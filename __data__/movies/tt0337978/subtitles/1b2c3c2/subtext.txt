42173 44008 Well?
44175 47136 I'm sending you the code.<br />Yes, I see that. Thank you.
53559 54879 What about my account?<br />Delivering.
77458 79919 I just sent it. You should have it.
80127 83464 - Yes. Thank you.<br />- Are you sure this is legal?
83631 87093 We're just running a test<br />on our security system, sir. It's fine.
87260 90680 You have a sexy voice.<br />Is there anything else I can do for you?
90846 92723 To you? We have all we need.
103609 104694 We're ready.
114036 117665 Yo, guess who just made<br />50 G's today.
124213 126340 What'd you do to my drive?<br />I didn't touch it.
126507 129427 This isn't cool.<br />Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
198120 201457 Diagnostics show no damage,<br />but this was an intentional breach.
201624 204460 We were hacked?<br />It wasn't "Denial of Service" level.
204627 207338 But they definitely<br />cracked our door.
207797 209715 Okay. Open the Black Hat files.
209882 213803 I want every hacker in the country<br />who could have done this interviewed now.
213969 217598 Sir, that's close to 1000 names. This<br />holiday weekend, we're short-staffed as it is.
217765 223062 Listen, we're supposed to keep this from<br />happening, and it happened to us. Get it done.
223229 225773 It's the middle of the night.<br />They're all over the country.
225940 227691 Fine. Get local law enforcement help.
227858 231737 Somebody out there thinks they can<br />screw with us. I wanna find out who.
238661 240955 You are so cool
241122 244125 You are so rock 'n' roll
244291 247545 Be my, be my

250840 254468 Be my, be my
254635 255678 Be my little
255970 257346 Rock 'n' roll queen
257513 261308 Jim. I said no.<br />Lucy, you're killing me, all right?
261517 262768 Get out. What?
262935 265062 Get out of the car now.<br />Don't touch me.
265229 267064 No means no. What are you doing?
267231 270609 John, stop it.<br />Don't call me that. I hate it.
270860 273362 You know this guy?<br />Just shut your mouth right now.
273529 276198 Dad. Stop it. I mean it.
276365 279368 - Dad? You said your dad was dead.<br />- What?
280077 283164 You told this jerk off I was dead?<br />You actually said that?
283330 286083 I may have exaggerated a little bit.
287293 289503 And this guy's what?<br />Your boyfriend?
289670 291797 - No.<br />- Yeah.
292464 295551 I don't know, okay?<br />I'm sorry. We'll see.
296802 298470 What are you doing here?
298637 302433 You don't answer your phone, return calls.<br />Because I'm not talking to you.
302600 307229 Why aren't you talking to me this time, Lucy?<br />Why not? What, you want a list?
307396 309690 How about stuff like, you spy on me.
309857 312067 You drag my boyfriend out of the car.<br />I'm not spying.
312234 314153 You said he's not your boyfriend.<br />He's not.
314320 317239 I thought you said I just was.<br />Shut up.
319283 321577 You are such an asshole.
322995 329251 Okay. I'm sorry I pulled your<br />not-boyfriend out of the car, okay?
331212 335090 Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.<br />No, no.
335257 337551 Will both of you go away?<br />Just talk to me.
337718 340346 I'm tired. I'm going to bed.<br />Alone.
340512 342765 Damn right you're going to bed alone.
344767 348103 Lucy, honey, wait a minute.<br />I wanna talk to you. Just wait.
348270 351065 Dad, when I wanna talk to you...
351523 353484 If I wanna talk to you...
355277 357112 ...I'll call you.
357279 360449 Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.
360616 364370 Lucy McClane.<br />It's not McClane. It's Gennaro.
366872 368999 Chicks, right?
372461 374630 I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
403075 405160 John?
405327 407705 John? It's Scalvino.
409456 413252 Go for McClane.<br />What are you doing at Rutgers?
413419 416797 How do you know where I am?<br />Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.
416964 421302 I'm staring at exactly where you are.<br />Sir, that's not something I would turn on.
421468 424596 Yeah, we did that.<br />John, we turned them on.
424763 427057 Listen, the feds have<br />called in a favor.
427224 431562 They're doing a sweep. They want us to<br />pick up some computer hacker in Camden.
431729 434773 Last name: Farrell.<br />First name: Matthew.
434940 437693 Whoa, whoa. Camden?<br />What are you telling me this for?
437860 441196 Just came in.<br />It's 3 in the morning. I was on my way home.
441363 444283 Send a jughead from the academy.<br />They'd be happy to do it.
444450 448912 I can't just send in a uniform.<br />The feds demanded a senior detective.
449079 451457 The kid's a high-value subject.<br />I don't know.
451623 455210 Just pick him up, escort him<br />to the Hoover Building in D.C.
455377 459173 They had some kind of a computer breach<br />there this morning.
459423 461216 Great.
463761 465804 You owe me one, Jack.
465971 468390 All right, give me that name again.<br />What is it?
474897 481195 With what's written on my heart
482321 484448 I will break
488702 489870 Break
503926 505803 Selfishness
505969 507721 I'm so sick
509348 511225 I'm so sick
512935 518732 If you want more of this

586717 590012 Hey, I'm not lost.<br />Are you Matthew Farrell?
590179 593807 No. He, uh, actually<br />does not live here any more.
593974 597102 Of course not. Who are you?<br />My name is Daisy Duke.
597269 602691 Got a lot of shit for it when I was<br />a kid. Please don't add to it. Heh.
602858 606695 Can I see some identification, please?<br />Yeah, sure.
610032 615037 Oh. "Detective." Yeah, that looks real.<br />You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.
615204 619750 Then of course...<br />Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.
619958 621043 Mm-hm.
621210 625214 Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of<br />the "Kill Zone Nine." Wanna check it out?
625380 629676 No. Thanks, though, man. And good<br />luck at the Bad Timing Awards.
630511 632971 Open the door.
633138 634389 Shit.
640896 643232 Can I get you something?<br />Coffee? A warrant?
643398 646652 What's this about?<br />I don't know. Some computer thing.
646818 649655 D.C. feds wanna talk to you,<br />so let's go.
650239 653158 Feds, huh? Yeah. The feds.
660958 665337 I've been White Hat for four years,<br />but once you're on that goddamn list.
665504 667214 Such a pain in the ass.
667381 669758 You play with dolls?
669925 672177 Uh, could you not touch that?<br />Like a G.I. Joe?
672344 676223 No, it's not. It's a limited edition, and...<br />Ooh.
676390 679935 That supposed to come off?<br />No, but it's more valuable broken.
680102 683981 So thanks for that.<br />Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.
684147 686316 I got some other cool shit<br />you can break.
686483 690279 Let's go, okay? Come on.<br />I gotta power down my gear, okay?
693031 696493 More dolls. Not spending<br />a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?
698787 700789 Hey! Are you really trying to escape?
702249 703875 Ah! Jesus, don't shoot. Hey!

1047886 1050055 Did you see that?<br />Yeah, I saw it. I did it.
1052599 1057354 Camden base, 10077. Come back.<br />Camden base, 10077.
1057520 1058855 Camden base. Go ahead.
1059022 1062817 I need to speak to the chief of your<br />detectives. Police emergency, ASAP.
1062984 1064402 Stand by.
1064569 1068907 This is Chief Detective Wiesman.<br />This is Detective John McClane, N.Y.P.D.
1069074 1073411 Police emergency. I wanna report<br />a police shooting in your jurisdiction.
1093848 1096017 - Yeah?<br />- What's the status?
1102023 1103316 Wait one.
1124379 1127882 Thomas. We had a problem<br />in New Jersey. Farrell's still alive.
1131010 1133388 So he got away. Yeah.
1133555 1135807 I did send five of you,<br />is that right?
1137726 1142564 I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll<br />track them down. Think you can handle that?
1147402 1149237 Oh, my God.
1150488 1151823 What the fuck?
1151990 1153032 Just breathe.
1153199 1156911 I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.
1157078 1159831 It's the adrenaline.<br />You're just scared. It'll pass.
1159998 1163877 Yeah, I'm scared.<br />Weren't you scared, back there?
1164043 1167172 Yeah. I was scared.
1167338 1171926 Really? This is you being scared?<br />I don't know, you seem really calm.
1172177 1174262 Have you done stuff like that before?
1174429 1178016 Stuff like what?<br />Like killing people.
1179809 1183271 Yeah. But not for a long time.
1184355 1187484 So who were those guys? Huh?<br />Why were they trying to kill you?
1187650 1189903 Why did they blow up<br />my goddamn apartment?
1191112 1192655 They were there to kill you.
1194282 1199287 Why would they want to kill me?<br />You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.
1214594 1218389 We got seven dead hackers so far,<br />none of whom were high on our list.
1218556 1221768 - Collect the hard drives, start sweeping them.<br />- Yes, sir.
1226731 1230068 Trey. Matthew Farrell.<br />Find him for me.
1230235 1231986 On it.
1234155 1236449 What's with all the guns?
1237033 1239202 Operational prudence.
1239869 1242163 Think of them as hardware<br />to your software.
1254592 1259347 Good morning, D.C. It's shaping up<br />to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.
1259514 1264269 If you've got any big plans, get started<br />early, because the traffic is ramping up.
1264435 1268106 So here's another golden oldie<br />for all the commuters out there.
1270233 1272861 What? What? What?
1273027 1275238 What are you doing? What is that?
1275405 1277323 It's Creedence. Creedence?
1277490 1281536 Creedence. Creedence Clearwater<br />Revival? Classic rock?
1281703 1284873 I know who it is. It's old rock.<br />Doesn't make it classic.
1285039 1287959 What sucked then, sucks now.<br />You don't like Creedence?
1288126 1291254 This is like having a pine cone<br />shoved in my ass.
1291880 1295091 Okay. Really? Wow. That's mature.
1295258 1297135 Come on. I'm cooperating with you.
1299846 1303057 We're at a heading of 060.<br />Making another pass.
1306477 1309230 Listen up, everyone.<br />Are we ready?
1310064 1312984 Transportation hubs are prepped<br />and set.
1313151 1315153 Begin stage one.
1332587 1334255 What? Nothing.
1343348 1345767 With six and a half innings, the game...
1345934 1347936 Pavillion this weekend for two shows only...
1348102 1353816 When'd you last turn on the radio and listen<br />to popular music? Just give me a decade.
1353983 1358029 The '70s? I'm guessing.<br />Was Michael Jackson still black?
1358196 1361032 Pearl Jam.<br />I'll go back 10 years with you. Ten years.
1361199 1363076 Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?
1363242 1368456 It's called news radio. Trying to see if your<br />friends from Camden made the headlines.
1368623 1370959 Hold on. You listen to the news?
1371125 1374045 You got a problem with the news now?<br />Heh, heh, heh.
1374295 1377256 Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem<br />with the news.
1377423 1381010 Ready for this?<br />The news is completely manipulated.
1381177 1384305 Everything you hear, every single day...
1384472 1387725 ...Is designed by corporate media to do<br />one thing only.
1387892 1389560 Jesus.<br />To keep you living in fear.
1389727 1391521 Oh, fear? Total fear.
1391688 1395733 So you'll go out and spend money<br />on things you probably don't even need.
1395900 1398569 So advertisers can<br />keep buying ads on their stations.
1398736 1402699 I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this<br />all day. I got days of data at home.
1402865 1404826 I'll drop a bomb on you...<br />Hey. Hey!
1404993 1406703 What? Shut up.
1406911 1408246 Shut the fuck up.
1408413 1411791 That's good.<br />Be dismissive instead of...
1463509 1466095 You all right?<br />No, I'm not all right.
1466846 1469348 Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.
1472101 1474187 Hey, man. Hey.
1475021 1477899 You all right? Don't move.<br />Just call 911, all right?
1478065 1479358 Okay.
1481402 1482862 Jesus Christ.
1504091 1506594 All the lights are green. Huh?
1506761 1509347 All the lights are green.<br />Let's go. Right now.
1509514 1512517 We gotta go?<br />Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.
1514602 1517438 Let's go.<br />This is crazy. I've never been in a car accident.
1517605 1519857 Well, it's very exciting.<br />This way, come on.
1520024 1521776 You been in a car accident?<br />Yeah.
1521943 1523069 What are we doing?
1523236 1527657 It's a little thing they invented in the '60s<br />called jogging. You're gonna love it.
1537208 1541212 Sir, Chicago's reporting<br />a systems crash on the I train network.
1545091 1548177 Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash<br />in their com system.
1548344 1552306 FAA just issued a critical alert.<br />Their ATC net just went down.
1555101 1557812 Okay, let's get them outside<br />for a little fresh air.
1569115 1571242 That's the anthrax alarm.
1573160 1576163 All right, everyone out. Now. Now.
1578833 1581836 Taylor, move. Go. Move.
1597143 1599645 All personnel must evacuate and proceed...
1599812 1601939 ...lo the transportation shuttles immediately.
1602106 1604025 This is not a drill.
1604191 1609697 All personnel must evacuate and proceed<br />to the transportation shuttles immediately.
1629383 1630927 We need you inside, sir.
1637183 1641354 Take your team. I want men<br />on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.
1644065 1645566 We gotta know what's there.
1645733 1649070 Run a trunk search on these data crashes,<br />see if we can ID the point of origin.
1652114 1654158 Begin stage two.
1660414 1661957 Hey, what's going on?
1669548 1672134 They're already starting to panic.
1675096 1677264 Of course they are.
1677431 1679892 They think that someone's<br />taking their money.
1681936 1683729 Prep the video package.
1696367 1701455 D.C. transportation system's crashing and<br />they just hit the financial sector. All of it.
1701622 1706293 Get me the secretary of trans and treasury<br />on the line and the chairman for the SEC.
1706460 1710840 Let's go, people. Somewhere<br />somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.
1711549 1714802 Deputy Director Bowman in here?<br />Not now. It'll have to wait.
1714969 1719014 Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.<br />I brought him here on orders from Bowman.
1719181 1722226 If you don't know what's going on,<br />find somebody that does.
1722393 1723477 I'm Bowman.
1729442 1731777 Video package is ready for upload.
1735698 1738033 John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell.
1738200 1741162 But we are neck-deep<br />in damage control right now.
1741328 1745332 Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have<br />anything to eat, any snacks around?
1745499 1748002 I'd love...<br />I've got really low blood sugar.
1748169 1750337 Sir? No?
1754049 1758971 As if the transportation breakdown<br />and anthrax scares weren't enough for one day...
1759138 1761849 ...the stock market<br />found itself in a selling frenzy.
1762016 1765436 The Federal Trade Commission believes<br />this panic might have been triggered...
1765603 1768564 ...by a computer malfunction<br />in the stock exchange.
1768731 1771484 Oh, man, that is all bad.
1771984 1775988 It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills<br />to prepare for things like this.
1776906 1778783 - These your suspects?<br />- Were.
1778949 1781535 All seven were killed<br />in the last 24 hours.
1783454 1785956 Recognize any of these people?
1787458 1788751 No.
1788918 1790628 Not one?
1790795 1793631 Sir, we got a system error.
1799678 1802014 <i>My fellow Americans.<br />It is time to...</i>
1802181 1805309 ...Strike fear into<br />the hearts of citizenry.
1806310 1808771 Ask not...<br />That's an unauthorized broadcast.
1808938 1811857 ...what your country can do<br />to avert this crisis.
1812024 1814735 The answer is...<br />...nothing whatsoever.
1814902 1818364 Our military strength<br />is in this case...
1818531 1819740 ...useless.
1820491 1823410 Read my lips.
1823869 1828791 The great confident roar<br />of American progress and growth...
1828958 1831585 ...has come to an end.
1831752 1835756 All the vital technology<br />that this nation holds dear.
1835923 1840010 All communications. Transportation.<br />The internet. Connectivity.
1840177 1843138 Electrical power.<br />Critical utilities.
1843848 1848060 Their fate now rests<br />in our hands.
1848227 1851689 We will not tire, we will not falter...
1851856 1853566 ...and we will not fail.
1853732 1856402 I don't know how they're getting in.
1856569 1857903 Thank you. And a...
1858070 1860239 ...happy Independence Day<br />to everyone.
1864034 1865786 That was creepy.
1865953 1867788 I tried to find more Nixon.
1868539 1870499 Think they bought it?
1870666 1872626 Absolutely.
1873919 1877089 Okay, I want telecom, transportation...
1877256 1879967 Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.<br />What?
1880801 1882636 It's a fire sale.
1882887 1883888 Hey.
1884138 1886557 We don't know that yet.<br />It's a myth, anyway. Can't be done.
1886724 1891103 It's a myth? Really? Please tell me<br />she's actually not in charge of anything.
1891270 1893105 What's a fire sale?
1893272 1897651 It's a three-step systematic attack<br />on the entire national infrastructure.
1897818 1902114 Step one: take out transportation.<br />Step two: the financial base and telecoms.
1902281 1906118 Step three: get rid of all the utilities.<br />Gas, water, electric, nuclear.
1906285 1910664 Anything that's run by computers,<br />which today is almost everything.
1910831 1913834 That's why they call it a fire sale,<br />because everything must go.
1914001 1916420 Listen. What's your name? Farrell?
1916587 1920674 Keep your voice down, okay?<br />No one here's talking about a fire sale.
1920841 1924762 Not unless you're telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1924929 1927222 What? No, man. I'm just saying...
1927389 1929975 Appreciate your concern.<br />We're on it. Thank you.
1930142 1932978 You've done a bang-up job so far.<br />What? What?
1933145 1935356 Nothing. I said I understand.
1935898 1942404 Hey, they didn't send the girl scouts to get this<br />kid. They sent professionals, full tactical gear.
1942571 1948202 They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,<br />and frankly I don't give a shit. No offense.
1948369 1950537 But somebody wants this kid dead...
1950704 1954833 ...and obviously it's got something to do<br />with whatever's going on here.
1955000 1958379 Okay. Homeland's interrogating<br />the hackers we're bringing in.
1958545 1961382 I'll get you an escort over there. All right?
1961548 1966845 Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.<br />I wanna know what he knows.
1967012 1969974 If he knew half the shit I know,<br />his head would explode.
1970724 1973060 Special Agent Johnson.<br />We'll take the sedan.
1973227 1976730 Agent Johnson?<br />That's right. Right this way.
1976897 1981402 Great. So is any of that actually possible,<br />what you were saying back there?
1981568 1985990 Is it possible? Look, you take out<br />any one thing, the system can recover.
1986156 1991495 If you take it all down at once, the system<br />crashes and... Look around, man.
1991662 1996250 Come on. Government's gotta have dozens<br />of departments dedicated to that shit.
1996417 2000587 It took FEMA five days<br />to get water to the Superdome.
2023694 2026280 How long till we get to DHS?
2026447 2031160 Laughlin, get on the D.C. police band<br />and get them to clear a route to DHS for us.
2031326 2034288 D.C. Metro, this is the FBI<br />requesting you to clear a route...
2038167 2040294 Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.
2041211 2043422 Feds are taking him to Homeland.<br />Good.
2043589 2046300 Close that loop, now.<br />Isolate the frequency.
2046467 2050846 Get us a location on the vehicles<br />and pull me up a file on this John McClane.
2051013 2054141 Rand, we just found Farrell.<br />Stand by for a location.
2058312 2062274 I don't mean to harp, but we just passed<br />another Arby's, and I'm starving.
2062441 2064526 I could eat a wrapper. Shut up.
2064693 2067821 I could just get some ketchup packets.<br />Shut up.
2067988 2070657 You got about 14 minutes<br />to tell me why you lied to me.
2070824 2073160 Lied to you? What are you talking about?
2073327 2075579 The pictures on the wall.<br />You knew those guys.
2075746 2078332 I don't... Kid, don't lie to me.
2078499 2081627 I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.<br />Who were they?
2084505 2087132 Okay, okay. Okay.
2089510 2092513 They were my competition.
2094973 2097434 Make the next right onto Concord.
2097601 2100854 They said they'd developed<br />a mutating encryption algorithm...
2101021 2103357 ...and they wanted to see<br />if it could be cracked.
2103524 2106860 That's what I do.<br />I do math-based security.
2111281 2115869 Here's the thing. To pull off something<br />as massive and crazy as a fire sale...
2116036 2120040 ...you need tons of guys to write programs,<br />but only a few Black Hats to implement it.
2120207 2124753 At that point, the start-up guys who haven't<br />really done anything wrong, like me...
2124920 2127339 Would end up as pictures<br />on some guy's wall.
2127506 2132886 I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you<br />I had no idea I was gonna be...
2133387 2135889 ...an accessory to Armageddon.
2136557 2138475 Take the next left at Lexington.
2138642 2142729 And that's a sexy voice.<br />What's she taking us this way for?
2142896 2144481 Unit 510. Oh, my God.
2144648 2147693 Clear a route for two FBI vehicles<br />approaching on Concord.
2147860 2149069 Copy, dispatch.
2149236 2150571 That's her.
2150737 2152781 Her who?<br />What are you talking about?
2154908 2157202 - It's them.<br />- You're saying it's "them" them?
2157369 2161165 I swear to you I know her.<br />I would know her voice anywhere.
2162332 2165419 Don't say anything.<br />Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.
2166920 2169423 Hey, Metro, how's your day<br />going over there?
2169590 2173927 Gotta be pretty crazy over there,<br />what with all those 587s.
2174094 2176096 Yes, sir.<br />We've had to dispatch all units.
2178265 2182269 You had to dispatch all units<br />for all the naked people walking around?
2182436 2185814 Cut the bullshit, honey,<br />and just put your boss on.
2188233 2191361 Laughlin, we're getting off this route.<br />Turn left on 14th Street.
2200287 2204249 Officer McClane.<br />It's Detective McClane, asshole.
2204416 2209546 Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get<br />to know each other when I visit you in prison.
2209713 2212966 But, John, I already know<br />so much about you.
2213133 2215219 Your address in Brooklyn.
2215385 2219932 The payments on your mortgage, how long<br />you've been a member of the N.Y.P.D.
2220098 2221767 And how's Holly?
2221934 2226104 That's sad. You're divorced.<br />Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?
2228148 2234196 Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought<br />you'd have a better pension plan annuity.
2234363 2236323 Oh. And it gets worse.
2238784 2241745 Your 401k no longer exists.
2241912 2246291 Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.<br />Box them in at that intersection.
2246458 2249503 Shoot Mr. Farrell in the head<br />and drive away...
2249670 2252256 ...and by the time you reach<br />the end of the next block...
2252422 2257928 ...all your debts will be wiped clean<br />and your children will be set for life.
2258095 2261598 Now, that really is tempting,<br />especially that last part.
2261765 2264226 But I think I'm gonna have to pass,<br />jerk off.
2265978 2268271 John, you're gonna lose.
2269022 2272776 Yeah, well, the other thing that could<br />happen is I could come and find you...
2272943 2276488 ...kick your ass and throw you out of<br />your own party. How's that sound, fuckhead?
2277698 2278865 Hold your position.
2285038 2286999 Get your head down! Kid, get down!
2293005 2294673 Just stay down.
2298593 2302222 Officers down at the corner of<br />Main and Constitution. Officers down.
2320323 2322576 Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.
2325912 2328999 Goddamn it. Just stay down.<br />What was that?
2334588 2336840 Get down! Just hang on.
2347059 2350937 Base, we've got a squad car<br />under fire. We need backup.
2351104 2353607 This is base.<br />We're sending backup.
2358236 2360155 Just brace yourself.
2375754 2377506 Hang on. Hang on.
2393647 2395190 Hang on.
2398652 2399736 Oh!
2404991 2406493 Yeah!
2411623 2413416 We lost Del. Stay with them.
2424219 2425887 They're back. I know.
2429141 2430684 Take the tunnel. Left!
2437023 2438692 God, what are you...? Oh, God.
2447617 2449703 Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.
2449870 2451329 The tunnel!
2460881 2462883 Open the gates on the north side entrance.
2470515 2472434 Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.
2489576 2492287 Now open the other side. What?
2492454 2493705 Move.
2498001 2499294 Hang onto something.
2536331 2539626 Hey! Don't get out of the car.<br />Hey! Don't...
2546299 2547300 Run, goddamn it, run!
2548134 2549803 Down! Get down!
2552639 2554099 Ah!
2558812 2560981 Run. Run!
2568154 2569155 Fuck. Oh, God.
2574828 2576496 Don't hesitate like that again.
2576663 2578415 Can you help me get my wife...
2578581 2581001 You all right? Unh! Yeah, yeah.
2581167 2583878 - You okay?<br />- I can't move my arms.
2585297 2588383 Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.<br />What?
2588550 2591177 "It can't be a uniform, John. No."
2592012 2595098 Get over to the wall, sir.<br />"Feds called in a favor."
2595265 2601062 "All you gotta do is go pick up a kid<br />down in Jersey, drive him down to D.C."
2601229 2604649 "How hard can that be, huh?<br />It can't be that hard, can it?"
2606026 2608445 "No, gotta be a senior detective."
2613867 2618079 Think a traffic jam, throwing a car<br />at me is gonna stop me? Huh?
2618246 2620332 Rand, get in there and get it done.
2633553 2636723 Okay, the car's on fire.
2637182 2639100 That can't be good.
2639684 2642145 Oh, this is a bad fucking idea.
2680433 2683186 Don't touch me, don't touch me.<br />Okay, sorry, sorry.
2683353 2685605 Are you okay? Oh, my God.
2688358 2692070 Pretty lucky shot, huh?<br />Yeah, lucky. That was...
2692237 2694364 You just killed a helicopter with a car.
2694572 2699285 Hundreds of thousands of people get killed<br />by cars every year. It's just like four more.
2702288 2706292 How you doing?<br />I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...
2708336 2713133 Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.<br />I'm an idiot. I'm too old to jump out of cars.
2722892 2725019 Rand, check in.
2727605 2729941 What about Farrell and McClane?
2732735 2733820 Come back in.
2733987 2736072 We're moving on. Begin stage three.
2736239 2739617 I just spoke to Emerson.<br />The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
2739784 2743997 Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.
2751004 2752964 ID, sir.
2753548 2755842 Park behind the transpo.<br />We'll lead you in.
2756009 2758344 Man the gate. You're with me.
2765059 2768021 Anthrax alarms<br />only went off on five floors.
2768188 2771024 Below that you'll need<br />DOD clearance.
2771191 2775320 I don't know why you'd need to go further.<br />There's nothing down there but servers.
2778281 2780074 Unh!
2781117 2784871 Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.
2800303 2801971 Gate secured. Copy.
2811731 2812732 Okay, we are in.
2847642 2848851 This is insane.
2849018 2851938 Hey. Hey. This is absurd.
2852105 2857318 Man, there's tough and there's stupid.<br />You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.
2857944 2859946 I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.
2860113 2862031 Yeah. Sexy, right? No.
2862198 2863366 Come on.
2863616 2866077 We don't need a doctor.<br />We need the cops.
2894522 2896149 He's in.
2896983 2899736 Get out of the way.<br />Make a hole, please. Come on.
2899902 2904365 Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />Come on.
2904532 2907493 N.Y.P.D. All right? I got this kid.<br />Come on. Let's go, kid.
2913124 2914834 It's okay. Yeah. Thanks.
2915001 2916794 <i>NY PD.</i>
2917503 2919505 Coming through.
2919672 2920798 Sergeant?
2920965 2923885 Sergeant. I need to speak to you.
2924052 2928890 The medic's in the back.<br />I'm all right. N.Y.P.D. I need to talk to you.
2929057 2931351 Just give me a minute.
2931517 2933728 Sergeant.
2937315 2939233 Oh, my God.
2945239 2947325 Let's get out of here.
2954165 2955792 Open. Open, open.
2961464 2962924 We're a go.
2963091 2964133 Launch the downloads.
2975144 2977897 Nothing's happening. Be patient.
2982151 2983361 Wait for it.
2988533 2990868 See? There you go.
2992412 2994705 Let me know when the download<br />reaches 20 percent.
2994872 2996374 Okay.
2997959 3000002 I need you to please<br />remain calm.
3002755 3003923 Excuse me.
3004715 3005716 Unh!
3005883 3010012 Excuse me. Thank you. Holy shit.
3010179 3012348 Kid? Kid, hey. Yeah, yeah.
3012515 3014976 You got a phone in that bag?<br />Yeah.
3015143 3017103 Come on. Let's go.
3020356 3024777 And here you go, Agent Tovarek.<br />Guess that's you.
3046591 3049635 Download's at 20 percent.<br />Time to move.
3049802 3052847 Let's keep them chasing<br />their tails.
3067778 3069655 Due to recent activity...
3069822 3072658 ...law enforcement agencies<br />are being cautious.
3072825 3077205 They are telling drivers to abandon<br />their vehicles until they are searched.
3077371 3081334 And, as you can see,<br />canine units are checking each vehicle.
3081542 3084921 <i>Whether this is connected to<br />the anthrax reports we heard earlier...</i>
3085087 3087381 ...or a new terrorist threat, we do not know.
3087548 3089884 FAA just grounded all flights.<br />Good.
3090051 3095515 We have complete access over networks.<br />Phones, power grids, water, nuclear.
3095681 3097767 Excuse me. Jack Parry, NSA.
3097934 3101646 Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.<br />White House made the call.
3101812 3105650 Anything you need, we're here to help.<br />Help? Wow, that's great.
3105816 3110488 We're gonna need some work space<br />for our people. What can you do for us?
3110655 3115826 As you can see, we're using the space, so<br />you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.
3115993 3119121 If I need something,<br />I'll just wave to you.
3141727 3144564 Wait. No, don't call.<br />What are you talking about?
3144730 3148359 They probably cracked that hours ago.<br />They could trace us. Put it in your pocket.
3148568 3150278 You sure? Yes.
3150444 3153030 Or smash it.<br />You didn't have to smash it.
3153781 3156409 Excuse me. It's a police emergency.<br />Hey. Hey!
3156576 3158077 He'll call you right back.
3159745 3161247 Here, right in here. Come here.
3162582 3164333 You got a signal? Yeah.
3165918 3169088 Yeah.<br />This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.
3169255 3171549 Sir, John McClane is on the line.
3172800 3175011 McClane, go.<br />We never made it to DHS.
3175177 3177888 They came after the kid again.<br />All your men are down.
3180599 3183436 What about Farrell?<br />I got him with me right now.
3183602 3185563 Sir? Hang on, John.
3185730 3187398 Yeah, I'll hold on.
3192361 3194780 Another day in paradise.
3194947 3200036 They just swarmed at everything.<br />The telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.
3209670 3212381 O beautiful for...
3212548 3214633 They're blanketing every station.
3215176 3220389 For amber waves of grain
3222516 3226479 For purple mountain majesties
3228147 3231984 Above the fruited plain
3233361 3239116 America, America
3239283 3241327 God shed his grace on thee
3241494 3245539 Can you put the news back on?<br />This is the news. It's on every channel.
3245706 3248501 Been this way for a few minutes now.
3265184 3267019 Oh, my God.
3275027 3276654 McClane.
3277696 3278739 Look out!
3278948 3280491 Look out!
3281700 3283202 Look out.
3284870 3286997 Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?
3287164 3289333 Bowman, it's a fake.
3293587 3295172 I see it.
3296173 3298092 Thank God.
3299552 3301387 Oh, shit.
3301554 3303389 McClane? Bowman.
3309061 3311313 Satellite's down. Get me a land line.
3313149 3314525 Shit.
3326745 3332126 I wrote one little piece of code and the<br />world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.
3332293 3334336 What? You know, it's crazy.
3334503 3337131 The first time I heard of the concept<br />of a fire sale...
3337298 3340509 ...I actually thought it would be cool<br />if anyone ever really did it.
3341385 3347057 Just hit the reset button<br />and melt the system just for fun.
3347224 3350603 Hey. It's not a system. It's a country.
3350769 3353939 You're talking about people,<br />a whole country full of people.
3354106 3357610 Sitting at home alone, scared to death<br />in their houses, all right?
3357776 3363115 So finish your nostalgic moment and think<br />a little bit and help me catch these guys.
3364116 3367995 Just help me.<br />Just put yourself in their shoes.
3369163 3372917 Come on. If this were your fire sale,<br />what would be your next move?
3373083 3378797 Okay, uh... Well, the whole point of a fire sale<br />is that it's mostly done by remote, right?
3378964 3383886 But not everything is run completely online.<br />Major utilities aren't.
3384053 3387806 They're run by closed circuits,<br />so you could breach the security to a point...
3387973 3391936 ...but to shut it down you'd have to<br />physically go there. You'd have to show up.
3392102 3393145 And, uh...
3394980 3397483 Give me that guy's PDA.<br />Phones are all dead.
3397650 3403155 No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta<br />reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.
3403322 3407826 Hackers surf them all the time. Probably what<br />these guys are using to talk to each other.
3407993 3409662 How do you know all this stuff?
3409828 3414083 Dude, I don't know. There's a lot<br />rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.
3414250 3416877 Okay. National power grid.
3417044 3420548 Gas and electric is divided into three zones.<br />Eastern, Central, Western.
3420714 3423175 Each with a primary hub.
3423342 3425344 Here it is.
3426554 3429306 What are we looking at?<br />That is the Eastern hub.
3429473 3434895 Now, they take this out, wipes out all<br />the power for the entire Eastern corridor.
3435062 3437439 But, again, you'd have to do it manually.
3437606 3442528 Okay. Come on. Let's go.<br />What? To West Virginia?
3442695 3446824 I honestly don't think I can handle<br />any more people trying to kill me. McClane.
3446991 3448117 McClane. Aw, shit.
3448576 3453122 Sir, wireless networks are down<br />and I think they're hitting the land lines too.
3453289 3456333 I don't care how,<br />you find me a line.
3456500 3459545 Come on, what you got?<br />We swept the building. Seems clean.
3459712 3464300 We can sweep it again.<br />Don't bother. Don't bother.
3464466 3467720 It's a fake. This guy's playing us.
3467886 3470389 Okay, get everyone back inside<br />the crisis center now.
3470556 3472224 Okay, let's open it up.
3475102 3477688 Come on, get in. Door's locked.
3478647 3481400 Unless you have an extra gun<br />I can use to unlock it.
3483819 3486864 Don't do that.<br />You're gonna disable it.
3488324 3489658 Fuck!
3491160 3493078 That was crazy. Did you see that?
3493245 3496248 Sorry about that, man.<br />I didn't know it'd come out so fast.
3496415 3497875 Fucking idiot.
3498667 3502046 Man, this is a pain in the ass.<br />How'd you do yours?
3505341 3508302 You all right? What?<br />Did it hit you a little bit?
3508469 3510387 Sorry.
3513349 3517645 No, please don't touch those, okay?<br />I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.
3517811 3519772 I mean, I've read about it.
3521398 3523609 Road Assist.<br />We've detected an airbag deployment.
3523776 3528280 Yes. Please, we just hit a tree<br />and my dad is having a heart attack.
3528447 3530824 I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.
3530991 3533702 Hold while we contact emergency services.
3533869 3538874 No, no. He's dying. I can get him<br />to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.
3539041 3543962 But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta<br />start the car for us, okay? Please, Dad...
3544129 3546757 Your name, please? I'm...
3547466 3550636 My name is... Is... Frank.
3550803 3554431 And my dad's name is, um...
3556850 3560104 ...Dvorak Tsajanski.
3561397 3564650 Please, just help us.<br />We need your help. Please.
3565401 3567528 Emergency services are on their way.
3567695 3570364 No, no, listen to me.<br />Ma'am, what is your name?
3570531 3572157 Dolores. Dolores?
3572324 3575536 Olay, Dolores, I don't know<br />if you have a dad, but I do.
3575703 3577955 And I wanna be able to say that<br />a year from now.
3578122 3582042 Because my dad is my hero,<br />and right now he is in my arms dying...
3582209 3586338 ...and his only hope is to get to a hospital<br />right now. We can't wait.
3586505 3588841 So please start the goddamn car!
3593303 3595055 Thank you, Dolores.
3595222 3597599 Pass the PDA.<br />I gotta call the Warlock.
3597766 3601270 The what?<br />The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.
3619079 3622833 Ma'am, you're not authorized to be here.<br />FBI. We suspect a security breach.
3623000 3624376 You can't land here without...
3645272 3647524 That was pretty good back there, kid.
3648150 3649610 Thanks.
3650194 3653405 What's the matter with you?<br />Nothing else to complain about?
3653572 3655991 No. I'm just...
3656158 3660746 Well, what? What's the matter?<br />I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.
3660913 3662748 What's that mean? Like what?
3663582 3668253 I'm not, like, heroic and everything.<br />I'm not brave like you are.
3668420 3670339 I'm nobody's hero, kid.
3670506 3673008 You've saved my life, like,<br />ten times in six hours.
3673175 3675761 Just doing my job, that's all.<br />Uh...
3675928 3677262 Fuck being a hero.
3677846 3682684 Know what you get for being a hero?<br />Nothing. You get shot at.
3682851 3686855 You get a little pat on the back,<br />blah-blah-blah. "Attaboy."
3689525 3690734 You get divorced.
3691944 3694947 A wife that can't remember<br />your last name.
3695113 3697449 Your kids don't wanna talk to you.
3698784 3701453 You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.
3702037 3704373 Trust me, kid,<br />nobody wants to be that guy.
3706166 3710087 Then why are you doing this?<br />Because there's nobody else to do it now.
3710254 3713257 If there was somebody else to do it,<br />I would let them do it.
3713423 3716093 But there's not. So we're doing it.
3716885 3718095 Ah.
3718262 3720430 And that's what makes you that guy.
3729439 3731358 Thing is flying now.
3731525 3734319 Contact Emerson.<br />Tell him we'll be there soon.
3741118 3743537 What the hell are you doing?<br />This whole floor's restricted...
3770522 3771607 Stay here.
3801887 3803347 All right, come on.
3822532 3824743 We're in. Good. Shut it down.
3835921 3838131 Guess you were right, kid.
3838298 3840717 Okay, that's awful.
3843261 3845013 We got company.
3853897 3856274 How would they shut down a power grid?<br />What?
3856441 3860404 Come on.<br />Uh... Central control room. Okay.
3862072 3865200 Fourth floor. Fourth floor.<br />Come on.
3867619 3869454 Take the right.
3876336 3877963 Shit.
3879131 3881174 Can we stop for...<br />Try to keep up.
3881341 3884136 I am. I just wanna stop<br />for two seconds to catch our breath.
3884302 3887431 You know, they have these things<br />called gymnasiums.
3909077 3911663 Come on, let's go. Let's go.
3923925 3926636 Intel's fairly certain<br />the terrorists are mobile.
3926803 3929598 It's the only way<br />to avoid signal triangulation.
3929764 3932100 With the amount of hardware<br />they're running...
3932267 3936855 ...we're probably looking for a large vehicle,<br />most likely a semitrailer rig.
3937022 3939649 All right.<br />Tell the guys at Homeland Security...
3939816 3943612 ...we need every agent, satellite<br />and functioning network they got. Now.
3963048 3964716 Play time's over, sweetheart.
3964883 3965967 Don't.
3966134 3968512 Take your hand off the gun.<br />Hands up.
3969387 3970514 Stand up.
3977270 3978563 Go on. Now.
3980065 3982734 Let's go, kid. You're up.
3982901 3984569 Okay.
3986196 3987364 As fast as you can.
3987531 3988657 Hey! Hey!
3990742 3992327 Jesus. Whoa!
4008718 4010762 That's enough of this kung fu shit.
4010929 4015267 I've known some bitches in my day,<br />but you are maybe...
4016935 4017936 Uh...
4019854 4022399 Uh... Still awake, huh?
4022566 4024734 Just keep doing what you're doing.<br />Okay.
4024901 4027320 How much time do you need?<br />Not much.
4036162 4037247 Hoo.
4040792 4043336 Are you done? I...
4043503 4045297 Are you done? No, not quite.
4045463 4048383 What?<br />I'm not exactly checking my e-mail here.
4049801 4053221 They used VM mode, so I'm isolating<br />their APl and booting the host.
4053388 4056641 What?<br />It means about 30 seconds, okay?
4056808 4059144 - Not the easiest thing to do when...<br />- What the...?
4059811 4061021 Fuck, bitch! Hyah! Hyah!
4064399 4065650 Fuck.
4071948 4073658 Okay.
4074492 4076703 Undo everything you just did. Now!
4076870 4079039 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4079789 4084002 I'm a righty, I'm a righty.<br />I need my other hand, I really do.
4084919 4086338 I'm a righty.
4119788 4121831 One last door to open.
4122791 4126711 Do you know what you're doing? Do you<br />realize what this'll do to the country?
4126878 4130882 Yes, I do. Now open the door.
4131049 4134469 Okay, good. Glad we're on the same page.
4141017 4143812 You do? I'm glad you know.
4156574 4158243 Ooh!
4159744 4161746 How you doing?
4161955 4163123 Aah!
4170755 4172340 Hang on.
4180181 4181224 Aah!
4226644 4228188 Aah!
4245663 4248666 Listen, let's just talk<br />about this for one second.
4253338 4256341 How you doing?<br />That's not too tight, is it?
4259344 4260720 Damn it.
4263348 4264516 Smile pretty.
4281157 4282283 Fuck.
4283201 4284494 Motherfucker!
4299133 4300218 McClane.
4302554 4304264 Shit.
4304973 4307225 McClane, get out of there!
4308726 4310937 Come on, man! Come on!
4314399 4315483 Come on, man!
4330206 4332500 Fuck you, bitch.
4337255 4338840 Did you see that?
4340466 4342093 Argh!
4342844 4344804 So you stopped it, right?
4344971 4348266 You know, a gun to your head<br />makes it harder to do this kind of work.
4348433 4351311 What?<br />I know that comes as a surprise.
4354731 4358109 Can't you just turn it off? Lock them out?<br />I'm not sure.
4360445 4363239 I might be able to slow them down,<br />though.
4365074 4368828 Western and Central hubs are ours.<br />We're just waiting on Mai's end.
4369495 4373082 Hang on. Something's up.<br />All the security's reactivating.
4374292 4379297 I think someone might be in the market<br />for some cheap Viagra.
4379464 4384177 Now your girlfriend's dead,<br />why don't you check out our sexy singles.
4384969 4386721 It's an e-bomb.
4393811 4395146 Hey, hey.
4399067 4400485 All right, wait, wait.
4404322 4406908 Mai, talk to me. What's going on?<br />Mai.
4407825 4411829 Oh, yeah, little Asian chick,<br />likes to kick people?
4411996 4414999 I don't think she's gonna be talking<br />to anybody for a really long time.
4416000 4421297 Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom<br />of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.
4422256 4425259 What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?
4425426 4428846 Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.
4430807 4435186 Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna<br />come and I'm gonna kick your ass.
4435353 4441401 You have no idea who I am<br />or what I'm capable of.
4441567 4444153 When I'm finished here,<br />and I promise it'll be soon...
4444320 4447990 ...I will focus all my attention on you.
4449367 4452161 You wanna make things personal, fine.
4472223 4476561 Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas<br />in the pipelines to that station.
4478271 4482859 Can you get Bowman on this thing?<br />Sure. I can get anyone on it.
4483025 4484110 Do it.
4484277 4486028 Now? Yeah, now.
4489741 4491743 Please, no.
4492702 4494537 It's Thomas Gabriel. Shit.
4496330 4499584 You know this guy?<br />I worked with him.
4499751 4503212 He was DOD's chief programmer<br />for infrastructure security.
4503379 4507258 After 9/11, he's the guy that told<br />Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.
4507425 4511554 He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't<br />listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.
4511721 4513222 You think so?
4513389 4516559 When he tried to go public,<br />they crucified him.
4516726 4520813 Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.<br />After that he disappeared.
4520980 4523274 We got a pretty serious problem.
4523441 4525610 Hold on one minute. What?
4525777 4528362 I think we need<br />to get out of here right now.
4529864 4532825 They're sending the gas lines here.<br />Gas lines? What gas lines?
4533451 4534494 Christ.
4537079 4540291 All of them. See that,<br />those flashing arrows? That's not good.
4540458 4543920 All that's coming here?<br />Yeah. I think we gotta go.
4544086 4547423 Listen, I gotta go.<br />Just find Thomas Gabriel.
4547590 4549926 McClane? McClane?
4550092 4551385 Let's go. Finish this up.
4557975 4561270 Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.<br />Okay. Okay.
4562855 4564106 Fuck.
4582667 4584085 Get in there. Get in there.
4630047 4631048 Okay.
4636679 4640808 Let's go. We gotta get out of here.<br />What is the point? Man, what is the point?
4640975 4643144 Hey, knock that off, come on.
4643311 4648858 This has something to do with that code you<br />wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.
4649025 4652653 Win? When do we start winning?<br />Huh?
4652820 4657074 Look around. Are you out of your mind?<br />Does it look like we're close to winning?
4657241 4659660 We just got the shit kicked out of us.
4659827 4661871 You think I'm holding out on you?
4662038 4665916 If I knew what they wanted, I would<br />tell you. I would happily tell you.
4666584 4668419 Jesus.
4704664 4707625 The Warlock. The Warlock.
4707792 4710795 Oh. Great. Unh!<br />There goes the cellphone.
4710961 4714465 They knocked the satellites out of the skies?<br />No, your battery ran out.
4714632 4716384 We should go see him. Who?
4716550 4719220 The Warlock. We should drive<br />to his house in Baltimore.
4719387 4723140 Can't go to the Warlock's house now.<br />Hey, hey, hey. This is me helping you.
4723307 4727269 Okay? Trust me. We gotta go see<br />the Warlock. That's our only hope.
4732983 4736862 How do you feel about flying?<br />Uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?
4744537 4747248 Just stick it in the round thing.<br />What brown thing?
4747415 4749417 Here, put these on.
4750334 4752795 Just stick it in there. That'll work.
4752962 4756882 You okay?<br />Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.
4757049 4759427 I used to be terrified of flying.<br />Really?
4759593 4762972 Yeah. I took some lessons.<br />Face your fears, that kind of thing.
4763139 4765933 Yeah? Did it help? Not really.
4766809 4768436 Is it...?
4771021 4773774 Is it supposed to make that sound?<br />Yeah.
4775526 4780030 Maybe we should just drive.<br />Take it easy. Taking off is the hardest part.
4780197 4781615 Really? I heard...
4781782 4786203 To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.<br />Ha-ha-ha. You did? Really?
4786370 4789874 But you have your license, right?<br />I mean, you can fly one of these things?
4790875 4794378 Oh, God.<br />Hey! Here we go. We're up.
4794545 4796380 Oh, God.
4799049 4802595 Okay. That's good. That's pretty good.
4804847 4807850 Jesus, look at that.<br />This whole area's blacked out.
4810102 4812313 How we gonna find Warlock's house?
4812480 4815649 Um... It's probably gonna be<br />the one with the lights still on.
4823574 4827369 Power outage keeps spreading. About half<br />the East Coast has already gone down.
4828996 4832416 All right. Put everything<br />on emergency generators.
4832583 4834919 How the hell are they<br />getting past us?
4838756 4840841 Okay. Down there, down there. I see it.
4841008 4842635 Down there? Left, left. Down.
4846597 4849016 What? Are we gonna land down there?
4850893 4852728 All right, hang on. Okay. Okay.
4856273 4857733 Fence. Fence. Fence.
4860277 4861946 Fence. Fence. I see it.
4862613 4864073 Watch...
4865282 4867451 Oh! Oh!
4870162 4871831 Whoo! Oh!
4872957 4874041 Uh...
4876043 4877920 Oh, Jesus. Come on.
4878087 4880965 Oh, yeah.<br />"Taking off is the hardest part.”
4881382 4882550 Let's go.
4885761 4888722 Now, there's something<br />you need to know about Warlock.
4888889 4890599 He hates cops. Hates them.
4890766 4892810 So just let me do all the talking.
4902403 4903445 Shit.
4904864 4907074 Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.
4907241 4908784 Um, is Freddy home?
4910828 4913831 I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...
4913998 4915708 ...Billy.
4916292 4920629 We're friends from Space Camp.<br />I went to Space Camp with Freddy.
4922172 4923257 Freddy!
4924341 4927928 You got company. Freddy?
4928137 4929805 Freddy, get the fuck up here!
4936520 4939607 Frederick. Didn't you hear me?
4939773 4941692 All Baltimore heard you, Ma.
4941859 4944695 - Your friends are here.<br />- Friends? What the...?
4945696 4949700 Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta<br />tell you, don't bring people down here?
4949867 4954705 I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded<br />Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.
4954872 4958042 No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?<br />Know what? Doesn't matter.
4958250 4962880 What are you doing here? Because of you,<br />I'm rocking five generators to stay online.
4963047 4969303 And since you're being hunted by assassins,<br />this visit is not a healthy use of my time.
4969470 4971513 Hey, don't touch that, all right?
4972473 4976226 CB radio?<br />A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?
4976393 4979938 That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world<br />insurance system, okay?
4980105 4983525 When the last microchip goes down,<br />I can stay in touch with whoever's out there...
4983692 4985819 ...whether they be zombies or not.
4985986 4990199 What'd you bring your dad here for?<br />He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.
4990366 4991492 Nice poster.
4993077 4998749 What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?<br />No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.
4999500 5002294 Star Wars guy. Who is this man?<br />He's kidding. He's my...
5002461 5004797 Hey, Jenny Craig. I'm not his dad.
5004963 5008926 I'm a cop. How about that?<br />Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.
5009093 5011762 Why'd you bring a cop<br />into my command center?
5011929 5014598 Ha-ha-ha.<br />Command center. It's a basement.
5014765 5017101 It's a command center.<br />Don't help. I can explain.
5017267 5021021 Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel,<br />all right? That's why we came here.
5021188 5023190 Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.
5023357 5025609 Get out!<br />I want you out of here, right now.
5025776 5028946 Hey, hey! Calm down.<br />Just calm down, big boy.
5029113 5030864 You calm down. It's my house.
5031615 5035619 You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,<br />or I'll beat you to death in your own house.
5050759 5055055 Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas<br />Gabriel to be a cyberspook for them, okay?
5055222 5057266 First day on the job, tells his bosses...
5057433 5060978 ...this nation's security infrastructure<br />is wide open to compromise.
5061145 5066233 They say, "We'll take it under advisement."<br />But this dude don't ease up. He is committed.
5066400 5069236 So he breaks into a meeting<br />of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
5069403 5074241 ...and using just a laptop, hacks into NORAD<br />and shuts down our defense network.
5074408 5077661 So they put a gun to the man's head<br />and forced him to stop the hack.
5077828 5081957 Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down<br />NORAD with a laptop, just to prove a point.
5082124 5084793 You think I'm scared of you?<br />Tell us how to find him.
5084960 5088005 How do I know? He's a ghost, man.<br />He just fell off the grid.
5088172 5090299 Another dead end. Come on.<br />Hold on. Wait.
5090466 5093844 Listen, Warlock,<br />a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...
5094011 5096513 I know.<br />A mutating algorithmic security code...
5096680 5099516 ...that's probably being used<br />by Thomas Gabriel now.
5099683 5102978 No, we know that. Yes.<br />Can you tell us what he's using it for?
5103145 5106231 I don't know. I've been trying<br />to figure that out. Here, look.
5107024 5110068 The only security system in the country<br />that I can find...
5110235 5114615 ...currently employing that template<br />is the Social Security Administration.
5114781 5120078 But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.<br />They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.
5120245 5123290 Oh. What the hell? God.<br />I know, right?
5123457 5127085 What are you talking about?<br />The power consumption's off the charts.
5127252 5129755 It's hot. It's on fire.<br />Why are there chilling towers?
5129922 5132341 That's what I thought. Hello.
5132549 5134218 What's a chilling tower?
5135135 5137513 See what I've been dealing with?
5137679 5141141 Large server farms generate a lot<br />of heat and need to be cooled.
5141308 5142643 But why there?
5142809 5146355 I don't know what's in that building,<br />but it's not Social Security numbers.
5153111 5157241 I got a red flag over here.<br />Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.
5159117 5160994 Honing in on the host server right now.
5163080 5164581 Frederick Kaludis.
5165374 5167417 Let's have a look at him.<br />Fat bastard.
5172422 5173799 McClane.
5173966 5178303 - Where is his daughter?<br />- We just got a trace on her cell.
5178470 5179930 You're gonna love this.
5184268 5186812 All right. Let's get a better<br />look at you.
5199074 5200867 Freddy? What?
5201034 5204580 What the hell are you doing<br />dicking around inside my network?
5208750 5209918 McClane.
5210877 5212713 I thought I killed you already.
5212879 5214798 I get that sometimes.
5217968 5220971 You think you can try to track where he is?
5221263 5222343 - Dude, yeah.<br />- Detective...
5222431 5226560 ...covering the camera with your hand<br />does not turn off the microphone.
5227978 5233317 Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys<br />with all this computer shit.
5234109 5237738 But, hey, I'm still alive, ain't I?
5238739 5242909 I mean, you got to be running out<br />of bad guys by now, right?
5243160 5244578 Huh?
5245787 5246955 Gabriel?
5247372 5250417 Honestly, you can tell me.<br />How's that work?
5250584 5255255 You got some kind of service?<br />Some kind of 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?
5255422 5257758 I bet you're still on hold with:
5257924 5261345 "Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch<br />over here right away?"
5262846 5269519 Huh? But seriously, all that kicking aside, that<br />skinny little ninja chick, she was smoking hot.
5269686 5272856 One of those gotta be real hard<br />to come by, right?
5273023 5276610 You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?<br />I have my moments.
5276777 5278570 Yeah?
5280364 5282199 Is this one of them?
5286787 5289623 Hello?<br />Yes, this is Emergency Services calling.
5289790 5291541 Thank God. Can she hear me?
5291708 5295337 My name is Lucy Gennaro.<br />I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.
5295504 5298215 Can she hear this?<br />Lucy, hang up that phone.
5298382 5302511 Just calm down, miss.<br />We know exactly where you are.
5302678 5304471 Everything is gonna be all right.
5304638 5309267 Lucy, hang up the phone.<br />John, I'm trying to have a conversation.
5312020 5314981 We're a bit overloaded tonight,<br />as you may imagine.
5315148 5317609 But I assure you<br />we're gonna get you out of there.
5317776 5322030 Even if I have to come down there myself.<br />Thank you.
5322197 5325701 In the meantime, is there anyone<br />we can contact for you?
5325867 5327411 Yeah.
5328328 5329746 My dad.
5330747 5334251 His name is John McClane.<br />He's a New York City cop.
5335043 5341258 We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,<br />and we'll get to you, very soon.
5342843 5344803 Thank you.
5345929 5350600 Wow. That's a great girl you got there.<br />Can't wait to meet her.
5351184 5353729 What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
5353895 5355939 Come on, John.
5357149 5358775 Make a joke.
5359860 5361945 Say something funny.
5368869 5371079 Wait. Where you going?
5371621 5376126 McClane. Hold on.<br />Where you going? What are you gonna do?
5376293 5378837 I'm gonna kill this motherfucker<br />and get my daughter back.
5379004 5380964 Or go get my daughter<br />and kill this motherfucker.
5381131 5382466 But she could be anywhere.<br />Listen.
5382632 5383800 You can't go, okay?
5383967 5388430 Just go play a computer game<br />with Hamhock.
5388597 5389890 Warlock. Yeah. Warlock.
5390056 5392809 Either way, you should just stay here.<br />I think I...
5392976 5396104 Hey, I'm doing you a favor, all right?
5396271 5398315 It's gonna get messy.
5399024 5400942 I'll take it from here.
5401109 5403361 Thanks for your help.
5416041 5417417 Buckle up.
5444694 5446863 FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.
5447030 5448365 Mind if I see your ID?
5449199 5450367 Not at all.
5460210 5462546 My dad's a cop. Force of habit.
5463296 5466132 Your father sounds like a very smart man.
5471221 5473557 Kid, can you get Bowman?
5473723 5475183 Uh, yeah.
5485402 5487362 It's completely dead.
5487529 5491074 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all the satellite links. Shit.
5496371 5498873 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5501418 5503253 About all of it.
5503795 5506548 It was my fault you got into this.<br />This wasn't your fight.
5506715 5508300 You got nothing to be sorry about.
5513513 5516349 Let go of me, you bastard.<br />This bitch is a handful.
5522522 5524733 Are you gonna be all right?
5526735 5529446 Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.
5529613 5534576 Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,<br />just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.
5536536 5538788 You really are his daughter.
5538955 5540498 Tie her wrists.
5547797 5550091 Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.
5550258 5552052 Is it that time already? Yeah.
5556348 5559017 I'll be back in a second.
5563980 5565148 No, no, no, please.
5613530 5616199 We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.
5620537 5621871 Go take a look.
5623540 5625709 Don't be long. We're packing up soon.
5637429 5641099 Hey, McClane, do we have anything<br />resembling a plan?
5641266 5643226 Yeah, find Lucy and kill everybody else.
5643393 5645895 No, I mean more like a plan.<br />Like, a way to do that.
5646062 5648398 I gotta get a gun. Keep your eyes open.
5649441 5651443 Come on.
5652569 5656489 Okay, according to the layout,<br />the chilling towers are kept on the bottom level.
5656656 5658825 Keep your voice down.
5662203 5663246 Unh!
5663413 5664789 I think mine's locked.
5668918 5671629 Okay. Now it looks like<br />we're getting somewhere.
5679095 5680138 Uh...
5683683 5688438 Okay, this looks like it controls the cooling<br />system for the mainframe, which should be...
5690023 5691858 If I can just hack in...
5693735 5696446 ...and trip the alarm,<br />it might alert Bowman.
5705038 5706790 Someone set off the alarms.
5706956 5710585 Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.<br />Find a way to turn it off.
5715215 5716549 What have you got?
5718301 5721221 We got a problem.<br />The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
5723139 5724265 It's gotta be him.
5725141 5727143 And what's Woodlawn?
5731397 5735276 It's NSA. A secure facility<br />outside of Baltimore.
5735652 5740323 It's a failsafe we built after 9/11<br />to back up all financial information.
5740490 5745411 The moment the networks were hit, all financial<br />data began downloading to those servers.
5745578 5750542 Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,<br />government funds. All of it.
5750708 5754462 Basically, a backup for<br />the accumulated wealth of America.
5754712 5756881 All in one location?
5757549 5758967 What could Gabriel do with it?
5759133 5763096 If he could get in, he could download<br />the data, use it to siphon billions.
5763263 5767600 Or, knowing him, he could erase it all<br />and send us all back to the Stone Age.
5768935 5774232 Why the hell wasn't I told about this?<br />Frankly, it's above your pay grade.
5774399 5775984 My pay grade?
5777527 5781155 I'm in charge of the infrastructure,<br />you arrogant prick.
5782198 5786035 How the hell did Gabriel find out about this<br />when even I didn't know about it?
5789831 5791374 He designed it.
5793501 5795211 It was his program.
5795503 5799465 He knew that hacking your system<br />last night would trigger the download.
5806055 5809267 Let me see if I can get<br />a floor plan of this place.
5809892 5810893 Don't move.
5812145 5814564 You, get away from the bag. Now.
5814731 5815940 Okay, okay.
5816274 5818693 We've been waiting for you.
5819444 5822739 Yeah? I've been waiting for you too.
5828661 5829787 Aah!
5839922 5842550 - Fuck this motherfucker!<br />- Aah!
5850266 5851726 McClane!
5853436 5854937 McClane!
5857607 5858941 Kid?
5859400 5860443 Matt!
5860610 5861694 Kid.
5875124 5877001 Emerson.
5878252 5880588 We have a problem in<br />one of the cooling towers.
5880755 5881964 Tower seven. Tower seven.
5882298 5883466 Find out what's going on.
5894143 5895144 Sir?
5895311 5897647 Get the HR team into choppers.<br />We need to get to Woodlawn.
5897814 5900608 They're saying it'll take at least 20 minutes<br />to get the team on site.
5901442 5903611 We don't have 20 minutes.
5904362 5907365 Look, the Pentagon<br />has jets flying CAP over D.C.
5907532 5910451 Have them send one to Woodlawn<br />and keep an eye on things.
5910618 5911953 Let's go.
5925258 5927260 Where's my daughter?
5927427 5929720 Russo, check in.
5933683 5938229 Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down<br />to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.
5938855 5941941 Hold on a minute.<br />Looks like he's coming around.
5942525 5944527 It's McClane. He's on the third floor.
5949031 5951951 Get all that? That's right.
5952410 5955997 I'm on the third floor.<br />But I'm coming to get you.
5964380 5965506 Time to take a nap, pal.
5970428 5972889 Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.
5982523 5985109 Oh, shit. Oh, God.
6019185 6020978 My algorithm.
6027109 6029278 Okay, please, God.
6030154 6032156 Please, God.
6068317 6071320 Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.
6094343 6097179 You coming to get me, John?<br />Is that the plan?
6097346 6099348 Yep, that's my plan.
6099682 6102935 What makes you think I won't put<br />a bullet in your daughter's head?
6103102 6106272 Because you're scared of me.<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
6107064 6110234 Otherwise, she'd be dead already.<br />She's your bargaining chip.
6117366 6119869 Stop there. Hands up.
6120202 6122413 If you kill me,<br />you'll never get it open.
6125583 6127543 Move away. Move!
6135051 6139055 You know, John, I feel like<br />we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
6139221 6142725 And because of that,<br />you think I'm the bad guy.
6142892 6145603 Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />I'm the good guy.
6145770 6149190 I told them this could happen<br />if they didn't prepare.
6149357 6152860 Did I get a thank-you?<br />No, I got a fuck-you. But they wouldn't listen.
6153027 6156739 You got their attention now, don't you?<br />That's right.
6156906 6161535 I am doing the country a favor.<br />Heh, heh. By tearing it apart.
6161702 6166749 Better me than some outsider.<br />Some religious nutjob bent on Armageddon.
6166916 6169418 Nobody wants to see that happen.
6169585 6175800 Everything I've broken can be fixed<br />if the country is willing to pay for it.
6175966 6179261 Oh, fuck you.<br />It's always been about the money.
6179428 6183432 What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?<br />I'm working my ass off here, John.
6183682 6185768 I'm on my way to bring you<br />a big fucking check.
6190439 6194276 I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,<br />see if you can get him to focus.
6195152 6196195 Dad?
6199281 6200699 Hi, baby.
6201283 6202952 Now there are only five of them.
6206288 6208749 Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.
6213379 6214463 Unh!
6219093 6222596 <i>Would somebody<br />please kill this son of a bitch?</i>
6224223 6225975 We have a problem.
6226892 6230688 There's actually no problem.<br />I just got off on the wrong floor.
6233482 6235651 This is a mess.
6237486 6241699 Wow, I'm truly impressed, man.<br />Hacking every byte of financial data...
6241866 6245828 ...for the entire country would take weeks<br />unless you eliminated the congestion.
6246203 6248456 That's what this fire sale is about,<br />isn't it?
6248622 6252585 Heh. That's brilliant.<br />Yes, it is. Please be quiet.
6252751 6255004 Asshole. Who are you?
6255838 6257256 Matt Farrell.
6258257 6260259 Lucy McClane.
6260676 6264054 I thought your name was Gennaro.<br />Lucy Gennaro.
6264221 6265890 Not today.
6266056 6269977 Can you crack the code?<br />Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.
6270144 6272354 That's encouraging.
6274023 6276275 Take them with us.
6276442 6278444 Let's go. Let's go.
6281155 6283824 Gabriel, Pentagon just sent<br />an F-35 towards us.
6283991 6286035 Keep an eye on it.
6287912 6290247 Pulling down the go codes now.
6306222 6309391 You might wanna think about<br />what you want on your headstone, asshole.
6316774 6319276 Christ! Goddamn hamster.
6320194 6321529 There you go.
6321695 6324031 Stay still, spider-boy.
6328118 6329745 That's right.
6349682 6350683 Unh!
6358941 6360234 Goddamn it!
6366073 6367366 Aah!
6369994 6371954 Oh, no.
6375666 6379962 You probably shouldn't antagonize them,<br />since they have all the loaded guns.
6380254 6384633 Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger<br />set of balls, because you're gonna need them.
6384800 6389138 Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird<br />hearing it from someone with hair.
6426383 6427468 Sir.
6427635 6429345 15 minutes.
6484608 6486318 Fix it.
6486485 6489613 Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.<br />I know that.
6490072 6491573 Stop.
6496537 6497996 Oh, shit.
6501792 6503669 I'm not gonna do it.
6507965 6511718 - No, no, no. Shit.<br />- Robinson is coming pretty fast.
6511885 6513929 I'm sorry, what?<br />Something's wrong.
6514096 6515931 Robinson is coming too fast.
6520477 6522438 It's not Robinson.
6522604 6524314 That would be my dad.
6535868 6537995 Freddy?
6538912 6540706 Freddy.
6541623 6543333 It's John McClane.
6543500 6546962 Look, I know you can hear me.<br />This is your frequency, right? 666.
6547129 6549840 Come on, pick up the mike, Freddy.
6552509 6554803 Nobody here by that name. Sorry.
6554970 6556638 Hacker jerk off!
6561059 6562311 Warlock.
6563228 6568400 I need you to do whatever it is you do<br />to patch me through to the FBI.
6568567 6570486 To Deputy Director Bowman.
6570652 6573155 You hear me? Are you serious?
6573322 6575782 You want me to intentionally<br />open up a com line...
6575949 6579703 ...to the head of the FBI's cyber division?<br />I don't think so.
6580037 6582206 Freddy, goddamn it,<br />they have my daughter!
6587836 6590172 I can do that. Hold on.
6591423 6593175 Thank you.
6599681 6602684 This is Central.<br />We have a patch for Director Bowman.
6603519 6606271 Sir. Central's trying to reach you.
6607523 6608732 Go.
6608899 6611360 Bowman, it's McClane. McClane.
6611527 6615322 Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695<br />headed north in a Hazmat truck.
6615489 6618784 Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?<br />We're headed there right now.
6618951 6621370 Bowman. He's got my daughter.
6623372 6627918 Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government<br />vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?
6628085 6630212 Track that down, it should take you to him.
6630379 6633882 Give me the tag number.<br />All right. Hang on. Here it comes.
6634049 6636093 Golf. Tango.
6637678 6641723 Five. Niner. Two. November.
6641890 6644476 Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?
6644643 6645894 He's with them.
6647020 6648438 Listen to me.
6648605 6652985 I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,<br />but if something happens to me...
6653151 6657406 ...you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?<br />I mean everybody.
6657781 6659908 Don't let that maniac get my daughter.
6660075 6663161 John, don't worry.<br />I want your word, Bowman.
6665747 6667332 Yeah, you have it.
6668250 6669918 McClane out.
6677301 6678427 There's the F-35.
6681096 6682931 Did you get the go codes?
6683265 6685851 Trey. Did you get the go codes?<br />Yes. I got the codes.
6686018 6690397 Can you connect me to the pilot?<br />Uh... Uh...
6705078 6706663 Isolating his radio.
6712628 6714963 Sending him the go codes.
6721553 6722763 AV-81.
6722929 6728143 - AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.<br />- Go for AV-81.
6728310 6731980 Confirmed terrorist vehicle<br />located in your sector. A big rig truck.
6733482 6736276 - Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.<br />- I see them.
6736443 6739112 You are authorized to engage<br />and destroy.
6739279 6741573 Copy that. AV-81 engaging.
6749915 6751083 What?
6759007 6762052 Jesus Christ! Goddamn it!
6765347 6767140 You're shooting at the wrong guy!
6775190 6777359 I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.
6789871 6790872 Hey!
6791289 6792999 Jackass!
6828660 6830245 Unh!
6840130 6842382 Is that it? Huh?
6845260 6846595 Is that your best shot?
6890138 6891473 Come on!
6900232 6901441 Damn it.
6907781 6908990 Aah!
6917916 6919543 Come on.
6938854 6939855 Unh!
6943692 6945652 Argh!
6980061 6981104 Hoo.
7013053 7014971 Let's go. Come on.
7015138 7017182 That way. It's that way. Go.
7018600 7019726 Let's go. Move it.
7026274 7028777 We are leaving in three minutes.
7032238 7034449 You have one.
7034616 7037953 The rules haven't changed.<br />You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.
7038745 7041623 Aah! No!
7041957 7044793 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Matthew?
7044960 7048046 Matthew!<br />I really need you to pay attention.
7049214 7052842 The rules can always change.<br />Okay, wait.
7053009 7055345 I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.<br />Wait, wait, wait.
7055512 7057305 Nine.
7057472 7058974 I can't.
7059140 7061059 Eight.
7061226 7062978 I can't.
7063770 7065063 Oh, God.
7068108 7069192 Okay.
7071236 7072654 Okay, okay, okay.
7072821 7074322 Six.
7074489 7078326 Okay, stop. Stop, stop.<br />I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
7078493 7080954 Oh, God. Oh, my God.
7094634 7096177 Feds are headed this way.
7097053 7099514 Get everything on the plane.<br />Yep.
7109607 7111359 - Dad.<br />- Careful.
7111526 7114779 Don't worry, baby.<br />Everything's gonna be all right.
7116865 7118324 Daddy!
7124164 7125707 No!
7125874 7128001 Hold this.
7150190 7151649 No.
7153276 7154486 Jesus Christ.
7155570 7157655 You got her?
7158114 7159991 You're sure?
7162118 7163620 Nice effort, though.
7164412 7167415 Matthew.<br />Oh, shit. All right, Okay.
7167582 7169292 Okay. I'm doing it. I know.
7177300 7178927 McClane.
7179427 7181805 Would you do me a favor?
7183640 7188603 I know the lights are beginning to dim,<br />but if you could just hang on for a second.
7188770 7191898 As soon as Matt's finished,<br />I'm gonna kill him and your daughter.
7192065 7194776 And I would love for you<br />to see that.
7196444 7198655 Goddamn it. Matthew?
7199030 7201449 Ten seconds, okay?<br />You'll have all your money.
7201616 7205620 You just leave. No one has to get hurt.<br />A few seconds. Stay with me.
7205787 7208790 McClane. Unh!
7208957 7211334 - Stay with me.<br />- Dad?
7212127 7217298 On your tombstone it should read: "Always<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time."
7218174 7222387 How about,<br />"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker."
7235859 7238486 Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
7238653 7241573 Are you okay?<br />Yes, baby, I'm fine.
7243867 7245326 I knew you'd come for me.
7245493 7249998 Of course I'd come for you, honey.<br />Sorry it took me so long. It's okay.
7258089 7259632 Move, move!
7264804 7266180 Freeze!
7266514 7269183 Hold, hold. He's okay.
7271352 7274022 - Get that vehicle.<br />- Come around.
7274188 7276190 Here, help Daddy up. Okay.
7276357 7280778 Unh! Wait, wait.<br />I think I'll just stay here for a minute.
7281195 7285199 Okay. Daddy, you're out of your mind.<br />What are you talking about?
7285366 7290121 You shot yourself.<br />It seemed like a good idea at the time.
7290288 7293207 - Don't tell these guys that I did that.<br />- Heh, heh.
7304719 7307513 Thanks for all your help, John.<br />Thank you.
7309557 7311392 Is he okay?
7312560 7315271 Should I put my hands up?<br />No, don't put your hands up.
7315438 7316898 Put them down farther?
7317857 7320735 Might die of shock<br />on the way to the hospital.
7324864 7326157 All right.
7326616 7327784 Unh!
7328743 7330411 I'll be right back.
7332372 7334457 Hey. Oh, hey.
7334624 7337210 How's it feel to be shot?<br />It actually feels great.
7337377 7340713 He gave me some...<br />What's it called? Morphine.
7340880 7344759 Well, you got your merit badge now.<br />Yeah. I don't know what that means.
7346594 7350431 Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.<br />Really? Hm.
7352058 7353434 Not that one.
7354227 7355895 What? Don't even think about it.
7356062 7359774 How did you know what I was thinking?<br />Did she say something to you?
7359941 7363861 I felt like we had kind of a vibe.<br />Easy. That's just the morphine kicking in.
7364028 7365863 Yeah.
7366030 7370952 Besides, after all we've been through,<br />I'd hate to have to beat you to death.
7372870 7374455 That would suck.
7376416 7378209 Good to go? Yeah, all set.
7378376 7381921 Take care of yourself.<br />I'll see you at the hospital.
7385758 7387010 Hey.
7388428 7390263 Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
7390805 7392140 Hey.
7393224 7394642 What was I gonna do?
7397061 7399105 That's what makes you that guy.
7402233 7403818 Yeah.
7409991 7412785 So, um,<br />did he say anything about me?
7414704 7416748 Jesus, Lucy.
7416914 7419000 What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
7420585 7422962 I'm in enough pain already.
7423129 7424881 Hospital.
7440688 7444317 Some folks are born made to wave the flag
7444484 7447028 Ooh, they're red, white and blue
7447862 7451491 And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
7451657 7454744 Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
7455369 7462001 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no senator's son, son
7462502 7468883 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no fortunate one, no
7469467 7473054 Some folks are born<br />Silver spoon in hand
7473221 7476516 Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
7476808 7480103 But when the taxman comes to the door
7480269 7483898 Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes
7484065 7491197 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no
7491364 7497912 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no fortunate one, no
7511634 7512844 Yeah, now
7513010 7516639 Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
7516806 7520101 Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
7520268 7523729 And when you ask them<br />"How much should we give?"
7523896 7527692 Ooh, they only answer<br />"More, more, more,” oh
7527859 7534448 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no military son, son
7534949 7541831 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no fortunate one, no, no
7541998 7548963 It ain't me, it ain't me<br />I ain't no fortunate one, no, no, no
7549130 7550798 It ain't me
