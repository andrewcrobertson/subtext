55823 57807 You don't like flying, do you?
59215 61200 What gives you that idea?
63216 67729 You want to know the secret<br />to surviving air travel?
67793 70417 After you get where you're going,<br />take off your shoes and socks.
70480 74897 Then you walk around on the rug barefoot<br />and make fists with your toes.
76049 78161 Fists with your toes?
78898 80593 I know. It sounds crazy.
80689 82482 Trust me.<br />I've been doing it for nine years.
82578 86962 Yes, sir! Better than a shower<br />and a hot cup of coffee.
87058 87986 OK.
97683 99251 It's OK. I'm a cop.
101556 105268 Trust me.<br />I've been doing this for 11 years.
105524 108532 [stewardess] On behalf<br />of the captain and the crew,...

186491 189787 Hey, Holly.<br />What about dinner tonight?
190171 192412 Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
192508 195451 Families, stockings,...
196667 198683 Chestnuts?
198844 200540 Rudolph and Frosty?
200604 202524 Any of these things ring a bell?
202621 204220 Actually, I was thinking more of...
204285 207740 ..mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...
207836 211773 ..and a roaring fireplace.<br />You know what I'm saying?
213886 216989 Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.<br />Have some champagne.
217054 219422 You're making me feel<br />like Ebenezer Scrooge.
219518 223070 Thanks. Do you think the baby<br />can handle a little sip?
223134 226111 That baby's ready to tend bar.
226174 227486 Last chance.
227583 229374 Bye.

238015 241855 Hello, Lucy McClane.<br />This is your mother speaking.
241951 244640 Mommy!<br />When are you coming home?
245023 246784 Pretty soon.
246848 249120 You'll be in bed<br />when I get there, though.
249184 251585 Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?
251648 255840 And no snooping around the house<br />looking for presents.
255905 258273 Is Daddy coming home with you?
260289 261761 Well, we'll see what...
261825 264225 ..Santa and Mommy can do, OK?
264674 266753 Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.
266818 268258 Paulina!
273186 274979 Hola, Mrs Holly.
275075 277635 Um, did Mr McClane call?
277922 280195 No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.
281379 284387 He probably didn't have time<br />before his flight.
284451 287140 It might be a good idea<br />to make up the spare bedroom...
287235 288227 ..just in case.
288291 291140 Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.
291236 294276 What would I do without you, Paulina?
313510 315526 [woman squeals]
317798 319751 California!
332295 333863 Hey, I'm John McClane.
333959 334952 Argyle.
335016 336839 I'm your limo driver.
339944 341000 Nice bear.
345448 347433 OK... Argyle.
347785 349225 What do we do now?
349320 352105 I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.
352201 353993 It's my first time driving a limo.
354185 356969 That's OK.<br />It's my first time riding in one.
357034 359690 Relax.<br />We got everything in this mug, man.
359754 362218 Look at this... CD, CB, TV,...
362954 365354 ..telephone, full bar, VHS.
367018 368523 If your friend's hot to trot,...
368586 370346 ..I know a few mama bears<br />we can hook up with.
372747 373867 Or is he married?
373963 375467 He's married.
375563 377547 OK.
378347 381324 Sorry about that.<br />It's the girl's day off.
381388 383628 I didn't know<br />you were gonna sit up front.
383724 385164 Your lady live out here?
385228 387276 About the past six months.
387373 390253 Meaning you still live in New York?
390989 394029 You always ask<br />this many questions, Argyle?
394125 397517 Sorry. I used to drive a cab<br />and people would expect a little chitchat.
397965 401806 - So, you divorced?<br />- Just drive the car, man.
401870 405550 Hey, come on. You divorced?<br />You separated? She beat you up!?
408366 412271 She had a good job.<br />It turned into a great career.
412366 417359 - That meant she had to move here.<br />- You're very fast, Argyle.
417519 419727 So, why didn't you come?
421807 422767 Well?
422831 424335 Why didn't you come with her?
424400 426287 Because I'm a New York cop.
426351 431184 I got a backlog of New York scumbags<br />I'm still trying to put behind bars.
431280 433105 I can't just go that easy.
433201 435600 You thought she wasn't<br />gonna make it out here...
435696 439825 ..and she'd come crawling back to you<br />so why bother to pack, right?
439921 442833 Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.
442929 444401 Mind if we hear some tunes?
445905 447442 [rap music]
448050 450034 Hey, that'll work.
451505 453938 Don't you got any Christmas music?
454002 456595 This is Christmas music.
457618 460402 [Run DMC] # It was December 24th<br />on Hollis Ave. after dark #
460498 462930 # When I seen the man chillin'<br />with his dog in the park #
462995 465331 # I approached them very slowly<br />with my heart full of fear #
465395 467987 # Looked at his dog...<br />oh, my God, a ill reindeer #
468083 470132 # But then I was illin'<br />'cause the man had a beard #
470196 472596 # And a bag full of goodies.<br />12 o'clock hit, man #
472691 474836 # So I turned my head a second,<br />and the man was gone #
474932 477204 # But he must have dropped his wallet<br />smack dead on the lawn #
477268 479764 # I picked the wallet up,<br />and then I took a pause #
479860 482388 # Took out the licence,<br />and it cold said Santa Claus #
482484 484533 # A million dollars in it,<br />cold hundreds and Gs... #
484597 487093 So your lady sees you,<br />you run into each other's arms,...
487157 490517 ..the music comes up<br />and you live happily ever after, right?
490773 492405 I can live with that.
493526 496629 So, if it doesn't work out,<br />you got a place to stay?
496726 498262 I'll find a place.
498966 500278 I tell you what...
500374 505078 I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,<br />give me a call on the car phone.
505174 509847 I'll take your bags to the desk.<br />You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.
509911 514295 - You're all right, Argyle.<br />- Remember that when you sign for the tip.
536857 538841 - Hi.<br />- Good evening.
539129 541370 I'm here to see Holly McClane.
541465 543929 Just type it in there.
549179 550170 Cute toy.
550235 553499 Yeah, if you have to take a leak,<br />it'll even help you find your zipper.
569660 571452 Christ.
576284 578333 - Thirtieth floor?<br />- The party.
578396 580157 They're the only ones<br />left in the building.
580445 581661 Take the express elevator.
581853 583709 Get off where you hear the noise.
584061 585533 Thanks.
588926 591966 [whistling] # Jingle Bells #
641347 643746 - Champagne, sir?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
676741 678597 Oh, I'm sorry.
679109 681542 Hey! Merry Christmas!
685030 686727 Jesus.
687335 688870 Fuckin' California!
688934 691015 [woman] I couldn't agree with you more.
691111 693191 Why don't I talk to him right now?
694023 696551 Hi. I'm looking for...
696615 697959 - Holly Gennero.<br />- Yeah.
698023 699912 Then you must be John McClane.
699975 702247 Joe Takagi.<br />How was your ride in?
702344 704744 Nice. I have you to thank for that?
704840 706952 Seemed the least we could do.
707016 710536 - Quite a place you have here.<br />- It will be if we ever get it finished.
710633 712553 Still several floors under construction.
712616 716873 Holly went to fax some documents.<br />She should be back any minute.
716937 720425 In the meanwhile,<br />her office is back here.
721673 722633 Ellis?
723785 727754 [sniffing] I was just making a call.<br />This was the nearest phone.
727946 729962 I want you to meet John McClane,...
730026 731562 ..Holly's husband.
732074 733642 Holly's policeman.
733930 735914 Ellis is in charge<br />of international development.
736235 738378 Heard a lot about you.
738475 740202 You missed some.
740267 741355 [Ellis sniffs]
741707 743339 Can I get you anything?
743435 746348 Food? Cake?<br />Some watered-down champagne?
746412 748428 No, thank you. I'm fine.
749836 751467 You throw quite a party.
752908 755660 I didn't realise they celebrated<br />Christmas in Japan.
755757 756844 We're flexible.
756908 759756 Pearl Harbor didn't work out,<br />so we got you with tape decks.
759820 761836 [exaggerated laugh]
762380 766125 It's sort of a double celebration.<br />We closed a pretty big deal today...
766189 768590 ..and a lot of it was due<br />to Holly. Right, Joe?
768653 771118 [Holly] I'll be out<br />in a couple of minutes.
775150 776429 John.
780430 782254 Have you met everyone?
782350 784239 We've been sticking him with spears.
784303 786319 Of course he has.
786863 790224 She was made for the business.<br />Tough as nails.
790320 792592 I was hoping you made that flight.
792655 794735 Show him the watch.
795279 796239 Later.
796303 798352 Show him. Are you embarrassed?
798928 801296 It's just a small token of appreciation...
801393 803888 ..for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.
803952 806352 I'm sure I'll see it later.
806448 808528 Is there a place<br />where I could wash up?
809425 810225 Sure.
825586 826994 You have to forgive Ellis.
827059 828594 He gets very depressed<br />this time of year.
830035 833139 He thought he was<br />God's greatest gift, you know?
833235 835443 I know the type.
835699 838195 I think he's got his eye on you.
838707 842131 That's OK. I have my eye<br />on his private bathroom.
842483 845236 Where are you staying?<br />Things happened so fast...
845300 847956 ..I didn't get a chance<br />to ask you on the phone.
848052 850420 Cappy Roberts retired out here.
850516 851605 Oh, yeah?
851669 853237 He said I could bunk with him.
853300 855573 Cappy retired, huh?<br />Where's he live?
855637 858709 - Romona.<br />- Ha! Pomona.
859350 861270 - Huh?<br />- Pomona.
861366 863126 - Pomona.<br />- Yeah.
864053 866294 You'll be in the car half the time.
867670 870006 Why don't we make it easy?<br />I have a spare bedroom.
871350 873687 It's not huge or anything, but...
873751 877079 ..the kids would love to have you<br />at the house.
878231 879670 They would, huh?
882871 885079 I would, too.
885143 886840 [woman] Ha ha! Ooh!
888152 889527 Sorry.
896216 898649 I missed you.
904793 906841 Didn't miss my name, though, huh?
907641 910682 Except maybe<br />when you're signing cheques?
910746 912762 Since when did you start using<br />Ms Gennero?
915642 918971 This is a Japanese company.<br />They figure a married woman's...
919483 921083 You are a married woman.
921178 923931 This conversation again?<br />We did this in July.
923994 926107 We never finished this conversation.
926203 928443 I had an opportunity. I had to take it.
928539 931227 No matter what it did to our marriage.
931323 933499 It only changed your idea<br />of our marriage.
933564 935292 You have no clue what my idea...
935356 938812 I know exactly what your idea<br />of our marriage should be.
938876 940572 [knocking] Ms Gennero, I...
942236 943900 Excuse me.
944412 945693 Hi.
946940 948925 Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.
949021 951453 He wants you to say something<br />to the troops.
951517 952285 Thank you.
956733 957597 Speech time.
958622 960414 Be back in a few minutes.
971742 973279 That was great, John.
973375 976255 Good job. Very mature.
1023940 1025092 So Kareem rebounds.

1615798 1617655 Ohh, that's beautiful.
1620184 1622743 I always enjoyed to make models<br />when I was a boy.
1622808 1627384 The exactness, the attention<br />to every conceivable detail.
1628184 1629592 It's beautiful.
1629784 1632824 Is this what this is all about?<br />Our project in Indonesia?
1634136 1636537 Contrary to what you people may think,...
1636985 1639993 ..we're going to develop<br />that region, not exploit it.
1640057 1644505 I believe you.<br />I read the article in "Forbes".
1646425 1647770 Mr Takagi...
1649401 1652986 I could talk about industrialisation<br />and men's fashions all day...
1653081 1655034 ..but I'm afraid work must intrude...
1655099 1658075 ..and my associate here<br />has some questions for you.
1658875 1661786 Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,<br />actually.
1662586 1663579 [beeping]
1670779 1672508 I don't have that code.
1673499 1675771 You broke in here<br />to access our computer?
1676060 1677980 Any information you could get...
1678076 1680188 ..when they wake up in Tokyo,<br />they'll change it.
1680284 1683068 You won't be able to blackmail<br />our executives...
1683164 1685117 Sit... down!
1694589 1698109 Mr Takagi, I'm really not<br />interested in your computer.
1703103 1704542 But I need the code key...
1705631 1709439 ..because I am interested<br />in the $640 million...
1709982 1714143 ..in negotiable bearer bonds<br />that you have locked in your vault...
1714239 1717727 ..and the computer<br />controls the vault.
1718879 1720768 You want money?
1721184 1723488 What kind of terrorists are you?
1726624 1728992 Who said we were terrorists?
1747714 1750370 The bonds represent, at most...
1750434 1754083 ..10 days' operating capital<br />for your parent organisation.
1754147 1757347 It's really no more<br />than a temporary inconvenience.
1757443 1758435 Now...
1762628 1764356 ..the code, please.
1765604 1766564 It's useless to you.
1766628 1769956 There are seven safeguards on our vault<br />and the code key's only one of them.
1770020 1771364 You'll never get it open.
1771429 1773924 Then there's no reason<br />not to tell it to us.
1774724 1778501 - I told you.<br />- It's not over yet.
1782885 1786405 It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.
1787109 1790181 It would be a shame to ruin it.
1792326 1794598 I'm going to count to three.
1795590 1798439 There will not be a four.
1799238 1801094 Give me the code.
1802087 1803239 One,...
1806151 1807400 ..two,...
1809320 1811303 - ..three,...<br />- I don't know it.
1812008 1814152 Get on a jet to Tokyo<br />and ask the chairman.
1814248 1815752 You're just gonna have to kill me.
1816360 1817064 OK.
1820968 1822313 We do it the hard way.
1822409 1824329 Tony, see if you can dispose of that.
1824392 1827593 Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work<br />up on the machine floor.
1827881 1828969 [bumps head]
1851947 1852875 Nothing.
1853707 1855339 See to Heinrich.
1856843 1858220 Now...
1858636 1860940 ..you can break the code?
1861644 1866540 You didn't bring me<br />for my charming personality.
1870925 1873613 Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.
1873677 1875213 You're calling the police right now.
1875277 1877517 [loud music playing]<br />Of course I'm still coming by later.
1878829 1880845 Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?
1881645 1884014 My boss? He thinks<br />I'm on my way to Vegas.
1885326 1887695 Uli, get up on the pipes.
1888399 1890286 Marco, you go through here.
1892206 1893774 I'll throw you the cord.
1897775 1899247 Hans, we're on the roof.
1912176 1913392 Here.
1916785 1917969 Uli.
1924850 1927090 30 minutes to break the code,...
1927185 1931571 ..two hours, two and a half hours<br />for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.
1931634 1934706 The 7th lock, however,<br />is out of my hands.
1956436 1957781 I'm sorry?
1957845 1960628 The 7th lock...<br />the electromagnetic seal.
1960692 1963541 You do understand the circuits<br />cannot be cut locally?
1965237 1966453 Trust me.
1968181 1971126 Why the fuck<br />didn't you stop him, John?
1972182 1974902 'Cause then you'd be dead, too,<br />asshole.
1974966 1976886 Think, goddamn it! Think!
1985655 1987095 [beeping]
1988791 1990423 We've got a fire alarm.
1990999 1992631 Call 911.
1992695 1996536 Give them the guard's name<br />and cancel the alarm.
1996600 1997848 Then disable the sys...
2001144 2003929 Eddie, on what floor<br />did the alarm go off?
2005400 2007449 Shall we go?
2007736 2008888 Nein.
2014457 2015898 [sirens]
2019514 2020634 Yes.
2020858 2023546 Hello, baby.<br />Come to Papa. Come on.
2023962 2025818 Ah ha ha ha!
2027290 2028666 Come on, baby.
2029147 2030266 Come on, baby.
2030331 2031611 Come on, baby. Come to Papa.
2031707 2034075 I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.
2036731 2038940 You stupid motherfuckers!<br />No! No!
2039515 2041372 Turn the fuckin' truck around!
2041468 2043003 [elevator bell dings]
2073470 2076414 The fire has been called off, my friend.
2080831 2083135 No-one is coming to help you.
2086975 2090047 You might as well come out<br />and join the others.
2092640 2094656 I promise I won't hurt you.
2101057 2102529 [whirring]
2115746 2118179 [whirring slows]
2122946 2125987 Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.
2126083 2127747 You won't hurt me.
2127843 2129539 Yeah? Why not?
2129635 2131428 Because you're a policeman.
2131491 2133828 There are rules for policemen.
2133924 2137252 Yeah, that's what my captain<br />keeps telling me.
2201225 2203306 Bet your ass I wish to proceed.
2205066 2206986 [whirring]
2241965 2243821 Nine million terrorists in the world...
2243918 2246957 ..and I got to kill one with feet<br />smaller than my sister.
2294322 2296722 I wanted this to be professional,...
2296785 2298770 ..efficient, adult, cooperative.
2298834 2299922 Not a lot to ask.
2300018 2302802 Alas, your Mr Takagi<br />did not see it that way...
2302898 2306386 ..so he won't be joining us<br />for the rest of his life.
2308435 2310291 We can go any way you want it.
2311443 2314195 You can walk out of here<br />or be carried out...
2314291 2318163 ..but have no illusions...<br />we are in charge.
2319604 2323316 So... decide now, each of you...
2323476 2325364 ..and please remember...
2326772 2328820 ..we have left nothing to chance.
2332917 2334357 It's Tony!
2336853 2338069 Get them back!
2347511 2349879 "Now I have a machine gun."
2351479 2354615 "Ho... ho... ho."
2357431 2359351 A security guard we missed?
2359447 2364343 They're usually tired old policemen.<br />No, this is something else.
2364792 2367256 [Hans speaking German]
2373592 2375641 We have to do something, Hans.
2375737 2376921 Yes, we do.
2377017 2379321 Tell Karl his brother is dead.
2380057 2381337 Tell him to come down.
2382778 2384698 Karl... komm sofort.
2385113 2387449 [Hans] Franco, Fritz,<br />take the body upstairs...
2387545 2388666 ..and out of sight.
2388762 2391418 I don't want the hostages<br />to think too much.
2391994 2393498 [Fritz] Komm sofort. Schnell.
2453120 2454815 I want blood!
2454911 2457856 You'll have it, but let<br />Heinrich plant the detonators...
2457920 2460416 ..and Theo prepare the vault.<br />After we call the police,...
2460512 2463585 ..you can tear the building apart<br />looking for this man...
2463648 2466368 ..but until then,<br />do not alter the plan!
2466784 2468929 And if he alters it?
2473538 2475329 [Ellis] What do you think?
2477218 2479265 Something's wrong.
2479330 2480610 Cops?
2482466 2484834 - John.<br />- John?
2485122 2487170 [Ellis] He can fuck<br />this whole thing up.
2487266 2488514 What does he think he's doing?
2488578 2489762 His job.
2489859 2493379 Bullshit.<br />His job's 3,000 miles away.
2493475 2496579 Without him, we still have<br />a chance to get out of here.
2497603 2499971 Tell that to Takagi.
2522469 2524741 Mayday, Mayday,<br />anyone copying channel nine.
2524837 2527206 Terrorists have seized<br />the Nakatomibuilding...
2527302 2528677 ..and are holding<br />at least 30 people hostage.
2528742 2530790 I repeat.<br />Unknown number of terrorists...
2530854 2532870 ..six or more<br />armed with automatic weapons...
2532934 2534054 ..at Nakatomi Plaza,...
2534150 2535110 ..Century City.
2535175 2537926 Where's the best place to transmit?
2538022 2538599 The roof!
2538663 2539942 Go! Go!
2542535 2544936 [woman] It's the same address<br />as that fire signal.
2545159 2547431 [2nd woman] I'll handle it.

2568490 2571177 No-one kills him but me.
2571785 2573866 They have already killed one hostage.
2573962 2577002 They are fortifying their positions<br />while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!
2577387 2579274 Sir, I've already told you.
2579338 2580907 This is a reserved channel.
2580971 2584587 If this is an emergency call,<br />dial 911 on your telephone.
2584683 2588139 Otherwise, I'll report this<br />as an FCC violation.
2588235 2590699 Fine! Report me!<br />Come the fuck down here and arrest me!
2590795 2591980 Just send the police now!
2593548 2594508 [gunshots on radio]

2823520 2825663 He's in the elevator shaft.
2826175 2827072 Perfect.
2827168 2829504 The elevators are locked off.<br />He can't escape.
2829568 2831200 Just shut him in<br />and come back down.
2834976 2836097 Oh, fuck.
2841729 2844001 Karl, the police are probably<br />on their way...

2866499 2867299 Christ.
2872292 2874532 I can stall them,<br />but not if they hear gunshots.

3087511 3088919 I do see a guard inside.

3137787 3139963 You ask me, that goddamn<br />computer sent you...
3140026 3141787 ..on another wild-goose chase.

3375023 3376943 Never thought<br />I'd love to hear that sound.
3377008 3378543 All of you relax.
3378607 3381423 This is a matter<br />of inconvenient timing, that's all.
3381488 3383376 Police action was inevitable...
3383440 3386065 ..and, as it happens, necessary.
3386128 3389457 So, let them fumble about outside<br />and stay calm.
3389520 3391088 This is simply the beginning.

3396145 3398706 I'm very sorry, Hans.<br />I didn't get that message.
3398769 3402001 Maybe you should have put it<br />on the bulletin board.
3402097 3404498 I figured since I waxed Tony<br />and Marco and his friend here,...
3404562 3407314 ..I figured you and Karl<br />and Franco might be lonely...
3407378 3409267 ..so I wanted to give you a call.
3409330 3411442 [Karl] How does he know<br />so much about us?
3412818 3414867 That's very kind of you.
3415282 3418163 I assume you are<br />our mysterious party crasher.
3418835 3420147 You are most troublesome...
3420211 3421940 ..for a security guard.
3422356 3425043 Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.
3425139 3427763 Would you like to go for double jeopardy<br />where the scores can really change?
3432692 3434996 Mm, these are very bad for you.
3435829 3437268 Who are you, then?
3437333 3439540 Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.
3439605 3440949 The monkey in the wrench,...
3441013 3442901 ..the pain in the ass.
3445494 3446294 Whoa!
3447862 3450230 Check on all the others.<br />Don't use the radio.
3450294 3451638 See if he's lying about Marco...
3451702 3454294 ..and find out<br />if anyone else is missing.
3457782 3459766 Mr Mystery Guest,...
3460822 3462487 ..are you still there?
3463223 3464791 Yeah, I'm still here...
3464855 3467511 ..unless you want to open<br />the front door for me.
3467576 3469432 No, I'm afraid not...
3469496 3472183 ..but you have me at a loss.
3472248 3473944 You know my name, but who are you?
3474008 3478008 Just another American<br />who saw too many movies as a child?
3478104 3481144 Another orphan<br />of a bankrupt culture...
3481240 3484216 ..who thinks he's John Wayne,<br />Rambo, Marshal Dillon?
3485465 3488250 I was always partial<br />to Roy Rogers, actually.
3488858 3490553 I liked those sequined shirts.
3490618 3493754 Do you really think you have<br />a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?
3496762 3498778 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
3502426 3504634 I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.
3504698 3506427 [man] Sam, I don't have the new pages.
3506491 3508666 Harvey, keep your pants on.
3508731 3510427 Sam, I'm begging you.
3510491 3513595 Simon's with the remote.<br />I'll tell him to swing by.
3513660 3515420 I won't sit on this!
3515515 3518171 This is my story!<br />I'm going out there!
3518268 3519835 Look, Sam. Tell you what.
3519900 3522012 You don't give me a truck,<br />I'll steal a truck.
3522108 3523228 [Harvey]<br />Give us a break, Thornburg.
3523324 3524444 Eat it, Harvey!
3524508 3526972 ..four, three, two,...
3527068 3528221 ..one.
3528444 3530109 Harvey, we're on the air.
3534237 3536221 Good evening.<br />This is Harvey Johnson.
3538045 3539678 And I'm Gail Wallens.
3539742 3541662 This is Nightline News at 10.00.
3541758 3544446 Our top stories<br />on this Christmas Eve...
3544510 3547550 Take truck number five.<br />Get out of here.
3555039 3557823 He wasn't lying about Marco.<br />He's down on the street.
3558399 3560160 The other man was Heinrich...
3560671 3562399 ..and his bag is missing.
3564544 3565984 He had the detonator.
3570784 3571521 Theo.
3572288 3573281 Theo.
3573472 3574464 Yo!
3574913 3577952 We may have some problems.<br />How's our schedule?
3578497 3579873 Three down, four to go.
3579969 3581345 Then don't waste time...
3581441 3583233 ..talking to me.
3583906 3585377 This is Sergeant Al Powell...
3585474 3587042 ..of the Los Angeles<br />Police Department.
3587105 3588482 If the person who radioed for help...
3588546 3589666 ..can hear me on this channel,...
3589825 3591682 ..acknowledge this transmission.
3591746 3592770 I say again,...
3592834 3596035 ..if the person who radioed<br />for help can hear me,...
3596098 3598466 ..acknowledge this transmission!
3602595 3605123 I read you, pal.<br />You the guy in the car?
3605187 3607075 What's left of him.
3607171 3608739 Can you identify yourself?
3608835 3610468 Not now. Maybe later.
3610564 3612484 Listen fast. This is a party line.
3612548 3614468 The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.
3614564 3616036 All right, here's the deal.
3616101 3617892 You got 30 or so hostages<br />on the 30th floor.
3617957 3619300 The leader's name is Hans.
3619396 3620837 We have to find him and shut him up.
3620901 3621957 He's telling them everything!
3622020 3624036 Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.
3624101 3626117 He can waste<br />as much time as he likes...
3626213 3628389 ..but we must find the bag, Fritz.
3628485 3630438 [McClane]<br />They have a freakin' arsenal here.
3630502 3631781 We must have the detonators.
3631877 3634245 They got missiles, automatic weapons,...
3634310 3636358 ..and enough plastic explosives<br />to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3636838 3639558 They're down to nine now,<br />counting the skydiver you met.
3639654 3641382 These guys are mostly European...
3641478 3643879 ..judging by their clothing labels and...
3650439 3651911 ..cigarettes.
3652007 3654440 They're well-financed and very slick.
3654504 3656135 How do you know that?
3656200 3657895 I've seen enough phoney IDs in my time...
3657960 3661640 ..to recognise the ones they got<br />must have cost a fortune.
3663849 3666152 Add all that up. I don't know<br />what the fuck it means...
3666248 3668233 ..but you got<br />some bad-ass perpetrators...
3668329 3669672 ..and they're here to stay.
3671209 3672617 I hear you, partner.
3672681 3673865 LA's finest are on it,...
3674089 3675433 ..so light 'em if you got 'em.
3676041 3678729 Way ahead of you, partner.
3679242 3681130 So what do I call you?
3682730 3683818 Call me...
3685610 3686410 ..Roy.
3686474 3690090 Listen up, Roy,<br />if you think of anything else...
3690155 3691275 ..don't be shy, OK?
3691371 3694283 In the meantime, find a safe place<br />and let us do our job.
3695243 3697452 They're all yours, Al.
3714188 3715437 Who's talking to 'em?
3716460 3719373 I am, sir.<br />Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
3719790 3721773 Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?
3721837 3723693 What do these pricks want?
3723757 3725806 If you mean the terrorists,...
3725869 3727854 ..we haven't heard a peep from them.
3727918 3729710 Who have you been talking to?
3730734 3733487 We don't know.<br />He won't give us his name.
3733550 3736078 But he appears to be<br />the one who phoned.
3736174 3739279 He's killed one terrorist for sure<br />and claims he capped off two others.
3739375 3740527 He claims?
3740623 3742736 Powell, has it occurred to you...
3742799 3745071 ..he could be<br />one of the terrorists pulling your chain...
3745167 3746831 ..or some nutcase in there?
3746928 3749871 I don't think so.<br />In fact, I think he's a cop,...
3749967 3752656 ..maybe not LAPD,<br />But he's definitely a badge.
3752720 3755856 - How do you know that?<br />- A hunch... things he said...
3755921 3758608 ..like being able to spot a phoney ID.
3758672 3760688 Jesus Christ, Powell!
3760784 3763152 He could be a fucking bartender<br />for all we know!
3763249 3764721 TV's here.
3765617 3767153 Oh, shit.
3767249 3768242 [horn honks]
3770193 3771762 [officers shouting]
3783474 3784882 I have a request.
3784979 3787699 What idiot put you in charge?
3787763 3789203 You did...
3789299 3791284 ..when you murdered my boss.
3791379 3793364 Now everybody's looking to me.
3793460 3795924 Personally, I'd pass on the job.
3796020 3799252 I don't enjoy being this close to you.
3806901 3808149 Go on.
3808245 3810133 We have a pregnant woman.
3810197 3813013 Relax. She's not due<br />for a couple weeks...
3813078 3816117 ..but sitting on that rock<br />isn't doing her back any good.
3816213 3819446 So I'd like permission to move her<br />to an office with a sofa.
3820822 3823574 No, but I'll have a sofa<br />brought out. Good enough?
3823639 3825014 Good enough.
3825559 3827030 And unless you like it messy,...
3827094 3829271 ..start bringing us<br />in groups to the bathroom.
3829335 3832279 Yes. You're right.
3833175 3834775 It will be done.
3834935 3836568 Was there something else?
3838903 3840408 No, thank you.
3846616 3849336 Mr Takagi<br />chose his people well, Mrs...?
3850232 3851192 Gennero.
3852856 3855321 Ms Gennero.
3857850 3860378 We interrupt this program<br />for a special news bulletin.
3860441 3863258 This is Richard Thornburg<br />live from Century City.
3863321 3866298 Tonight, Los Angeles has joined
3866393 3869306 the sad and worldwide<br />fraternity of cities
3869371 3871291 whose only membership requirement
3871387 3874330 is to suffer the anguish<br />of international terrorism.
3874427 3878619 Approximately two hours ago,<br />an unidentified group of men
3878683 3881244 seized control<br />of the Nakatomibuilding,
3881339 3883483 sealing off all entrances and exits.
3883579 3885403 All telephone lines have been cut
3885499 3887708 and the only communication<br />now possible
3887771 3890588 has been through the use<br />of CB communicators
3890652 3892924 which the group<br />apparently brought with them.
3893021 3894748 According to official sources,
3894812 3897340 the perpetrators of this building siege...
3897436 3900061 Unit five,<br />hold your position in the main entrance.
3900156 3902621 We got Charlie unit in position
3902685 3904190 by the parking structure.
3904253 3905981 Let me ask you something.
3906077 3908126 Does this stairway<br />go up to the escalator?
3908222 3909342 Yeah.
3909405 3911134 Tell them to go ahead.
3911838 3913438 What's going on?
3914142 3916222 What's it look like? We're going in.
3916319 3918974 Going in? Man, that's crazy!
3919070 3920926 There could be over 30 hostages<br />in there for all we know.
3921022 3922846 We don't know shit, Powell.
3922942 3926175 If there's hostages, how come<br />there were no ransom demands?
3926271 3929407 If there's terrorists in there,<br />where's their list of demands?
3929504 3931616 All we know is that<br />somebody shot your car up.
3931712 3933759 It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
3933824 3935775 you've been talking to on that radio.
3935872 3937472 Excuse me, sir,
3937536 3940704 but what about the body<br />that fell out the window?
3940800 3942496 Probably some stockbroker<br />got depressed.
3942593 3943681 We're ready, Chief.
3943745 3946017 - Light 'em up. Let's go.<br />- Hit your lights.
3946113 3948897 - Blue units, go.<br />- Lights on!
3960354 3961154 Powell?
3962594 3965186 Powell, you still with me, babe?<br />What's going on?
3965858 3967106 Yo, Al.
3967235 3969667 I'm here, Roy,<br />but I'm kind of busy right now.
3969731 3970819 I'll talk to you later.
3970915 3971811 Al, what's wrong?
3971907 3973507 I'll talk to you later.
3973572 3975555 If you are what I think you are,
3975619 3978083 you'll know when to listen,<br />shut up, and
3979491 3981380 and when to pray.
3981476 3983588 Jesus Christ!<br />You're coming in, right?
3983684 3984996 Christ, Powell,
3985060 3987013 I told you what kind of people<br />you're dealing with here.
3987109 3989317 Let's load them up.
3992580 3994949 They'll be coming.<br />Everyone get ready.
3995813 3998341 Theo, you are the eyes now.
4010311 4011559 - Rivers.<br />- Yo.
4011623 4014310 Begin your reconnoitre.
4014918 4016231 Let's go.
4019304 4020839 Shit!
4038985 4041161 Come on. Let's go.
4050762 4052394 Ow! Jesus!
4085069 4087405 All right, spread out.
4112239 4113775 Shut up.
4115471 4117295 Let's go.
4121744 4123601 You macho assholes. No! No!
4126448 4129137 Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.
4130449 4132529 'Twas the night before Christmas
4132593 4134513 and all through the house
4134609 4136946 not a creature was stirring, except
4137042 4139889 the four assholes<br />coming in the rear in standard
4139954 4141682 two-by-two cover formation.
4143986 4145235 We're all set.
4146547 4148370 We're ready.
4148530 4149810 Kick ass.
4149875 4150962 Go!
4151058 4153139 Right. Let's do it.
4167956 4169332 Take cover!
4169716 4171157 They're shooting at 'em.
4171253 4173204 It's panic fire.<br />They can't see anything.
4173300 4175093 They're shooting at the lights.
4179189 4182613 They're going after the lights.<br />Call them back.
4183541 4184886 It's not happening.
4184950 4186133 Mike, burn it.
4188278 4189910 Don't be impatient.
4190710 4192438 Just wound them.
4194358 4196790 Get them back.<br />They're sitting ducks without lights.
4196886 4198615 They're almost in.
4198679 4199799 Send in the car.
4199895 4201430 Send in the car.
4214264 4215577 Jesus Christ!
4218553 4221209 Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
4221304 4224089 Wait a minute.<br />What have we here, gentlemen?
4227961 4230522 The police have themselves an RV.
4235610 4236890 Southeast corner.
4249435 4251259 Oh, Jesus Christ.
4262684 4265308 Get back! Get the fuck back!
4267005 4268092 Get over there.
4268188 4269533 Schnell! Schnell!
4269597 4271645 Mach schnell!
4274398 4276189 Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!
4276254 4278045 Mach schnell! Mach schnell!
4278141 4279261 Weiter!
4282142 4283614 Mach los! Mach los!
4302816 4303744 I see him!
4314880 4316513 - Fire!<br />- Clear!
4322273 4325154 Oh, my God!<br />The quarterback is toast!
4325697 4328162 Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
4329378 4330306 Hit it again.
4330370 4332611 All right, you motherfucker,<br />you made your point!
4332707 4333507 Let them pull back!
4333571 4335971 Thank you, Mr Cowboy.<br />I'll take it under advisement.
4336066 4336418 Hit it
4336514 4337507 again.
4351172 4352420 Fire.
4366373 4368261 Fuck me.
4368357 4370790 Get them out of the car! They're burning!
4380615 4381223 Fuck it.
4383975 4385574 Mach schnell! Mach los!
4393159 4396616 Let's see you take this<br />under advisement, jerkweed.
4400200 4402120 Geronimo, motherfucker.
4420042 4421002 Oh, shit!
4426058 4427595 They're using artillery on us!
4427659 4429675 You idiot, it's not the police.
4430219 4431883 It's him.
4439051 4440299 Holy shit.
4445420 4446828 My God!
4448908 4451757 - Tell me you got that.<br />- I got it.
4453069 4455437 Eat your heart out, Channel Five.
4455501 4456781 We've had an update
4456877 4459309 on the terrorist takeover<br />of the Nakatomibuilding.
4459405 4461485 Sources say<br />the terrorist leader, Hans,
4461549 4463501 may be this man... Hans Gruber.
4463597 4466382 A member of the radical<br />West German Volksfreimovement.
4466477 4470126 Strangely, the Volksfreileadership<br />issued a communique an hour ago
4470190 4472879 stating that Gruber had been<br />expelled from that organisation.
4472943 4474959 Al, do you copy?
4475311 4476686 Are you all right?
4477551 4478863 Yeah, I'm fine.
4479951 4481232 W-what was that?
4481295 4484112 Remember that plastic<br />explosive I told you about?
4484175 4486992 There you go.<br />Is the building on fire?
4487055 4488784 No, but it's gonna need a paint job
4488880 4490448 and a shitload of screen doors.
4490512 4493168 Our spotter said you got two<br />with that blast.
4493232 4495665 - Is that him?<br />- Yes, sir.
4497233 4499793 I don't know who you think you are
4499889 4502225 but you just destroyed a building.
4502321 4505265 We do not want your help.<br />Is that clear?
4505361 4507121 We don't want your help.
4507186 4510162 I've got 100 people down here,<br />and they're covered with glass.
4510226 4513042 Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?
4513106 4514034 Who the fuck is this?
4515602 4518163 This is Deputy Chief of Police<br />Dwayne T Robinson
4518226 4520115 and I am in charge of this situation.
4520210 4521907 Oh, you're in charge?
4522003 4523923 I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.
4523986 4527155 From up here it doesn't look<br />like you're in charge of shit.
4527219 4529236 Listen to me, you little asshole...
4529299 4530099 Asshole?
4530196 4531923 I'm not the one<br />who just got buttfucked
4531987 4533747 on national TV, Dwayne.
4533843 4535028 Ah ha ha!
4535124 4536884 Listen to me, jerk-off,
4536948 4539828 if you're not part of the solution,<br />you're part of the problem.
4539924 4542933 Quit being part of the problem<br />and put the other guy back on!
4545620 4547285 Hey, Roy, how you feeling?
4547349 4549269 Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.
4549365 4551509 Hey, look. I love you.
4551605 4553813 So do a lot of the other guys.
4553878 4556374 So hang in there, man, you hear me?
4556437 4558262 You hang in there.
4559798 4562166 Yeah, thanks, partner.
4567831 4569175 What are you doing?
4569239 4570422 I'm tired of sitting here
4570519 4572503 waiting to see<br />who gets us killed first,
4572599 4574008 them or your husband.
4574487 4575991 What are you going to do?
4576087 4576888 Hey, babe,
4576951 4578775 I negotiate million-dollar deals<br />for breakfast.
4578840 4580631 I think I can handle this Eurotrash.
4581368 4584120 Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?
4584184 4586968 If you'd listened to me,<br />he would be neutralised already.
4587033 4588665 I don't want neutral. I want dead.
4590040 4591865 Hope I'm not interrupting.
4591961 4592953 What does he want?
4593049 4596569 It's not what I want.<br />It's what I can give you.
4603673 4605914 Look, let's be straight, OK?
4606010 4608442 It's obvious you're not<br />some dumb schmuck
4608538 4610458 up here to snatch a few purses.
4610522 4612091 You're very perceptive.
4612155 4613755 I watch "60 Minutes".
4613851 4616443 I say to myself,<br />these guys are professional,
4616507 4618843 they're motivated, they're happening,
4618939 4620444 they want something.
4620507 4623228 I couldn't care less<br />about your politics.
4623324 4625436 Maybe you're pissed off<br />at the camel jockeys.
4625532 4626940 Maybe it's the Hebes,<br />Northern Ireland.
4627004 4628316 It's none of my business.
4628412 4630652 I figure you're here<br />to negotiate, am I right?
4630716 4631804 You're amazing.
4631869 4634108 You figured this all out already?
4634204 4636253 Hey, business is business.
4636317 4638173 You use a gun,<br />I use a fountain pen.
4638237 4639452 What's the difference?
4639517 4640573 Let's put it in my terms.
4640637 4642013 You're here on a hostile takeover.
4642078 4643261 You grab us for some green
4643325 4646493 but you didn't expect some poison pill<br />was gonna be running around the building.
4646558 4647389 Am I right?
4647966 4648957 Hans,
4649534 4650558 bubbie...
4651038 4652734 I'm your white knight.
4653822 4656382 I must have missed "60 Minutes".
4656446 4657439 What are you saying?
4659774 4662847 The guy upstairs<br />who's fucking things up, huh?
4667040 4668927 I can give him to you.
4671488 4673472 Oh, God...
4675488 4677760 Roy? Roy, you all right?
4678976 4681889 Just trying to fire down<br />a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.
4682849 4684289 What do they put in these things,
4684384 4685184 anyway?
4685697 4687425 Sugar, enriched flour,
4687489 4689441 partially hydrogenated<br />vegetable oil,
4689537 4690882 polysorbate 60,
4690978 4692610 and yellow dye number five.
4692673 4695522 Just everything<br />a growing boy needs.
4696098 4697890 How many kids you got, Al?
4697986 4701859 As a matter of fact,<br />my wife is working on our first.
4701922 4703490 How about you, cowboy?
4703586 4705954 You got any kids<br />back on your ranch?
4707139 4708291 Yeah.
4708834 4709603 Two.
4710307 4711971 Sure hope I can see them
4712068 4714243 swinging on a jungle gym<br />with Al Jr. someday.
4716612 4718339 Well, now, that's a date
4718404 4720452 but you bring the ice cream.
4720900 4723044 [Hans] Touching, cowboy. Touching.
4723941 4725156 Or should I call you
4725253 4727300 Mr McClane?
4728581 4731141 Mr Officer John McClane
4731205 4733765 of the New York<br />Police Department?
4735301 4737445 Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
4737541 4739782 You better get a hold of somebody<br />at Dispatch.
4739846 4743142 Sister Theresa called me<br />Mr McClane in the third grade.
4743206 4745638 My friends call me John
4745734 4748422 and you're neither, shithead.
4748487 4752039 I have someone<br />who wants to talk to you.
4752135 4754727 A very special friend
4754822 4757287 who was with you<br />at the party tonight.
4763015 4765064 Hey, John boy.
4766312 4767688 Ellis?
4767944 4769224 Yeah.
4769288 4773097 Listen, John, they're giving me<br />a few minutes to talk sense into you.
4773161 4776104 I know you think you're doing your job<br />and I can appreciate that
4776169 4777833 but you're just dragging<br />this thing out.
4777897 4780809 Look, no-one gets out of here<br />until these guys
4780905 4782537 can talk to the LA Police.
4782633 4785865 That won't happen until you stop<br />messing up the works. Capisce?
4791178 4792874 Ellis, what have you told them?
4792938 4796874 I told them we were old friends<br />and you were my guest
4796939 4798347 at the party.
4799339 4801227 Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
4801291 4802507 Tell me about it.
4808843 4810507 All right, John, listen.
4810572 4813644 They want you to tell them<br />where the detonators are.
4813740 4815916 They know people are listening.
4815980 4819789 They want the detonators,<br />or they're gonna kill me.
4823181 4824557 John, didn't you hear me?
4826893 4828717 Yeah, I hear you.
4828781 4830573 John, get with the program.
4830670 4833134 The police are here now.<br />It's their problem.
4833230 4835662 Tell these guys where the detonators are<br />so no-one else gets hurt!
4835725 4838670 I'm putting my life<br />on the line for you, pal!
4838734 4840878 Ellis, listen to me carefully.
4840942 4841263 John...
4841327 4843247 Shut up, Ellis!<br />Just shut your mouth!
4843983 4845326 Put Hans back on the line.
4845423 4849839 Hans, this shithead doesn't know<br />what kind of man you are but I do.
4849903 4851823 Good. Then you'll<br />give us what we want
4851888 4853231 and save your friend's life.
4853296 4855439 You're not part of this equation.
4855504 4857711 Hey, what am I, a method actor?
4857776 4859312 Babe, put away the gun.
4859376 4860976 This is radio, not television.
4861072 4863057 Hans, this asshole is not my friend!
4863153 4864528 I just met him tonight!<br />I don't know him!
4864625 4866577 Jesus Christ, Ellis!<br />These people will kill you!
4866673 4868465 Tell them you don't know me!
4869553 4871857 How can you say that<br />after all these years?
4871953 4875345 John? John?
4898035 4899092 Do you hear that?
4899859 4902196 Talk to me!<br />Where are my detonators?
4902644 4905108 Where are they,<br />or shall I shoot another one?
4905172 4906388 Sooner or later
4906484 4908948 I might get to someone<br />you do care about.
4909524 4911988 Go fuck yourself, Hans.
4913140 4915157 He just let the guy die.
4915220 4917205 He just gave him up.<br />Give me that headset.
4917269 4919254 That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
4919350 4922870 Can't you see what's happening?<br />Can't you read between the lines?
4922965 4925142 He did everything he could<br />to save him.
4925238 4928214 If he gave himself up,<br />they'd both be dead right now!
4928310 4930871 No way, man. They'd be talking to us.
4930934 4934326 You tell this partner of yours<br />to stay out of this from now on.
4934390 4937302 Because if he doesn't,<br />I'm really going to nail his ass.
4937398 4939287 The man is hurting.
4939351 4940919 He is alone, tired,
4940984 4944503 and he hasn't seen diddly-squat<br />from anybody here!
4944599 4946999 You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn
4947063 4950104 about what you do to him<br />if he makes it out of there alive?
4950200 4952984 Why don't you wake up<br />and smell what you're shoveling?
4953080 4954584 You listen to me, sergeant.
4954680 4958041 Any time you want to go home,<br />you consider yourself dismissed.
4958105 4961304 No, sir.<br />You couldn't drag me away.
4961400 4963193 Attention, police.
4964313 4966298 Attention, police.
4966394 4969337 - This is Sergeant Al Powell...<br />- Give me that.
4969689 4971865 This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
4971961 4972825 Who is this?
4972921 4974394 This is Hans Gruber.
4975610 4978938 I assume you realise the futility<br />of direct action against me.
4979035 4980858 We have no wish<br />for further loss of life.
4980955 4983867 What is it you do wish for?
4983963 4988028 I have comrades in arms<br />around the world languishing in prison.
4988123 4991675 The American State Department<br />enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.
4991771 4993724 Now it can rattle it for me.
4995068 4998556 The following people<br />are to be released from their captors.
4999164 5002140 In Northern Ireland the seven members<br />of the New Provo Front.
5002236 5006684 In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders<br />of Liberte de Quebec.
5006749 5010557 In Sri Lanka, the nine members<br />of the Asian Dawn.
5010621 5012093 What the fuck?
5012157 5013917 Asian Dawn?
5014013 5016381 I read about them in "Time magazine".
5016478 5020221 When these revolutionary<br />brothers and sisters are free,
5020318 5023390 the hostages in this building<br />will be taken to the roof
5023486 5025727 and they will accompany us<br />in helicopters
5025790 5027966 to the Los Angeles<br />International Airport
5028031 5030559 where they will be given<br />further instructions.
5030623 5032447 You have two hours to comply.
5032511 5035839 Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.<br />This is crazy.
5035936 5039520 I don't have the authority.<br />Two hours is not enough.
5039583 5041792 Hello? Hello!
5043808 5046849 Did you get all that?<br />We got to make some calls.
5046912 5048961 Do you think they'll even try?
5049024 5050689 Who cares?
5053281 5055361 Theo, are we on schedule?
5055457 5057313 One more to go, then it's up to you.
5057410 5060673 You better be right<br />because the last one will take a miracle.
5060769 5062242 It's Christmas, Theo.
5062338 5064770 It's the time of miracles,<br />so be of good cheer
5064834 5067522 and call me<br />when you hit the last lock.
5068194 5069187 Karl,
5069283 5072803 hunt that little shit down<br />and get those detonators.
5072898 5074915 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5075010 5077571 I'll check the explosives.<br />You just get the detonators.
5077635 5079875 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5079971 5082531 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5083043 5086404 You gotta believe me.<br />There was nothing I could do.
5086468 5089892 Well, it's gonna be<br />both our asses if you're wrong.
5090404 5091877 I hear you.
5097573 5099877 Did you catch that bullshit<br />Hans was running?
5099973 5102405 It doesn't make sense, man.
5103685 5104965 Hey, don't ask me, man.
5105029 5107526 I'm just a desk jockey<br />who was on my way home when you rang.
5107590 5111078 The way you drove that car<br />I figured you for the street, Al.
5111174 5114022 In my youth. In my youth.
5114086 5117895 ..author of "Hostage Terrorist,<br />Terrorist Hostage,
5117958 5119078 A Study in Duality."
5119174 5120646 Dr Hasseldorf,
5120742 5122758 what can we expect<br />in the next few hours?
5122854 5123367 Well, Gail,
5123462 5125927 by this time,<br />the hostages should be going through
5125991 5128200 the early stages<br />of the Helsinki Syndrome.
5128295 5130055 As in Helsinki, Sweden.
5130120 5131655 Finland.
5131720 5135208 Basically, it's when the hostages<br />and the terrorists
5135304 5137800 go through a sort of<br />psychological transference
5137896 5139944 and a projection of dependency.
5140008 5142728 A strange sort of trust<br />and bond develops.
5142824 5145289 We've had situations<br />where the hostages
5145353 5147625 have embraced their captors<br />after release
5147689 5149929 and even corresponded with them<br />in prison.
5150121 5152810 No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.
5152873 5155722 D-A-W-N.
5155818 5157225 - Sir?<br />- Yeah?
5157290 5159146 Sir, the FBI is here.
5159210 5162858 - The FBI is here now?<br />- Yes, sir. Right over there.
5162923 5164010 Hold this.
5164298 5166443 Want a breath mint?
5170315 5172172 Hey, how you doing, man?
5172683 5175211 I'm Agent Johnson.<br />This is Special Agent Johnson.
5175307 5178507 - Oh, how you doing?<br />- No relation.
5178572 5179852 I'm, uh...
5181228 5184044 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.<br />I'm in charge here.
5184972 5186925 Not any more.
5239409 5242833 Hi, there. How you doing?
5246002 5247025 Ohh...
5248530 5251570 Please, God. No.<br />You're one of them, aren't you?
5251666 5253138 You're one of them.
5253234 5255986 No! Don't kill me! Please!
5256051 5258419 Don't kill me, please!<br />Please, please, please.
5258483 5261170 Whoa. Relax.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.
5261266 5262867 I'm not gonna hurt you!
5265299 5266868 Oh, God.
5270163 5271668 What the fuck<br />are you doing up here?
5271731 5273268 What were you looking for?
5273332 5275668 I managed to get out of there and
5275732 5278741 I was just trying<br />to get up on the roof
5278804 5281428 and see if I could signal for help.
5282869 5284916 It's just over here.<br />Why don't you come and help?
5284981 5287989 Hold it. Forget the roof.
5288661 5291382 I said forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5292757 5295062 You want to stay alive,<br />you stay with me.
5297814 5299767 The best we can figure it,
5299862 5303222 we've got maybe<br />30 or 35 hostages up there
5303318 5305142 probably on the 30th floor
5305238 5308695 and maybe seven or eight<br />terrorists up there.
5308791 5310871 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5310936 5313271 Thank you.<br />We'll handle it from here.
5313335 5316055 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5316151 5318008 Aren't you forgetting something?
5318104 5319064 Such as?
5319127 5320760 What about John McClane?
5320824 5323832 He's the reason<br />we have any information.
5323896 5327384 He's also the reason<br />you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.
5327480 5329688 He's inside? Who is he?
5329785 5332569 He might be a cop.<br />We're checking on that.
5332665 5335225 - One of yours?<br />- No, no way.
5340538 5341369 You smoke?
5342874 5344314 Yeah.
5348827 5349979 Thanks.
5353690 5356475 You don't work for Nakatomi.
5360571 5362299 And if you're not one of them...
5365340 5366748 I'm a cop from New York.
5368540 5370076 New York?
5370140 5371196 Yeah.
5372060 5374781 Got invited to<br />the Christmas party by mistake.
5374876 5376093 Who knew?
5383581 5385885 Better than being caught<br />with your pants down, huh?
5395263 5396671 I'm John McClane.
5397951 5399391 You're, uh...
5400703 5401791 Clay.
5404191 5405472 Bill Clay.
5411360 5413344 Know how to use a handgun, Bill?
5414720 5416640 I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
5416705 5418880 That game with the guns<br />that shoot red paint.
5418944 5421121 Probably seems kind of stupid to you.
5422465 5423649 Nope.
5426593 5428353 Time for the real thing, Bill.
5436546 5438722 All you got to do<br />is pull the trigger.
5439395 5439970 Come on.
5458596 5460036 Put down the gun
5460132 5462724 and give me my detonators.
5466948 5468325 Well, well, well...
5470181 5471205 Hans.
5472197 5474629 Put it down now.
5478086 5480646 That's pretty tricky<br />with that accent.
5480710 5483911 You oughta be on fucking TV<br />with that accent.
5486791 5490279 But what do you want<br />with the detonators?
5490342 5492903 I already used all the explosives.
5495143 5496455 Or did I?
5497831 5499399 I'm going to count to three.
5499495 5501800 Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?
5502888 5503527 Oops.
5505352 5506632 No bullets.
5506728 5509673 What do you think...<br />I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
5509768 5510793 You were saying?
5563245 5563725 Karl.
5564653 5565805 Schieß dem Fenster.
5573070 5574926 Shoot the glass!
5606929 5608369 Jesus Christ!
5636403 5639252 Smile, Karl.<br />We're back in business.
5641812 5644692 ..is the last resort of diplomacy,
5644756 5647700 then couldn't we just as well say
5647764 5650580 that terrorism has an equal claim<br />on being that, too?
5651253 5653301 Tell me you got something.
5653365 5657173 McClane's name, badge number,<br />employment record, vital statistics,
5657237 5658613 and his family's home address
5658709 5660566 right here in LA.
5662902 5663606 Whoo!
5668982 5670102 Go to work.
5670294 5672022 Got it.
5683639 5686776 God, that man looks really pissed.
5689016 5690936 He's still alive.
5691288 5692248 What?
5693592 5697368 Only John can drive<br />somebody that crazy.
5711610 5714554 Hans, you better heat up that miracle
5714618 5716698 because we just broke through<br />on number six
5716794 5719387 and the electromagnetic<br />came down like a fucking anvil.
5719450 5724571 Have a look at what our friends<br />outside are doing and I'll be right up.
5726907 5728028 Hey, John.
5728092 5730427 John McClane, you still with us?
5730491 5731579 Yeah.
5732347 5736028 But all things being equal,<br />I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5736572 5738620 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5738940 5741629 The boys down here<br />will be glad to hear that.
5742460 5744253 We got a pool going on you.
5744349 5746141 What kind of odds am I getting?
5746236 5747805 You don't want to know.
5747901 5749277 Put me down for 20.
5749341 5750461 I'm good for it.
5754237 5756797 Hey, pal, you got flatfeet?
5759166 5761310 What the hell<br />are you talking about, man?
5761374 5763711 Something had<br />to get you off the street.
5763774 5764927 What's the matter?
5765023 5768127 You don't think jockeying papers<br />across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?
5769983 5771199 No.
5774495 5776448 I had an accident.
5776544 5778752 The way you drive, I can see why.
5778816 5779552 What'd you do ?
5779616 5782111 Run over your captain's foot<br />with the car?
5785824 5786976 I shot a kid.
5788513 5790273 He was 13 years old.
5791457 5793441 Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.
5793505 5795361 He had a ray gun, looked real enough.
5798466 5802081 When you're a rookie, they teach you<br />everything about being a cop
5802146 5803938 except how to live with a mistake.
5807779 5811971 Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself<br />to draw my gun on anybody again.
5815299 5816579 Sorry, man.
5818019 5820612 Hey, man, how could you know?
5822851 5824611 I feel like shit anyway.
5827491 5829028 Well, then, this won't matter.
5829124 5833668 The LAPD is not calling the shots<br />down here any more.
5836036 5837157 The Feds?
5837669 5838725 You got it.
5840229 5842437 Those are the city engineers.
5843589 5844325 Wait.
5845093 5846918 They're going into the street circuits.
5846982 5849894 Those guys in the suits,<br />I don't know who they are.
5849990 5850854 That's the FBI.
5851750 5855206 They're ordering the others<br />to cut the building's power.
5855271 5857191 Regular as clockwork.
5858951 5860455 Or a time lock.
5860967 5862631 Precisely.
5862727 5866407 The circuits that cannot be cut<br />are cut automatically
5866471 5869095 in response to a terrorist incident.
5869191 5871240 You asked for miracles, Theo.
5871303 5875304 I give you the F-B-I.
5875400 5877224 I want the building shut down.
5877320 5879400 I got a problem. I got a switch...
5879464 5883305 I don't care<br />about your switch. I want it out. Dark!
5884233 5885705 You can't do it from here.
5885801 5888105 - Yeah, you could.<br />- It can't be done from here.
5888201 5889801 I could just... I got the radio...
5889865 5893226 You can't do it from here.<br />It's got to be done from downtown.
5893322 5895018 They've gotta take out<br />a whole city grid.
5895113 5897002 We're talking 10 square blocks.
5897066 5898826 Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.
5898922 5901386 It's Christmas Eve.<br />There's thousands of people.
5901482 5903083 You have to go wider.
5903146 5908042 - I need authorisation.<br />- How about the United States government?
5908107 5910123 Lose the grid, or you lose your job.
5916043 5917740 - Yeah, Central?<br />- Yeah?
5917836 5920076 This is Walt down at Nakatomi.
5920172 5924876 Would it be possible for you<br />to turn off grid 212?
5924972 5926029 Are you crazy?!
5926125 5928685 Maybe I should call the Mayor.
5928749 5931725 No shit it's my ass.<br />I got a big problem here.
5931789 5934062 Shut it down now.
5937230 5939406 Emergency lighting activated.
5939950 5942670 Al, talk to me. What's going on here?
5942766 5944238 Ask the FBI.
5944334 5946958 They got the universal<br />terrorist playbook
5947054 5949359 and they're running it step by step.
5951406 5953231 It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
5954959 5956303 Yes!
5978225 5979633 Merry Christmas.
5981106 5984145 They must be pissing in their pants.
5984242 5986034 The Mayor is gonna have my ass.
5992754 5994035 Whoo!
6006483 6008659 What are we gonna do now?
6008724 6011604 Arrest them for not paying<br />their electric bill?
6011700 6013396 We've shut them down.
6013492 6016756 We let them sweat for a while,<br />then we give them helicopters.
6016852 6018964 Right up the ass.
6021461 6022933 This is Agent Johnson.
6022997 6024341 No, the other one.
6024405 6027573 I want that air support ready<br />to lift off in five minutes.
6027637 6030966 Damn right. Fully armed.<br />We're on the way.
6036662 6038486 Oh, yes!
6040119 6042455 I wish to talk to the FBI.
6044919 6046967 This is Special Agent Johnson.
6047063 6051319 The State Department has arranged<br />for the return of your comrades.
6051415 6053943 Helicopters are en route<br />as you requested.
6054008 6055288 I hear you. We'll be ready.
6055351 6058584 By the time he figures out<br />what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.
6058648 6060440 When they touch down,<br />we'll blow the roof.
6060536 6062200 They'll spend a month<br />sifting through the rubble.
6062296 6065112 By the time they figure out<br />what went wrong,
6065208 6068217 we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.
6072889 6074329 Ah! Jeez!
6074394 6075417 Powell?
6076217 6077978 Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
6079642 6081274 I'm here, John.
6082938 6085850 Listen, I'm starting to get<br />a bad feeling up here.
6086426 6088283 I want you to do something for me.
6088379 6089562 Um... ahem...
6091035 6092443 I want you to find my wife.
6092538 6094812 Don't ask me how.<br />By then you'll know how.
6094875 6098140 Uh, I want you<br />to tell her something.
6099675 6101276 I want you to tell her that...
6107932 6110492 Tell her it took me<br />a while to figure out
6110588 6112445 what a jerk I've been
6113116 6114333 but, um...
6115933 6116893 that...
6120605 6123229 that when things started<br />to pan out for her
6123294 6127166 I should have been more supportive.
6127614 6128446 And, uh...
6129886 6132703 I just should have been<br />behind her more.
6135390 6136575 Oh, shit.
6139135 6141152 Tell her that, um
6142015 6146400 that she's the best thing<br />that ever happened to a bum like me.
6148256 6151584 She's heard me say "I love you"<br />a thousand times.
6152704 6155968 She never heard me say I'm sorry.
6156576 6162529 I want you to tell her that, Al.<br />Tell her that John said that he was sorry.
6163841 6164865 OK?
6165761 6166881 You got that, man?
6166977 6169186 Yeah, I got it, John.
6170434 6172066 But you can tell her that yourself.
6172129 6176482 You just watch your ass<br />and you'll make it out. You hear me?
6176994 6179491 I guess that's up to the man upstairs.
6182755 6184162 John?
6184963 6186371 John?
6186819 6190212 What the fuck<br />were you doing upstairs, Hans?
6191780 6192772 John?
6192868 6195844 No, Al, listen.<br />Just lay off for a while.
6197764 6200421 I gotta go check on something.
6202916 6205509 One minute, that's all I'm asking.
6205573 6207365 One minute to speak to them.
6207461 6209413 All right. Get back. Get back.
6209509 6211781 All right, look.
6211846 6215845 You let me in right now,<br />or I call the INS, comprende?
6218342 6220582 This is the last time<br />these kids are gonna have
6220646 6222694 to speak to their parents.
6224294 6225383 All right?
6225702 6227751 All right. Come on. Come on.
6237416 6238728 What were you doing, Hans?
6239495 6240936 What were you doing?
6262378 6265482 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6268747 6271275 Al, listen to me!<br />It's a double-cross!
6271338 6272906 The roof is wired to...
6275499 6276491 John?
6278795 6280268 John!
6280587 6281867 John, come in!
6282380 6283403 Did you get that?
6283467 6286347 Something about a double-cross.
6286443 6288652 Tell me about it.
6294124 6296269 We are both professionals.
6298316 6299917 This is personal.
6301229 6302541 Aww...
6322543 6324879 They're coming!
6325391 6326991 Choppers are coming.
6327279 6330480 Time to gather your flock,<br />Miss Gennero.
6330544 6334480 Your mom and dad<br />are very important people.
6334543 6336432 They're very brave people.
6336528 6340368 Is there something you'd like<br />to say to them, if they're watching?
6340432 6343473 Come home.
6351601 6352882 Mrs McClane.
6355986 6359186 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6362290 6364210 On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
6364274 6366834 Lock them up there<br />and come right back.
6392725 6395605 You should have heard<br />your brother squeal
6395669 6398710 when I broke his fucking neck!
6401846 6404118 What do you figure the breakage?
6404182 6406262 I figure we take out the terrorists,
6406358 6409206 lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.
6409942 6412278 I can live with that.
6412374 6413686 Get this thing on the deck.
6413751 6417079 They're expecting transports,<br />not gunships.
6428600 6430360 Move it! Come on! Move!
6430456 6431961 Come on! Come on!
6432024 6433240 Move it!
6434393 6435609 Go! Move!
6439321 6440249 Theo.
6440762 6442297 A little bonus for us.
6442361 6444281 Please, sit down. Sit down!
6444346 6446970 A policeman's wife<br />might come in handy.
6447033 6449434 McClane, I have some news for you.
6450426 6451674 McClane?
6462683 6463931 Move!
6466491 6467195 Come on!
6479517 6481725 Motherfucker! I'll kill you!
6485501 6486525 Armed.
6486973 6488925 - The truck?<br />- The truck.
6495806 6499679 After all your posturing,<br />all your little speeches,
6499774 6502047 you're nothing but a common thief.
6502238 6504638 I am an exceptional thief,<br />Mrs McClane.
6504735 6506239 And since I'm moving up<br />to kidnapping,
6506335 6508255 you should be more polite.
6515007 6517056 You motherfucker,<br />I'm gonna kill you!
6517119 6520448 I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,<br />and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!
6542146 6544130 I don't like this, Sarge.
6551523 6557219 Yee-hah!<br />Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?
6558691 6561443 I was in Junior High, dickhead.
6588230 6589606 Where's Holly?
6589702 6591110 Where's Holly Gennero?
6591174 6593223 Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?
6593286 6595046 Where's Holly? Where is she?
6595143 6596518 - They took her!<br />- Where?
6596614 6597767 The vault!
6597863 6599687 - Where is the vault?<br />- The 30th floor!
6599783 6601607 They just took her!
6601831 6602887 Get downstairs!
6602983 6605383 The whole fucking roof<br />is wired to blow!
6605448 6606983 Get down!
6607048 6609544 Get down!<br />Get the fuck downstairs!
6611656 6614408 They made us, Bureau.<br />Terrorist shooting hostages.
6614504 6616136 Break left!
6622121 6623753 Nail that sucker!
6631529 6634474 I'm on your side, you assholes!
6634538 6637546 Swing around again!<br />I'll bag this little bastard.
6655660 6657420 What the fuck...
6659308 6662060 Oh, John,<br />what the fuck are you doing?
6662156 6664909 How the fuck<br />did you get into this shit?
6674509 6677773 There's something wrong!<br />They're coming back down!
6677869 6679950 - Blow the roof.<br />- But Karl's up there!
6680014 6681390 Blow the roof!
6684494 6687278 I promise I will never even think
6687342 6690223 about going up<br />in a tall building again.
6693423 6695663 Oh, God, please don't let me die!
6783543 6785943 Holy Christ!
6787063 6789592 We're gonna need<br />some more FBI guys, I guess.
6801848 6803544 Jesus fucking Christ!
6804473 6805561 Fuck!
6828955 6831386 What the fuck is going on?
6833211 6836636 What are you gonna do?<br />Sit here while the building falls down?
6844636 6845468 Shit!
6845564 6847356 All right!
6848765 6849917 Hey! Hey!
6850844 6852573 Hang on, baby.
6852637 6854141 Hang on, honey.
6855165 6856157 Oh, God.
6899456 6901089 Hans!
6915011 6916675 Jesus.
6916771 6919874 Hi, honey.
6940100 6943876 So that's what this is all about?<br />A fucking robbery?
6944325 6945477 Put down the gun.
6947109 6949317 Why'd you have to nuke<br />the whole building, Hans?
6949413 6952325 Well, when you steal $600,<br />you can just disappear.
6952421 6955301 When you steal 600 million,<br />they will find you
6955366 6957574 unless they think<br />you're already dead.
6957638 6959686 Put down the gun.
6969735 6971335 Nein. This is mine.
6974440 6976200 You got me.
6976296 6978951 Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.
6979047 6980648 Americans... all alike.
6980712 6984520 This time, John Wayne does not walk off<br />into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
6984616 6986376 That was Gary Cooper, asshole.
6986440 6988169 Enough jokes.
6988265 6991017 You'd have made a pretty<br />good cowboy yourself, Hans.
6991080 6995562 Oh, yes. What was it<br />you said to me before?
6995657 6999242 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7019531 7019979 Holly!
7025836 7027308 Happy trails, Hans.
7032557 7034125 - Aah!<br />- Holly.
7070128 7071920 I hope that's not a hostage.
7099186 7103026 Gimme water hook-ups<br />for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.
7106546 7108115 Over here. It's a better angle.
7108179 7110035 Let's give them a hand.
7112563 7115508 Keep it going, now. Keep it going.
7120340 7123828 - Come on. We're going to miss it!<br />- OK. Hand me my notes!
7145910 7149814 What was it like in there?<br />How did they treat you?
7194138 7195834 Al, this is my wife Holly.
7195898 7197754 Holly Gennero.

7206428 7207867 McClane!
7207963 7210556 McClane, I want a debriefing!
7210620 7213180 You got some things<br />to answer for, mister.
7213276 7214940 Ellis' murder, for one thing.
7215036 7218621 Property damage,<br />interfering with police business.
7257344 7260320 Two of you go inside<br />and see if there's anybody else!
7270625 7273121 No. This one's with me.
7282626 7284194 Mr McClane, Mr McClane!
7284290 7286723 Now that it's all over,<br />after this incredible ordeal,
7286787 7288674 what are your feelings?
7293731 7295076 Well, well, well.
7295139 7299235 - Merry Christmas, Argyle.<br />- Merry Christmas.
7302628 7303620 Did you get that?
7303716 7305636 Let me through.
7306116 7309508 If this is their idea of Christmas,<br />I gotta be here for New Year's.
