1395268 1396603 Things you probably<br />already have six of,

1875874 1877041 That was creepy.
1877750 1879419 I tried to find more Nixon.
1880461 1881462 Think they bought it?
1882255 1883423 Absolutely.
1884299 1886718 (siren blares in distance)
1886801 1890221 Okay, I want telecom,<br />transportation, any and every...
1890305 1891931 Jesus Christ,<br />it's a fire sale.
1892015 1893099 What?
1894142 1895852 It's a fire sale.
1896185 1897979 Hey. We don't know that yet.
1898062 1899731 Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.<br />Can't be done.
1899814 1900982 Oh, it's a myth? Really?
1901441 1903526 Please tell me she's only here<br />for show and she's actually not
1903610 1905445 -in charge of anything.<br />-Hey. What's a fire sale?
1906279 1908197 It's a three-step...<br />It's a three-step
1908281 1910742 systematic attack on the entire<br />national infrastructure.
1910825 1911910 Okay, step one:
1911993 1913453 take out<br />all the transportation.
1913536 1915163 Step two: the financial base<br />and telecoms.
1915246 1917206 Step three: you get rid<br />of all the utilities,
1917290 1919167 gas, water, electric, nuclear.
1919334 1920919 Pretty much anything<br />that's run by computers,
1921002 1923254 which, which, today<br />is almost everything.
1924005 1925340 So that's why they<br />call it a fire sale,
1925423 1926549 because everything must go.
1927050 1928092 Hey, l-listen, listen.
1928176 1929552 What's your name? Farrell?
1930261 1931638 Keep your voice down, okay?
1931721 1933723 No one here's talking<br />about a fire sale.
1933973 1936726 Not unless you're telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1937268 1939854 (scoffs) What? No, man,<br />I'm just saying...
1940104 1941481 -to explain--<br />-Appreciate your concern.
1941564 1943232 We know what we're doing,<br />we're on it. Thank you.
1943316 1945526 -Yeah, you've done a bang-up job so far.<br />-What?
1945610 1946527 -I...<br />-What?
1946611 1948071 Nothing. I get...<br />I said I understand.
1949280 1952158 Hey. They didn't send<br />the Girl Scouts out to get this kid.
1952617 1955203 They sent professional guys,<br />full tactical gear.
1955286 1956412 They blew<br />the whole joint up.
1956496 1958081 Now, look,<br />I don't know this kid.
1958456 1960458 And frankly, I don't<br />give a shit. No offense.
1961376 1962794 But somebody wants<br />this kid dead.
1963795 1965254 And obviously,<br />it's got something to do
1965338 1966756 with whatever<br />is going on here.
1968174 1969926 Okay.<br />Homeland's taking over
1970009 1971761 the interrogation of the hackers<br />we're bringing in.
1971844 1973262 I'll get you an escort<br />over there.
1973680 1974681 All right?
1974764 1976307 Molina, get this kid<br />to the front of the line.
1977016 1978226 I want to know<br />what he knows.
1978309 1979310 MOLINA: Right.
1980019 1981479 If that guy knew<br />half the shit that I know,
1981562 1983106 his fuzzy<br />little head would explode.
1983898 1985942 Special Agent Johnson.<br />We'll take the sedan.
1986192 1987443 Agent Johnson?
1987527 1988444 That's right.
1988903 1989946 Right this way.
1990029 1990989 Great.
1992365 1994742 So, is any of that actually possible,<br />what you were saying back there?
1994826 1997078 Is it possible? Here, look,<br />I'm gonna tell you again.
1997161 1999497 You take out any one thing,<br />the system can recover, right?
1999580 2002208 If you take it all down at once,<br />the system crashes and...
2002750 2004085 Look around, man.
2004877 2006546 Come on.<br />Government's got to have
2006629 2008673 dozens of departments<br />dedicated to that shit.
2009590 2012510 It took FEMA five days<br />to get water to the Superdome.
2012593 2013636 (car engines starting)
2017598 2020143 (clamoring)
2026024 2027942 (car horns honking)
2035700 2036868 (indistinct radio chatter)
2036951 2038411 How long<br />till we get to DHS?
2039579 2041831 Laughlin, get on<br />the DC police band,
2041914 2043499 <i>and get 'em to clear</i><br /><i>a route to DHS for us.</i>
2044667 2047336 DC Metro, this is the FBI,<br />requesting you to clear a route...
2047420 2049297 (garbled voices)
2051340 2053134 Farrell just resurfaced<br />on the grid.
2054427 2055762 Feds are taking him to Homeland.
2055845 2057805 Good. Close that loop now.
2058347 2059515 Isolate the frequency.
2059640 2061059 Get us a location<br />on the vehicles
2061142 2062894 and pull me up a file<br />on this John McClane.
2064312 2065980 WOMAN (over radio):<br /><i>Rand, we just found Farrell.</i>
2066064 2067148 <i>Stand by for a location.</i>
2067231 2068691 (whistle blowing)
2071402 2073112 Look, I don't mean<br />to harp, guys,
2073196 2075573 but we just passed another<br />Arby's and I'm starving.
2075656 2077075 -I-I could eat a wrapper.<br />-Later. Shut up.
2077158 2078493 -You don't even have to order.<br />-Shut up.
2078576 2080036 I'll just run and get<br />some ketchup packets.
2080119 2081037 Shut up.
2081120 2083706 You got about 14 minutes<br />to tell me why you lied to me back there.
2084040 2086209 Lied to you?<br />What are you talking about?
2086292 2088252 The pictures on the wall,<br />you knew those guys, right?
2088920 2091464 -I don't... I...<br />-Kid, don't lie to me.
2091756 2093257 I'm a cop,<br />I can tell you're lying.
2093800 2094717 Who were they?
2097720 2098721 Okay.
2099347 2100264 Okay, okay.
2103059 2104393 They were my competition.
2108231 2110483 -Make the next right onto Concord.<br />-(static crackles)
2110566 2112610 They said they were a software firm<br />that had developed
2112693 2114112 a mutating encryption algorithm,
2114195 2116030 and they just wanted<br />to see if it could be cracked.
2116447 2119033 That's what I do. I do.<br />I-I do math-based security.
2124247 2126332 Here's the thing, the thing that<br />I've been thinking about is,
2126415 2127959 if you're gonna pull<br />something as-as massive
2128042 2129961 and crazy as a fire sale,<br />you'd need tons
2130044 2131587 of start-up guys<br />to write the programs,
2131671 2133464 but only a few black hats<br />to actually implement it,
2133548 2135508 so then at that point,<br />the start-up guys,
2135591 2138261 the guys who haven't really<br />done anything wrong, like me...
2138344 2140346 Would end up as pictures<br />on some guy's wall.
2140763 2142140 I swear to God, McClane.
2142348 2143307 I swear to you,
2143391 2145184 I had no idea I was gonna be...
2146602 2148729 an accessory<br />to-to-to Armageddon.
2149814 2151607 Take the next left<br />at Lexington.
2151732 2153234 Man, that's a sexy voice.
2154402 2155778 What's she taking us<br />this way for?
2155862 2157613 <i>-Unit 510, this is dispatch.</i><br />-Oh, my God.
2157697 2159407 Clear a route for<br />two FBI vehicles
2159490 2160616 approaching on Concord.
2160950 2161909 Copy, Dispatch.
2162243 2163744 <i>-FBI, we've cleared a path.</i><br />-That's her.
2163828 2165121 -Her who?<br /><i>-Proceed to the corner...</i>
2165204 2166122 What are you talking about?
2166205 2167206 (siren beeping)
2167915 2168749 FARRELL: It's them.
2168833 2170209 McCLANE:<br />You're saying it's "them" them?
2170293 2172003 FARRELL:<br />I swear to you, I know her.
2172461 2173921 I would know<br />her voice anywhere.
2175715 2176674 Don't say anything, don't...
2176757 2178092 Just keep your mouth shut<br />for a minute.
2180178 2182471 Hey, Metro, how's your day<br />going over there?
2182555 2184640 <i>Yeah, got to be pretty, uh,</i><br /><i>crazy over there,</i>
2184724 2186684 <i>what with all those 587s, huh?</i>
2187310 2189312 Yes, sir.<br />We've had to dispatch all units.
2191397 2192857 Yeah, you had<br />to dispatch all units
2192940 2194525 for all the naked people<br />walking around?
2195818 2198154 Cut the bullshit, honey,<br />and just put your boss on.
2201365 2202950 Laughlin,<br />we're getting off this route.
2203034 2204368 <i>Make a left here on 14th Street.</i>
2207830 2209248 (steady beeping)
2213586 2215046 Officer McClane.
2215504 2217131 It's Detective McClane, asshole.
2217506 2218841 Don't worry, though,<br />we're gonna have
2218925 2220384 plenty of time<br />to get to know each other
2220468 2221761 <i>when I come</i><br /><i>visit you in prison.</i>
2223012 2226182 But, John, I already know<br />so much about you.
2226766 2229727 Your address in Brooklyn,<br />the payments on your mortgage,
2230186 2232813 <i>how long you've been</i><br /><i>a member of the NYPD.</i>
2233522 2234482 And how's Holly?
2234982 2237151 Oh, that's sad.<br />You're divorced.
2237235 2239153 Was that tough<br />on little Jack and Lucy?
2241364 2243491 Now, this is sad,<br />after 30 years, I thought
2243574 2244909 <i>you'd have a better</i><br /><i>pension plan annuity</i>
2244992 2246077 <i>than what I see here.</i>
2246827 2248746 Oh, and it gets worse.
2251832 2254043 Your 401k<br />no longer exists.
2255336 2256963 Tell you what.<br />Let me make it up to you.
2257546 2258881 Box them in<br />at that intersection.
2259882 2262551 Shoot Mr. Farrell<br />in the head and drive away,
2262635 2264887 and by the time you reach<br />the end of the next block,
2265596 2267390 <i>all your debts</i><br /><i>will be wiped clean,</i>
2267974 2270059 <i>and your children</i><br /><i>will be set for life.</i>
2271352 2272895 Well, now that really<br />is tempting,
2272979 2274355 especially that last part.
2274855 2276607 But I think I'm gonna<br />have to pass, jerkoff.
2279110 2280027 John...
2280778 2283197 you're a Timex watch<br />in a digital age.
2283281 2284282 <i>You're gonna lose.</i>
2285408 2287159 McCLANE (sighs):<br />Yeah, well, the other thing
2287243 2289078 that could happen is,<br />I could come and find you,
2289161 2291372 kick your ass and throw you<br />out of your own party.
2291455 2292790 <i>What do you think</i><br /><i>about that, dickhead?</i>
2292873 2294166 Hold your position.

2693857 2695275 -Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry.<br />-Don't touch me.
2695734 2696610 Are you okay?
2696694 2697695 Oh, my God.
2697778 2699196 (crash in distance)
2700656 2701740 Pretty lucky shot, huh?
2702116 2703158 Yeah, lucky.
2703242 2706495 That was... You just killed<br />that helicopter with a car.
2706578 2708122 I was out of bullets.
2708789 2709790 (laughs)
2709873 2711208 (laughs weakly)
2711667 2712793 How you doing?
2713043 2714837 I-I skinned my knee,<br />and my asthma's acting up
2714920 2716380 -a little bit, but...<br />-(laughs)
2717339 2719133 Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
2719258 2721760 McCLANE: I'm getting too old<br />to jump out of cars.
2732354 2733689 GABRIEL (over radio):<br /><i>Rand, check in.</i>
2735524 2736859 (speaking French)<br />The chopper's down...
2737276 2738527 What about Farrell and McClane?
2738652 2739737 (coughs)
2740529 2741780 (speaking French)<br />They're history.
2742197 2743115 Come back in.
2743449 2745492 Okay, we're moving on.<br />Begin stage three.
2745576 2748996 I just spoke to Emerson.<br />The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
2749079 2750205 Very good.

2774605 2777524 Anthrax alarms only went off<br />on five floors.

2779443 2780402 (beeps)
2780611 2782321 I don't know why you'd<br />need to go any further.
2782404 2784114 There's nothing down there<br />but servers.

2858730 2860732 -(grunts)<br />-Hey, this is absurd.
2861108 2862985 Man, there's tough<br />and there's stupid.
2863318 2865863 You got to go to a hospital.<br />Look at you.
2866989 2868991 I'm not a doctor, but you<br />look like you're hurt.

2871076 2871952 Come on.
2872744 2874580 McCLANE: We don't need a doctor.<br />We need the cops.
2891013 2893432 (whirring)

3101807 3103767 the phones, power grids,<br />water, nuclear.
3105268 3107187 -Hey, excuse me--<br />-Jack Parry, NSA.
3107395 3110565 Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.<br />White House made the call.
3110649 3112275 Anything you need,<br />we're here to help.
3112359 3113235 Help?
3113318 3114861 Wow, that's... That's great.
3114945 3117489 We're gonna need some<br />work space for our people.
3117572 3118740 What can you do for us?
3119699 3121993 Well, as you can see,<br />we're using the space.
3122077 3123537 So you guys can stand<br />in the corner,
3123620 3124746 and, uh, liaise.
3124830 3126039 If I need something,
3126998 3128083 I'll just wave to you.
3135215 3137592 (truck engine rumbling)
3150814 3152357 -Wait. No, no. Don't-don't-don't call.<br />-What?
3152440 3154901 -What? What are you talking about?<br />-They probably cracked that hours ago.
3154985 3156695 If you use it, they might be able<br />to trace us here.
3156778 3157737 Just put it in your pocket.
3157821 3158864 -You sure?<br />-Yes.
3159447 3161658 Or... smash it.<br />You didn't have to smash it.
3163160 3164327 -Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />-Hey! Hey!
3164411 3165495 It's a police emergency.
3165579 3166955 He'll call you right back.
3168790 3170000 Here. Right in here.<br />Come here.
3171543 3172919 -You got a signal?<br />-Yeah.

3175714 3177382 This is John McClane<br />for Agent Bowman.
3178383 3179968 Sir, John McClane<br />is on the line.
3181970 3184181 -McClane, go.<br />-We never made it to DHS.

3192647 3193523 MAN: Sir?

3334998 3337584 I wrote one little piece of code<br />and the world falls apart.
3337917 3340420 (scoffs) This is<br />virtual terrorism.
3340503 3342130 -What?<br />-You know, it's crazy,
3342297 3344632 first I time I heard<br />of the concept of a fire sale,
3345508 3347177 I actually thought<br />it would be cool
3347260 3348720 if anyone ever really did it.
3349721 3352140 Just... hit the reset button.
3353141 3355143 Melt the system just for fun.
3355518 3357354 Hey, it's not a system.
3357854 3358897 It's a country.
3358980 3359981 You're talking about people.
3360065 3362025 All right? A whole<br />country full of people.
3362359 3364235 Sitting at home, alone,<br />scared to death
3364319 3365779 in their houses, all right?
3365820 3367697 So if you're done with<br />your little nostalgic moment,
3367781 3370492 maybe you can think a little bit<br />and help me catch these guys.
3371034 3372035 Yeah.
3372577 3373578 Just help me.
3373870 3375705 Just put yourself<br />in their shoes.
3377374 3378333 -Come on.<br />-Okay, okay.
3378416 3380335 If this were your fire sale,<br />you were running this thing,
3380418 3381419 what would be your next move?
3381503 3382712 Okay, uh...
3384089 3385298 Well, the whole point<br />of a fire sale
3385382 3387217 is that it-it's mostly<br />done by remote, right?
3387300 3390011 But... But not everything<br />is run completely online.
3390095 3392305 Uh, uh, major utilities aren't.
3392389 3395225 They're run by closed-circuit,<br />so you could breach the security
3395308 3397394 up to a certain point, but, um,
3397477 3399187 to shut it down, you'd have<br />to physically go there.
3399270 3401398 You'd have to show up,<br />right, and-and, uh...
3403316 3404609 You know what?<br />Give me that guy's PDA.
3404692 3406027 The phones don't work.<br />They're all dead.
3406111 3408405 No, the phones are fine.<br />It's the network that's dead.
3408488 3409781 I've just gotta reprogram it
3409864 3411449 and link it<br />into the old SATCOMs.
3411950 3413159 Hackers surf 'em all the time.
3413451 3414828 That's probably<br />what these guys are using
3414911 3416162 to talk to each other.
3416246 3417414 How do you know all this stuff?
3418081 3419082 Dude, I don't know.
3419165 3420917 (stammering) There's a lot<br />rattling around up there.
3421000 3422335 I couldn't tell you.
3422460 3424796 Okay. National power grid.
3424879 3427215 Uh, gas and electric is divided<br />into three zones, right?
3427298 3430093 Eastern, central and western,<br />each with a primary hub.
3431553 3432512 Here it is.
3434806 3436307 What is that?<br />What are we looking at?
3436391 3439352 That is the eastern hub.<br />Now, they take this out...
3440562 3443022 wipes out all the power for<br />the entire eastern corridor.
3443481 3445108 But again, you'd have<br />to do it manually.
3445859 3449028 Okay. Come on. Let's go.
3449112 3450238 What, to West Virginia?
3450822 3452115 Hey, I-I honestly don't think
3452198 3453825 I can handle any more people<br />trying to kill me.
3453950 3455910 -McClane? McClane?<br />-Well, you get used to it.
3455994 3457120 McClane... Oh, shit.
3457203 3459164 Sir, wireless<br />networks are down,
3459247 3461082 and I think they're hitting<br />the landlines too.
3462083 3464586 I don't care how.<br />You find me a line.
3465712 3466754 Come on. Whatcha got?
3466838 3467964 We swept the whole building.
3468047 3469424 Seems clean.<br />We can sweep it again.
3469507 3472343 -I don't think we're gonna find anything.<br />-Don't bother. Don't bother.
3473428 3474512 It's a fake.
3475054 3476222 This guy's playing us.
3476973 3479350 Okay, get everyone back inside<br />the crisis center now.
3479434 3480768 Okay. Let's open it up!
3484147 3485315 Come on. Get in.
3485940 3487066 Door's locked,
3487609 3489486 unless you have an extra gun<br />I can use to unlock it.
3489694 3490778 (grunts)
3492822 3495658 Hey, hey, don't do that.<br />Hey! You're gonna disable it.
3496284 3497202 (grunts)
3497285 3498661 Jesus Christ!
3499287 3501498 Oh! That was crazy.<br />Did you see that?
3502081 3503333 Sorry about that, man.
3503416 3505043 I didn't know<br />it would come out so fast.
3506211 3507128 (grunts)
3507212 3509297 Uh... Oh, man...<br />(mutters)
3509923 3511007 How'd you do yours?
3511090 3512425 (sighs)
3514219 3515261 You all right?
3515553 3518097 What'd you... What, it hit you<br />a little bit? Sorry.
3522268 3524395 Oh, no, listen, do-do not...<br />Please don't touch those, okay?
3524479 3525939 I know what I'm doing.<br />I've done this before.
3526689 3528191 I mean, I-I've read about it.
3528650 3530193 (phone ringing)
3530276 3532695 OPERATOR: <i>Road assist, we've detected</i><br /><i>an air bag deployment.</i>
3532779 3535240 Yes, um...<br />Please, we just hit a tree,
3535323 3537367 and my-my my dad is having<br />a heart attack.
3537450 3539744 And I think he's gonna die!<br />You need to help us.
3539953 3542163 OPERATOR: <i>Hold while we contact</i><br /><i>emergency services.</i>
3542247 3544165 (sighs) No, no, no, he's...<br />He's dying.
3544249 3546376 Please, listen to me.<br />I-I can get him to a hospital.
3546459 3547919 I can drive. I'm fine.
3548002 3549420 But I can't really<br />turn the key.
3549504 3552048 The key won't start,<br />so you gotta start the car for us, okay?
3552131 3553341 Please, Dad...
3553424 3555760 -OPERATOR: <i>Your name, please?</i><br />-Uh...
3555843 3558388 My name is-is...
3558513 3559681 Frank...
3559764 3562767 and my dad's<br />name is, um...
3563601 3565144 Is...
3566104 3569107 "Dvorak Tsajanski."
3570191 3571234 P-please...
3571317 3573695 Please just help us, okay?<br />We need your help, please!
3573778 3576447 OPERATOR:<br /><i>Emergency services are on their way.</i>
3576531 3577824 No, no, h-hold on.<br />Listen to me.
3577907 3579450 Listen to me, ma'am.<br />What is your name?
3579534 3581119 <i>-Dolores.</i><br />-Dolores?
3581244 3584497 Okay, Dolores, uh, I don't know<br />if you have a dad, but I do,
3584581 3586958 and I want to be able to say<br />that a year from now, okay?
3587041 3588293 Because my dad is my hero,
3588376 3591045 and right now<br />he is in my arms dying.
3591129 3594507 A-and his only hope i-is to get<br />to a hospital right now.
3594591 3597719 And we can't wait, so please<br />start the goddamn car!
3597927 3599512 (engine starts)
3600471 3601806 (seat belt prompt chimes)
3602557 3603725 Thank you, Dolores.
3604267 3606436 Pass me the PDA.<br />I gotta call the Warlock.
3606519 3607979 -McCLANE: The what?<br />-FARRELL: The Warlock.
3608062 3610023 He's a digital Jedi.<br />He's amazing.
3627999 3629834 Ma'am, you're not<br />authorized to be here.
3629917 3632045 FBI. We suspect there's<br />been a security breach.
3632128 3633921 No, you can't land here<br />without authoriza--
3636090 3637675 (grunts)
3638301 3639302 (silenced gunshots)
3654400 3655777 That was pretty good<br />back there, kid.
3657445 3658613 Thanks.
3659322 3662367 What's the matter with you?<br />Nothing else to complain about?
3662950 3664285 No. Just, uh...
3665370 3666663 What?<br />What's the matter with you?
3666746 3668039 It's not funny.<br />I'm not like you.
3668122 3669707 I can't... I can't do this shit.
3670208 3671751 What do you mean?<br />What's that mean? Like what?
3672627 3675505 I'm not, like... like heroic<br />and everything, I'm...
3675588 3677256 -(chuckles)<br />-...not brave like you are.
3677340 3678341 I'm not that guy.
3678424 3679592 I'm nobody's hero, kid.
3680218 3682804 You saved my life, like,<br />10 times in the last six hours.
3682887 3684555 Just doing my job, that's all.
3684639 3685890 Uh...
3687767 3690436 Know what you get<br />for being a hero? Nothing.
3690853 3692021 You get shot at.
3692730 3694649 You get a little pat<br />on the back, blah-blah-blah.
3694816 3696067 Attaboy.
3699487 3700905 You get divorced.
3701572 3703616 A wife that can't remember<br />your last name.
3705159 3706536 Kids don't wanna talk to you.
3708663 3710665 Get to eat a lot of meals<br />by yourself.
3711833 3713918 Trust me, kid.<br />Nobody wants to be that guy.
3716045 3717130 Then why are you doing this?
3717463 3719841 Because there's nobody else<br />to do it right now, that's why.
3720466 3722135 Believe me, if there was<br />somebody else to do it,
3722218 3723803 I would let them do it,<br />but there's not,
3724095 3725179 so we're doing it.
3726806 3729726 (clicks tongue) Uh... and that's<br />what makes you that guy.
3736482 3738234 (keys clacking)
3739277 3740403 Thing's flying now.
3741195 3743239 Contact Emerson.<br />Tell him we'll be there soon.
3750830 3751914 What the hell are you doing?
3751998 3753833 This whole floor's<br />restricted access.
3755334 3756794 (body thuds)
3766888 3768431 (rumbling)
3779358 3780485 Stay here.
3810431 3811599 (whispering)<br />All right, come on.
3811682 3812600 FARRELL:<br />Okay.
3822610 3824737 (electronic whirring)
3831202 3832703 -We're in.<br />-GABRIEL: <i>Good. Shut it down.</i>
3837166 3840378 (beeping)
3844882 3846133 Guess you were right, kid.
3846926 3848928 Okay, that's... awful.
3852181 3853182 We got company.
3862608 3864443 So how would they shut down<br />the power grid?
3864527 3865611 -What?<br />-Come on!
3865695 3868030 Uh... central control room.
3868114 3869115 Okay.
3869198 3870199 (beeps)
3870825 3871993 Uh... fourth floor.
3872076 3873369 -Fourth floor! Fourth floor!<br />-Come on!
3876789 3877915 -Take the right.<br />-Yeah.
3882336 3883880 -(door squeaks, clangs)<br />-Oh, shit.
3884881 3886132 Shh.
3888009 3889719 -I'm gonna stop here for--<br />-Just try to keep up.
3889802 3892471 I am keeping up. I just want to stop for<br />two seconds to catch a breath.
3892638 3894724 You know, they have these<br />things called gymnasiums.
3894807 3896517 -FARRELL: Yeah, it's not like--<br />-(yells)
3899937 3901898 (grunting and groaning)
3907236 3908946 -(gunshot)<br />-(yells)
3913826 3915286 (gun thuds)
3916996 3919165 McCLANE:<br />Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
3926297 3927757 Right.
3932178 3934680 Intel's fairly certain that<br />the terrorists are mobile.
3934805 3937600 It's the only way to<br />consistently avoid signal triangulation,
3937683 3939852 and judging by the amount<br />of hardware they're running,
3939936 3942438 we're probably looking<br />for a large vehicle,
3942897 3944607 most likely a semitrailer rig.
3944857 3947568 All right, tell the guys<br />at Homeland Security
3947652 3949070 we need every agent, satellite
3949153 3951489 and functioning network<br />they got. Now.
3956869 3957995 (beeps)
3967838 3968839 (beeps)
3971092 3972635 McCLANE:<br />Playtime's over, sweetheart.
3972885 3975054 Don't. Take your hand<br />off the gun.
3976013 3978182 Hands up. Stand up.
3985564 3986649 Go on, now!
3988442 3990152 Let's go, kid.<br />You're up.
3990820 3991862 (whispers) Okay.
3994281 3995825 As fast as you can. Hey!
3995908 3997243 (grunting)
3998828 3999787 McCLANE:<br />Jesus!
3999870 4001038 -(gunshot)<br />-Whoa!
4001539 4002915 (grunting)
4004750 4006168 (groaning)
4007378 4008754 (grunts)
4016929 4018848 That's enough<br />of this kung fu shit.
4018931 4020850 I've known<br />some bitches in my day,
4021308 4022935 but you are the biggest...
4023019 4024729 -(yelling)<br />-(groaning)
4024812 4026063 Okay, uh...
4026105 4027398 (grunts)
4027857 4029442 -Uh...<br />-Still awake, huh?
4031110 4032319 Just keep doing<br />what you're doing.
4032403 4033821 -Okay.<br />-How much time do you need?
4033904 4035364 Um, um... Not much.
4036782 4037783 (grunting)
4044206 4045249 Whoo.
4048919 4050421 -Are you done?<br />-(panting)
4051422 4052465 -I...<br />-Are you done?
4052548 4054175 -No, no, not quite.<br />-What?
4054425 4056510 I'm not exactly checking<br />my email here, you know?
4056594 4057553 (groans)
4058012 4060473 They ran this hack in VMO,<br />so I'm isolating their API,
4060556 4061807 -and just booting the host.<br />-What?
4061891 4063809 It means about 30 seconds, okay?
4065352 4067104 Not the easiest thing<br />to do when...
4067897 4069065 (yells)
4069190 4070775 (grunting and groaning)
4077239 4078324 (gasps)
4079033 4080701 -(grunts)<br />-Okay!
4082912 4084914 Undo everything<br />you just did. Now!
4084997 4086791 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
4087917 4089043 I'm a righty. I'm a righty.
4089126 4091212 I'm a righty. I need<br />my other hand. I really do.
4093506 4094548 I'm a righty.
4096092 4097301 (groans)
4109438 4110564 (groans)
4114735 4115653 (engine starts)

4121575 4122451 (cocks gun)
4125204 4126372 (computer beeping)
4127957 4129291 One last door to open.
4130918 4132211 Do you know what you're doing?
4132503 4133879 (nervous chuckle)<br />I mean, do you realize
4133963 4135381 what this'll do to the country?
4135464 4136841 Yes, I do.
4136924 4138175 Now open the door.
4139093 4140386 Okay, good.
4140803 4142221 Glad we're on the same page.
4142596 4145099 (engine revving)
4149562 4151939 You do? I'm glad you know.
4159321 4160322 (car engine revving)
4163909 4165161 -(yells)<br />-Ohh!
4167872 4168914 McCLANE: How you doing?
4169957 4170916 (Mai screams)
4179008 4180092 Hang on!
4182553 4184138 (groaning)
4184847 4186640 (metal creaking)
4188309 4189351 (screams)

4239318 4241028 (grunting)
4246450 4247493 (groans)
4253916 4256794 Listen. Let's just talk<br />about this for one--
4256877 4257753 (grunts)
4260965 4262424 (grunts) How you doing?
4262716 4265427 That's not too tight,<br />is it? Huh? Huh?
4267513 4268555 Damn it!
4271433 4272601 Smile pretty!
4273519 4274812 (groans)
4280901 4282778 (metal creaking)
4284071 4284947 (grunts)
4307469 4308345 McClane!
4310681 4311640 Oh, shit.
4313058 4314560 McClane, get outta there!
4316812 4317896 Come on, man. Come on!
4322526 4323527 Come on, man!
4331368 4332328 Oh, God.
4339793 4341211 (grunting)
4345382 4346633 Did you see that?
4346717 4348218 (whooping laugh)
4348510 4350137 (triumphant yell)
4350929 4352097 McCLANE:<br />So, you stopped it, right?
4352181 4354141 FARRELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,<br />actually, having a gun
4354266 4356352 to your head makes it harder<br />to do this kind of work.
4356435 4357311 McCLANE:<br />What?
4357394 4358771 FARRELL:<br />I know that comes as a surprise.
4360272 4361315 Shit.
4362733 4365110 You can't just turn it off?<br />Just lock 'em out?
4365194 4366111 I'm not sure.
4368489 4371200 I might be able<br />to slow 'em down, though.
4373202 4374828 Western and central hubs<br />are ours.
4374912 4376038 We're just waiting on Mai's end.
4377581 4379041 Hang on. Something's up.
4379625 4381126 All the security's reactivating.
4381210 4383796 (chuckles)<br />I think someone might be
4383879 4386256 in the market<br />for some cheap Viagra.
4386340 4388884 Why don't you take some of that?<br />I know your girlfriend's dead,
4388967 4392346 why don't you check out our sexy<br />singles that you can chat with?
4393347 4394431 It's an e-bomb.
4396558 4399144 (phone ringing)
4401522 4402731 Hey, h-hey...
4403941 4404900 (blows on phone)
4407528 4409071 All right, all right,<br />wait, wait, wait.
4409947 4411323 (ringing continues)
4412408 4413826 GABRIEL: <i>Mai, talk to me.</i><br /><i>What's going on?</i>
4414243 4416954 Mai? Oh, yeah.
4417413 4419415 Little Asian chick,<br />likes to kick people?
4419706 4421333 I don't think she's gonna<br />be talking to anybody
4421417 4423085 for a really long time.
4424211 4425254 Last time I saw her,
4425337 4427464 she was at the bottom<br />of an elevator shaft
4427548 4429133 with an SUV<br />rammed up her ass.
4430467 4432594 <i>What's the matter?</i><br /><i>Cat got your tongue?</i>
4433679 4436932 Listen, jackass,<br />your fire sale's over.
4438934 4440394 So pack up your little circus,
4440644 4443147 or I'm gonna come<br />and I'm gonna kick your ass.
4443272 4449194 You have no idea who I am<br />or what I am capable of.
4449486 4452156 <i>When I'm finished here,</i><br /><i>and I promise it'll be soon,</i>
4452448 4455993 I will focus<br />all my attention on you.
4457494 4459955 You want to make things<br />personal, fine.
4480350 4482978 Reroute every cubic foot<br />of natural gas in the pipelines
4483061 4483896 to that station.
4486440 4487816 Can you get Bowman<br />on this thing?
4488233 4489985 FARRELL:<br />Sure. I can get anyone on.
4491278 4492779 -Do it.<br />-Now?
4492863 4493989 Yeah. Now.
4497951 4498869 Please, no.
4500704 4502581 It's Thomas Gabriel. Shit.
4504875 4506210 McCLANE:<br /><i>You know this guy?</i>
4506585 4509755 I worked with him.<br />He was DOD's chief programmer
4509838 4511298 <i>for infrastructure security.</i>
4511381 4514092 After 9/11, he's the guy<br />that told Joint Chiefs
4514343 4515511 the system was vulnerable.
4515594 4516803 He was pushing<br />for total overhaul,
4516887 4517763 but they wouldn't listen.
4517846 4519848 Gabriel's not exactly<br />people-friendly.
4519932 4521058 You think so?
4521558 4524102 When he tried to go public,<br />they crucified him...
4524728 4525979 <i>destroyed his reputation.</i>
4526438 4527731 <i>-Froze assets. After that...</i><br />-Uh...
4528106 4529107 ...he disappeared.
4529191 4531360 We got a pretty serious problem.
4531443 4533278 -(beeping)<br />-Wh... Hold on one minute. What?
4533737 4536281 I think we need to<br />get out of here right now.
4537866 4539368 They're sending<br />the gas lines here.
4539618 4540827 Gas lines? What gas lines?
4540911 4542371 -(beeping continues)<br />-Christ.
4543288 4544289 Oh.
4544790 4546458 All of 'em. See that?
4546542 4548460 Those flashing arrows?<br />That's not good.
4548544 4549670 McCLANE:<br />All that's coming here?
4550254 4551964 Yeah, I think we gotta go.
4552047 4554174 McCLANE: <i>He-hey, listen,</i><br /><i>I gotta go, I gotta go.</i>
4554258 4555551 Just find Thomas Gabriel.
4555634 4557761 McClane? McClane?
4558053 4559471 Let's go.<br />Let's go. Finish this up!
4566270 4568480 Right now. Finish it up.<br />Come on. Let's go!
4568939 4570107 Okay.
4588417 4589668 McCLANE:<br />Get in there! Get in there!
4610689 4612232 (blipping)
4628373 4630042 (metal creaking)
4634504 4635756 (panting)
4636131 4637090 You okay?
4639051 4640177 (coughing)
4642846 4644723 Let's go, come on.<br />Got to get out of here.
4644806 4646767 Oh, what's the point?<br />Man, what is the point?
4646850 4648810 Hey. Knock that off.<br />Come on.
4648894 4650812 This has something to do with<br />that code you wrote for them.
4650896 4652022 All right? Now think.
4652105 4653190 Come on. Help us win.
4653357 4654232 (coughing)
4654900 4655817 Win?
4656318 4658612 When do we start winning? Huh?
4658695 4660322 Take a look around.<br />Are you out of your mind?
4660405 4662741 Does it look like<br />we're even close to winning?
4663116 4664951 We just got the shit<br />kicked out of us.
4665285 4666745 What, do you think<br />I'm holding out on you,
4666828 4668205 there's something<br />I'm not telling you?
4668288 4670332 If I knew what they wanted,<br />I would tell you.
4670415 4671583 I would happily tell you.
4672626 4673543 Jesus.
4682969 4686515 -(breakers clanking)<br />-(generators powering down)
4707119 4708203 (crackling)
4710706 4711707 The Warlock.
4712165 4713166 The Warlock.
4713750 4715210 Oh, great. Ah!
4715711 4716670 There goes the cell phone.
4716753 4718463 They're knocking satellites<br />out of the skies now?
4718547 4720006 No, your battery ran out.
4720090 4722300 -Listen, we should go see him.<br />-Who?
4722342 4723885 The Warlock, we should<br />drive to his house.
4723969 4725345 He's not that far away.<br />He's in Baltimore.
4725429 4726638 We can't go<br />to the Warlock's house.
4726722 4728056 Hey, hey, hey,<br />you want me to help you.
4728140 4729099 This is me helping you.
4729182 4730434 Okay? Trust me.
4730517 4731810 We got to go see the Warlock.
4731893 4732853 It's our only hope.
4738942 4740193 How do you feel<br />about flying?
4740277 4741486 Uh, about what?
4741570 4742863 You mean, like, with a pilot?
4742946 4745449 (whirring)
4750537 4751872 Just stick it<br />in the round thing.
4751955 4753206 What round thing?
4753290 4754666 Here, put these on.
4754750 4755834 (clears throat)
4756334 4757461 Just stick it in there.
4757544 4758712 -That'll work.<br />-Oh, oh, oh.
4759045 4760130 You okay?
4760213 4762924 Uh, yeah, I'm just<br />kind of afraid of flying...
4763049 4765093 Yeah, I used to be terrified<br />of flying.
4765177 4767012 -Really?<br />-Yeah. Took some lessons.
4767095 4768972 You know, face your fears,<br />that kinda thing.
4769055 4770265 Yeah? Did it help?
4770348 4771308 Not really.
4772726 4773810 FARRELL: This it?
4775270 4776396 -(engine whirs)<br />-(alarm beeps)
4776646 4778148 Is it supposed<br />to make that sound?
4778482 4781067 -Yeah.<br />-(engine purring)
4781443 4782444 Maybe we should just drive.
4782527 4783862 It'll be fun,<br />it'll be like a road trip.
4783945 4786031 Just take it easy. They say<br />taking off is the hardest part.
4786114 4787574 Really? I... I heard...
4787657 4789785 To be honest with you,<br />I missed a couple of classes.
4789868 4792037 Ha ha ha.<br />You did, really?
4792120 4793246 But you have<br />your license, right?
4793330 4795040 I mean, you can fly<br />one of these, right?
4796875 4798585 -Oh...<br />-Hey-hey! Here we go.
4798668 4800086 -Hey-hey.<br />-We're up.
4801087 4802255 (sighs) Oh, God.
4804925 4807761 Okay. That's good.<br />That's pretty good.
4810889 4811890 McCLANE: Jesus, look at that.
4812140 4813725 This whole area is blacked out.
4816102 4817854 How we gonna<br />find Warlock's house?
4818480 4820440 Um, it's probably<br />gonna be the one
4820524 4821566 with the lights still on.
4829533 4830867 Power outage keeps spreading.
4830951 4832786 About half the East Coast<br />has already gone down.
4834913 4837707 All right. Put everything<br />on emergency generators.
4838542 4840210 How the hell<br />are they getting past us?
4841127 4843463 (helicopter engine humming)
4844756 4846842 Uh, okay. Uh, down there,<br />down there, I see it.
4846925 4848343 -Down there?<br />-Left, left, down.
4853682 4855433 We're gonna land there?<br />We're gonna land down there?
4857269 4859271 -All right, hang on.<br />-Okay, okay.
4859896 4860814 Oh...
4862732 4864276 Fence. Fence, fence.
4866570 4867737 Fence, fence!
4867821 4868697 I see...
4869030 4869906 Watch...
4871658 4873243 (screaming)
4874911 4876496 (alarm blaring)
4876580 4879082 -Whoo!<br />-(whimpering)
4879207 4880250 Oh!
4882544 4884421 -Oh. Jesus.<br />-Come on.
4884504 4887465 Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,<br />taking off is the hardest part.
4888174 4889134 Let's go.
4889551 4890927 (dog barking in distance)
4891970 4894472 FARRELL: Now, now. Now, there's something<br />you need to know about Warlock.
4894556 4897100 He, he hates cops.<br />I mean, he hates 'em, okay?
4897183 4899185 So just let me do<br />all the talking.
4906818 4907903 (clears throat)
4909112 4910071 Shit.
4911323 4912782 Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.
4913617 4914993 Um, is Freddy home?
4917454 4920790 I'm Matt Farrell<br />and this is, uh... Billy.
4922751 4925211 We-we're friends<br />from space camp.
4925295 4926796 We went to space camp<br />with Freddy.
4928715 4929799 Freddy!
4931009 4931968 (softly) Freddy?
4932052 4933219 You got company!
4933386 4934721 (keys clacking)
4939893 4942437 Frederick, didn't you hear me?
4943104 4944814 All Baltimore heard you, Ma.
4945231 4946483 Your friends are here.
4946566 4948276 WARLOCK: Friends?<br />What... What the...
4949110 4950111 Come on, Ma!
4950195 4951279 How many times<br />I gotta tell you,
4951363 4953031 you don't bring people<br />down here, man?
4953114 4955909 I can't see too good. Is that<br />a young bearded Han Solo?
4955992 4957786 What happened, man?<br />You lost so much weight.
4957869 4960038 No, dude, I gained 30 pounds.<br />Who is that?
4960121 4961581 You know what?<br />Doesn't matter.
4961665 4962916 Dude, what are you<br />even doing here?
4962999 4964918 'Cause of you,<br />I am rockin' five generators
4965001 4966336 just so I can stay online.
4966586 4968546 And since you're being<br />hunted by assassins,
4968630 4970256 it doesn't really make me<br />think, like, this visit
4970340 4972968 is a very productive or healthy use<br />of my time, and...
4973051 4974803 Hey, hey, don't...<br />Don't touch that, all right?
4975845 4977055 CB radio?
4978223 4979849 A little low-tech for you guys,<br />isn't it?
4979933 4981059 Low-tech.<br />Dude, that, my friend,
4981142 4983353 is an end-of-the-world<br />insurance system, okay?
4983436 4984854 So when the last<br />microchip goes down,
4984938 4986940 I'm gonna be able to stay in touch with<br />whoever's out there,
4987023 4989234 whether they be zombies or not,<br />I'll tell you that right now.
4989693 4991194 What'd you bring<br />your dad here for?
4991277 4993405 He's cool. He's into<br />the whole gaming culture--
4993488 4994781 Nice poster.
4996533 4998076 Oh, what, like,<br />you a big fan of the Fett?
4998159 4999619 -(whispers) Oh, God.<br />-McCLANE: No.
4999869 5001496 I was always more<br />of a <i>Star Wars </i>guy.
5002455 5003873 -Oh, dude, he's kidding.<br /><i>-Star Wars </i>guy.
5003957 5005333 -Who is this man?<br />-He's my--
5005417 5008003 Hey, dump truck,<br />I'm not his dad.
5008420 5009671 I'm a cop.<br />How about that?
5009754 5012257 Oh, a cop, I'm sorry.<br />Thank you very much.
5012340 5014801 Why'd you bring a cop<br />into my command center?
5014884 5016886 (whooping laughter)<br />Command center.
5017178 5018930 -It's a basement.<br />-It's a command center.
5019014 5020557 Don't help, McClane.<br />I can explain.
5020640 5022726 Just tell us what you know<br />about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
5022809 5023852 That's why we came here.
5024519 5026771 Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.<br />I didn't know. I'm sorry.
5026855 5028857 Get out! I want you out<br />of here, man. Right now!
5028940 5030025 -Why?<br />-Hey, hey.
5030108 5032402 -'Cause...<br />-Just calm down, big boy.
5032485 5033903 You calm down!<br />This is my house.
5034904 5036364 You're gonna tell me<br />what I want to know,
5036448 5038199 or I'm going to beat you<br />to death in your own house.
5054257 5055717 WARLOCK:<br /><i>Four years ago, the DOD</i>
5055800 5058553 recruits Thomas Gabriel to be<br />a cyber-spook for 'em, okay?
5058636 5060430 First day on the job,<br />goes in to his bosses
5060513 5062932 and tells 'em this nation's<br />security infrastructure
5063016 5065435 is wide open to compromise,<br />and what do they say?
5065518 5066728 "We'll take it<br />under advisement."
5066811 5067771 But this dude don't ease up,
5067854 5069397 'cause he's committed,<br />like you read about,
5069481 5070732 so he breaks into a meeting
5070815 5072692 of the Joint Chiefs<br />of Staff, okay?
5072776 5075361 And using just a laptop,<br />hacks into NORAD
5075445 5077614 and shuts down<br />our entire defense network,
5077697 5079282 till they put a gun<br />to the man's head
5079365 5080950 and forced him<br />to stop the hack.
5081159 5083286 Thomas Gabriel's the guy<br />who shut down NORAD
5083369 5085413 with a laptop<br />just to prove a point.
5085497 5086581 You think I'm scared of you?
5086664 5088333 Just tell us how to find<br />the guy, that's all.
5088416 5089834 WARLOCK: How do I know<br />how to find the guy?
5089918 5091795 He's a ghost, man.<br />He just fell off the grid.
5091920 5092921 Another dead-end.<br />Come on.
5093004 5093880 Hold up, wait, McClane.
5093963 5097300 Listen, Warlock, a couple<br />of weeks ago, I wrote--
5097383 5100011 I know, dude, you wrote<br />a mutating algorithmic security code
5100095 5102263 that's probably being used<br />by Thomas Gabriel right now.
5103389 5104682 No, we know that, yes.
5104974 5106309 Can you tell us<br />what he's using it for?
5106434 5108103 I don't know. I've been<br />trying to figure that out.
5108186 5109187 Here, look.
5110647 5113441 The only security system<br />in the country that I can find
5113525 5115485 currently employing<br />that particular template
5115568 5117987 is the Social Security<br />Administration, okay?
5118071 5120156 But they don't even use it<br />in the main facility. Look.
5120573 5121866 They use it in this building.
5122408 5123535 Over here in Woodlawn.
5123618 5126746 -Whoa. What the hell? God.<br />-I know, right?
5126830 5129040 "Right," what? What the hell<br />are you guys talking about?
5129124 5130583 Their power consumption is off the charts.
5130667 5131793 It's hot, it's hot. It's on fire.
5131876 5133586 FARRELL: Why would there<br />be chilling towers there?
5133670 5135672 That's what I thought.<br />Hello?
5136256 5137507 What's a chilling tower?
5138508 5139884 (sighs) See what<br />I've been dealing with?
5141010 5143555 Large server farms generate a lot of heat<br />and need to be cooled.
5145098 5146057 But why there?
5146099 5148059 Tell you what, guys. I don't<br />know what's in that building,
5148143 5149853 but I assure you it's not<br />Social Security numbers.
5151104 5152689 (beeping)
5156609 5158027 I got a red flag over here.
5158570 5160071 Someone's hacking<br />into Woodlawn.
5162490 5164242 Honing in on<br />the host server right now.
5166452 5167954 Frederick Kaludis.
5168621 5169664 Let's have a look at him.
5169747 5170748 Fat bastard.
5176337 5177255 McClane.
5177714 5178882 Where is his daughter?
5178965 5180758 We just got a trace on her cell.
5182135 5183386 You're gonna love this.
5183469 5184679 (phone beeps)
5187807 5189601 All right, let's get<br />a better look at you.
5192645 5194564 (elevator whirring)
5202322 5203948 -GABRIEL: <i>Freddy.</i><br />-What?
5204365 5205408 <i>What the hell are you doing</i>
5205491 5207202 <i>dicking around</i><br /><i>inside my network?</i>
5212290 5213333 GABRIEL: <i>McClane?</i>
5214000 5215585 I thought I killed you<br />already.
5216211 5217587 I get that sometimes.
5221299 5224427 You think you can, uh,<br />find a track where he is?
5224510 5225720 -Two minutes.<br />-GABRIEL: <i>Detective,</i>
5226179 5227764 <i>covering the camera</i><br /><i>with your hand</i>
5228014 5229933 does not turn off<br />the microphone.
5231392 5234854 Yeah. I know I'm not<br />as smart as you guys
5234896 5236147 at all this computer shit.
5237565 5238441 But, hey...
5239984 5241110 <i>I'm still alive, ain't I?</i>
5242028 5245531 I mean, you've got to be running<br />out of bad guys by now, right?
5246658 5247575 Huh?
5250370 5251454 Gabriel?
5254207 5255541 Honestly, you can tell me.
5255875 5257001 I mean, how does that work?
5257418 5258795 You got some kind<br />of service or something?
5258878 5261965 Some kind of 800 number?<br />1-800-HENCHMEN?
5262382 5264425 Oh, you know what?<br />I bet you're still on hold with,
5264801 5267053 "Can I get another dead<br />Asian hooker bitch
5267136 5268263 over here right away?"
5269597 5272725 Huh? But seriously,<br />all that kicking aside,
5272809 5275895 that skinny little ninja chick,<br />she was smokin' hot.
5276771 5279065 A new one of those gotta be<br />real hard to come by, right?
5279816 5281859 You're very impressed<br />with yourself, aren't you?
5281943 5283278 I have my moments.
5284195 5285113 Yeah?
5287490 5288783 Is this one of them?
5289492 5291160 (line ringing)
5293037 5294122 -(phone clicks)<br />-LUCY: <i>Hello?</i>
5294205 5296416 Yes, this is<br />emergency services calling.
5296499 5298376 -(sighs) <i>Oh, God. Thank God.</i><br />-Can she hear me?
5298459 5300420 <i>My name is Lucy Gennero. I've been stuck</i><br /><i>in here for hours.</i>
5300503 5301671 <i>-I've been trying to call...</i><br />-Hey.
5301754 5302797 <i>My cell phone's not working...</i>
5302880 5304799 Can she hear this?<br />Lucy, hang up that phone.
5305049 5306551 <i>Yes. Calm down, miss.</i>
5307010 5309220 <i>We know exactly</i><br /><i>where you are.</i>
5309554 5311180 <i>Everything is gonna</i><br /><i>be all right.</i>
5311264 5312640 -(Lucy sighs)<br />-Lucy, hang up the phone!
5313057 5316144 Please, John, I'm trying<br />to have a conversation.
5318938 5321816 <i>We're a bit overloaded tonight,</i><br /><i>as you may imagine,</i>
5321899 5324485 <i>but I assure you, we're gonna</i><br /><i>get you out of there,</i>
5324569 5327530 even if I have to come down<br />there and get you myself.
5327989 5328865 <i>Thank you.</i>
5328948 5330616 In the meantime, Miss Gennero,<br />is there anyone
5330700 5332577 <i>you would like us</i><br /><i>to contact for you?</i>
5332660 5333619 LUCY: <i>Yeah.</i>
5335330 5336372 My dad.
5337749 5339125 His name is John McClane.
5339751 5340960 <i>He's a New York City cop.</i>
5342003 5343087 <i>We'll find him.</i>
5343171 5344464 <i>Just hang in there, miss.</i>
5344922 5347467 <i>We'll get to you... very soon.</i>
5349677 5351012 <i>Thank you. </i>(sighs)
5353014 5356142 <i>Wow. That's a great girl</i><br /><i>you got there.</i>
5356267 5357602 <i>Can't wait to meet her.</i>
5358102 5360063 <i>What's the matter?</i><br /><i>Cat got your tongue?</i>
5361147 5362607 Come on, John.
5364025 5365193 Make a joke.
5366736 5368196 Say something funny.
5370073 5371157 (Warlock whistles softly)
5375578 5376579 Where are you go...<br />Wh-Wh...
5376662 5377955 (whispering)<br />Where are you going? Hey.
5378456 5379749 McClane! Hey!
5379916 5380917 Hold up. Hold on.
5381250 5382752 Where you going?<br />What are you gonna do?
5383169 5384337 What do you think<br />I'm gonna do?
5385588 5387298 I'm gonna go kill this guy<br />and get my daughter.
5387382 5389175 -But she could be anywhere.<br />-Now, hey, listen to me.
5389634 5391677 It's gonna get messy.<br />You should just stay here.
5391761 5394847 -I think I--<br />-Hey, I'm doing you a favor.
5395223 5396599 I wouldn't bet on me,<br />all right?
5397809 5399018 I'll take it from here.
5399977 5400978 Thanks for your help.
5405566 5406692 (engine starts)
5406818 5407985 (car door closes)
5408945 5411489 I wouldn't bet on you, either,<br />so I figured I'd lend a hand.
5414742 5415618 Buckle up.
5437932 5439517 (clanking)
5439851 5441227 (buzzing)
5442854 5444772 FBI, ma'am,<br />Jersey field office.
5445189 5446482 Mind if I see your ID?
5447275 5448317 Not at all.
5456242 5457326 (chuckles)
5458453 5460705 My dad's a cop.<br />Force of habit.
5461581 5463708 Your father sounds like<br />a very smart man.
5469422 5470756 McCLANE:<br />Kid, can you get Bowman?
5471841 5472925 Uh, yeah.
5482059 5483186 (beeping)
5483561 5484854 It's completely dead.
5485605 5487648 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all the satellite links.
5487732 5488774 Shit.
5494572 5496240 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5499577 5500828 About all of it.
5501829 5503372 It's my fault<br />you got into this.
5503456 5504540 This wasn't your fight.
5504957 5506417 You got nothing<br />to be sorry about.
5508753 5509754 (elevator bell dings)
5511589 5513090 Let go of me,<br />you bastard.
5513174 5515510 This bitch is a handful.<br />(grunts)
5516552 5517428 (groans)
5520598 5521974 Are you gonna be all right?
5524685 5527522 Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.
5527605 5528481 Oh, yeah?
5529232 5530691 Let's step outside,<br />just you and me.
5531609 5532652 We'll see who hurts who.
5534654 5535947 You really are his daughter.
5537156 5538199 Tie her wrists.
5540701 5541702 (straining)
5545998 5546958 Trey.
5547041 5547959 Gabriel wants to see you.
5548501 5549418 Is it that time already?
5549502 5550503 Yeah.
5552088 5552964 Okay.
5554549 5556175 I'll be back in a second.
5562139 5563099 No, no, no,<br />please, please!
5608102 5609145 (alarm beeping)
5609186 5611188 We're showing a breach<br />on an exterior vent.
5616319 5617403 Go take a look.
5619280 5620906 Don't be long.<br />We're packing up soon.
5633294 5634545 Hey, McClane.
5634920 5637089 Do we have anything resembling<br />a plan or anything?
5637465 5639175 McCLANE: Find Lucy<br />and kill everybody else.
5639258 5641552 FARRELL: I mean more like a plan,<br />like, a way to do that.
5645222 5646265 Come on.
5647933 5649477 FARRELL:<br />Okay, according to the layout,
5649560 5651604 uh, the chilling towers<br />are kept on the bottom level.
5658069 5659695 -(grunts)<br />-I think mine's locked.
5664700 5666369 Okay, now it looks like<br />we're getting somewhere.
5675169 5676087 Uh...
5679423 5681926 Okay, this looks like it controls<br />the cooling system for the mainframe,
5682009 5684345 which should be...
5686222 5687348 If I can just hack in...
5689684 5691894 trip the alarm,<br />it might alert Bowman.
5694855 5696107 (powering down)
5696190 5698150 (alarm blaring)
5700945 5702113 Someone set off the alarms.
5702655 5704907 Yes. Thank you, detective.<br />I can hear that.
5704990 5706283 Find a way<br />to turn it off.
5711122 5712164 What do you got?
5713416 5715167 (sighs) We got a problem.
5715251 5717002 The alarms went off<br />at Woodlawn.
5719088 5720172 It's got to be him.
5721006 5722717 And what's Woodlawn?
5727221 5728431 It's NSA,
5728514 5731350 a secure facility<br />outside of Baltimore.
5731434 5733853 It's a fail-safe<br />we built after 9/11
5733894 5735771 to back up<br />all financial information.
5736230 5738858 The moment the networks<br />were hit, all the financial data
5738941 5741318 automatically began downloading<br />to those servers.
5741402 5745281 Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,<br />government funds,
5745364 5747491 all of it, basically, a backup
5747575 5749869 for the accumulated wealth<br />of America.
5750703 5751787 All in one location?
5754206 5755624 What could Gabriel do with it?
5755708 5756584 Well, if he could get in,
5756667 5758085 he might try<br />to transfer the data
5758169 5759670 to a portable hard drive.
5760212 5762298 Then he could have access to<br />those accounts from anywhere,
5762840 5764216 siphon off billions for himself.
5765968 5767303 We'd have no way to trace it.
5767762 5770097 Or knowing him,<br />he could erase it all
5770181 5772266 and send us all<br />back to the Stone Age.
5773559 5775394 Why the hell<br />wasn't I told about this?
5775853 5778522 Frankly, uh,<br />it's above your pay grade.
5779273 5780441 My pay grade?
5783360 5785362 How the hell did Gabriel<br />find out about this,
5785446 5786572 when even I didn't<br />know about it?
5786655 5788032 (sighs)
5791035 5792077 He designed it.
5794705 5795956 It was his program.
5796415 5798834 He knew that hacking<br />your system last night
5798918 5800503 would trigger the download.
5801962 5803088 That's brilliant.
5803547 5806634 You two geniuses<br />stay out of my way.
5809094 5810304 (alarm blaring)
5810387 5812348 (alarm continues)
5813098 5815142 FARRELL: Let me see if I can get<br />a floor plan of this place.
5816727 5817853 -Okay.<br />-Don't move!
5819271 5821816 You... Get away<br />from the bag. Now!
5821899 5822817 Okay. Okay.
5823484 5824777 We've been waiting for you.
5826529 5827446 Yeah?
5828614 5830282 I've been waiting for you, too.
5831408 5833077 (gunfire)
5835746 5836664 (yelps)
5838541 5839458 (yells)
5843712 5845005 (groans)
5845089 5847007 (grunting)
5848175 5849343 (grunts)
5852763 5855099 (machinery whirring)
5857226 5858310 McClane!
5860312 5861313 McClane!
5864567 5865526 Kid!
5866402 5867403 Matt!
5867486 5868487 Kid?
5873951 5875452 (rattling)
5881542 5883168 -(beeping)<br />-GABRIEL: <i>Emerson.</i>
5885212 5887464 We seem to have a problem<br />in one of the cooling towers.
5887548 5889008 -Tower Seven.<br />-Tower Seven.
5889091 5891218 <i>-Find out what's going on.</i><br />-(speaking Italian)
5891302 5892344 (in English)<br />Okay.
5901186 5903105 -Sir?<br />-Get the HR team to stand by.
5903188 5904565 We need to get<br />to Woodlawn now.
5904648 5905900 The roads out<br />are completely blocked.
5905983 5907359 DC is in total gridlock.
5907610 5908944 Well, get us some helicopters.
5909320 5910905 Sir, they've all been<br />pulled by the Pentagon
5910988 5912281 for search and rescue.
5912364 5915075 Molina, find me some goddamn<br />helicopters immediately.
5917077 5919997 Look, the Pentagon has jets<br />flying CAP over DC.
5920080 5921332 Have them send one<br />over to Woodlawn
5921415 5922917 and keep an eye on things<br />till we get there.
5923000 5923918 Let's go.
5932384 5933427 (grunting)
5936513 5937431 Where's my daughter?
5937514 5939350 -(beeping)<br />-GABRIEL: <i>Russo, check in.</i>
5943854 5944813 Yeah, I think, uh,
5944897 5947733 <i>Russo's on his way down</i><br /><i>to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.</i>
5949234 5950152 <i>Hold on a minute.</i>
5950736 5951987 Looks like he's coming around.
5952863 5954782 It's McClane. He's on the<br />third floor and the kid is--
5954865 5955783 -(gunshot)<br />-(Lucy gasps)
5959328 5960621 McCLANE: <i>Get all that?</i>
5961121 5962247 <i>That's right.</i>
5962915 5966043 I'm on the third floor,<br />but I'm coming to get you.
5974885 5977221 Don't move now.<br />I'll send a doctor.
5980808 5982977 Kill this guy,<br />and I'll give you Mai's cut.
5984770 5986188 (speaking French)
5993028 5994029 (quietly) Shit.
5996115 5997866 (footsteps receding)
6006583 6008752 (mechanical whirring)
6018721 6020639 (quiet pneumatic hiss)
6029690 6031150 My algorithm.
6032651 6034111 (footsteps)
6037281 6038365 Okay, please get in.
6040284 6042327 Oh, please. God.
6042745 6044246 (beeping)
6045956 6046874 (indistinct)
6056800 6058594 (whirring)
6068604 6070189 (quiet hum)
6078530 6080783 Oh, Jesus, they're going<br />after the money.
6104848 6106433 GABRIEL:<br /><i>You coming to get me, John?</i>
6106517 6107601 <i>Is that the plan?</i>
6107684 6109645 Yep. That's my plan.
6109728 6111480 What makes you think<br />I won't put a bullet
6111563 6113023 in your daughter's head<br />right now?
6113107 6114441 'Cause you're scared of me.
6114733 6116401 Is that right?<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
6117444 6119196 'Cause otherwise<br />she'd be dead already.
6119279 6120447 <i>You need a bargaining chip.</i>
6127746 6129706 MAN:<br />Stop there. Hands up.
6130332 6132000 If you kill me,<br />you'll never get it open.
6133043 6134837 (speaking Italian)
6135879 6137589 (in English)<br />Move away. Move!
6142302 6144555 (beeping)
6145347 6146723 You know, John, I feel like
6146807 6148851 we've gotten off<br />on the wrong foot.
6149309 6150519 And because of that,
6150602 6152688 <i>you think I'm the bad guy,</i>
6152938 6154439 and nothing could be<br />further from the truth,
6154523 6155566 I'm the good guy here.
6156024 6159570 I told them this could happen<br />if they didn't prepare.
6159653 6161613 Did I get a thank you?<br />No, I got crucified.
6161822 6163115 <i>But they wouldn't listen.</i>
6163198 6164908 You got their attention now,<br />don't you?
6165242 6166243 That's right.
6167327 6169955 I am doing the country a favor.
6170038 6171832 McCLANE (chuckling):<br /><i>By tearing it apart.</i>
6171915 6174084 Better me than some outsider,
6174668 6177129 some religious nut job<br />bent on Armageddon.
6177212 6178714 Nobody wants to see<br />that happen.
6179381 6182426 Everything I've broken<br />can be fixed...
6183510 6186221 if the country is willing<br />to pay for it.
6186305 6189308 Ah, bullshit. It's always been<br />about the money.
6189516 6191059 What, I shouldn't get paid<br />for my work?
6192144 6193729 I'm working<br />my ass off here, John.
6193812 6196356 Well, just sit tight, asshole.<br />I got a check for you.
6196440 6197399 (sighs)
6200777 6201820 I can't talk to this guy.
6201904 6203697 You talk to him, see if<br />you can get him to focus.
6205532 6206450 Dad?
6209536 6210704 <i>Hi, baby.</i>
6211788 6213123 Now there are<br />only five of them.
6216627 6218670 Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.
6221006 6222674 (sighs sharply)
6223634 6224676 (yelps)
6229473 6231892 Would somebody please<br />kill this son of a bitch?
6234561 6235604 We have a problem.
6237189 6239191 No, there's...<br />There's actually no problem.
6239274 6240692 I think I just got off<br />on the wrong floor.
6243820 6244738 TREY: This is a mess.
6247783 6250494 Wow, I'm... I'm truly<br />impressed, man.
6250577 6251954 Hacking every byte<br />of financial data
6252037 6253413 for the entire country<br />would take weeks
6253497 6254915 unless you eliminated<br />the congestion.
6256458 6258377 That's what this<br />fire sale's about, isn't it?
6259253 6260754 (chuckles) That's brilliant.
6260837 6262881 Yes, it is.<br />Please be quiet.
6262965 6264299 (quietly) Asshole.
6264383 6265342 Who are you?
6266301 6267511 Matt Farrell.
6268679 6269638 Lucy McClane.
6271098 6272557 I thought your name<br />was Gennero.
6273475 6274518 Lucy Gennero.
6274601 6275686 Not today.
6276603 6277771 Can you crack the code?
6278480 6280190 Maybe, I mean,<br />if I had enough time.
6280732 6281900 That's encouraging.
6284194 6285237 Take them with us.
6286655 6288198 -Let's go.<br />-Let's go.
6290993 6293453 Gabriel, Pentagon just<br />sent an F-35 towards us.
6294246 6295247 Keep an eye on it.
6298250 6299626 Pulling down the go codes now.
6301420 6302879 (door creaking)
6316560 6317811 You might wanna<br />start thinking about
6317894 6319521 what you want<br />on your headstone, asshole.
6319688 6320939 (gunfire)
6326570 6327696 -Jesus Christ.<br />-(cocks gun)
6328363 6329406 Damn hamster.
6330365 6331283 Here you go.
6331992 6333201 Stay still, spider boy.
6338332 6339291 That's right.
6342252 6343754 (grunting)
6359936 6360937 (straining)
6369112 6370405 Goddamn it!
6375410 6376745 (hissing)
6380207 6381416 (laughing)<br />Oh-ho-ho, no.
6383919 6385962 Seriously, you probably<br />shouldn't antagonize them
6386046 6388340 since they have all<br />the loaded guns and whatnot.
6388423 6390050 Listen, will you just<br />take a minute and dig deep
6390133 6392010 for a bigger set of balls,<br />'cause you're gonna need 'em
6392094 6392969 before we're through.
6393053 6394054 Wow, I know that tone.
6394137 6396890 It's just weird hearing it<br />come from someone... with hair.
6403188 6404856 (engines revving)
6434553 6437389 Sir, ETA: 15 minutes.
6444062 6445689 (grunting)
6459786 6460787 (grunting)
6462372 6463498 (grunts)
6466835 6468420 (panting)
6492068 6493111 Fix it.
6493778 6494946 Oh, why?<br />You're just gonna kill me
6495030 6496198 if I fix it. I know that.
6497282 6498325 -(grunting)<br />-Stop!
6504039 6505540 (groaning) Shit!
6509169 6510170 I'm not gonna do it.
6515383 6516676 Oh, no, no, no. Shit.
6516760 6518303 MAN: Robinson is coming<br />pretty fast.
6519471 6520347 I'm sorry. What?
6520430 6522682 Something's wrong.<br />Robinson is coming too fast.
6527979 6529189 TREY: It's not Robinson.
6530065 6531358 That would be my dad.
6539449 6540742 (radio static)
6543286 6544287 McCLANE (over radio):<br /><i>Freddy.</i>
6546331 6547374 <i>Freddy!</i>
6549459 6551836 It's John McClane.<br />Look, I know you can hear me.
6551920 6553338 This is your frequency, right?
6553421 6554339 6-6-6.
6554422 6556007 <i>Come on.</i><br /><i>Pick up the mic, Freddy.</i>
6560011 6561805 Uh, nobody here<br />by that name, sorry.

7167368 7168286 (gasps)
7168828 7169954 It's a nice effort, though.

7186262 7187430 Would you do me a favor?
7190558 7192685 I know the lights<br />are beginning to dim,
7192727 7193978 but if you could just hang on
7194228 7196606 for a second, as soon<br />as Matt's finished,
7196689 7198441 I'm gonna kill him<br />and your daughter,
7198524 7201152 and I would love<br />for you to see that.
7203029 7204322 Goddamn it. Matthew?
7205573 7207909 Ten seconds, okay? 10 seconds,<br />you'll have all your money.
7208159 7210119 You just leave.<br />No one has to get hurt, okay?
7210369 7212121 A few seconds.<br />Stay with me.
7212580 7215082 -McClane! (grunts)<br />-(McClane grunts in pain)
7215166 7217001 Stay with me.
7217084 7217960 LUCY: Dad?
7218711 7220796 On your tombstone,<br />it should read:
7220880 7223966 "Always in the wrong place<br />at the wrong time."
7224884 7227386 How about..."Yippee-ki-yay,

7246530 7248199 McCLANE (softly):<br />Yes, baby, I'm fine.
7249033 7251911 (sobbing) I knew<br />you would come for me.
7252245 7254121 McCLANE: Of course<br />I'd come for you.
7254205 7256290 Sorry it took me<br />so long. It's okay.
7264090 7265549 -(grunting)<br />-MAN: Move, move!
7271305 7272181 AGENT: Freeze!
7273266 7275184 Hold, hold! He's okay.
7278729 7280106 Move around. Come around!
7280189 7282733 -(groans) Here, help Daddy up.<br />-Okay.
7282817 7284777 Wait, wait. Oh, wait.
7284944 7286862 I think I'll just stay here<br />for a minute.
7287905 7290866 Okay. Daddy,<br />you're out of your mind.
7291075 7291993 What are you talking about?
7292076 7293369 (laughs) You shot yourself.
7293703 7295371 It seemed like a good idea<br />at the time.
7296956 7298833 Don't tell these guys<br />that I did that.
7298916 7300167 (Lucy chuckles)
7307925 7309844 -(indistinct chatter)<br />-(horn blows)
7311470 7312722 Thanks for<br />all your help, John.
7313264 7314348 Thank you.
7316225 7317310 Is he okay?
7319186 7321188 -Should I put my hands up?<br />-No, don't put your hands up.
7322189 7323524 -Put 'em down farther?<br />-Yeah.
7324483 7326402 He might die of shock<br />on the way to the hospital.
7331490 7332575 All right.
7333159 7334243 (groaning)
7335244 7336370 I'll be right back.
7338956 7340374 -McCLANE: Hey.<br />-Oh, hey.
7341250 7342460 How's it feel to be shot?
7342543 7343711 It actually feels great.
7343794 7345796 Uh, he gave me some...<br />What is it called? Mor...
7345880 7346964 -Morphine.<br />-Morphine.
7347673 7349592 Wow, you got<br />your merit badge now.
7349717 7351469 Yeah... Hey, I don't know<br />what that means.
7351552 7352511 (chuckles)
7353304 7355181 Plus, you know,<br />chicks dig scars.
7355264 7356932 Really? Hm.
7358809 7359977 Not that one.
7360853 7362563 -What?<br />-Don't even think about it.
7362646 7364065 How did you know<br />what I was thinking?
7364148 7366317 Did she... What, did she<br />say something to you?
7366484 7368611 I felt like we had a, um,<br />kind of a vibe.
7368694 7370488 Take it easy. That's just<br />the morphine kicking in.
7371030 7371989 Yeah.
7372573 7373574 Besides...
7374075 7375201 after all we've been through,
7376202 7377620 I'd hate to have to<br />beat you to death.
7377745 7378704 (chuckles)
7379538 7380581 That would suck.
7383250 7384835 -Good to go?<br />-Yeah, we're all set.
7384919 7386379 Okay. Take care of yourself.
7386587 7387797 I'll see you at the hospital.
7392635 7393552 Hey.
7395346 7396972 Thanks for saving<br />my daughter's life.
7397390 7398516 Hey...
7399850 7401060 What was I gonna do?
7403771 7405231 That's what makes you<br />that guy.
7407191 7408192 (chuckles softly)
7408901 7409902 Yeah.
7410486 7412196 (helicopter approaching)
7416492 7419078 So, um, did he say<br />anything about me?
7421455 7423457 Jesus, Lucy!
7423541 7425668 What? I-I'm sorry.<br />I'm just asking. I'm...
7427253 7428754 I'm in enough pain already.
