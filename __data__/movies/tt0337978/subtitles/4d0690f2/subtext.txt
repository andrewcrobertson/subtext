42290 44166 Well?
44250 47629 - I'm sending you the code.<br />- Yes, I see that. Thank you.
53843 56387 - What about my account?<br />- Delivering.
77491 80120 I just sent it. You should have it.
80203 83624 - Yes. Thank you.<br />- Are you sure this is legal?
83707 87211 We're just running a test<br />on our security system, sir. It's fine.
87294 90797 You've got a sexy voice.<br />Is there anything else I can do for you?
90881 92925 - To you?<br />- We have all we need.
103727 104811 We're ready.
114196 117783 Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.
124248 126458 - What'd you do to my drive?<br />- I didn't touch it.
126542 129503 This isn't cool.<br />Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
164539 168543 FBI CYBER-SECURITY DIVISION<br />WASHINGTON, D.C.
198281 201618 Diagnostics show no damage,<br />but this was an intentional breach.
201701 204621 - We were hacked?<br />- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,
204704 207498 but they definitely cracked our door.
207874 209876 OK. Open the Black Hat files.
209959 213963 I want every hacker in the country<br />who could have done this interviewed now.
214047 219135 Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This<br />holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.
219219 223223 We're the ones supposed to keep this from<br />happening, and it happened to us. Do it.
223306 225892 Sir, it's night.<br />They're all over the country.
225975 227853 Get local law enforcement help.
227937 233150 Somebody out there thinks they can<br />screw with us. I wanna find out who.
257591 261470 - Jim. I said no.<br />- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?
262346 263639 - Get out.<br />- What?
263722 265933 - Get out of the car now.<br />- Don't touch me.
266016 267893 - No means no.<br />- What are you doin'
267977 271438 - John, stop it.<br />- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.
271522 274149 - You know this guy?<br />- Just shut your mouth right now.
274233 276944 Dad. Stop it. I mean it.
277027 280072 - "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.<br />- What?
280823 283951 You told this jerk-off I was dead?<br />You actually said that?
284034 286912 I may have exaggerated a little bit.
288038 290291 And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?
290374 292501 - No.<br />- Yeah.
293210 296338 I don't know, OK?<br />I'm sorry. We'll see.
297506 299300 What are you doing here?
299383 303221 - You don't answer your phone, return calls.<br />- Because I'm not talking to you.
303305 308018 - Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?<br />- Why not? What? You want a list?
308101 312856 How about stuff like this: You spy on me,<br />you drag my boyfriend out of the car...
312939 314941 - You said he's not your boyfriend.<br />- He's not.
315025 318028 - I thought you said I just was.<br />- Shut up.
319988 322407 You are such an asshole.
323700 330081 OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"<br />out of the car, OK?
331958 335879 - Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.<br />- No, no.
335962 338340 - Will both of you go away?<br />- Just talk to me.
338423 341134 I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.
341218 344763 Damn right you're going to bed alone.
345305 348850 Lucy, honey, wait a minute.<br />I wanna talk to you. Just wait.
348934 351853 Dad, when I wanna talk to you -
352270 354272 if I wanna talk to you -
355982 357901 I'll call you.
357984 361279 Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.
361363 365075 - Lucy McClane.<br />- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.
367619 369704 Chicks, right?
373166 375378 I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
403823 405992 John?
406075 408494 John? It's Sclavino.
410204 414041 - Go for McClane.<br />- What are you doing at Rutgers?
414125 417587 - How do you know where I am?<br />- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.
417670 422049 - I'm staring at exactly where you are.<br />- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.
422133 425386 Yeah, we did that.<br />John, we turned them on.
425469 427847 Listen, the feds have called in a favour.
427930 432351 They're doing a sweep. They want us to<br />pick up some computer hacker in Camden.
432435 435563 Last name: Farrell.<br />First name: Matthew.
435646 438524 Whoa, whoa. Camden?<br />What are you telling me this for?
438608 442028 - Just came in.<br />- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.
442111 445072 Send ajughead from the Academy.<br />They'd be happy to do it.
445156 449661 I can't just send in a uniform.<br />The feds demanded a senior detective.
449745 452247 The kid's a high-value subject -<br />I don't know.
452331 456001 Just pick him up, escort him<br />to the Hoover Building in DC.
456084 459963 They had some kind of a computer breach<br />there this morning.
460047 462007 Great.
462090 467262 All right, give me that information.<br />Give me that name again. What is it?
467346 469139 You owe me one, Jack.
523111 524153 What?
534622 536583 Aw, come on.
543715 545592 Goddammit.
558855 561608 PLAN B. WE DO IT OURSELVES.
568990 573161 - Who is it?<br />- NYPD. Open the door, please.
580043 582462 - Hi.<br />- NYPD?
582545 587342 OK. I get it. Don't worry, everyone<br />gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...
587425 591221 I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?
591304 594599 No. He actually does not live here any more.
594682 598312 - Course not. Who are you?<br />- My name is Daisy Duke.
598395 603901 Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.<br />Please don't add to it.
603984 607821 - Can I see some identification, please?<br />- Yeah, sure.
611200 616247 "Detective". Yeah, that looks real.<br />You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.
616330 621043 - Then of course...<br />- Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.
622002 626423 Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of<br />the <i>Kill Zone Nine.</i> Wanna check it out?
626507 630970 No. Thanks, though, man.<br />And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.
631720 634181 Open the door.
634265 635683 Shit.
642022 644525 Can I get you something?<br />Coffee? A warrant?
644608 647861 - What's this about?<br />- I don't know. Some computer thing.
647945 650948 DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.
651448 654451 - Feds?<br />- Yeah. The feds.
662167 666630 I've been White Hat for four years,<br />but once you're on that goddamn list...
666714 668507 Such a pain in the ass.
668591 671011 You play with dolls?
671094 673471 - Could you not touch that?<br />- Like a GI Joe?
673555 676641 No, it's not. It's a limited edition,
676725 677517 and...
677601 681271 - That supposed to come off?<br />- No, but it's more valuable broken,
681354 685275 - so thanks for that.<br />- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.
685358 687611 I got some other cool shit you can break.
687694 691531 - Let's go, OK? Come on.<br />- I gotta power down my gear, OK?
694159 697787 More dolls. Not spending<br />a whole lot of time with the girls.
700457 702626 Are you really trying to escape?
703460 705128 Jesus, don't shoot.
705212 706630 Get down.
713094 715388 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Stay right there.
732239 733198 Go.

746629 750466 It's all right. Stay low, all right? Stay down.
750550 753970 - You stay with me, all right? Here we go.<br />- OK.
757807 759600 OK.
775491 777493 That'll wake the neighbours.
778703 780580 Get down. Get inside.
784625 787545 They're back in the room.<br />They're back in the room.
791090 794385 Are you nuts? Get outta there right now.
794468 796095 - I'm trying to...<br />- Now.
835761 837304 Get back in there.
886270 888355 Get ready to run.
922682 925935 - What the hell was that?<br />- What?
926019 929022 - Did you do that?<br />- No.
929105 932066 - Shit.<br />- I didn't do that. Come on.
932150 936696 - Shit.<br />- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.
938448 941784 Come on. Let's go.<br />Come on, let's go, goddammit.
943286 945330 Come on.
945413 947415 Watch it. Slow it down.
947498 951252 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
951336 953671 Let's go. Come on.
955131 957467 Come on, come on. Stay close.
968896 971565 Stay with me. Stay with me.
974652 976862 Come on, let's go. Stay close.
979031 981617 Get in the car. Go, go.
988249 990501 - Kid, can you reload a gun?<br />- What? Me?
990584 992878 - Can you reload a gun?<br />- I...
993963 997132 Open the glove box<br />and get a magazine out right now.
1001845 1004265 Grab the gun from the back seat.
1024034 1025619 You OK?
1034628 1036922 Get your head down.
1039508 1041803 Jesus! Is the circus in town?
1051938 1054232 - Did you see that?<br />- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.
1056693 1061489 Camden base, 10077. Come back.<br />Camden base, 10077.
1061573 1062991 Go ahead.
1063074 1066953 I need to speak to your chief of your<br />detectives. Police emergency, asap.
1067037 1068538 Stand by.
1068622 1073043 - This is Chief Detective Wiesman.<br />- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.
1073126 1077505 Police emergency. I wanna report<br />a police shooting in yourjurisdiction.
1093230 1094272 YOU TELL HER.
1097901 1100237 - Yeah?<br />- What's the status?
1100654 1102155 WE DIDN'T GET HIM.
1102697 1104157 THREE OF OUR MEN ARE DOWN.
1106076 1107494 Wait one.
1128432 1133771 Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.<br />Farrell's still alive.
1135106 1137525 - So he got away.<br />- Yeah.
1137608 1139986 I did send five of you, is that right?
1141821 1146742 I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll<br />track 'em down. Think you can handle that?
1151455 1154625 - Oh, my God.<br />- Just breathe.
1154709 1158129 I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.
1158212 1161090 It's the adrenaline.<br />You're just scared. It'll pass.
1161173 1165344 Yeah, I'm scared.<br />Weren't you scared, back there?
1165428 1168639 Yeah. I was scared.
1168723 1173436 Really? This is you being scared?<br />I don't know, cos you seem really calm.
1173519 1175771 Have you done stuff like that before?
1175855 1179525 - Stuff like what?<br />- Like killing people.
1181235 1184780 Yeah. But not for a long time.
1185781 1188994 So who were those guys?<br />Why were they trying to kill you?
1189077 1192497 Why did they blow up<br />my goddamn apartment?
1192581 1195542 They were there to kill you.
1195626 1200797 - Why would they want to kill me?<br />- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.
1215979 1219858 We got seven dead hackers so far,<br />none of whom were high on our list.
1219942 1223654 - Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.<br />- Yes, sir.
1228158 1231495 Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.
1231578 1233413 On it.
1235540 1237918 What's with all the guns?
1238418 1240712 Operational prudence.
1241296 1245342 Think of them as hardware to your software.
1255978 1260774 Good morning, DC. It's shaping up<br />to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.
1260857 1265697 If you've got any big plans, get started<br />early, cos the traffic is ramping up.
1265780 1269492 So here's another golden oldie<br />for all the commuters out there.
1271619 1274330 What? What... What...
1274414 1276708 What are you doing? What is that?
1276791 1278751 - It's Creedence.<br />- Creedence?
1278835 1283006 Creedence. Creedence Clearwater<br />Revival? Classic rock?
1283089 1286342 I know who it is. It's old rock.<br />Doesn't make it classic.
1286426 1289387 - What sucked then sucks now.<br />- You don't like Creedence?
1289470 1292640 This is like having a pine cone<br />shoved in my ass.
1293308 1296561 OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.
1296644 1298605 Come on. I'm cooperating with you.
1301274 1304527 We're at a heading of 060.<br />Making another pass.
1307906 1310658 Listen up, everyone.<br />Are we ready?
1311451 1314454 Transportation hubs are prepped and set.
1314537 1316581 Begin stage one.
1334015 1335684 What? Nothing.
1349531 1355287 When'd you last turn on the radio and listen<br />to popular music? Just give me a decade.
1355371 1359458 The '70s? I'm guessing.<br />Was Michael Jackson still black?
1359541 1362503 Pearl Jam.<br />I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.
1362586 1364505 20 years. The Cure? Nothin'
1364588 1369927 It's called news radio. I want to see if your<br />friends from Camden made the headlines.
1370010 1372388 Hold on. You listen to the news?
1372471 1375558 You got a problem with the news now?
1375641 1378686 Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem<br />with the news.
1378769 1382481 Ready for this?<br />The news is completely manipulated.
1382565 1385776 Everything you hear, every single day,
1385859 1391031 is designed by corporate media to do<br />one thing only: To keep you living in fear.
1391115 1392992 - Fear?<br />- Total fear.
1393075 1397204 So you'll go out and spend money<br />on things you probably don't even need,
1397288 1400040 so advertisers<br />keep buying ads on their stations.
1400124 1404169 I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this<br />all day. I got days of data at home...
1404253 1406338 I'll drop a bomb on you...
1406422 1408173 - What?<br />- Shut up.
1408257 1411636 That's good. Be dismissive instead of...
1463355 1466066 - You all right?<br />- No, I'm not all right.
1466733 1469736 Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.
1471947 1474074 Hey, man. Hey.
1474908 1477827 You all right? Don't move.<br />Just call 911, all right?
1477911 1479913 OK.
1481331 1482791 Jesus Christ.
1503980 1506524 All the lights are green.
1506607 1509277 All the lights are green.<br />Let's go. Right now.
1509360 1512488 - We gotta go?<br />- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.
1514615 1517368 - Let's go.<br />- I've never been in a car accident.
1517451 1519787 Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.
1519870 1521706 - You been in a car accident?<br />- Yeah.
1521789 1522999 What are we doing?
1523082 1527712 It's a little thing they invented in the '60s<br />called jogging. You're gonna love it.
1537054 1541183 Sir, Chicago's reporting<br />a systems crash on the el train network.
1544979 1548107 Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash<br />in their com system.
1548190 1552445 FAAjust issued a critical alert.<br />Their ATC net just went down.
1552528 1554530 We're under attack.
1556240 1558994 OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.
1570088 1572299 That's the anthrax alarm.
1574176 1577095 All right, everyone out. Now. Now.
1579848 1582893 Taylor, move. Go. Move.
1597574 1602955 All personnel must evacuate and proceed<br />to the transportation shuttles immediately.
1603038 1605040 This is not a drill.
1605123 1611129 All personnel must evacuate and proceed<br />to the transportation shuttles immediately.
1630357 1631985 We need you inside, sir.
1638116 1642787 Take your team. I want men<br />on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.
1645039 1646624 We gotta know what's there.
1646708 1650128 Run a trunk search on these data crashes,<br />try to ID the point of origin.
1653131 1655216 Begin stage two.
1661389 1664475 What's going on?
1670523 1673109 They're already starting to panic.
1676070 1678281 Of course they are.
1678364 1680909 They think that someone's<br />taking their money.
1680992 1684746 All those nickels and dimes they saved<br />had meaning.
1684829 1687874 "Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.
1688833 1690877 Prep the video package.
1703431 1708604 DC transportation system's crashing and<br />they just hit the financial sector. All of it.
1708687 1713484 Get me the secretary for trans and treasury<br />on the line and the chairman of the SEC.
1713567 1717988 Let's go, people. Somewhere<br />somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.
1718614 1721909 - Deputy Director Bowman in here?<br />- Not now. It'll have to wait.
1721992 1726121 Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.<br />I brought him here on orders from Bowman.
1726205 1729333 If you don't know what's goin' on,<br />find somebody that does.
1729416 1730626 I'm Bowman.
1736507 1739385 Video package is ready for upload.
1742805 1745182 John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,
1745266 1748269 but we are neck-deep<br />in damage control right now.
1748352 1752523 Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have<br />anything to eat, any snacks around?
1752606 1755109 I'd love...<br />I've got really low blood sugar...
1755192 1757486 - Sir?<br />- No?
1761115 1766078 As if the transportation breakdown and<br />anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,
1766161 1769248 the stock market<br />found itself in a selling frenzy.
1769331 1772251 The FTC believes this panic<br />might have been triggered
1772334 1775713 by a computer malfunction<br />in the stock exchange.
1775796 1778925 Man, that is all bad.
1779009 1783179 It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills<br />to prepare for things like this.
1783972 1785932 - These your suspects?<br />- Were.
1786016 1788643 All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.
1790562 1793064 Recognise any of these people?
1794566 1795901 No.
1795984 1797777 Not one?
1797861 1800780 Sir, we got a system error.
1812375 1814836 - My fellow Americans...<br />...it is time to...
1814920 1818048 strike... fear... into...<br />the hearts of... citizenry.
1819090 1821593 - Ask not...<br />- That's an unauthorised broadcast.
1821676 1824679 ...what your country can do...<br />to avert... this... crisis.
1824763 1827557 - The answer is...<br />...nothing whatsoever.
1827641 1831144 Our military... strength...<br />is... in this case...
1831228 1832520 ...useless.
1833230 1836149 Read my lips.
1836650 1841613 The... great... confident... roar...<br />of... American... progress... and... growth...
1841696 1844366 has come to... an end.
1844449 1848620 All the... vital... technology...<br />that... this nation... holds dear...
1848703 1852833 all... communications... transportation...<br />the internet... connectivity...
1852917 1855962 electrical... power...<br />critical... utilities...
1856587 1860883 their... fate... now... rests...<br />in... our... hands.
1860967 1864470 We will not tire, we will not falter,
1864554 1866347 and we will not fail.
1866430 1869183 I don't know how they're getting in.
1869267 1870142 Thank you.
1870226 1873020 And a... happy Independence Day...<br />to everyone.
1876774 1878609 That was creepy.
1878693 1880570 I tried to find more Nixon.
1881320 1883281 Think they bought it?
1883364 1885408 Absolutely.
1888077 1891289 OK, I want telecom, transportation...
1891372 1894166 - Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.<br />- What?
1895042 1898129 It's a fire sale.
1898212 1900798 - We don't know that yet.<br />- It's a myth, anyway.
1900881 1905303 It's a myth? Really? Please tell me<br />she's actually not in charge of anything.
1905386 1907346 What's a fire sale?
1907430 1911893 It's a three-step systematic attack<br />on the entire national infrastructure.
1911976 1916355 Step one: Take out transportation.<br />Step two: The financial base and telecoms.
1916439 1920359 Step three: Get rid of all the utilities -<br />gas, water electric, nuclear...
1920443 1924906 Anything that's run by computers,<br />which today is almost everything.
1924989 1928076 That's why they call it a fire sale -<br />everything must go.
1928160 1930662 Listen. What's your name? Farrell?
1930746 1934917 Keep your voice down, OK?<br />No one here's talking about a fire sale.
1935000 1939046 Not unless you're telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1939129 1941465 No, man. I'm just saying...
1941548 1944176 Appreciate your concern.<br />We're on it. Thank you.
1944259 1947221 - You've done a bang-up job so far.<br />- What? What?
1947304 1951141 Nothing. I said I understand.
1951225 1956647 They didn't send the girl scouts out to get this<br />kid. They sent professionals, full tactical gear.
1956730 1962444 They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,<br />and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -
1962527 1964780 but somebody wants this kid dead,
1964863 1969076 and obviously it's got something to do<br />with whatever's going on here.
1969159 1972621 OK. Homeland's interrogating<br />the hackers we're bringing in.
1972704 1975624 I'll get you an escort over there. All right?
1975707 1981088 Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.<br />I wanna know what he knows.
1981171 1984258 If he knew half the shit I know,<br />his head would explode.
1984883 1987302 Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.
1987386 1991014 - Agent Johnson?<br />- That's right. Right this way.
1991098 1995602 Great. So is any of that actually possible,<br />what you were saying back there?
1995686 2000232 Is it possible? Look, you take out<br />any one thing, the system can recover.
2000316 2005738 If you take it all down at once, the system<br />crashes and... Look around, man.
2005822 2010493 Come on. Government's gotta have dozens<br />of departments dedicated to that shit.
2010577 2014831 It took FEMA five days<br />to get water to the Superdome.
2037896 2040523 How long till we get to DHS?
2040607 2045403 Laughlin, get on the DC police band<br />and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.
2045486 2048448 DC Metro, this is the FBI<br />requesting you to clear a route...
2052368 2054495 Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.
2055371 2057665 - Feds are taking him to Homeland.<br />- Good.
2057749 2060543 - Close that loop, now.<br />- Isolate the frequency.
2060627 2065131 Get us a location on the vehicles<br />and pull me up a file on this John McClane.
2065214 2068343 Rand, we just found Farrell.<br />Stand by for a location.
2072513 2076518 I don't mean to harp, but we just passed<br />another Arby's, and I'm starving.
2076602 2078771 - I could eat a wrapper.<br />- Shut up.
2078854 2082066 - I could just get some ketchup packets.<br />- Shut up.
2082149 2084944 You got about 14 minutes<br />to tell me why you lied to me.
2085027 2087404 Lied to you? What are you talking about?
2087488 2089865 The pictures on the wall -<br />you knew those guys.
2089949 2092576 - I don't...<br />- Kid, don't lie to me.
2092660 2095871 I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.<br />Who were they?
2098707 2101418 OK. OK, OK.
2103671 2106799 They were my competition.
2109176 2111679 Make the next right onto Concord.
2111762 2115099 They said they'd developed<br />a mutating encryption algorithm
2115182 2117601 and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.
2117685 2121146 That's what I do. I do math-based security.
2125442 2130114 Here's the thing. To pull off something<br />as massive and crazy as a fire sale,
2130197 2134285 you need tons of guys to write programs,<br />but only a few Black Hats to implement it.
2134368 2138998 At that point the start-up guys, who haven't<br />really done anything wrong, like me...
2139081 2141542 Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.
2141625 2147047 I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you<br />I had no idea I was gonna be...
2147631 2150135 an accessory to Armageddon.
2150719 2152721 Take the next left at Lexington.
2152804 2156975 And that's a sexy voice.<br />What's she taking us this way for?
2157058 2158727 - Unit 510.<br />- Oh, my God.
2158810 2161938 Clear a route for two FBI vehicles<br />approaching on Concord.
2162022 2163315 Copy, dispatch.
2163398 2164858 That's her.
2164941 2166985 - Her who?<br />- What are you talking about?
2169112 2171406 - It's them.<br />- You're saying it's "them" them?
2171489 2175410 I swear to you I know her.<br />I would know her voice anywhere.
2176494 2180999 - No, don't say anything...<br />- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.
2181082 2183668 Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?
2183752 2188173 Gotta be pretty crazy over there,<br />what with all those 587s.
2188256 2191259 Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.
2192427 2196556 You had to dispatch all units<br />for all the naked people walking around?
2196640 2200101 Cut the bullshit, honey,<br />and just put your boss on.
2202395 2205690 Laughlin, we're getting off this route.<br />Turn left on 14th Street.
2214491 2218495 - Officer McClane.<br />- It's Detective McClane, asshole.
2218578 2223793 Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get<br />to know each other when I visit you in prison.
2223876 2227213 But, John, I already know<br />so much about you.
2227296 2229423 Your address in Brooklyn,
2229507 2234178 the payments on your mortgage, how long<br />you've been a member of the NYPD.
2234262 2236013 And how's Holly?
2236097 2240351 That's sad. You're divorced.<br />Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?
2242353 2248442 Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought<br />you'd have a better pension plan annuity.
2248526 2250653 And it gets worse.
2252947 2256033 Your 401k no longer exists.
2256117 2260538 - Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.<br />- Box them in at that intersection.
2260621 2263708 Shoot Mr Farrell in the head<br />and drive away,
2263791 2266502 and by the time you reach<br />the end of the next block
2266586 2272174 all your debts will be wiped clean<br />and your children will be set for life.
2272258 2275845 Now, that really is tempting,<br />especially that last part,
2275928 2279056 but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.
2280057 2284395 John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.
2284478 2286314 You're gonna lose.
2286397 2290276 Yeah, well, the other thing that could<br />happen is I could come and find you,
2290359 2293946 kick your ass and throw you out of<br />your own party. What about that?
2294030 2296325 Hold your position.
2298660 2300746 He's not responding.
2303665 2306293 Get down. Get right down.
2311089 2312883 Just stay down.
2316762 2320432 Officers down at the corner of<br />Main and Constitution. Officers down.
2338450 2340827 Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.
2342829 2346041 Goddammit. Just stay down!
2351546 2353840 Get down. Just hang on.
2364017 2367938 Base, we've got a squad car under fire.<br />We need backup.
2368021 2370692 This is base. We're sending backup.
2375196 2377490 Just brace yourself.
2392714 2393840 Hang on.
2410607 2412150 Hang on.
2421910 2423536 Yeah!
2428583 2431711 - We lost the tail.<br />- Stay with them.
2441179 2442931 - They're back.<br />- I know.
2446101 2447686 Take the tunnel. Left.
2453984 2455778 God, what are you... Oh, God!
2464620 2466747 Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.
2466830 2468374 The tunnel!
2477841 2481387 Open the gates on the north side entrance.
2487476 2489478 Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.
2506620 2509331 - Now open the other side.<br />- What?
2509415 2510708 Move.
2514962 2516338 Hang onto something.
2553293 2556671 Don't get out of the car. Don't...
2563428 2565680 Just stay there. Stand still.
2575774 2578068 Run. Run.
2585116 2586201 Oh, God.
2591791 2593542 Don't hesitate like that again.
2593626 2595461 Can you help me get my wife...
2595544 2598005 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2598089 2602134 - You OK?<br />- I can't move my arms.
2602218 2605429 - Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.<br />- What?
2605513 2608182 "It can't be a uniform, John. No."
2608933 2612812 Get over to the wall, sir.<br />"Feds called in a favour."
2614272 2620111 "All you gotta do is go pick up a kid<br />down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."
2620194 2624657 "How hard can that be?<br />It can't be that hard, can it?"
2624740 2628452 "No, gotta be a senior detective."
2632582 2636836 Think a traffic jam,<br />throwing a car at me's gonna stop me?
2636919 2639088 Rand, get in there and get it done.
2639171 2641132 WE DON'T HAVE TO. HE'S COMING TO US.
2653227 2655479 This is not a good idea.
2693727 2696521 - Don't touch me, don't touch me.<br />- OK, sorry, sorry.
2696605 2698857 Are you OK? Oh, my God.
2701652 2705364 - Pretty lucky shot.<br />- Yeah, lucky. That was...
2705447 2707699 You just killed a helicopter with a car.
2707783 2709910 I was out of bullets.
2712788 2716833 - How you doin'<br />- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...
2718335 2723799 - Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.<br />- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.
2733392 2735477 Rand, check in.
2736770 2737980 THE CHOPPER'S DOWN.
2738063 2740775 What about Farrell and McClane?
2741651 2742902 THEY'R E HISTORY.
2743236 2744362 Come back in.
2744445 2746573 OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.
2746656 2750118 I just spoke to Emerson.<br />The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
2750201 2754581 Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.
2761462 2763506 ID, sir.
2764048 2766384 Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.
2766467 2768886 Man the gate. You're with me.
2775560 2781524 Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.<br />Below that you'll need DOD clearance.
2781608 2785778 I don't know why you'd need to go further.<br />There's nothin' down there but servers.
2791618 2795496 Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.
2810303 2812096 - Gate secured.<br />- Copy.
2821857 2822942 OK, we are in.
2857810 2859019 This is insane.
2859103 2862064 This is absurd.
2862147 2867486 Man, there's tough and there's stupid.<br />You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.
2868028 2870114 I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.
2870197 2872199 - Yeah. Sexy, right?<br />- No.
2872283 2873576 Come on.
2873659 2876203 We don't need a doctor.<br />We need the cops.
2904566 2906943 He's in.
2907027 2909821 Get outta the way.<br />Make a hole, please. Come on.
2909905 2914451 Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />Come on.
2914534 2917621 NYPD. All right? I got this kid.<br />Come on. Let's go, kid.
2923168 2924961 Excuse me. Thanks.
2925045 2927464 NYPD. NYPD.
2927547 2929633 Coming through.
2929716 2930926 Sergeant?
2931009 2934012 Sergeant. I need to speak to you.
2934095 2939017 - The medic's in the back.<br />- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.
2939100 2941478 Just give me a minute.
2941561 2943897 Sergeant.
2947400 2949402 Oh, my God.
2955283 2957869 Let's get outta here.
2971509 2973427 We're a go.
2973511 2975596 Launch the downloads.
2985189 2988025 - Nothing's happening.<br />- Be patient.
2989986 2993573 - I don't know. It's not responding.<br />- Wait for it.
2998619 3001080 See? There you go.
3002873 3005793 - Tell me when the download reaches 20%.<br />- OK.
3008004 3010298 I need you to please remain calm.
3013009 3015094 Excuse me.
3016137 3020308 - Excuse me. Thank you.<br />- Holy shit.
3020391 3022643 - Kid? Kid, hey.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3022727 3025271 - You got a phone in that bag?<br />- Yeah.
3025354 3027356 Come on. Let's go.
3030651 3035073 And here you go, Agent Tovarek.<br />Guess that's you.
3056845 3060015 - Download's at 20%.<br />- Time to move.
3060098 3063185 Let's keep them chasing their tails.
3078033 3082996 Due to recent activity, law enforcement<br />agencies are being cautious.
3083080 3087542 They are telling drivers to abandon<br />their vehicles until they are searched.
3087626 3091630 And, as you can see,<br />canine units are checking each vehicle.
3091713 3095175 Whether this is connected to<br />the anthrax reports we heard earlier
3095259 3097636 or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...
3097719 3100138 - FAAjust grounded all flights.<br />- Good.
3100222 3105769 We have complete access over networks -<br />phones, power grids, water, nuclear.
3105852 3108063 - Excuse me.<br />- Jack Parry, NSA.
3108146 3111901 Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.<br />White House made the call.
3111985 3115905 - Anything you need, we're here to help.<br />- Help? Wow, that's great.
3115989 3120743 We're gonna need some work space<br />for our people. What can you do for us?
3120827 3126082 As you can see, we're using the space, so<br />you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.
3126165 3129377 If I need something, I'll just wave to you.
3151941 3154819 - Wait. No, don't call.<br />- What are you talkin' about?
3154903 3158615 They probably cracked that hours ago.<br />They could trace us. Put it away.
3158698 3160491 - You sure?<br />- Yes.
3160575 3163828 Or smash it. You didn't have to smash it.
3163912 3166664 Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
3166748 3169792 He'll call you right back.
3169876 3172629 Here, right in here. Come here.
3172712 3174547 - You got a signal?<br />- Yeah.
3176132 3179302 - Yeah.<br />- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.
3179385 3181679 Sir, John McClane is on the line.
3183015 3185267 - McClane, go.<br />- We never made it to DHS.
3185351 3188145 They came after the kid again.<br />All your men are down.
3190731 3193609 - What about Farrell?<br />- I got him with me right now.
3193692 3195778 - Sir?<br />- Hang on, John.
3195861 3197947 Yeah, I'll hold on.
3202534 3204161 Another day in paradise.
3204245 3209458 They just swarmed into everything -<br />the telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.
3221887 3224390 They're blanketing every station.
3250791 3254920 - Can you put the news back on?<br />- This is the news. It's on every channel.
3255004 3259134 Been this way for a few minutes now.
3274482 3276443 Oh, my God.
3284367 3286077 McClane.
3286995 3288121 Look out.
3288288 3289789 Look out.
3291041 3292584 Look out.
3294210 3296379 Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?
3296463 3298798 Bowman, it's a fake.
3302928 3304596 I see it.
3305472 3307474 Thank God.
3308934 3310769 Shit.
3310852 3312687 - McClane?<br />- Bowman.
3318401 3320737 Satellite's down. Get me a land line.
3336045 3341509 I wrote one little piece of code and the<br />world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.
3341592 3343719 - What?<br />- You know, it's crazy.
3343803 3346514 The first time I heard of the concept<br />of a fire sale
3346597 3350601 I actually thought it would be cool<br />if anyone ever really did it.
3350685 3356482 Just hit the reset button<br />and melt the system just for fun.
3356566 3359986 It's not a system. It's a country.
3360069 3363364 You're talkin' about people,<br />a whole country full of people,
3363447 3366993 sitting at home alone, scared to death<br />in their houses, all right?
3367076 3373332 So finish your nostalgic moment and think<br />a little bit and help me catch these guys.
3373416 3377420 Just help me.<br />Just put yourself in their shoes.
3378546 3382300 Come on. If this were your fire sale,<br />what would be your next move?
3382383 3388180 OK, well, the whole point of a fire sale<br />is that it's mostly done by remote, right?
3388264 3393269 But not everything is run completely online.<br />Major utilities aren't.
3393352 3397231 They're run by closed circuits,<br />so you could breach the security,
3397315 3401485 but to shut it down you'd have to<br />physically go there. You'd have to show up.
3401569 3403404 And...
3404323 3406867 - Give me that guy's PDA.<br />- Phones are all dead.
3406950 3412539 No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta<br />reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.
3412623 3417210 Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what<br />these guys are using to talk to each other.
3417294 3419046 How do you know all this stuff?
3419129 3423467 Dude, I don't know. There's a lot<br />rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.
3423550 3426303 OK. National power grid.
3426386 3429932 Gas and electric is divided into three zones -<br />Eastern, Central, Western -
3430015 3432559 each with a primary hub.
3432643 3434728 Here it is.
3435896 3438690 - What are we looking at?<br />- That is the Eastern hub.
3438774 3444279 Now, they take this out, wipes out all<br />the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.
3444363 3446823 But, again, you'd have to do it manually.
3446907 3451870 - OK. Come on. Let's go.<br />- What? To West Virginia?
3451954 3455958 I honestly don't think I can handle<br />any more people trying to kill me. McClane.
3456041 3458335 - You get used to it.<br />- McClane. Shit.
3458418 3463048 Sir, wireless networks are down<br />and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.
3463131 3466260 I don't care how, you find me a line.
3466343 3469638 - Come on, what you got?<br />- We swept the building. Seems clean.
3469721 3474393 - We can sweep it again...<br />- Don't bother. Don't bother.
3474476 3477813 It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.
3477896 3480567 OK, get everyone back inside<br />the crisis centre now.
3480650 3482360 OK, let's open it up.
3485196 3487865 - Come on, get in.<br />- Door's locked.
3488741 3492495 Unless you have an extra gun<br />I can use to unlock it.
3493955 3497166 Don't do that. You're gonna disable it.
3498418 3499877 Jesus Christ!
3501296 3503256 That was crazy. Did you see that?
3503339 3507594 Sorry about that, man.<br />I didn't know it'd come out so fast.
3508803 3512223 Man, this is a pain in the ass.<br />How'd you do yours?
3515393 3518479 You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?
3518563 3520481 Sorry.
3523443 3527780 No, please don't touch those, OK?<br />I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.
3527864 3530700 I mean, I've read about it.
3530783 3533828 RoadAssist. We've detected<br />an air-bag deployment.
3533912 3538458 Yes. Please, we just hit a tree<br />and my dad is having a heart attack.
3538541 3541002 I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.
3541085 3543880 Hold while we contact emergency services.
3543963 3549052 No, no. He's dying. I can get him<br />to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.
3549135 3554183 But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta<br />start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...
3554266 3556894 - Your name, please?<br />- I'm...
3557645 3560856 My name is... Frank,
3560940 3565653 and my dad's name is... is...
3566987 3570241 Dvorak Tsajanski.
3571575 3575412 Please... Please, just help us.<br />We need your help. Please.
3575496 3577706 Emergency services are on their way.
3577790 3580584 No, no, listen to me.<br />Ma'am, what is your name?
3580668 3582378 - Dolores.<br />- Dolores?
3582461 3585714 OK, Dolores, I don't know<br />if you have a dad, but I do,
3585798 3588133 and I wanna be able to say that<br />a year from now.
3588217 3592221 Because my dad is my hero,<br />and right now he is in my arms dying,
3592304 3596558 and his only hope is to get to a hospital<br />right now. We can't wait.
3596642 3598978 So please start the goddamn car.
3603440 3605234 Thank you, Dolores.
3605317 3607778 Pass the PDA. I gotta call the Warlock.
3607861 3611448 - The what?<br />- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.
3629217 3633013 - Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.<br />- FBI. We suspect a security breach.
3633096 3635890 You can't land here without authorisa...
3655410 3658163 That was pretty good back there, kid.
3658246 3659789 Thanks.
3659873 3663585 What's the matter with you?<br />Nothing else to complain about?
3663668 3666171 No. I'm just...
3666254 3670967 - Well, what? What's the matter with you?<br />- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.
3671051 3673595 What's that mean? Like what?
3673678 3678433 I'm not, like, heroic and everything.<br />I'm not brave like you are.
3678516 3681227 - I'm not that guy.<br />- I'm nobody's hero, kid.
3681311 3683939 You've saved my life, like,<br />ten times in six hours.
3684022 3687234 Just doing my job, that's all.
3688777 3693657 Know what you get for being a hero?<br />Nothing. You get shot at.
3693740 3697827 You get a little pat on the back,<br />blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.
3700456 3702708 You get divorced.
3702792 3705878 A wife that can't remember your last name.
3705962 3708381 Your kids don't wanna talk to you.
3709632 3712802 You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.
3712885 3716472 Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.
3717014 3720977 - Then why are you doin' this?<br />- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.
3721060 3724146 If there was somebody else to do it,<br />I would let them do it.
3724230 3727191 But there's not. So we're doin' it.
3729110 3731404 And that's what makes you that guy.
3740288 3742290 Thing's flying now.
3742373 3745293 Contact Emerson.<br />Tell him we'll be there soon.
3751966 3755678 What the hell are you doing?<br />This whole floor's restricted acc...
3780287 3782831 Stay here.
3811735 3813820 All right, come on.
3832339 3835300 - We're in.<br />- Good. Shut it down.
3845811 3848022 Guess you were right, kid.
3848106 3851359 OK, that's awful.
3853069 3854862 We got company.
3863746 3866165 - How would they shut down a power grid?<br />- What?
3866249 3870378 - Come on.<br />- Central control room. OK...
3871921 3875133 - Fourth floor. Fourth floor.<br />- Come on.
3877510 3880138 You take the right.
3884017 3886019 Shit.
3888521 3890607 - Can we stop for...<br />- Try to keep up.
3890690 3893860 I am. I just wanna stop for two seconds<br />to catch our breath.
3893943 3897363 You know, they have these things<br />called gymnasiums.
3918217 3920845 Come on, let's go. Let's go.
3933108 3935819 Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.
3935903 3938781 It's the only way<br />to avoid signal triangulation.
3938864 3941283 With the amount of hardware they're running,
3941367 3946038 we're probably looking for a large vehicle,<br />most likely a semitrailer rig.
3946121 3948832 All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security
3948916 3952836 we need every agent, satellite<br />and functioning network they got. Now.
3972231 3973941 Play time's over, sweetheart.
3974024 3975192 Don't.
3975276 3977778 Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.
3978529 3980614 Stand up.
3986745 3989164 Go on. Now.
3989248 3992001 Let's go, kid. You're up.
3992084 3993752 OK...
3995338 3996965 As fast as you can.
4000010 4001136 Jesus!
4017944 4020030 That's enough of this kung fu shit.
4020113 4024534 I've known some bitches in my day,<br />but you are maybe the...
4029664 4031666 Still awake?
4031750 4034002 - Just keep doin' what you're doin'<br />- OK.
4034085 4036630 - How much time do you need?<br />- Not much.
4050018 4052604 - Are you done?<br />- I...
4052687 4054606 - Are you done?<br />- No, not quite.
4054689 4057692 - What?<br />- I'm not exactly checking my email here.
4059027 4062489 They used VM mode, so I'm isolating<br />their API and booting the host.
4062572 4065951 - What?<br />- It means about 30 seconds, OK?
4066034 4068411 Not the easiest thing to do when...
4081175 4082843 OK...
4083761 4085972 Undo everything you just did. Now.
4086055 4088266 OK. OK, OK.
4089016 4093229 I'm a righty, I'm a righty.<br />I need my other hand, I really do.
4094146 4095606 I'm a righty.
4129015 4131892 One last door to open.
4131976 4135980 Do you know what you're doing? Do you<br />realise what this'll do to the country?
4136063 4140151 Yes, I do. Now open the door.
4140234 4143780 OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.
4150245 4153123 You do? I'm glad you know.
4168972 4170933 How you doin'
4179942 4181610 Hang on.
4254892 4257979 Listen, let's just talk about this<br />for one second.
4262567 4265612 How you doin'<br />That's not too tight, is it?
4268615 4270575 Damn it.
4272535 4274579 Smile pretty.
4308364 4309490 McClane!
4311784 4313577 Shit.
4314203 4316789 McClane, get out of there.
4317957 4320209 Come on, man. Come on.
4323629 4326340 Come on, man.
4346485 4348153 Did you see that?
4352074 4354076 So you stopped it, right?
4354159 4357538 You know, a gun to your head<br />makes it harder to do this kind of work.
4357621 4361041 - What?<br />- I know that comes as a surprise.
4363919 4367340 - Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?<br />- I'm not sure.
4369676 4372470 I might be able to slow 'em down, though.
4374306 4378602 Western and Central hubs are ours.<br />We're just waiting on Mai's end.
4378685 4382397 Hang on. Something's up.<br />All the security's reactivating.
4383565 4388612 I think someone might be in the market<br />for some cheap Viagra.
4388695 4393491 Now your girlfriend's dead,<br />why don't you check out our sexy singles?
4394242 4396036 It's an e-bomb.
4408298 4409799 All right, wait, wait.
4413595 4416139 - Mai, talk to me. What's going on?<br />- Mai?
4417098 4421144 Yeah - little Asian chick, likes to kick people?
4421227 4425106 I don't think she's gonna be talking<br />to anybody for a really long time.
4425190 4430612 Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom<br />of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.
4431488 4434532 What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?
4434616 4438161 Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.
4439997 4444460 Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna<br />come and I'm gonna kick your ass.
4444543 4450675 You have no idea who I am<br />or what I'm capable of.
4450758 4453427 When I'm finished here -<br />and I promise it'll be soon -
4453511 4457306 I will focus all my attention on you.
4458599 4461394 You wanna make things personal, fine.
4481455 4486919 Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas<br />in the pipelines to that station.
4487503 4492133 - Can you get Bowman on this thing?<br />- Sure. I can get anyone on it.
4492216 4493384 Do it.
4493467 4495344 - Now?<br />- Yeah, now.
4498973 4500933 Please, no.
4501892 4503853 - It's Thomas Gabriel.<br />- Shit.
4505563 4508816 - You know this guy?<br />- I worked with him.
4508899 4512446 He was DOD's chief programmer<br />for infrastructure security.
4512529 4516575 After 9/11, he's the guy that told<br />Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.
4516658 4520787 He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't<br />listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.
4520871 4522497 You think so?
4522581 4525792 When he tried to go public,<br />they crucified him.
4525876 4530088 Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.<br />After that he disappeared.
4530172 4532591 We got a pretty serious problem.
4532674 4534843 Hold on one minute.<br />What?
4534927 4538972 I think we need to get out of here right now.
4539056 4542601 - They're sending the gas lines here.<br />- Gas lines? What gas lines?
4542684 4543810 Christ.
4545562 4549566 All of them. See that,<br />those flashing arrows? That's not good.
4549650 4553195 - All that's coming here?<br />- Yeah. I think we gotta go.
4553278 4556698 Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.
4556782 4559201 McClane? McClane?
4559284 4561620 Let's go. Finish this up.
4567209 4570587 Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.
4589774 4591276 Get in there.
4637280 4640158 You OK?
4643786 4647916 - Let's go. We gotta get outta here.<br />- What is the point? Man, what is the point?
4647999 4650293 Knock that off, come on.
4650376 4655965 This has something to do with that code you<br />wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.
4656049 4659802 Win? When do we start winning?
4659886 4664224 Look around. Are you out of your mind?<br />Does it look like we're close to winning?
4664308 4666810 We just got the shit kicked out of us.
4666894 4668979 You think I'm holding out on you?
4669063 4673067 If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you.<br />I would happily tell you.
4673734 4675527 Jesus.
4711772 4714775 The Warlock. The Warlock.
4714858 4717903 Great. There goes the cellphone.
4717987 4721615 - They knocked satellites out of the skies?<br />- No, your battery ran out.
4721699 4723492 - We should go see him.<br />- Who?
4723576 4726370 The Warlock. We should drive<br />to his house in Baltimore.
4726453 4730249 - Can't go to the Warlock's house now.<br />- This is me helping you.
4730332 4735714 OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.<br />That's our only hope.
4740051 4744097 - How do you feel about flying?<br />- About what? Like, with a pilot?
4751646 4754399 - Just stick it in the round thing.<br />- What brown thing?
4754482 4757277 Here, put these on.
4757360 4759946 Just stick it in there. That'll work.
4760030 4764034 - You OK?<br />- Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.
4764117 4766578 - I used to be terrified of flying.<br />- Really?
4766661 4770123 Yeah. I took some lessons.<br />Face your fears, that kind of thing.
4770206 4773168 - Yeah? Did it help?<br />- Not really.
4778048 4781009 - Is it supposed to make that sound?<br />- Yeah.
4782636 4787140 - Maybe we should just drive.<br />- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.
4787223 4788767 Really? I heard...
4788850 4793355 - To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.<br />- Ha, ha, ha. You did? Really?
4793438 4797859 But you have your licence, right?<br />I mean, you can fly one of these things?
4797943 4801529 - Oh, God.<br />- Here we go. We're up.
4801613 4803490 Oh, God.
4807786 4810665 That's good. That's pretty good.
4811958 4815044 Jesus, look at that.<br />This whole area's blacked out.
4817171 4819465 How we gonna find Warlock's house?
4819548 4822760 It's probably gonna be<br />the one with the lights still on.
4830685 4835982 Power outage keeps spreading. About half<br />the East Coast has already gone down.
4836065 4839568 All right. Put everything<br />on emergency generators.
4839652 4842154 How the hell are they getting past us?
4845866 4847994 OK. Down there, down there. I see it.
4848077 4849787 - Down there?<br />- Left. Down.
4853666 4856669 What? Are we gonna land down there?
4858462 4860423 - All right, hang on.<br />- OK, OK.
4863593 4865428 Fence. Fence. Fence.
4867888 4869557 - Fence. Fence.<br />- I see it.
4870224 4871642 Watch...
4883655 4885574 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Come on.
4885657 4889119 Yeah, yeah. "Taking off's the hardest part."
4889202 4890162 Let's go.
4893332 4898253 Now, there's something you need to know<br />about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?
4898337 4901632 So just let me do all the talking, OK?
4910432 4912351 Shit.
4912434 4914728 Hey, Mrs Kaludis.
4914811 4916480 Is Freddy home?
4918440 4921485 I'm Matt Farrell and this is...
4921568 4923362 Billy.
4923445 4928367 We're friends from Space Camp.<br />I went to Space Camp with Freddy.
4929868 4931828 Freddy!
4931912 4934581 - Freddy?<br />- You got company.
4941046 4944216 Frederick. Didn't you hear me?
4944299 4946343 All Baltimore heard you, Ma.
4946426 4949638 - Your friends are here.<br />- Friends? What the?
4950264 4954309 Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta<br />tell you, don't bring people down here?
4954393 4959357 I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded<br />Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.
4959440 4962694 No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?<br />Know what? Doesn't matter.
4962777 4967448 Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,<br />I'm rocking five generators to stay online.
4967532 4973913 And since you're being hunted by assassins,<br />this visit is not a healthy use of my time.
4973997 4976916 And don't touch that, all right?
4977000 4980837 CB radio?<br />A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?
4980920 4984549 That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world<br />insurance system, OK?
4984632 4988136 So when the last microchip goes down,<br />I can contact whoever's there,
4988219 4990430 whether they be zombies or not.
4990513 4994767 - What'd you bring your dad here for?<br />- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.
4994851 4997020 Nice poster.
4997687 5003484 - What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?<br />- No. I was always more of a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.
5004193 5006904 - <i>Star Wars</i> guy. Who is this man?<br />- He's my...
5006988 5009407 Dump truck. I'm not his dad.
5009490 5013536 - I'm a cop. How 'bout that?<br />- A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.
5013620 5016748 Why'd you bring a cop<br />into my command centre?
5016831 5019208 Command centre. It's a basement.
5019292 5021711 - It's a command centre.<br />- I can explain.
5021794 5025673 Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?<br />That's why we came here.
5025757 5027842 Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.
5027926 5030262 Get out. I want you outta here, right now.
5030346 5033599 Calm down. Just calm down, big boy.
5033682 5036101 You calm down. It's my house.
5036185 5040898 You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,<br />or I'll beat you to death in your own house.
5055329 5059708 Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas<br />Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?
5059792 5061919 First day on the job, tells his bosses
5062002 5065589 this nation's security infrastructure<br />is open to compromise.
5065673 5070886 They say, "We'll take it under advisement."<br />But he don't ease up cos he is committed.
5070970 5073889 So he breaks into a meeting<br />of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
5073973 5078894 and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD<br />and shuts down our defence network.
5078978 5082314 So they put a gun to the man's head<br />and forced him to stop the hack.
5082398 5086568 Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down<br />NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.
5086652 5089405 - You think I'm scared of you?<br />- Tell us how to find him.
5089488 5092658 How do I know? He's a ghost, man.<br />He just fell off the grid.
5092741 5094952 - Another dead end. Come on.<br />- Wait.
5095035 5098455 Listen, Warlock,<br />a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...
5098539 5104170 A mutating algorithmic security code, that's<br />probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.
5104254 5107591 No, we know that. Yes.<br />Can you tell us what he's using it for?
5107674 5111469 I don't know. I've been trying<br />to figure that out. Here, look.
5111553 5114723 The only security system in the country<br />that I can find
5114806 5119269 currently employing that template<br />is the Social Security Administration.
5119352 5124733 But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.<br />They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.
5124816 5127944 - Whoa. What the hell? God.<br />- I know, right?
5128028 5131740 - What are you talkin' about?<br />- The power consumption's off the charts.
5131823 5135535 - It's hot. It's on fire.<br />- Why are there chilling towers?
5135619 5136995 Hello.
5137078 5139581 What's a chilling tower?
5139664 5142083 See what I've been dealing with?
5142167 5145754 Large server farms generate a lot of heat<br />and need to be cooled.
5145837 5147255 But why there?
5147339 5152177 I don't know what's in that building,<br />but it's not Social Security numbers.
5157682 5162854 I got a red flag over here.<br />Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.
5163688 5166900 Honing in on the host server right now.
5167609 5169778 "Frederick Kaludis."
5169861 5172030 - Let's have a look at him.<br />- Fat bastard.
5177035 5178412 McClane.
5178496 5182917 - Where is his daughter?<br />- We just got a trace on her cell.
5183000 5184585 You'll love this.
5188839 5191467 All right. Let's get a better look at you.
5203604 5205481 - Freddy?<br />- What?
5205564 5209151 What the hell are you doing<br />dickin' around inside my network?
5213531 5215324 McClane?
5215408 5217326 I thought I killed you already.
5217410 5219412 I get that sometimes.
5222540 5226085 - You think you can try to track where he is?<br />- Dude, yeah.
5226168 5231215 Detective, covering the camera with your<br />hand does not turn off the microphone.
5232508 5238681 Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys<br />with all this computer shit,
5238764 5242435 but I'm still alive, ain't I?
5243311 5248858 I mean, you got to be runnin' out<br />of bad guys by now, right?
5251528 5253530 Gabriel?
5255115 5258493 Honestly, you can tell me.<br />How does that work?
5258577 5263373 You got some kind of service?<br />Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?
5263457 5265834 And I bet you're still on hold with,
5265918 5271465 "Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch<br />over here right away?"
5271548 5277554 But seriously, all that kicking aside, that<br />skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.
5277638 5280933 One of those gotta be real hard<br />to come by, right?
5281016 5284686 - You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?<br />- I have my moments.
5284770 5286605 Yeah?
5288440 5290359 Is this one of them?
5294821 5297699 - Hello?<br />- Yes, this is Emergency Services.
5297783 5299618 - Thank God.<br />- Can she hear me?
5299701 5303413 My name is Lucy Gennero.<br />I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.
5303497 5306333 Can she hear this?<br />Lucy, hang up that phone.
5306416 5310587 Yes, calm down, miss.<br />We know exactly where you are.
5310671 5312547 Everything is gonna be all right.
5312631 5317302 - Lucy, hang up the phone.<br />- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.
5320055 5323058 We're a bit overloaded tonight,<br />as you may imagine,
5323141 5325687 but I assure you<br />we're gonna get you out of there.
5325770 5330108 - Even if I have to come down there myself.<br />- Thank you.
5330191 5333778 In the meantime, is there anyone<br />we can contact for you?
5333861 5335571 Yeah.
5336364 5338616 My dad.
5338700 5342412 His name is John McClane.<br />He's a New York City cop.
5343079 5349294 We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,<br />and we'll get to you, very soon.
5350878 5352880 Thank you.
5353923 5358761 Wow. That's a great girl you got there.<br />Can't wait to meet her.
5359220 5361806 What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
5361889 5363975 Come on, John.
5365184 5367729 Make ajoke.
5367812 5370857 Say somethin' funny.
5376904 5379240 Where? Where you goin'
5379657 5384245 McClane. Hold on.<br />Where you goin' What are you gonna do?
5384329 5388541 What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna<br />go kill this guy and get my daughter.
5388625 5392712 - But she can be anywhere...<br />- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.
5392795 5396382 - I think I...<br />- I'm doing you a favour.
5396466 5398885 I wouldn't bet on me, all right?
5398968 5400971 I'll take it from here.
5401055 5403474 Thanks for your help.
5410230 5414234 I wouldn't bet on you either,<br />so I figured I'd lend a hand.
5416028 5418113 Buckle up.
5444014 5446308 FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.
5446392 5448394 Mind if I see your ID?
5448477 5450562 Not at all.
5459613 5461991 My dad's a cop. Force of habit.
5462658 5466120 Your father sounds like a very smart man.
5470583 5472918 Kid, can you get Bowman?
5473003 5475088 Yeah.
5484723 5486725 It's completely dead.
5486808 5490437 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all the satellite links. Shit.
5495692 5498194 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5500739 5502991 About all of it.
5503074 5505911 It was my fault you got into this.<br />This wasn't your fight.
5505994 5507704 You got nothin' to be sorry about.
5512792 5515795 - Let go of me, you bastard.<br />- This bitch is a handful.
5521801 5524179 Are you gonna be all right?
5526348 5528808 Behave or I will hurt you.
5528892 5533980 Yeah? Let's step outside, just you and me.<br />We'll see who hurts who.
5535857 5538193 You really are his daughter.
5538276 5539945 Tie her wrists.
5547119 5549455 Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.
5549538 5552083 - Is it that time already?<br />- Yeah.
5553376 5554752 OK.
5555711 5558464 I'll be back in a second.
5563302 5565221 No, no, no, please.
5610349 5613269 We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.
5617523 5619942 Go take a look.
5620484 5622738 Don't be long. We're packing up soon.
5634374 5638086 McClane, do we have anything<br />resembling a plan?
5638170 5640213 Find Lucy and kill everybody else.
5640297 5644176 No, I mean more like a plan.<br />Like, a way to do that.
5646386 5648388 Come on.
5649431 5655687 OK, according to the layout, the chilling<br />towers are kept on the bottom level.
5660150 5662235 I think mine's locked.
5665906 5669785 OK. Now it looks like<br />we're gettin' somewhere.
5680671 5686051 OK, this looks like it controls the cooling<br />system for the mainframe, which should be...
5687010 5689012 If I can just hack in,
5690722 5693558 and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.
5702026 5703820 Someone set off the alarms.
5703903 5708032 Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.<br />Find a way to turn it off.
5712203 5714247 What have you got?
5715290 5718793 We got a problem.<br />The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
5720086 5722005 It's gotta be him.
5722088 5724299 And what's Woodlawn?
5728428 5732515 It's NSA - a secure facility<br />outside of Baltimore.
5732599 5737353 It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11<br />to back up all financial information.
5737437 5742442 The moment networks were hit, all financial<br />data began downloading to those servers.
5742525 5747614 Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,<br />government funds - all of it.
5747697 5751534 Basically, a backup for<br />the accumulated wealth of America.
5751618 5754037 All in one location?
5755163 5756831 What could Gabriel do with it?
5756915 5760877 If he could get in, he might try to transfer<br />the data to a portable hard drive.
5760960 5766841 Then he'd have access to those accounts from<br />anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.
5766925 5768510 We couldn't trace it.
5768594 5774516 Or, knowing him, he could erase it all<br />and send us all back to the Stone Age.
5774600 5779980 - Why the hell wasn't I told about this?<br />- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.
5780064 5782149 My pay grade?
5784485 5790074 How the hell did Gabriel find out about this<br />when even I didn't know about it?
5792117 5794245 He designed it.
5795788 5797581 It was his program.
5797665 5802962 He knew that hacking your system<br />last night would trigger the download.
5803045 5804630 That's brilliant.
5804713 5808592 You two geniuses, stay out of my way.
5813973 5817726 Let me see if I can get a floor plan<br />of this place.
5818269 5820229 Don't move.
5820312 5822856 You, get away from the bag. Now.
5822940 5824566 OK, OK.
5824650 5826902 We've been waiting for you.
5827653 5831031 Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.
5858351 5860186 McClane!
5861521 5863023 McClane!
5865650 5867027 Kid?
5867444 5868570 Matt?
5868653 5869779 Kid.
5883168 5885378 Emerson.
5886296 5888715 We have a problem in<br />one of the cooling towers.
5888798 5890175 - Tower seven.<br />- Tower seven.
5890258 5892969 Find out what's going on.
5901811 5902854 Sir?
5902938 5905649 Get the HR team to stand by.<br />We need to get to Woodlawn.
5905732 5908526 The roads out are blocked.<br />DC's in total gridlock.
5908610 5910445 Then get us some helicopters.
5910528 5913490 They were all pulled by the Pentagon<br />for search and rescue.
5913573 5917578 Molina, find me<br />some goddamn helicopters immediately.
5918079 5921165 Look, the Pentagon<br />has jets flying CAP over DC.
5921249 5924210 Have them send one to Woodlawn<br />and keep an eye on things.
5924293 5926379 Let's go.
5937515 5939600 Where's my daughter?
5939684 5942103 Russo, check in.
5945064 5950194 Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down<br />to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.
5950278 5953656 Hold on a minute.<br />Looks like he's coming around.
5953990 5956867 It's McClane. He's on the third floor.
5960496 5963749 Get all that? That's right.
5963833 5967461 I'm on the third floor.<br />But I'm coming to get you.
5975970 5978472 Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.
5981642 5984228 Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.
6030567 6032444 My algorithm.
6038492 6041036 OK, please, God.
6041495 6043538 Please, God...
6079659 6083204 Jesus, they're going after the money.
6105685 6108605 You coming to get me, John?<br />Is that the plan?
6108688 6110898 Yep, that's my plan.
6110982 6114360 What makes you think I won't put a bullet<br />in your daughter's head?
6114444 6117739 - Cos you're scared of me.<br />- You think I'm afraid of you?
6118448 6121743 Otherwise she'd be dead already.<br />You need a bargaining chip.
6128708 6131461 Stop there. Hands up.
6131544 6134047 If you kill me, you'll never get it open.
6136925 6139178 Move away. Move.
6146393 6150481 You know, John, I feel like<br />we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
6150564 6154151 And because of that,<br />you think I'm the bad guy.
6154234 6157029 Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />I'm the good guy.
6157112 6160616 I told them this could happen<br />if they didn't prepare.
6160699 6164286 Did I get a thank-you?<br />No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.
6164370 6168207 - You got their attention now, don't you?<br />- That's right.
6168290 6172962 - I am doing the country a favour.<br />- By tearing it apart.
6173045 6178175 Better me than some outsider.<br />Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.
6178259 6180928 Nobody wants to see that happen.
6181011 6187268 Everything I've broken can be fixed<br />if the country is willing to pay for it.
6187351 6190646 Bullshit. It's always been about the money.
6190729 6194942 What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?<br />I'm working my ass off here, John.
6195025 6198696 Well, just sit tight, asshole.<br />I got a cheque for you.
6201782 6206578 I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,<br />see if you can get him to focus.
6206662 6207705 Dad?
6210708 6212752 Hi, baby.
6212836 6215213 Now there are only five of them.
6217674 6220260 Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'
6230478 6234107 Would somebody<br />please kill this son of a bitch?
6235609 6237569 We have a problem.
6238320 6242324 There's actually no problem.<br />I just got off on the wrong floor.
6244951 6247037 This is a mess.
6248955 6253168 Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.<br />Hacking every byte of financial data
6253251 6257505 for the entire country'd take weeks<br />unless you eliminated the congestion.
6257589 6260759 That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?
6260842 6264054 - That's brilliant.<br />- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.
6264137 6266640 - Asshole.<br />- Who are you?
6267265 6268808 Matt Farrell.
6269643 6271978 Lucy McClane.
6272062 6275523 I thought your name was Gennero.<br />Lucy Gennero.
6275607 6277400 Not today.
6277484 6281446 - Can you crack the code?<br />- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.
6281529 6283782 That's encouraging.
6285450 6287745 Take them with us.
6287828 6289956 - Let's go.<br />- Let's go.
6292541 6295294 Gabriel, Pentagon just sent<br />an F-35 towards us.
6295378 6297463 Keep an eye on it.
6299340 6302385 Pulling down the "go" codes now.
6317900 6321612 You might wanna think about<br />what you want on your headstone, asshole.
6328202 6330913 Christ! Goddamn hamster.
6331580 6332999 There you go.
6333082 6335543 Stay still, spider-boy.
6339547 6341340 That's right.
6370412 6372247 Goddammit!
6381423 6382591 Oh, no.
6385052 6389514 You probably shouldn't antagonise them,<br />since they have all the loaded guns.
6389598 6394019 Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger<br />set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.
6394102 6399191 Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird<br />hearing it from someone... with hair.
6435728 6436896 Sir.
6436980 6438856 ETA 15 minutes.
6463548 6466050 There we go.
6493202 6494954 Fix it.
6495038 6498374 Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.<br />I know that.
6505089 6506758 Oh, shit!
6510387 6512806 I'm not gonna do it.
6516560 6520314 - No, no, no. Shit.<br />- Robinson is coming pretty fast.
6520397 6522566 - I'm sorry, what?<br />- Something's wrong.
6522650 6524693 Robinson is coming too fast.
6529073 6531033 It's not Robinson.
6531116 6533118 That would be my dad.
6544463 6546590 Freddy?
6547508 6549301 Freddy?
6550177 6551971 It's John McClane.
6552054 6555599 Look, I know you can hear me.<br />This is your frequency, right? 666.
6555683 6558435 Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.
6561105 6563440 Nobody here by that name. Sorry.
6563524 6565609 Hackerjerk-off.
6569655 6571699 Warlock...
6571782 6577037 I need you to do whatever it is you do<br />to patch me through to the FBI.
6577121 6579123 To Deputy Director Bowman.
6579206 6581793 - You hear me?<br />- Are you serious?
6581876 6584421 You want me to intentionally<br />open up a com line
6584504 6588300 to the head of the FBI's cyber division?<br />I don't think so.
6588633 6591052 Freddy, goddammit,<br />they have my daughter.
6596391 6598768 I can do that. Hold on.
6599978 6602063 Thank you.
6608236 6611615 This is Central.<br />We have a patch for Director Bowman.
6612073 6615076 Sir. Central's trying to reach you.
6616411 6617412 Go.
6617495 6619956 - Bowman, it's McClane.<br />- McClane.
6620040 6623919 Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695<br />headed north in a Hazmat truck.
6624002 6627964 Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?<br />We're headed there right now.
6628048 6631259 Bowman. He's got my daughter.
6631885 6636556 Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government<br />vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?
6636640 6638850 Track that down, it should take you to him.
6638934 6642479 - Give me the tag number.<br />- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.
6642562 6644689 Golf... Tango...
6646232 6650362 five... niner... two... November.
6650445 6653073 Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?
6653156 6654699 He's with them.
6655576 6657078 Listen to me.
6657161 6661624 I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,<br />but if something happens to me,
6661707 6666254 you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?<br />I mean everybody.
6666337 6668506 Don't let that maniac get my daughter.
6668589 6672009 - John, don't worry.<br />- I want your word, Bowman.
6674345 6676722 Yeah, you have it.
6676806 6678599 McClane out.
6685898 6687066 There's the F-35.
6689694 6691988 Did you get the "go" codes?
6692071 6694490 - Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?<br />- Yes.
6694573 6697243 Can you connect me to the pilot?
6713843 6716345 Isolating his radio.
6721225 6723936 Sending him the "go" codes.
6730110 6731361 AV-81.
6731445 6736783 - AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.<br />- Go for AV-81.
6736867 6740537 Confirmed terrorist vehicle<br />located in your sector. A big rig truck.
6741997 6744916 - Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.<br />- I see them.
6745000 6747753 You are authorised to engage and destroy.
6747836 6750297 Copy that. AV-81 engaging.
6758513 6759723 What?
6767606 6770776 Jesus Christ! Goddammit!
6773904 6775781 You're shooting at the wrong guy.
6783789 6786124 I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.
6799888 6801723 Jackass!
6848688 6851024 Is that it?
6853985 6856821 Is that your best shot?
6898697 6900240 Come on!
6908791 6910084 Damn.
6926475 6928269 Come on.
7021738 7023698 Let's go. Come on.
7023782 7025868 That way. It's that way. Go.
7034877 7037546 We are leaving in three minutes.
7040800 7043135 You have one.
7043219 7046722 The rules haven't changed.<br />You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.
7050559 7053145 - Oh, shit. Oh, shit.<br />- Matthew?
7053229 7054480 Matthew.
7054563 7057400 I really need you to pay attention.
7057483 7061237 - The rules can always change.<br />- OK, wait.
7061320 7063698 - I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.<br />- Wait.
7063781 7065658 Nine.
7065741 7067326 I can't.
7067410 7069412 Eight.
7069495 7071289 I can't.
7072081 7073499 Oh, God.
7076419 7077712 OK.
7079547 7081007 OK, OK, OK.
7081090 7082675 Six.
7082758 7086679 OK, stop. Stop, stop.<br />I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
7086762 7089390 Oh, God. Oh, my God.
7102904 7105282 Feds are headed this way.
7105365 7107993 - Get everything on the plane.<br />- Yep.
7117127 7119087 - Dad.<br />- Careful.
7119171 7122674 Don't worry, baby.<br />Everything's gonna be all right.
7124676 7126762 Daddy!
7131934 7133518 No.
7133602 7135938 Hold this.
7157960 7159795 No.
7161088 7163257 Jesus Christ.
7163340 7165550 You got her?
7165926 7167844 You're sure?
7169930 7171556 Nice effort, though.
7172182 7175270 - Matthew.<br />- Oh, shit. All right, OK.
7175353 7177188 OK. I'm doin' it. I know.
7185071 7187073 McClane.
7187156 7190076 Would you do me a favour?
7191411 7196374 I know the lights are beginning to dim,<br />but if you could just hang on for a second,
7196457 7199669 when Matt's finished,<br />I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,
7199752 7202630 and I would love for you to see that.
7204215 7206676 Goddammit. Matthew?
7206759 7209262 Ten seconds, OK?<br />You'll have all your money.
7209345 7213433 - You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?<br />- A few seconds. Stay with me.
7213516 7215643 McClane.
7216686 7219147 - Stay with me.<br />- Dad?
7219897 7225153 On your tombstone it should read, " Always<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time."
7225945 7229907 How 'bout,<br />"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf..."
7243630 7246342 Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...
7246425 7249595 - Are you OK?<br />- Yes, baby, I'm fine.
7251639 7253182 I knew you'd come for me.
7253265 7257978 Of course I'd come for you, honey.<br />Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.
7265861 7267529 Move, move.
7272576 7274203 Freeze!
7274286 7277164 Hold, hold. He's OK.
7279166 7281835 - Get that vehicle.<br />- Come around.
7281919 7284088 - Here, help Daddy up.<br />- OK.
7284880 7288842 Wait, wait.<br />I think I'll just stay here for a minute.
7288926 7293055 - OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.<br />- What are you talkin' about?
7293138 7297977 - You shot yourself.<br />- It seemed like a good idea at the time.
7298060 7301188 Don't tell these guys that I did that.
7312533 7315327 - Thanks for all your help, John.<br />- Thank you.
7317288 7319248 Is he OK?
7320292 7323128 - Should I put my hands up?<br />- No, don't put your hands up.
7323211 7325547 Put 'em down further?
7325630 7329968 Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.
7332679 7334556 All right.
7336558 7338476 I'll be right back.
7340186 7342355 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
7342439 7345066 - How's it feel to be shot?<br />- It actually feels great.
7345150 7348570 He gave me some...<br />What's it called? Morphine.
7348653 7354326 - Well, you got your merit badge now.<br />- Yeah. I don't know what that means.
7354409 7358413 - Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.<br />- Really?
7359914 7361916 Not that one.
7362000 7363793 - What?<br />- Don't even think about it.
7363877 7367631 How did you know what I was thinking?<br />Did she say something to you?
7367714 7372260 - I felt like we had kind of a vibe.<br />- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.
7372344 7373762 Yeah.
7373845 7378934 Besides, after all we've been through,<br />I'd hate to have to beat you to death.
7380685 7382687 That would suck.
7384272 7386107 - Good to go?<br />- Yeah, all set.
7386191 7389903 Take care of yourself.<br />I'll see you at the hospital.
7396535 7400957 Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
7401040 7403417 What was I gonna do?
7404877 7407046 That's what makes you that guy.
7410049 7412343 Yeah.
7417807 7420685 So, did he say anything about me?
7422603 7424647 Jesus, Lucy.
7424730 7426941 What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
7428442 7430861 I'm in enough pain already.
7430945 7432863 Hospital.
