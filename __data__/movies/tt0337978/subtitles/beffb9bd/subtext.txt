139160 141360 (TV) Leonard Adkins is in a warmer clime...
141480 143560 ..with a story that grows<br />hotter by the minute.

149600 151480 ..that deposed general Ramon Esperanza...
151520 154320 ..will be delivered<br />for extradition to the United States.
154400 156360 Only two years ago,<br />General Esperanza...
156480 160520 ..led his country's army in a campaign<br />against communist insurgents,...
160640 163440 ..a campaign fought with<br />American money and advisers.
163520 165360 Esperanza's fall from power<br />caused ripples...
165440 170040 ..in his country's recent election,<br />and closer to home as well,...
170160 172520 ..when high-ranking<br />Pentagon officials were charged...
172640 175200 ..with supplying him with weapons<br />despite the Congressional ban.
175280 176960 Evidence that Esperanza's forces...
177040 179840 ..violated the neutrality<br />of neighbouring countries...
179920 182000 ..made Congress withhold funds.
182080 185520 Esperanza is accused<br />of replacing the funds...
185600 187120 - ..by cocaine smuggling.<br />- (beeping)
187200 190760 Although Esperanza was removed<br />as commander in chief this year,...
190880 194120 ..the agreement to extradite him<br />was only reached yesterday.
194240 197960 Washington insiders say<br />a phone call made it happen,...

394560 398960 ..thousands of political prisoners,<br />including the new president.
399040 400880 There's no doubt he still has...
400960 404000 ..some ardent supporters<br />both here and abroad.
404080 406800 Rumours abound on Capitol Hill<br />that there were...
409600 412480 - Yeah?<br />- Sir, we're checking our equipment.

931760 933800 Where's your ID?
938640 940320 On its way to Cleveland?
945600 947560 No, you did not explain anything.
947680 950400 You just shoved me back here<br />into this cattle car.
950480 952560 Sir, you were told we were overbooked.
952640 954160 Fine. Done. I accept that.
954240 957280 But why can't I get the first-class<br />meal my network paid for?
957360 960160 - Do you know who I am?<br />- Yes. We've seen your program.
960240 964160 Your episode, Flying Junkyards, was<br />an objective look at air traffic safety.
964240 968080 It wasn't nearly as edifying as<br />Bimbos of the Sky, was it, Connie?
968160 969760 You think you're funny.
970240 971440 You think you're funny.

979840 981440 Fine.
990320 991680 Stewardess.
991760 993160 Mr Thornberg,...
993280 995000 ..you cannot monopolise my time.
995120 996720 You cannot put me near that woman.
996800 998240 Excuse me?
999760 1002960 He means he's filed<br />a restraining order against me.
1003040 1006000 I’m not allowed within 50 feet of him.
1006080 1007200 50 yards.
1008080 1011560 So by keeping me in this section,<br />you are violating a court order.
1011680 1013720 l can sue you and this airline.
1015040 1019120 That woman assaulted me,<br />and she humiliated me in public.
1025600 1027040 What did you do?
1029040 1031360 Knocked out two of his teeth.
1031440 1034360 Would you like some champagne?
1037600 1040440 Sorry, Officer McClane.<br />I had to check.
1040480 1042880 Here's your piece and shield back.
1043680 1044920 Thanks.
1045040 1046160 (reporter) Over here, officer!
1046240 1048400 We understand that there was shooting.
1048480 1051560 ..the presence<br />of Justice Department officials?
1051680 1054040 Jesus!
1054640 1057600 What the fuck are you people...<br />What are you doing?
1057680 1060640 This is a crime scene.<br />You got to seal this area off.
1060720 1061840 That's up to the captain.
1061920 1066240 Maybe you better take me<br />up to the captain, then, huh?
1076080 1078640 - Where's Cochrane?<br />- He didn't make it.
1086640 1088080 You're late.
1089440 1091680 We ran into trouble, Colonel.
1091760 1097520 Some cop... killed Cochrane.<br />I barely got away, sir.
1097600 1099760 Did you accomplish your mission?
1099840 1102160 Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.
1102240 1105840 Well, then the damage is minimal.<br />The penalty could be severe.
1114000 1117200 You fail me again,<br />and the chamber won't be empty.
1118640 1120080 Dismissed.
1123280 1125720 Miss. Miss. I can't find my dog.
1125800 1128560 - Miss. My dog.<br />- One minute, ma'am.
1128640 1130600 l want you to fill out this form.
1135360 1136480 (knock on door)
1136560 1139160 Who is it? Come in.
1139280 1141280 - Captain Lorenzo?<br />- Yeah.
1141360 1144000 - I'm John McClane...<br />- Yeah, I know who you are.
1144080 1148480 You're the asshole that just broke<br />seven FAA and five district regulations...
1148560 1151800 ..running around my airport<br />with a gun, shooting at people.
1151920 1153520 What do you call that shit?
1153600 1154840 Self-defense.
1154920 1157040 What, you think that LA badge...
1157120 1160960 ..is going to get you a free lunch<br />or something around here?
1161080 1163360 Maybe a little professional courtesy.
1163440 1165600 Huh! ln an airport on Christmas week?
1165680 1167200 You've got to be kidding.
1167280 1169920 OK, fuck courtesy.<br />How about being professional?
1170000 1171960 Your boys just walked away<br />from a crime scene.
1172080 1174440 You can't wrap this up in ten minutes.
1174560 1176960 You got to seal the area off,<br />dust for prints...
1177080 1179080 Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.
1179200 1182080 l know what I'm doing.<br />We're going to dust it down.
1182200 1185400 We'll take all the pictures.<br />We'll sweep for fibres.
1185520 1188000 When will you do this?<br />After 400 people go through?
1188080 1189920 You'd be lucky to get a print<br />from one of your people.
1190000 1192680 - Shut down that area...<br />- Oh, shut the area down.
1192800 1195360 It's that simple, huh?<br />Just shut the area down?
1195440 1199360 Yeah, and I got everybody<br />from the Shriners' convention...
1199440 1201760 ..to the goddamn Boy Scouts in here!
1201840 1203760 l got lost kids, lost dogs...
1203840 1205840 Not now! Later!
1205920 1207080 l got international diplomats.
1207200 1211160 l got a fucking reindeer flying in here<br />from the fucking petting zoo!
1211280 1214320 But John McClane,<br />he's got a little problem.
1214400 1216520 Let's shut down<br />the whole fucking airport!
1216640 1219520 What do you think they'll say<br />upstairs when I tell them that?
1219600 1220920 Phone and find out.
1221040 1225760 l don't need fucking forensics to tell me<br />this was some punk stealing luggage!
1225840 1228280 Luggage?<br />That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.
1228400 1230680 That's a porcelain gun made in Germany.
1230800 1232920 Itdoesn't show up<br />on airport x-ray machines...
1233040 1234880 ..and costs more<br />than you make in a month.
1234960 1237000 You'd be surprised what I make in a month.
1237120 1238920 If it's more than $1.98...
1239040 1242080 Hey, McClane, don't start<br />believing your own press, huh?
1242200 1245400 Yeah, I know all about you<br />and that Nakatomi thing in LA.
1245520 1248920 But just cos the TV thinks<br />you're hot shit, that don't make it so.
1249040 1251920 Look, you are in my little pond now,...
1252000 1255120 ..and I am the big fish that runs it.
1255200 1257880 So you capped some lowlife.
1258000 1258920 Fine.
1259040 1262720 I’ll send your fucking captain in LA<br />a fucking commendation!
1262800 1264680 Now, get the hell out of my office...
1264800 1267600 ..before I have you thrown out<br />of my goddamn airport!
1277680 1279960 Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.
1280080 1282400 What sets off the metal detectors first:
1282480 1285000 the lead in your ass<br />or the shit in your brains?
1285120 1286840 Fat fuck.
1295760 1297680 (man) Any ID on this guy?
1297760 1299720 (man #2) That's somebody else's problem.

1316000 1317000 Hold up, boys.
1317120 1318840 Hold up. We got to check something.
1318960 1321840 - What are you doing?<br />- Pretty gruesome fucking job.
1321920 1327400 All the confusion in there,<br />forgot to get this clown's prints.
1329200 1330360 Ew! Christ.
1330480 1332600 You're supposed to do that at the morgue.
1332720 1336120 Not anymore. Got a new SOP<br />for DOAs from the FAA.
1339200 1341840 (laughs) I don't think<br />this one's going to make it.
1341920 1343040 Thanks a lot.
1351840 1353520 (speaks Spanish)
1377040 1379040 (groans)
1448160 1450560 (rings)
1451760 1453120 Powell here.
1453200 1455600 Take that Twinkie<br />out of your mouth and grab a pencil.
1455680 1458240 (laughs) Hey, John, how are you doing?
1458320 1461680 Holly stood me up a day<br />and I'm here alone in DC...
1461760 1463600 ..with my in-laws.
1463680 1465480 Eh, the old in-laws, huh?
1465600 1467920 They do love<br />their policemen son-in-laws.
1468000 1472560 Listen, Al, what is the fax machine<br />number there at the station?
1472640 1474560 Uh...
1474640 1477920 555 3212.
1478000 1480800 3212. Hold on a second, all right?
1480880 1482840 l want to send you something.
1482960 1484160 Excuse me.
1484240 1486560 You and faxes? This is a first.
1486640 1490040 Holly told me I should wake up<br />and smell the nineties.
1490160 1493120 - This way?<br />- No. That way.
1493200 1495520 - Wait. It's upside-down.<br />- Itdoesn't matter.
1495600 1497760 OK, here it comes.
1499360 1500800 I’m sending you something now.
1500880 1503600 Hold on a second, cowboy.
1516800 1518560 Fingerprints?
1518640 1520560 We've got an unidentified stiff here.
1520640 1523720 I’ve circled the whorls in pen<br />in case the transmission's fuzzy.
1523840 1526480 Run it through State and Federal,<br />and if you can, Interpol.
1526560 1528800 Will do. Well, what's this about?
1528880 1530320 Oh, just a feeling I have.
1530400 1534640 Ouch. When you get those feelings,<br />insurance companies start to go bankrupt.
1534720 1537440 Listen, the, uh, fax number is...
1537520 1539280 On the top of the transmission...
1539360 1543360 On the top of the transmission you just got.
1544800 1545920 Oh, an airport, huh?
1546000 1548960 You're not pissing<br />in somebody's pool, are you?
1549040 1552280 (laughs)<br />Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.
1557760 1560400 Just as this storm starts breaking,...
1560480 1563720 ..the satellite will feed up<br />and drop the other shoe.
1563840 1565760 Look at this new front moving in.
1565840 1567760 Makes its baby brother<br />look like chicken shit.
1569360 1573720 l can sand down the runway<br />and run the ploughs between landings...
1573840 1576240 ..if you downshift them,<br />give me time to work.
1576320 1577320 You got it.
1578240 1579760 All right, everyone.
1579840 1584320 Let's slow down our birds before<br />we get a parking lot over our heads.
1584400 1586800 The line starts at the Mississippi,...
1586880 1589440 ..and they better start taking numbers.
1598080 1599880 Can I get you another?
1602800 1604160 No, thank you.
1604240 1607080 l only have to look at his face<br />for another 20 minutes.
1608000 1611040 (PA) Ladies and gentlemen,<br />this is the captain speaking.
1611120 1613760 I’ve just been informed<br />by Dulles traffic control...
1613840 1615960 ..that there's a weather front ahead of us.
1616560 1619480 We maybe up here<br />a little while longer.
1619600 1621040 Thank you.
1621120 1622880 On second thoughts...
1628560 1630320 - (rings)<br />- Al?
1630400 1632320 Hey, I'm right here, partner.
1632400 1635120 Your stiff's dossier is<br />coming through now.
1637040 1639440 - What can you tell me about him?<br />- He's dead.
1639520 1641560 You needed a computer<br />to figure that out?
1641680 1643480 No, no. You don't follow me.
1643600 1647480 According to the Department Of Defense,<br />he's been dead for two years.
1647600 1648920 What?
1649040 1651680 That's right.<br />Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.
1651760 1653360 American adviser in Honduras.
1653440 1656840 Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.
1656960 1658520 Officer.
1658640 1662800 Read between the lines, and I'd say<br />it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff.
1662880 1664240 Yeah, I see it.
1664320 1666680 - All right, Al. Thanks a lot.<br />- Hey, any time.
1666800 1668080 OK.
1669440 1673840 Say, I close in about an hour.<br />Maybe we can go get a drink?
1676480 1679200 Just the fax, ma'am. Just the fax.
1684080 1687120 Hey, wait a second. I see somebody.<br />I’ll call you back.
1692640 1694480 The ghost of Christmas past.
1694560 1697080 Nakatomi? LA?<br />You're John McClane, right?
1697200 1698760 - Who are you?<br />- Sam Coleman.
1698880 1699680 WNTW News.
1700880 1702080 Excuse me.
1702160 1704160 Give me a break. I saw the stiff.
1704240 1706680 Word is that was your handiwork.
1706800 1709080 No. I only do needlepoint.
1714080 1717640 Great. National just shut down.<br />Totally iced.
1717760 1719520 They'll send us their planes.
1719600 1720760 Happy, happy holiday.
1720880 1723120 The worst part, Mr Trudeau,<br />was the press.
1723200 1725640 They were here for the Esperanza story,...
1725760 1729360 ..so they got it right on the fucking news,<br />bloodstains and all.
1729440 1732320 I'd like to lock every damn reporter<br />out of the airport,...
1732400 1735120 ..but they'd pull<br />that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1735200 1737040 Then the ACLU would be all over us.
1737120 1741000 Murder on television.<br />Hell of a start for Christmas week.
1741120 1744560 What is it?<br />A gang thing like last time?
1744640 1747400 Only if your gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1748880 1750400 - Who the hell is this?<br />- Uh-uh, McClane.
1750480 1753320 - I'm a police officer...<br />- ln an unauthorised area.
1753440 1755200 LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1755280 1757880 That's what I said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1758000 1761520 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1762960 1764920 I’m sure Captain Lorenzo explained...
1765040 1767200 ..the minor fracas with the minor thieves.
1767280 1769440 Maybe he can explain this.
1787680 1789120 All systems tapped, Colonel.
1789200 1790400 Fire it up.
1805040 1808400 H minus five minutes. Stand by.
1809440 1813280 OK, we've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1813360 1815920 Assuming it's not a computer error,<br />what do we assume?
1816000 1818240 That somebody's about<br />to fuck with this airport.
1818320 1820240 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
1820320 1824040 l know we're dummies up here,<br />so give us a taste of your genius.
1824160 1826320 This is a hijacking, a robbery or what?
1826400 1829880 - Look, I'm not sure...<br />- Oh, he's not sure. I'm stunned!
1830000 1831320 l got to lie down.
1831440 1833520 Only professionals go to this much trouble.
1833600 1835360 Not luggage thieves and not punks.
1835440 1838160 - Professional at what?<br />- What the fuck do you think this is?
1838240 1839280 The safety patrol?
1839360 1841280 This is the resume<br />of a professional mercenary.
1841360 1843320 The world's biggest drug dealer<br />is due here.
1843440 1845000 You need a slide rule to solve this,...
1845120 1848000 ..or another body in a bag<br />before you ask questions?
1848080 1851280 You're the one that gave us<br />that fucking body. Remember that.
1851360 1852800 Yeah, I remember that.
1859600 1863600 Lorenzo, have all your shift<br />commanders report in. Now.
1863680 1864720 You're not buying into this?!
1864800 1868240 They're to report anything unusual,<br />however trivial. Got that?
1868320 1869360 Yeah, I got it.
1869440 1871720 - Oh, my God!<br />- What?
1871840 1875040 - The runways.<br />- What the hell?
1875120 1877560 - They're shutting down.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1883440 1885640 Go to emergency lighting now.
1886160 1888560 Emergency. We are in a code yellow.
1888640 1890400 Backup systems won't come up.
1890480 1893280 - Shunt to another terminal.<br />- Bobby, what have you got?
1893360 1896880 - Nothing. The network is down.<br />- Should we call the power company?
1896960 1898720 We're on the same goddamn grid.<br />We're hot.
1898800 1900640 (radio)<br />Dulles, what's going on? I'm on approach.
1900720 1903960 - Maintain position. Repeat.<br />- What's going on down there?
1904080 1905280 Roger. We're on it.
1905360 1907920 - We're unable right now. Delay.<br />- Fuji 604.
1908000 1911000 Execute published missed-approach<br />procedure and hold.
1911120 1913600 TWA 23, unable to clear you<br />for approach at this time.
1913680 1916200 Climb to and maintain one zero thousand.
1916320 1919360 I’ve checked all systems.<br />Itain't happening.
1931680 1932680 Yeah, yeah, yeah...
1932800 1936120 - What's it look like?<br />- Approach control, it's gone.
1936240 1939280 Jesus!<br />Instrument landing system is down.
1940320 1942520 Confirmed. ILS is dead.
1942640 1944960 Every goddamn system's dead.
1945040 1947560 And INMAC monitors are down.
1951600 1955400 Attention all controllers.<br />Attention. We have a code-red alert.
1955520 1958240 (PA) Every aircraft approaching our sector...
1958320 1960280 ..and not already in our landing pattern...
1960400 1962440 ..gets diverted to their alternate airport.
1962560 1966400 Everyone already on approach<br />or inside our pattern...
1966480 1968800 ..holds at the outer markers.
1968880 1971480 Stack 'em, pack 'em, and rack 'em.
1971600 1972720 Move.
1973760 1975200 Get someone on it!
1975280 1976520 (beeping)
1978240 1980880 All right.<br />Not a word of this leaves this room.
1980960 1983440 There must be 15,000 people<br />in this airport,...
1983520 1985040 ..and we don't need panic.
1985120 1988040 We just bought ourselves<br />maybe two hours.
1988160 1990960 After that,<br />planes low on fuel won't be circling.
1991040 1993600 They'll be dropping<br />on the White House lawn.
1996240 1999520 McClane, is this what you expected?
2000960 2002720 No.
2002800 2004800 This is just the beginning.
2006000 2008720 (beeping)
2008800 2010040 FAA hot line.
2010160 2011760 How could they know already?
2011840 2013120 They can't.
2014880 2016880 Maybe it's the boys<br />who pulled your plugs.
2016960 2018800 Put it on speaker.
2020080 2023040 (speaker)<br />Attention, Dulles tower. Attention.
2023120 2026520 They say blind men become very<br />attentive by way of compensation.
2026640 2030240 Now that you're blind and deaf,<br />I think I've got your attention.
2030320 2033560 I’m aware your recorders are active,<br />so I'll be quick.
2033680 2036720 You can play me back later<br />to your heart's content.
2036800 2039200 How did you get on this line?<br />Who is this?
2040000 2041760 Who I am is unimportant.
2041840 2043000 What I want...
2043120 2047000 Well, if you don't want those planes<br />to start splashing into the Potomac...
2047120 2049840 ..as they run out of fuel,<br />what I want is very important.
2049920 2053320 A plane will be landing<br />at this airport in 58 minutes.
2053440 2056560 Itis FM-1: Foreign Military One.
2056640 2060320 - I'm sure you are aware of the nature...<br />- Esperanza?
2060400 2062760 ..of this flight, the importance of its cargo.
2062880 2065880 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2066000 2068880 Itwill land on a runway<br />of my designation,...
2068960 2072320 ..where it will remain<br />isolated and unapproached.
2072400 2074800 That will conclude<br />my interest in this aircraft...
2074880 2076560 ..and your responsibility for it.
2076640 2080480 At the same time,<br />I want a 747 cargo conversion,...
2080560 2082560 ..fully fueled...
2082640 2084800 ..and placed at my disposal.
2084880 2088280 You have two more minutes<br />to advise inbound aircraft...
2088360 2089720 ..to hold at their outer radio marker.
2089840 2092560 After that,<br />you will be able to receive only.
2092640 2095360 Any attempt to restore your systems,<br />will be met...
2095440 2097120 ..by severe penalties.
2097200 2098240 He's bluffing.
2099520 2100760 Damn it, you can't do this.
2100880 2102840 l am doing this.
2110480 2112840 OK, listen up.<br />I need you to punch up a code 15.
2112960 2114920 l got an idea, and I need your help.
2115040 2116680 If Esperanza gets to a country...
2116800 2119240 ..with no extradition treaties,<br />we're fucked.
2119360 2122400 They're talking to us on our own system.<br />They got to be close.
2122480 2124360 My men will tear this airport apart.
2124480 2126120 Just in the nick of time, huh?
2126160 2128640 l got a first-class unit here,<br />SWAT team and all.
2128720 2131280 We don't need<br />any Monday-morning quarterbacks.
2131360 2134040 My wife's on one of the planes<br />they're fucking with!
2134120 2135640 So I'm on the playing field.
2135680 2139400 If you'd have moved your fat ass before,<br />we wouldn't be deep in shit now.
2139520 2141760 That's it. Security. You're out of here.
2141880 2143880 Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations...
2144000 2146960 ..regarding unauthorised personnel<br />in the control tower!
2147040 2148960 We just have to find a way to transmit.
2149040 2151680 Somebody want to run<br />to Radio Shack for a transmitter?
2151760 2154240 We have one -<br />the terminal wing they're building.
2154360 2155920 20 airlines when it's done,...
2156000 2159320 ..all with reservation computers<br />in a nice antenna arrangement.
2159440 2163000 - See Mr McClane out.<br />- You got no business being up here.
2163120 2165680 Everything we need<br />is by the annexe skywalk...
2165760 2168280 ..just sitting there, waiting to go on line.
2168360 2170880 God dammit, Trudeau,<br />you're dealing with pros.
2170960 2172800 You can't fuck with these people!
2172880 2174360 Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
2174480 2177040 There are a lot of rumours flying around.
2177120 2179360 No way. No way, lady.<br />Hell, no. No.
2179440 2181520 This is off limits, Coleman.
2181640 2183200 (Captain) Get them out of here!
2183280 2185760 Anything you can think of,<br />they'll think of, too!
2185880 2187640 Get your fucking hands off me.
2187760 2189560 (Captain) Just get them out of here.
2191040 2191760 Lobby security,...
2191880 2193600 - ..come in.<br />- Tomalson here.
2193680 2195280 This is Captain Lorenzo.
2195360 2197480 We've two unauthorised personnel<br />in the tower.
2197600 2199360 Would you get your thumb<br />out of your ass?
2199440 2203160 Get them out of the elevator,<br />or you'll get a pink slip for Christmas.
2203280 2205640 10-4. Let's go.
2205760 2207440 Goddamn!
2208360 2210760 Anything who can think of?<br />Can't fuck with who?
2210880 2212160 Shit. Hang on over there.
2212240 2213360 - What for?<br />- Just hang on!
2213880 2216600 Big drug dealer on his way to prison.
2216720 2218360 Gunfight at airport.
2218480 2221280 Every controller in the coffee shop<br />getting beeped,...
2221360 2222720 ..and you rocking the boat.
2222800 2225280 Connection? Come on, McClane.<br />Just a few words.
2225360 2226960 OK, just a few words. Fuck off.
2227040 2230120 Thanks, but I already got<br />that from Colonel Stuart.
2231600 2235720 Stuart. The guy that got canned<br />by Congress. That's who he was.
2235840 2237320 Who he who? What? Hey...
2237440 2240640 Shh! It's OK, I've done this before.
2250880 2252160 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2253040 2255040 - Where's the other one?<br />- Claustrophobic, I guess.
2257440 2260640 It's a VHF system,<br />but the planes are so close, it's OK.
2260720 2263680 l can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,<br />and wire in a crossover.
2263760 2266080 Even the planes wouldn't<br />know the difference.
2266400 2268880 Get what you need.<br />Borrow. Steal. Kill.
2268960 2271160 l want my SWAT team<br />to go with him as cover.
2271280 2273880 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of, too.
2279280 2281680 Oh, man. I can't fucking believe this.
2281760 2284040 Another basement. Another elevator.
2284120 2287360 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?
2303640 2306160 (distant music)
2307760 2309760 (What the fuck?)
2309880 2311840 # Old Cape Cod
2321040 2327200 # lf you like the taste of a lobster stew
2327880 2333520 # Served by a window with an ocean view
2334120 2340800 # You're sure to fall in love<br />with Old Cape Cod
2343440 2344400 Who are you?
2345880 2349480 I’m Marvin. Marvin. I'm Marvin.
2349600 2352120 l thought you was trying<br />to steal my records.
2352880 2355120 I’m just the janitor.
2361280 2363200 This is Dulles approach to all aircraft...
2363280 2365200 ..holding at Potomac vortex.
2365280 2367880 We are experiencing<br />some technical problems.
2367920 2370000 Weather conditions,<br />which have deteriorated...
2370120 2374400 ..have now been complicated<br />by an unforeseen human factor.
2374480 2378040 This has affected all<br />of our electronic equipment...
2378120 2380120 ..and their redundant backups.
2380240 2383760 As a result, our nav<br />and approach systems are down.
2383880 2386080 We expect to lose<br />voice in another minute.
2386160 2387520 We want you to continue...
2387640 2390400 ..holding at the outer marker<br />as directed...
2390480 2392400 ..and wait for further instructions.
2392480 2394440 As soon as we're back on line,...
2394560 2397600 ..we'll expedite your landings<br />on a fuel-emergency basis.
2399040 2401000 Good luck.
2402640 2404400 God bless.
2409840 2411000 OK, change the boards.
2415040 2417640 (muttering)
2421440 2423440 (phone rings)
2438360 2439840 Hey, stand back.
2439920 2442360 - The skywalk annexe.<br />- No! The annexe skywalk.
2442480 2445720 It's the last thing I heard<br />before they kicked me out.
2445840 2447960 Well, let me see here, now.
2448080 2449760 Well, this must be it right there.
2449880 2454400 See? That's the raised platform<br />and there's the new terminal.
2454480 2455880 There's your skywalk.
2456480 2459200 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2460720 2463640 What's the fastest way<br />you can get me out to that spot?
2466120 2469360 This kind of thing wasn't<br />in my job description.
2469440 2473360 - Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.<br />- Yeah? Who watches yours?
2484240 2486080 Main ventilation duct.
2486880 2488360 Ventilation duct...
2489280 2490720 ..and bingo.
2490800 2491960 Just once,...
2492080 2495320 ..I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.
2497040 2501720 Eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,...
2501840 2503720 ..a little turkey.
2503840 2505200 But, no!
2505280 2509040 l got to crawl around<br />in this motherfucking tin can!
2514120 2516280 We're in the annexe skywalk.<br />I can see the array.
2516360 2519280 I’ll give you a call<br />for a protocol test when it's hot.
2519360 2520480 That's all for now.
2520560 2522960 (Barnes)<br />Sergeant, we need more equipment.
2523040 2524880 I'd like to send one<br />of your guys for it.
2524960 2526680 Right, sir. You got it.
2528640 2529720 What the hell?
2529840 2531480 What the hell's going on?
2531600 2533600 Hey! Put that back on!
2535600 2538240 Hey, asshole,<br />what do I look like to you?
2539040 2540640 A sitting duck.
2542320 2543320 Take him!
2544880 2545840 Shit!
2547440 2550640 Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.
2554720 2556480 Look out! Get down!
2567600 2569160 Aagh!
2585120 2586720 Aagh!
2600240 2602960 (gunfire)
2604960 2606920 (gunfire stops)
2652080 2653320 Stay down!
2667520 2668800 Fuck!
2676960 2678120 Come on.
2698320 2700320 Fucking son of a bitch.
2706640 2707560 Aagh!
2717040 2718080 Shit.
2718720 2720080 Agh! Ugh!
2728080 2731000 I’m going to kick your fucking ass.
2762800 2765760 - Jeez.<br />- You all right?
2765840 2769640 Yeah. But the antenna array,...<br />I got to get to it and set it up.
2774320 2775480 Get down!
2794080 2796120 (Goddamn.)
2797680 2798880 Bait.
2801360 2802880 Jerk us off.
2802960 2806400 Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.
2810160 2812600 Make you waste your time,...
2815440 2817200 ..time we don't have.
2830720 2833120 l think you're closer than 50 yards.
2833200 2836600 So's that airplane. Practically.
2836720 2838800 Yeah. There's quite a few of them.
2838880 2840840 Itlooks like a regular traffic jam.
2840960 2842800 There's nothing regular about it.
2843360 2845280 See? You're intrigued.
2845360 2847920 That's my gift, Mrs McClane.<br />I notice things.
2848000 2852560 Things other people wouldn't see.<br />That's how I make people curious.
2852640 2854400 Don't you mean nauseous?
2854480 2858640 Look. The people have a right<br />to know everything about everybody.
2858720 2860720 You got in the way of that.
2860800 2863520 Listen, buster.<br />You endangered my children.
2863600 2866440 You didn't do it<br />for anything as noble as the people.
2866560 2868160 The only time you see the people,...
2868240 2870760 ..is when you look down to see<br />what you're stepping on.
2875440 2877400 Me? Yeah, I'll live.
2877520 2879560 But Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,...
2879680 2882040 ..and the antenna array is gone.
2882160 2884200 - (beeping)<br />- Didn't you see it?!
2885680 2888000 It's hard looking for a new miracle.
2889440 2892280 (Barnes) Hold for a minute.<br />I’ll be right back.
2892400 2894360 Hold for a second.<br />Something's going on.
2894480 2897280 Yeah. Just hold on for a minute.
2897360 2900160 l say again, annexe team,<br />give us a sit rep.
2901360 2904320 Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?
2905520 2907200 It's got a scrambler on it.
2907280 2909480 Can you do anything with it?
2910640 2914440 No. This scramble mode<br />must activate on this code panel.
2914560 2917520 Even if we scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
2917600 2919520 - These guys are pros.<br />- So are you. Break the code.
2919600 2921600 l want to hear<br />what these bastards are saying.
2921680 2924240 This is a ten-digit control panel.<br />Six-digit read-out.
2924320 2926840 Hell, there could be<br />a million combinations.
2926960 2930720 Next time you kill one of these guys,<br />get him to enter the code first.
2930800 2931920 Yeah.
2933120 2936320 Sir, we just monitored a call<br />from their Chief Engineer.
2936400 2938880 We took out their SWAT team,<br />completely.
2938960 2941600 You were right.<br />They went for the antenna array.
2941680 2945240 - We're on schedule.<br />- Losing our team wasn't part of the plan.
2950320 2951880 Attention, Dulles tower.
2952000 2953600 Attention, Dulles control tower.
2953680 2956640 Mr Trudeau, I know you're listening.
2956720 2960320 - Unfortunately, you're not obeying.<br />- Try me face to face.
2960400 2962240 You were warned<br />not to restore your systems.
2962320 2965960 You've wasted lives and precious time<br />on a futile and obvious target.
2966080 2968720 Now you're going to pay the penalty.
2968800 2970880 I’ve got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.
2970960 2972640 Isn't that penalty enough?
2972720 2975400 McClane, keep out of this.<br />You've been a pain...
2977200 2978880 (Stuart) Oh, McClane.
2978960 2980960 John McClane.
2982000 2986040 The policeman hero who saved<br />the Nakatomi hostages.
2986160 2987880 l read about you in People magazine.
2988000 2990120 You seemed out of your league on Nightline.
2990240 2991600 Hey, Colonel, blow me.
2991680 2995360 How much drug money is Esperanza<br />paying you to turn traitor?
2995440 2999160 Cardinal Richelieu said it best:<br />''Treason is merely a matter of dates''.
2999280 3003120 This country's got to learn<br />it can't keep cutting the legs off...
3003200 3005400 ..of men like General Esperanza.
3005520 3008800 Men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3008880 3011880 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3012000 3014440 What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?
3015440 3018320 No. I think we can find<br />something in between.
3020800 3022080 Watch this.
3023280 3026400 Give me a flight number.<br />One that's low on fuel.
3027280 3029320 Windsor 114.<br />Transatlantic from London.
3029440 3031000 Fuel tank's dry as a martini.
3032320 3036320 Activate the ILS landing system,<br />but recalibrate sea level...
3037840 3039840 ..minus 200 feet.
3062880 3066680 Oh, Jesus! They've reset<br />ground level, minus 200 feet.
3067680 3069160 (Stuart) Windsor flight 114.
3069280 3070400 This is Dulles approach.
3070480 3072160 Do you copy?
3072240 3074640 Dulles approach, this is Windsor 114.
3074720 3077800 - Where the devil have you been?<br />- Windsor 114.
3077920 3080720 We've been right here all along, old buddy.
3080800 3083200 Our systems have only just<br />came back on line.
3084000 3087320 Windsor 114,<br />you are cleared for ILS approach,...
3087440 3088800 ..runway two-niner.
3088880 3091640 Contact Dulles tower frequency<br />at the outer marker.
3091760 3093920 Jesus Christ,<br />he's gonna crash the plane!
3094000 3095520 Roger, approach, and about time.
3095600 3098560 I’ve got 230 people up here<br />flying on petrol fumes.
3098640 3100080 Roger, 114. Understand.
3100160 3102560 - Calibrate Dulles altimeter...<br />- Oh, Jesus.
3102640 3104560 They'll fly right into the concrete.
3104640 3106080 Son of a bitch!
3106160 3108040 Why are they listening to him?
3108160 3110960 - It's our frequency!<br />- Dulles, this is Windsor 114.
3111840 3112840 Barnes!
3112960 3116240 This is Dulles tower.<br />We have radar contact...
3116320 3119000 - Give me your coat!<br />- Windsor 114, standby...
3119120 3121080 What are you going to do?
3121200 3122720 Whatever I can.
3125360 3129440 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we've started our descent.
3129520 3131440 We're sorry for the inconvenience,...
3131520 3134240 ..but we'll all be on the ground shortly.<br />Thank you.
3134320 3136240 Please keep your seat belts on.
3136320 3139040 We've made arrangements<br />for your next flight,...
3139120 3141040 ..so you won't miss it, OK?
3141120 3144000 ln your seat, please.<br />Come on, in your seat.
3144960 3147680 Oh, hey.<br />We're just like British Rail, love.
3147760 3150080 We may be late, but we get you there.
3150160 3151760 Don't worry.
3166960 3168480 Good luck, McClane!
3188800 3190880 (beeping)
3190960 3195040 Dulles, this is Windsor 114<br />inside the outer marker.
3195120 3197600 Roger, 114. This is Dulles tower.
3197680 3200000 We have radar contact<br />and show you on ILS.
3200080 3202560 You're in the glide path<br />and looking good.
3211440 3213440 There's somebody out there!
3217200 3218800 It's McClane.
3218880 3220640 Christ.
3224720 3225920 Approach flaps.
3226400 3227720 Approach flaps.
3227840 3231680 - Approach speed 140.<br />- Approach speed 140.
3231760 3233280 - 130.<br />- 130.
3233360 3235400 Altitude 1,000 feet.
3235520 3237640 800, guys! You're only at 800 feet!
3237760 3240880 (radio) Fire and rescue.<br />Roll everything onto runway two-niner!
3240960 3243400 (aircraft captain) Ref speed plus 20.
3243520 3245280 600 feet.
3245360 3247880 Looking good, Windsor.
3248000 3249440 Now, watch it.
3249520 3252320 30-knot crosswinds,<br />and the runway is icy.
3252400 3254320 Attaboy. We've got you.
3255280 3256800 We've got you.
3269360 3270480 Pull it up!
3271520 3272240 Jesus!
3285520 3288760 - Aagh! We're going to die!<br />- We've got you.
3314400 3316000 God.
3320080 3322080 Motherfucker.
3325040 3326400 Motherfucker.
3329600 3331360 (man) Oh, Jesus.
3342320 3345520 That concludes our object lesson<br />for this evening.
3345600 3347880 If the 747 we requested<br />is ready on time...
3348000 3351200 ..and General Esperanza's plane<br />arrives unmolested,...
3351280 3353200 ..further lessons can be avoided.
3353280 3354280 Out.
3359520 3360960 (woman crying)
3365120 3367360 (sirens)
3386880 3388640 (yelling)
3398720 3401200 We got no sign of survivors down here.
3401280 3402880 It's a goddamn nightmare.
3404720 3406920 Hey, Nelson! Come here.
3416720 3417680 Barnes!
3418800 3422600 We've got to warn those planes<br />there's a lunatic pretending he's the tower.
3422720 3424960 - Get me on the air.<br />- How?
3425040 3426320 You figure it out!
3426400 3427840 Here's the manifest.
3447760 3450760 McClane, I know how you must feel.
3454640 3457600 l wanted to help those people.
3457680 3460400 l was pretty goddamn useless.
3465120 3467400 We called the government for help.
3467520 3471200 They're going to send in<br />a Special army unit.
3471280 3473280 A counterterrorist team.
3479840 3482520 Your wife's plane...
3482640 3486880 They're still broadcasting,<br />even though we can't answer.
3487920 3490880 They're going to run<br />out of fuel in 90 minutes.
3502480 3505160 Listen, Dick. That is your name?
3505280 3506800 Dick.
3506880 3509600 If you're going<br />to continue to get this close,...
3509680 3511600 ..could you switch aftershaves?
3512960 3514720 Anything else?
3514800 3517720 Stronger mouthwash might be nice.
3517840 3521120 (TV) And here's Sam Coleman<br />reporting live from the accident.
3521200 3524200 Colonel, they've done<br />everything we've anticipated...
3524320 3526000 ..so far.
3526080 3527680 (TV)<br />But still there has been no official word.
3527760 3532040 Despite the fact that only one runway<br />has been closed due to the tragedy,...
3532160 3536320 ..several dozen airliners are visible,<br />endlessly circling the field.
3536400 3540480 Other reports say there was trouble<br />in the tower before the crash...
3540560 3543200 ..and that that may have contributed to it.
3543280 3545440 With weather conditions worsening,...
3545520 3547920 ..the problem here<br />and in the sky will grow.
3548000 3551280 I’m Samantha Coleman<br />at Dulles International Airport.
3557680 3558960 Victor. Victor.
3559040 3561480 - Victor.<br />- Yeah, what's up?
3561600 3564320 Did you pack the radio mikes<br />from the shoot or are they here?
3564400 3566320 l wouldn't let those assholes<br />check them in!
3566400 3567560 l love you.
3567680 3569680 Give me one of the receivers.
3574000 3577280 Can you tune into<br />the cockpit frequency?
3577360 3580280 - Yeah. Why?<br />- I want to hear what's going on.
3582000 3584320 Should be right here on our band.
3585280 3586280 Nothing.
3586400 3588280 You said it would work.<br />ls it working or not ?
3588400 3592440 Itis working, but all I'm getting<br />is some kind of airport beacon.
3592560 3595440 It's weird. It's like the tower isn't there.
3598240 3600000 Stay on it.
3600080 3602760 Let me know when<br />there is something there.
3603360 3604960 OK.
3640640 3642240 Major Grant. We're Blue Light.
3642320 3644000 Rollins, Department Of Justice.
3644080 3646000 Trudeau, Chief Of Air Operations.
3646080 3647600 Lorenzo, Terminal Police.
3647680 3649520 You want something, you got it.
3649600 3652520 This is it? One fucking platoon?
3652640 3654880 One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?
3654960 3656000 John McClane.
3656080 3658800 McClane, you showed<br />some balls out there, man.
3658880 3660400 Yeah.
3660480 3663800 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3663920 3666360 l think the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3666480 3668240 Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?
3668320 3669760 No, not anymore, he's not.
3669840 3671920 We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
3672000 3674160 And we will take him down.
3674240 3677320 l served with him.<br />I taught him everything he knows.
3677440 3681080 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3682160 3683440 Let's hustle!
3683520 3686640 The command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3686720 3689640 l want to be tied into the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3689760 3691360 All right, let's do it!
3693200 3694520 Hey, Trudeau.
3696080 3698320 Did things just get better or worse?
3702480 3704360 Lights. Big, portable lights.
3704480 3706400 We set up the field, and then we...
3706480 3708520 Wait for those lunatics<br />to shoot them out?
3708640 3710000 Where do we get those lights?
3710080 3711520 What about the air phone idea?
3711600 3715240 There's 18 planes up there.<br />Only five of them have those phones.
3715360 3717600 We got through to three.<br />We're trying the others.
3717680 3719280 That's 13 potential accidents.
3719360 3721280 Are they still bucking headwinds?
3721360 3723360 Headwinds are slamming<br />everybody over the outer marker.
3723440 3724800 The planes with enough fuel...
3724880 3727560 ..have been shunted<br />to Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.
3727680 3729680 Outer marker.
3729760 3730680 Damn!
3731600 3733520 The outer marker!
3733600 3736400 It's a beacon, right?<br />Itsends out this beep beep beep...
3736480 3738080 ..so they know they're over it.
3738160 3741400 - So?<br />- Who says that signal has to beep?
3741520 3744400 We switch the frequency from<br />the tower to the one in the beacon.
3744480 3745920 We pump up the wattage.
3746000 3749000 We can talk to our planes, and<br />those bastards who did this won't know!
3752480 3755120 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3755200 3758160 They've been tapped into<br />your tower chatter all night.
3758240 3760680 Punks stealing luggage, huh, Carmine?
3763760 3766680 - How you doing, Telford?<br />- No good. I called Lang.
3766800 3769360 They'll have a portable decoder<br />here in two hours.
3769440 3771280 My wife doesn't have two hours.
3771360 3773360 l was put on Grant's team yesterday.
3773440 3775360 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3775440 3778160 Word is, nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.
3778240 3779400 Attention!
3779520 3781480 Except maybe Colonel Stuart.
3783040 3786160 l want to hear about<br />the plane those bastards asked for.
3786240 3789840 Then I'll fill you in on my orders.<br />Pilots' Briefing Room. Now!
3790000 3790880 Keep working.
3790960 3792200 Albertson. With me.
3796720 3798680 No civilians.
3809120 3811760 - What the fuck... ?<br />- What is it?
3812760 3816480 The outer marker beeper.<br />Itisn't beeping. It's talking.
3816560 3819840 (radio) Attention,<br />all aircraft in Dulles landing pattern.
3819920 3822040 This is Chief Engineer, Leslie Barnes.
3822120 3825320 l have been authorised<br />to brief you in full.
3825400 3829480 At this time, this is the only<br />channel available to us.
3829560 3831680 Here is the situation.
3831760 3833760 Approximately two hours ago...
3836760 3838120 Get a load of this.
3838200 3841040 Do not accept instructions<br />claiming to be from our tower...
3841120 3843680 ..unless you hear<br />your flight recorder access code.
3843760 3845760 - The terrorists have got all...<br />- Holy shit!
3845840 3847880 - ..our systems and...<br />- Get this on tape!
3847960 3849920 ..have control of everything<br />except this channel.
3850000 3851200 Give us a second here, please.
3851280 3854680 This channel is secure.<br />Your own transmissions are not.
3854760 3858640 Do not attempt to reply on your<br />own frequencies to this broadcast.
3858720 3861040 These people have already<br />caused one crash...
3861120 3863240 - ..by impersonating our tower.<br />- Jesus.
3873800 3876080 Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...
3876160 3878240 ..the two systems that allow you to land:
3878320 3882520 field lights fora visual landing<br />and the ILS for an instrument.
3882600 3886320 A Special US Army unit is here,<br />preparing to take out the terrorists.
3886400 3888800 - My God.<br />- Don't accept any instructions...
3888880 3891840 - Yo, Marvin.<br />- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
3891920 3894160 No. Itnever looked good on me anyway.
3894240 3896880 You've got to get me<br />to the Pilots' Briefing Room.
3896960 3898920 I’ve got to hear what they're saying.
3899000 3902320 - Which map gets me in there?<br />- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
3902400 3903960 - Find the map, Marvin.<br />- I'll find it.
3904040 3906080 You'll mess up my whole<br />damn filing system.
3906160 3909120 Pilots' Briefing Room,<br />I think that's in the main terminal.
3909200 3912720 So would that be under P<br />for Pilots' Briefing Room?
3912800 3916640 - Now, Marvin!<br />- Or maybe under M for Miscellaneous.
3920120 3921760 - (beeping)<br />- Oh, shit!
3921840 3925280 (radio) Request permission<br />to reduce sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.
3925360 3927520 My men are getting cold and antsy.<br />Over.
3927600 3932120 This is Colonel Stuart. Assemble<br />the men not on watch fora briefing.
3932200 3933320 - Roger.<br />- What's the matter?
3933400 3935040 Oh!
3936040 3937680 Gentlemen,...
3938840 3940840 ..tonight the pattern ends.
3940920 3943240 The dominoes will fall no more,...
3943320 3945440 ..and the ramparts will remain upright.
3945520 3948240 Sir, General Esperanza's plane<br />is on the scope.
3954880 3956440 Attention, Dulles tower.
3956880 3958640 We will be lighting up a runway.
3958720 3962120 Do not, repeat,<br />do not attempt to land any planes.
3962200 3965040 Remember, we're monitoring you.
3967760 3969520 What do we do?
3969960 3971360 Obey.
3977200 3979480 Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael One.
3979560 3980640 Dulles tower...
3980720 3982400 ..to Foxtrot Michael One.
3982480 3985680 This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.<br />We read you. Over.
3985760 3988040 Foxtrot Michael One,<br />you are to come in on runway...
3988120 3991440 ..1-5, repeat, 1-5.
4004720 4008640 l found it on the floor,<br />by the coat, next to the luggage belt.
4008720 4010360 What the hell you so excited for?
4010440 4012480 The code's still punched into this one.
4012560 4013960 You like it, huh?
4014040 4016000 How about giving me 20 bucks for it?
4016080 4018240 How about I let you live?
4020120 4021720 The man knows how to bargain.
4021800 4024160 This is contrary to our instructions.
4024240 4026920 We are to land at runway 1-0,...
4027000 4030200 ..where we are to be met<br />by representatives of your Justice...
4031280 4035040 Captain, please tell the tower<br />you will proceed as ordered.
4045680 4047840 Roger, Dulles.
4047920 4050320 Proceeding to runway 1-5.
4050400 4052600 (yelling)
4057560 4058520 (gunshots)
4065560 4067640 Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.
4069120 4071880 What are you going to do now?<br />Are you going to shoot me?
4071960 4073280 So who will fly the plane?
4073360 4076560 Don't worry about it.<br />It's not your problem.
4077520 4079520 (plane descending)
4082880 4084400 Michael One. Do you copy?
4088160 4090600 Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.
4095320 4096360 (beep)
4097680 4098880 (beeping)
4098960 4100320 Eagle Nest.
4100400 4102120 This is Falcon. Mayday.
4102200 4105160 Eagle Nest. This is Falcon. Mayday!
4106760 4108400 Go ahead, Falcon.
4108480 4111440 I’ve lost cabin pressure.<br />Near-zero visibility.
4111520 4114280 l must drop out<br />of this weather and land now,...
4114360 4116240 ..on the first accessible runway.
4116320 4117520 Repeat.
4117640 4120440 I’ve lost cabin pressure.<br />Near-zero visibility.
4120520 4122440 l must drop out of the storm.
4122520 4126720 l can land, but I must land now,<br />on the first outgoing runway.
4126800 4130480 Repeat.<br />I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.
4134120 4135720 I’ll make you a deal, Marvin.
4135800 4137600 Show me a shortcut to those runways,...
4137680 4139480 ..and I'll get you a liner for that coat.
4139560 4142640 Repeat. I cannot circle<br />around to runway 1-5.
4142720 4144920 (Shit.) Stand by, Falcon.
4147080 4149400 Here, sir.<br />He's coming in from the ocean.
4150600 4153920 (Esperanza)<br />A bullet has damaged my instruments.
4154000 4155880 I’m not sure of my bearings,...
4155960 4158160 ..and I must make<br />a visual landing immediately.
4158240 4160960 - Do you copy, Eagle Nest?<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4161040 4162800 (radio) That would be 2-5 right.
4162880 4165040 Repeat. 2-5 right.
4165120 4168240 Make up your fucking mind!
4168320 4171040 We are just up to our ass<br />in terrorists again, John.
4171120 4173120 Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.
4173360 4174840 2-5 right.
4176400 4178520 I’ve got to quit smoking cigarettes.
4178600 4180800 (Esperanza)<br />Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.
4180880 4183040 But if you could show it to me as well,...
4183120 4184840 ..l would be grateful.
4195000 4198520 l see the lights.<br />They are directly in front of me.
4198600 4200040 Gracias, compadre.
4200120 4202920 Reducing airspeed.<br />Approaching runway.
4203000 4205960 - Wish me luck.<br />- Roger, Falcon.
4207000 4209280 We copy.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4209360 4212520 That's right, asshole.<br />We'll have you in five minutes.
4235160 4237040 (Stuart) I see your lights.
4237120 4238920 ETA 90 seconds.
4247160 4249480 Come to papa, scumbag.
4287840 4289920 (groans)
4302440 4303680 Oh, shit!
4314080 4315480 No!
4361360 4362560 Freedom.
4364240 4365440 Not yet.
4366320 4367240 (cocks gun)
4367320 4370840 You should stay in your seat<br />until the plane reaches the terminal.
4370920 4372800 No frequent-flier mileage for you.
4372880 4375080 - Who are you?<br />- A cop.
4375160 4376920 - A cop?<br />- Yeah, one of the good guys.
4377000 4378320 You're one of the bad guys.
4378400 4381440 Now I've got your sorry ass,<br />I’m going to trade it for my wife.
4381520 4382600 (gunfire)
4390440 4391440 Sit down!
4394680 4396600 Go in!
4402160 4403920 - Where did he go?<br />- ln there.
4412800 4414320 (Esperanza) I don't believe this.
4414400 4416520 Two months of planning,...
4416600 4418440 ..and you can't anticipate<br />one pendejo of a cop.
4418520 4420600 - Come on, General.<br />- Where is Colonel Stuart?
4424600 4426560 - General!<br />- I'm all right.
4426640 4430520 He said he was a policeman.<br />I thought you had this place secured.
4430600 4433720 - He went in the cockpit.<br />- He's going to hell!
4434640 4435640 McClane!
4435720 4438760 l assume it's you, McClane.
4439600 4441440 You're quite a little soldier.
4442000 4445720 You can consider this a military funeral!
4460840 4462840 Aaagh!
4469000 4471440 - How many grenades we got?<br />- Three each!
4472200 4473400 Use them!
4483480 4485040 Oh, fuck.
4498560 4500080 Go!
4512600 4516200 Aaagh!
4516280 4517600 Oh, shit!
4526000 4527640 You lucky fuck.
4529760 4531080 (sirens)
4531160 4532320 Fire trucks, sir.
4532400 4534720 Fall back to the church. Now!
4556280 4558320 Where's the fucking door?
4562280 4563200 (beep)
4571200 4574040 They're getting a little<br />nervous back there.
4574120 4575480 ln fact, so am l.
4575560 4576760 We're over Washington.
4576880 4579120 See if you can get any TV<br />to settle them down.
4579200 4581960 Works for me. I'll...
4582040 4583960 (beeping)
4604200 4607480 Writing your acceptance speech<br />for the video sleaze awards?
4607560 4610400 - Try Pulitzer.<br />- (PA) Ladies and gentlemen,...
4610480 4613520 ..while waiting to land, we are<br />turning on local Washington TV.
4613600 4615440 The sound is on channel three.
4622400 4623720 OK.
4624040 4625080 OK, OK.
4633160 4635480 Please, sir, we may land at any moment.
4635560 4638320 - If you'll take your seat...<br />- I'm going to be sick.
4638400 4641600 - I'm going to be sick.<br />- Sir, the seat beItlight is on.
4645440 4646760 Moron.
4646840 4648840 - WZDC.<br />- This is Richard Thornberg.
4648920 4650640 Put me through to Ruben<br />in the newsroom.
4650720 4654240 - He's about to go live.<br />- I know he is. That's why I need him.
4654320 4655640 You'll have to hold on...
4655720 4658600 Put me through, Celia,<br />or start typing your resume.
4658800 4661200 Esperanza's down,...
4662160 4663280 ..but he's hurt.
4663360 4665360 He took a round in his shoulder.
4665440 4668760 l got one more of their guys.<br />That's six they lost altogether.
4668840 4671680 If we knew how many they had<br />to start with, we could get excited,...
4671760 4675320 ..but if they got 50 guys,<br />it's a little early to open the champagne!
4675400 4679000 We appreciate your effort, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon here!
4679080 4682520 What if they crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your stunt?
4682600 4684280 They can't do that now, right, Barnes?
4684800 4687480 Besides, if I grabbed Esperanza,<br />this would be over now.
4687560 4690120 Maybe they're more creative<br />than you think!
4690200 4692360 Well, at least I'm thinking, god dammit!
4692440 4696040 We're here to jerk off that cocksucker<br />until he tries to take off.
4696120 4697120 Period!
4697240 4700080 You're the wrong guy<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time!
4702240 4703840 The story of my life.
4704920 4708080 Major! Pentagon Situation Room, sir!
4708160 4711360 Pentagon. I'll take it in here.<br />Thank you, Telford.
4711600 4714120 You men come with me.
4716120 4717600 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4717680 4720120 You said those guys<br />showed up right away?
4720200 4723120 - Yeah.<br />- That means they're on the field or close.
4723200 4725720 And I think I know where.
4725800 4727520 Let me show you something.
4729840 4732440 These are the old plans<br />with the longer runways.
4732520 4733640 That's 12 years ago.
4733720 4736280 Looks like they've modified the site,...
4736360 4739640 ..moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,<br />all the underground stuff...
4739720 4741520 ..so they could handle drainage.
4741600 4742800 If I'm right,...
4742880 4745400 ..it would run along the airport property...
4745480 4747600 ..and go right past this neighbourhood.
4750960 4753080 We should have landed two hours ago!
4753160 4755600 l understand, but if you just relax...
4755680 4756720 It's hopeless.
4757960 4761440 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess.
4761520 4765520 Unfortunately, there isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4765600 4768440 Oh, yeah?<br />What about that porker, Willard Scott?
4768520 4770320 l should have taken the bus.
4770400 4773240 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4773320 4774240 Excuse me.
4774960 4776080 Yes?
4776160 4777720 l was just wondering.
4777800 4782200 This flight originally was<br />supposed to be 5½ hours, right?
4782280 4783080 Mm-hmm.
4783160 4785720 Do we have enough fuel<br />to keep circling like this?
4785800 4786800 Oh, of course.
4786880 4789840 They anticipate little problems like this.
4805920 4809160 We looked at 12 fucking houses,<br />and we're nowhere.
4809240 4811960 This is our last possibility.
4812040 4814040 Over here there's an old church.
4814120 4815800 Let's go.
4819920 4821920 Wait.
4828000 4830520 There's the church over there.
4837640 4839440 Could be a sentry.
4839520 4841120 He could just be out for a walk.
4841200 4843600 Then why is he<br />going over his own footsteps?
4846040 4847240 Come on.
4849440 4850520 All right.
4850600 4853000 Stay here<br />and get ready to call the marines.
4853080 4854680 l thought they were the army.
4854760 4856680 Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.
4872600 4874880 - (beeping)<br />- Oh, shit.
4875880 4877040 (Not now.)
4890560 4892120 Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
4892200 4894720 Where the hell did you go?<br />Where's McClane?
4894800 4897960 With me, at the Hidey Lake Church,<br />to the west of the airport.
4898040 4901120 Where? God dammit!<br />You crazy idiot, why didn't...
4901200 4902880 This must be their operations base.
4902960 4904600 Shut up and get your ass here!
4904680 4906680 Code red! Sit rep.
4906760 4909080 We got positive ID on Stuart's location.
4909160 4910720 - Let's move.<br />- Yo!
4920520 4924000 Our escape plane will be ready<br />within 30 minutes, General.
4926120 4928200 If there are no more surprises.
4929480 4931480 (sirens)
4942640 4944720 Gentlemen, we have a situation here.
4990880 4993240 Aagh!
5002080 5003040 Ugh!
5018560 5019560 (whistles)
5019640 5020840 Over here.
5032520 5035320 Jeez, McClane, you all right?<br />You want a medic?
5035400 5038440 What the hell you think you're doing,<br />playing John Wayne?
5038520 5040680 How would you like to spend<br />the night in a cell?
5040760 5042880 Lorenzo, shut the fuck up<br />and do something useful.
5042960 5044120 Go seal off the street.
5044200 5046200 Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
5046280 5047560 Oh, no, Carmine?
5047640 5051200 Sergeant, get this bureaucrat<br />out of Mr McClane's face now.
5051280 5053120 With pleasure, sir.
5055320 5058640 Major, the men are in position, sir.
5058720 5060520 Close up the back. Then we go in.
5060600 5062920 - Fire only on my order.<br />- Roger that, sir.
5063000 5064720 Guess I was wrong about you.
5064800 5067200 You're not such an asshole after all.
5067280 5070720 No, you were right.<br />I’m just your kind of asshole.
5076000 5077480 (beeping)
5079320 5081320 Garber, sit rep!
5081400 5085120 Army Special Forces on three sides,<br />closing in fast around the back!
5085200 5087800 - Another problem, Colonel?<br />- No problem, General.
5089200 5091560 Gentlemen, you know what to do.
5102080 5104040 - Down!<br />- Get down! Get down!
5110600 5112040 (beeping)
5126720 5127720 (beeping)
5131000 5132000 General,...
5132720 5133880 ..it's time.
5135120 5137000 (power cuts off)
5137080 5138560 (beeping)
5141040 5143360 Come on, let's move it!
5156720 5159720 - They're pulling out... at the back!<br />- What?
5163960 5165840 (gunfire)
5167360 5168200 Move it!
5178240 5180720 Albertson, take your men around the back.
5187080 5189040 Aagh!
5193960 5195120 Aagh!
5205080 5207640 This equipment could land our planes.
5207720 5210320 There are trip wires.<br />They could have booby-trapped...
5210400 5212280 - They did.<br />- Got one here, too.
5212360 5214600 Looks like C-4.<br />The motherfucker is armed.
5214680 5216600 Clear the area! Everybody, now!
5219160 5221560 They booby-trapped all the equipment.
5221640 5223000 Seal off the building!
5223080 5224440 Shit!
5224520 5226960 Post sentries. No civilians allowed.
5227040 5229720 Hey, where the fuck is McClane?
5276520 5278040 Miller, take him!
5279840 5281360 I’ll cover you!
5315680 5319720 Aagh!
5326280 5328520 So much for the element of chance.
5329600 5330920 Let's move out.
5348280 5351840 l had the bastard in my sights.<br />I know I did.
5360840 5362680 Oh, Jesus Christ.
5367520 5369920 (Stuart)<br />Attention. Attention, Dulles tower.
5370000 5372760 This is Colonel Stuart.<br />Is our plane prepared?
5372840 5376760 Itis. It's in hangar 11.<br />It's the most remote building we've got.
5378120 5379720 We're on our way.
5379800 5383320 Have a ground crew there<br />to confirm the condition of the plane.
5383400 5386000 Do you believe the balls<br />on this son of a bitch?
5386080 5389760 Colonel, you're quite capable<br />of confirming it yourself.
5389840 5392920 Don't ask us to gift-wrap<br />potential hostages for you.
5393000 5394360 Major Grant, isn't it?
5394440 5395880 If you remember me, Colonel,...
5395960 5398360 ..then you remember<br />I know the drill as well as you do.
5399440 5401400 Check out your own fucking plane.
5401480 5405400 We move out in five minutes.<br />Flak jackets for everybody.
5405480 5409240 Body armour for the assauItteam.<br />Night scopes for the snipers.
5409320 5413120 We will take them in the hangar,<br />and I will pull that detonator...
5413200 5416040 ..out of Stuart's dead fucking hand myself.
5416120 5419120 Lorenzo, take all your men<br />back to the airport.
5419200 5420720 Seal off every exit,...
5420800 5423960 ..in case they try to slip past us<br />to break out onto the ground.
5424040 5425480 You got it.
5427520 5429080 All right, here we go.
5430360 5433120 This is nuts!<br />Every station has people at the airport,...
5433200 5435200 ..and no-one has heard<br />a whisper of this shit!
5435280 5436320 None of them is me.
5436400 5438240 You want proof, try this.
5438320 5441360 (Barnes) Repeat.<br />Terrorists have murdered civilians...
5441440 5444360 ..and cut off the two systems<br />that can allow you to land.
5444440 5448000 A Special US Army unit is here,<br />preparing to take out the terrorists.
5448080 5450800 - Jesus Christ.<br />- I want you to go live now.
5450880 5452760 Get me in from the files.<br />A publicity shot.
5452840 5454800 The maps, steal one from weather.
5454880 5456880 We're on it.<br />We're cutting in five minutes!
5456960 5459640 Tell the affiliates if they want in,<br />they got three minutes to shout.
5459720 5461320 Let's do this.
5462080 5463840 Network, here I come.
5466760 5469480 Telford,<br />what was your chicken-shit outfit doing...
5469560 5471120 ..while we were taking Grenada?
5472960 5474240 Grenada.
5474320 5477840 Five minutes of fire fight,<br />five weeks of surfing.
5477920 5479960 l wish I was with you guys for that.
5480040 5482280 Yeah. Me, too, kid.
5482840 5485120 - Really, sir?<br />- Sure.
5485480 5487760 Then we wouldn't have to do this.
5500320 5502400 (beeping)
5502480 5505240 Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.
5506280 5508920 On schedule... and in position.
5509000 5511200 Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here.
5511280 5513200 You have a green light.
5513360 5515760 l repeat, a green light.
5519280 5521280 (whistles)
5524520 5526000 Ugh!
5527120 5529440 Jesus, officer,<br />where did you come from,...
5529520 5530880 ..Pearl Harbour?
5534960 5538160 All right, let's clear it out, please.
5539160 5540280 Stand by.
5541040 5543480 Five, four, three...
5543560 5547040 (TV) This is a special bulletin<br />from WZDC News.
5547120 5550560 There has been a plane crash at Dulles,<br />where other aircraft still circle,...
5550640 5553800 ..with no explanation<br />from airport or FAA officials.
5553880 5556440 And now,<br />with an exclusive WZDC report,...
5556520 5560160 ..here's Dick Thornberg reporting<br />from the skies over Washington.
5560240 5564560 (Thornberg) I'm one of the thousand people<br />who has been circling our capital...
5564640 5569120 ..under the assumption that whatever<br />problem there was below was a normal one.
5569200 5571240 But the truth is far from normal.
5571320 5573280 The truth is terrifying.
5573360 5576440 Look out! Lady, look out!
5576520 5577360 Look out! Look out!
5577440 5579720 Look out! Look out!<br />Get out of the way!
5581040 5583800 Get out of the way!<br />Get out of the way, lady!
5583880 5585520 Go, go! Hey, hey, look out!
5585600 5587640 This is a recording of a conversation...
5587720 5590600 ..between Dulles tower<br />and a captive aircraft overhead.
5593720 5595720 Get out of the way!
5596400 5597520 Lorenzo!
5597600 5600560 - Are you out of your fucking mind?<br />- Where's the Blue Light team?
5600640 5603600 - Stuart's rigged explosives to a remote.<br />- Where's Grant?
5603680 5606240 They're going to kill that son of a bitch<br />and get it from them!
5606320 5608480 No, they're going to take off<br />on that plane with him!
5608560 5610600 Get the fuck out of here!
5610680 5613080 When the army canned Stuart,<br />he loaded that unit with his men!
5613160 5616960 - Are you nuts? That fire fight...<br />- Sideshow to buy him some time.
5617040 5620120 McClane, you are completely<br />around the fucking bend.
5620200 5621640 You're under arrest, motherfucker.
5627720 5630520 These are the bullets<br />they used out there tonight!
5630600 5632320 Blanks!
5634160 5636640 Jesus Christ.
5643320 5645680 This is Chief Lorenzo.
5645760 5649160 l want every officer recalled<br />and in body armour and full weaponry...
5649240 5651080 ..in the motor pool in five minutes.
5653480 5655880 It's time to kick ass.
5657560 5659840 Just like Iwo Jima!
5659920 5665000 (Thornberg) We have learned that<br />the terrorists have control of the airport,...
5665080 5668040 ..a fact that the authorities have repressed.
5668120 5672160 The terrorists promise more bloodshed<br />unless their demands are met.
5672240 5676280 Now that the Special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport,...
5676360 5680120 ..the likelihood of a full-scale battle<br />is dangerously close.
5700400 5702720 That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.
5702800 5705320 It's all over the airport.
5705400 5707440 (TV) 300 people have died...
5707520 5709840 When are we going to land?
5709920 5712320 ..and unfortunately,<br />they may not be the last.
5712400 5715640 The horrifying fact is that no-one is safe,...
5715720 5719520 ..either in the planes above Dulles<br />or in the terminal below.
5719600 5722880 The threat of a new and higher<br />body count at the airport...
5722960 5725160 ..hangs over the heads of everyone,...
5725240 5729000 ..and the holiday season<br />of peace and love has become a nightmare.
5734600 5736240 All right, listen up!
5736320 5739240 All units,<br />I want you to converge on hangar 11,...
5739320 5740640 ..all sides!
5740720 5742560 This car, McClane! Get in!
5742640 5745080 When the city blue show up<br />with their backup,...
5745160 5746880 ..they'll pick up the pieces!
5746960 5748520 Now, move out!
5748600 5751480 McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.
5752480 5753960 Merry Christmas.
5754040 5755840 Hi.
5761640 5765600 God dammit to hell!<br />Move that piece of shit!
5765680 5768600 Will you move<br />that goddamn piece of shit...
5768680 5769920 ..out of here?
5770000 5772080 Vito, get the fuck out of the car!
5772160 5774240 Get your ass in gear and help me!
5774320 5775280 Will you get... ?
5775360 5777720 Move that car right now!
5777800 5778920 Right there. Get that.
5779000 5780960 Hey, Coleman!
5781960 5784280 Sam! Sam Coleman!
5786160 5787160 Hey, Coleman!
5787240 5788520 Hi!
5788600 5789960 Coleman!
5791000 5794360 ..but at least the truth<br />is not among the hostages...
5794440 5797920 ..because l, Richard Thornberg,<br />just happened to be here...
5798000 5804920 ..to put his life and talent<br />on the line for humanity and country.
5805000 5807960 If this should be my final broadcast...
5810040 5812920 Amen to that,... Dick.
5813840 5815840 (reporter) Dick? We're live, Dick.
5815920 5817800 Where are you now?
5817880 5819240 Dick?
5821120 5822840 Truck lights approaching, sir.
5822920 5825320 They're here, right on schedule.
5825400 5827720 The hangar door, open it.
5827800 5829160 Clockwork.
5851800 5855120 Jeez, you give me this story,<br />and I'll have your baby.
5855520 5857920 Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.
5869040 5872320 Colonel, if I may say so,<br />you are some piece of work.
5872400 5875320 Thank you, Major.<br />You're not so bad yourself.
5875400 5877400 Congratulations on your escape, sir.
5877480 5880880 Thank you, Major.<br />Save them until we are all safe, hmm?
5880960 5882360 Sir.
5882440 5884320 My congratulations, gentlemen.
5884400 5886840 You've won a victory for our way of life,...
5886920 5889920 ..my pride, my admiration,<br />and a kick-ass vacation.
5890000 5891680 Now, get on board.
5919120 5921760 What's the matter, cowboy?<br />Ride too rough?
5921840 5924120 - I don't like to fly.<br />- Then why are you here?
5924200 5925720 l don't like to lose, either.
5925800 5928480 OK, whoa! Here we go!
5935760 5937640 l don't know about you guys,...
5937720 5940680 ..but I've seen enough<br />fucking snow to last me a lifetime.
5940760 5942720 You don't get much of that in the tropics.
5942800 5945480 For you gentlemen, we'll import it.
5948280 5949920 Shit! They left the hangar!
5953280 5955800 Right there. Right there. Get that.
5955880 5958040 - Now what?<br />- Get in front! Take it down!
5958120 5960120 Block their path so they can't get out!
5960200 5961640 I’m not playing chicken<br />with a 200-ton plane!
5961720 5964080 I’m crazy, but I ain't that crazy.<br />Forget it.
5964160 5965680 (radio) Dulles, this is Northeast 140.
5965760 5968000 - Request clearance to land.<br />- That's Holly's plane.
5968080 5970640 Repeat. Request emergency clearance.
5970720 5972800 l know you won't answer,<br />but you better listen!
5972880 5975000 We're down to fumes,<br />and we have to land.
5975080 5977080 ln five minutes, we're coming in.
5977200 5980160 That's my wife's plane!<br />Take it fucking down!
5980240 5982800 I’m not getting in front of that plane!
5986440 5988840 All right, how about getting over top of it?
5988920 5990400 (PA) This is the captain.
5990480 5991520 Your attention.
5991600 5994800 We have no choice<br />but to attempt an emergency landing.
5994880 5997200 Fasten your seatbelts<br />and assume crash positions...
5997280 5999600 ..as instructed by your cabin attendants.
5999680 6001840 Let's have the emergency check list.

6020520 6022480 (Thornberg) God!
6022560 6024680 (whimpers)
6027200 6028760 Oh, God.
6029160 6030520 Oh, God,...
6030600 6034320 Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
6040200 6041640 Just hang on!

6072000 6073640 Lower!
6073720 6074600 Aagh!
6082800 6086760 John, what the fuck are you doing<br />out on the wing of this plane?
6093000 6094440 Damn!
6099760 6101320 Mierda.
6101400 6102800 There's something wrong.
6103840 6105400 The ailerons.
6105480 6106560 We can't take off.
