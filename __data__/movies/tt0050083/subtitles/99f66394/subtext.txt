76452 78745 Thank you very much, sir.
78746 80997 You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
80998 83458 Shh. Shh.
83459 84959 We did it, Pete. We did it.
86962 88755 - For a moment, we had our doubts.<br />- Shh.
88756 92258 To continue, you've listened<br />to a long and complex case...
92259 94135 murder in the first degree.
94136 99182 A premeditated murder is the most serious<br />charge tried in our criminal courts.
99183 101017 You've listened to the testimony.
101018 104020 You've had the law read to you and<br />interpreted as it applies in this case.
104020 108124 It's now your duty to sit down and try<br />and separate the facts from the fancy.
108942 112587 One man is dead. Another<br />man's life is at stake.
113280 117366 If there's a reasonable doubt in your<br />minds as to the guilt of the accused...
117367 119368 a reasonable doubt...
119369 122246 then you must bring me<br />a verdict of not guilty.
122247 124207 Now if, however, there's<br />no reasonable doubt...
124208 128185 then you must in good conscience<br />find the accused guilty.
129213 133424 However you decide, your<br />verdict must be unanimous.
133425 136886 In the event that you find<br />the accused guilty...
136887 140306 the bench will not entertain<br />a recommendation for mercy.
140307 143601 The death sentence is<br />mandatory in this case.
143602 147413 You're faced with a grave responsibility.<br />Thank you, gentlemen.
149316 151459 The alternate jurors are excused.
157366 159467 The jury will now retire.
277360 279462 Try this one.<br />See if I can get it...
280697 282548 It's a muggy day.
285702 288162 Hey. Oh, oh.
300133 302301 - Piece of gum?<br />- No, thanks.
302302 304470 This thing is...
304470 306197 - Huh?<br />- ...move it.
307724 309976 - Come on, I'll give you a hand.<br />- Give me a hand with that.
309977 311410 That's it.
316942 318651 - You know something?<br />- Yeah?
318652 320486 I called the weather<br />bureau this morning.
320487 322488 This is gonna be the<br />hottest day of the year.
322489 324156 Could be.
324157 326158 Boy, you'd think they'd at least<br />air-condition these places.
326159 329578 - What is your name, sir?<br />- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.
329579 331080 Thank you very much.
331080 333916 Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.
333917 336836 Now, if there's anything you want,<br />I'll be right outside the door.
336837 339188 - Just knock.<br />- Okay, thanks. We will.
351600 352893 Good morning.
352894 354437 I never knew they locked the door.
354438 356705 Sure they lock the door.<br />What'd you think?
357690 360209 I don't know. It just<br />never occurred to me.
361737 363612 What's that for?
363613 365573 Oh, I thought we might<br />want to vote by ballot.
365574 368325 Great idea. Maybe we can<br />get him elected senator.
370495 372346 Just in case, you know.
375750 377960 - How'd you like it?<br />- Oh, I don't know.
377960 379712 It was pretty interesting.
379713 381756 Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
381757 384425 I mean, I've never<br />been on a jury before.
384426 387236 No? I've sat on many juries.
388305 391307 What gets me is the way those<br />lawyers talk and talk and talk...
391308 393559 even when it's an open-and-shut<br />case like this one.
393560 395352 Did you ever hear so<br />much talk about nothin'?
395353 397313 Well, I guess they're entitled.
397314 399874 Yeah. They're entitled.<br />It's the system, but...
400984 405154 If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids<br />down before they start any trouble.
405155 407323 It would save us a lot<br />of time and money.
407324 408949 - Hey, let's get started, huh?<br />- That's a good idea.
408950 411660 Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We<br />probably all got things to do here.
411660 413434 I figured we'd start out<br />with a five-minute break.
413460 414789 There's one gentleman<br />in the bathroom.
414790 415831 - Mr. Foreman.<br />- Huh?
415832 418709 - Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?<br />- Gee, I don't know.
418710 420561 I, uh... Well, I guess so.
425467 427009 Uh, you're in my seat.
427010 429111 - Oh. Excuse me.<br />- That's all right.
431556 433407 Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
436937 439480 What did you think of the case?
439480 441607 I mean, it had a lot<br />of interest for me.
441608 444835 No real... dead spots.<br />You know what I mean?
445612 448155 I tell you, we were lucky<br />to get a murder case.
448156 450199 I figured us for an<br />assault or burglary.
450200 452535 Boy, they can be the dullest.
454037 455412 Hey.
455413 457081 That the Woolworth Building?
457082 459083 That's right.
459084 460751 Isn't that funny?
460752 463212 You know, I've lived here all my life.<br />I've never been inside that.
463213 465381 If you had to<br />sort out all that junk...
465382 467550 Like that thing with the movies.
467550 470636 Yeah. You can say that again. And what<br />about that business with the knife?
470637 473597 I mean, asking grown-up people<br />to believe that kind of jazz, huh?
473598 476142 Well, I expected that.<br />You know what we're dealing with.
476143 478686 Yeah, I guess so.
478687 480479 Well, your horn works.<br />Now try your lights.
482065 483607 - What do you got, a cold?<br />- And how.
483608 485901 These hot-weather<br />colds can kill you.
485902 488404 I can hardly touch my nose.<br />You know what I mean?
488405 492032 I sure do. I just got over one.
492033 494306 Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,<br />let's go here, huh?
494332 496579 Well, that guy's still<br />in the bathroom.
496580 499498 Hey, what's new? I didn't get a<br />chance to see a paper this morning.
499499 500666 Hmm?
500667 503169 I was only wondering<br />how the market closed.
503170 505963 You got a seat on the Exchange?
505964 507798 I'm a broker.
507799 512261 I run a messenger service...<br />the Beck and Call Company.
512262 514471 The name is my wife's idea.
514472 518184 Got 37 men working.<br />Started with nothing.
518185 521437 Okay, men, let's<br />take our seats, huh?
524524 526442 Yeah, we can all get outta<br />here pretty quick, huh?
526443 527532 I don't know about the rest of you,
527558 529737 but I happen to have tickets<br />to that ball game tonight.
529738 531655 Yanks and Cleveland.
531656 533532 Yeah, we got this kid,<br />Modjelewski, in there.
533533 535284 Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.
535285 537494 You know... Phoom!
537495 539830 A real jug handle. You know?
539830 542166 Phoom!
542167 544585 You're a real baseball fan,<br />aren't you? Huh? Yeah.
544586 546128 Where do we sit here?
546129 549298 Well, I thought we'd sit in order,<br />you know, by jury numbers.
549299 551800 One, two, three, four, five...<br />so on, around the table.
551800 553135 If that's okay with you gentlemen.
553136 554303 - Sure.<br />- What's the difference?
554304 557431 - I think it's reasonable to sit in order.<br />- Let it be.
557432 559767 - Number 12. Do I sit down here?<br />- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...
559768 563103 - We start with you. One, right?<br />- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.
563104 565522 What was your impression of<br />the prosecuting attorney?
565523 567316 Okay. Two. You're two.
567317 568567 I beg pardon?
568568 572821 I thought he was really sharp, the way<br />he handled all those points one by one.
572822 576033 Logical sequence.<br />I was very impressed.
576034 579119 I think he... he did an expert job.
579120 582206 A lot of drive too,<br />you know? Real drive.
582207 583941 Okay, fellas, can we<br />hold it down a minute?
583967 584375 Sure.
584376 586043 Uh, fellas.
586044 589605 Say, we'd like to get started.<br />Gentleman at the window.
591174 593425 - We'd like to get started.<br />- Oh, I'm sorry.
593426 597179 Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid<br />kills his father... bing, just like that.
597180 599848 Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,<br />you'll see it happens all the time.
599849 601850 They let those kids<br />run wild up there.
601850 604645 Well, maybe it serves 'em right.<br />You know what I mean?
604646 606313 Is... Is everyone here?
606314 608232 The old man is inside.
608233 610943 Oh. Would you, uh,<br />knock on the door for him?
610944 612987 You a Yankee fan?
612988 614630 No. Baltimore.
615448 617049 - Baltimore?<br />- Yeah.
618243 620869 That's like being hit in the head<br />with a crowbar once a day.
622539 623872 Who have they got?
623873 626375 No, I mean, who have they got<br />besides good groundskeepers?
626376 628002 Say, uh, we'd like to get started.
628003 631146 Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.<br />I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
631840 633716 Baltimore?
633717 636593 Okay, gentlemen,<br />if I can have your attention.
636594 639638 You fellas can handle this thing<br />any way that you want to.
639639 642224 I'm, um... You know,<br />I'm not gonna make any rules.
642225 645602 Uh, we can, well, discuss it<br />first and, uh, then vote on it.
645603 648355 That's, of course, uh...<br />That's, uh, one way.
648356 651400 And, uh, well, we can vote<br />on it right now, and...
651400 653986 I think it's customary to<br />take a preliminary vote.
653987 657656 Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?<br />Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?
657657 659450 Uh-huh.
659450 662619 Okay, then I think that, uh...
662620 665581 Of course you know that we have a<br />first-degree murder charge here...
665582 667750 and if we vote the<br />accused guilty...
667750 671086 uh, we've got to send<br />him to the chair.
671087 674923 - Um, that's mandatory.<br />- I think we know that.
674924 676759 - Let's see who's where.<br />- We might as well.
676760 680654 - Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?<br />- All right with me.
681765 686435 Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this<br />has to be 12 to nothing either way.
686436 687978 Um, that's the law.
687979 690105 Okay, are we ready?
690106 693208 Now, all those voting guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
697113 700716 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
701950 704620 eight, nine, 10, 11.
704620 707623 Okay. That's 11 guilty.
707624 709224 Those voting not guilty.
710293 712461 One. Right.
712462 714855 That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.
715673 717341 Well, now we know where we are.
717342 721612 Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
722055 724431 So, what do we do now?
724432 726350 Well, I guess we talk.
726350 727768 Boy, oh, boy.
727769 729703 You really think he's innocent?
733066 734691 I don't know.
734692 737653 I mean, you sat in court with the<br />rest of us. You heard what we did.
737654 739863 The kid's a dangerous killer.<br />You could see it.
739864 741573 He's 18 years old.
741574 743742 Well, that's old enough. He...
743743 746495 He stabbed his own father<br />four inches into the chest.
746496 748831 They proved it a dozen<br />different ways in court.
748832 751458 Would you like me to<br />list them for you?
751459 752835 No.
752836 755003 Then what do you want?
755004 758006 - I just want to talk.<br />- What's there to talk about?
758007 759425 Eleven men in here<br />think he's guilty.
759426 761760 No one had to think about<br />it twice except you.
761760 765055 I want to ask you something.<br />Do you believe his story?
765056 767850 I don't know whether I believe<br />it or not. Maybe I don't.
767850 769518 So how come you vote not guilty?
769519 771520 Well, there were 11<br />votes for guilty.
771520 774356 It's not easy to raise my hand<br />and send a boy off to die...
774357 776525 without talking about it first.
776526 779044 - Well, now, who says it's easy?<br />- No one.
780238 782489 What, just because I voted fast?
782490 784992 I honestly think the guy's guilty.
784993 787870 You couldn't change my mind if<br />you talked for a hundred years.
787870 789972 I'm not trying to change<br />your mind. It's just that...
790457 792791 We're talking about<br />somebody's life here.
792792 794960 We can't decide it in five minutes.<br />Supposing we're wrong.
794960 796462 "Supposing we're wrong."
796463 798547 Supposing this whole building<br />should fall down on my head.
798548 800649 - You can suppose anything.<br />- That's right.
801384 803218 Look, what's the difference<br />how long it takes?
803219 805888 Suppose we do it in<br />five minutes. So what?
805889 808098 Let's take an hour.
808099 810117 The ball game doesn't<br />start till 8:00.
812729 813996 Hmm?
816065 817983 Who's got something to say?
817984 819485 I'm willing to sit for an hour.
819486 822279 Great. I heard a pretty<br />good story last night.
822280 824464 That's not why we're sitting here.
825074 828719 All right, then you tell me.<br />What are we sitting here for?
829870 831805 I don't know. Maybe no reason.
832707 836251 Look, this kid's been kicked<br />around all of his life...
836252 840255 you know, born in a slum,<br />mother dead since he was nine.
840256 842549 He lived for a year and a half<br />in an orphanage when his...
842550 845552 his father was serving a<br />jail term for forgery.
845553 847971 It's not a very happy beginning.
847972 850182 He's a... a wild, angry kid.
850183 851975 That's all he's ever been.<br />And you know why?
851976 855771 'Cause he's been hit on the head<br />by somebody once a day every day.
855772 858065 He's had a... He's had a<br />pretty miserable 18 years.
858066 861109 I... I just think we owe<br />him a few words. That's all.
861110 864738 I don't mind telling you this, mister.<br />We don't owe him a thing.
864739 867908 He got a fair trial, didn't he?<br />What do you think that trial cost?
867909 869873 He's lucky he got it.<br />You know what I mean?
869899 873497 - You know it.<br />- Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.
873498 875457 We heard the facts, didn't we?
875458 879336 You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed<br />to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
879337 881797 Listen, I've lived among<br />them all my life.
881798 885217 You can't believe a word they say.<br />You know that.
885218 887135 I mean, they're born liars.
887136 890556 - Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br />- Now listen...
890557 893475 Do you think you were born<br />with a monopoly on the truth?
893476 896144 I think certain things should<br />be pointed out to this man.
896145 898313 Come on. This isn't Sunday.<br />We don't need a sermon.
898314 900666 Come on. We have a job<br />to do. Now let's do it.
901609 904753 Rice Pops. It's a product<br />I work on at the agency.
905488 908198 "The breakfast with<br />the built-in bounce."
908199 909908 - I wrote that line.<br />- Very catchy.
909909 912160 - Yeah.<br />- Say, do you mind?
912160 913954 Oh, I'm sorry.
913955 916498 I have this habit of doodling.<br />Keeps me thinking clearly.
916499 918292 Yeah, we have all this work to do.
918293 920085 - There's no point staying here forever.<br />- Sorry.
920086 920919 Okay. Um...
920920 922379 Okay. Um...
922380 926258 perhaps if the gentleman down there<br />who's disagreeing with us...
926259 929636 Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You<br />know, let us know what you're thinking.
929637 932097 And we might be able to show<br />you where you're mixed up.
932098 933849 Well, look, maybe...<br />Maybe this is an idea.
933850 936351 Now, I haven't given it much<br />thought, but it seems to me...
936352 938706 that it's up to the<br />group of us to convince
938732 940856 this gentleman that he's<br />wrong and we're right.
940857 943500 Now, maybe if we each took a<br />couple of minutes just to...
944819 946320 Well, it was just a quick idea.
946320 947863 No, no, no. That's a good one.
947864 951033 Uh, suppose we go once<br />around the table.
951034 953994 - I guess you're first.<br />- Oh.
953995 955429 Well, uh...
956873 959391 Well, it-it's hard<br />to put into words.
960335 962419 I just think he's guilty.
962420 965005 I thought it was obvious<br />from the word "go."
965006 966590 I mean, nobody proved otherwise.
966590 968216 Nobody has to prove otherwise.
968217 970552 The burden of proof's<br />on the prosecution.
970553 973096 The defendant doesn't even<br />have to open his mouth.
973097 976308 - That's in the Constitution.<br />- Oh, well, sure, I know that.
976309 978368 Uh, what I meant was, is...
980063 982147 Well, I just think he's guilty.
982148 983940 I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.
983940 989071 Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I<br />have no personal feelings about this.
989072 991339 I just want to talk about facts.
992240 994468 Number one.
994910 999122 The old man lived downstairs under the<br />room where the killing took place.
999123 1001333 At ten minutes after 12:00<br />on the night of the killing...
1001334 1005087 he heard loud noises,<br />said it sounded like a fight.
1005088 1008048 And he heard the kid yell out,<br />"I'm gonna kill ya."
1008049 1010425 A second later, he heard<br />a body hit the floor.
1010426 1012219 Ran to the door, opened it up...
1012220 1014721 saw the kid running down the<br />stairs and out of the house.
1014722 1016098 Called the police.
1016099 1018850 They came in, found the old man<br />with a knife in his chest.
1018850 1022187 The coroner fixed the time<br />of death around midnight.
1022188 1025357 Now these are facts.<br />You can't refute facts.
1025358 1027609 The kid is guilty.
1027610 1029695 I'm just as sentimental<br />as the next fella.
1029696 1033657 I know he's only 18, but he's still<br />gotta pay for what he did.
1033658 1035200 I'm with you.
1035200 1037828 Okay. Are you finished?
1037829 1039371 - Yeah.<br />- Right. Next.
1039372 1042666 It is obvious, to me anyway,<br />that the boy's entire story was flimsy.
1042667 1044960 He claimed he was at the movies<br />during the time of the killing...
1044960 1047587 and yet, one hour later, he couldn't<br />remember the names of the films he saw...
1047588 1049506 - or who played in them.<br />- That's right.
1049507 1051883 And no one saw him going<br />in or out of the theater.
1051884 1053593 Listen, what about the<br />woman across the street?
1053594 1055971 If her testimony don't<br />prove it, nothing does.
1055972 1058390 That's right. She was the one<br />who actually saw the killing.
1058390 1060892 Now, fellas, please.<br />Let's go in order here, huh?
1060893 1064229 Just a minute. Here's a woman...
1064230 1066773 Here's a woman who was<br />lying in bed. She can't sleep.
1066774 1068775 She's dying with the heat.<br />You know what I mean?
1068776 1070694 Anyway, she looks out the window...
1070695 1074364 and right across the street she sees<br />the kid stick the knife into his father.
1074365 1077325 The time is 12:10 on the nose.
1077326 1081204 Everything fits. Look, she's<br />known the kid all his life.
1081205 1083415 His window is right opposite<br />hers across the el tracks...
1083416 1085167 and she swore she saw him do it.
1085168 1087369 Through the windows of<br />the passing el train.
1087395 1092174 Right. This el train had no passengers<br />on it. It was just being moved downtown.
1092175 1095177 The lights were out, remember?<br />And they proved in court that, at night...
1095178 1097679 you can look through the windows of an<br />el train when the lights are out...
1097680 1100098 and see what's happening<br />on the other side.
1100099 1103018 - They proved it.<br />- I'd like to ask you something.
1103019 1105771 You don't believe the boy's story.<br />How come you believe the woman's?
1105772 1107622 She's one of them too, isn't she?
1110193 1112277 You're a pretty smart<br />fella, aren't you?
1112278 1113779 - Okay, gentlemen.<br />- Now, now.
1113780 1116072 - Now, gentlemen.<br />- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
1116073 1118700 Oh, what's he so wise about?<br />I'm telling you.
1118700 1122037 Okay, now come on. Now we're<br />not gonna get anywhere fighting.
1122038 1123371 Whose turn is it next?
1123372 1126308 Oh, uh, his. Number five.
1128460 1131313 Okay, may I... Can I pass? it...
1132006 1134132 Well, uh, that's your privilege.
1134133 1137344 Uh, how about the next gentleman?
1137345 1140096 Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.
1140097 1144409 I started to be convinced,<br />you know, very early in the case.
1144894 1149105 You see, I was looking for a motive.<br />That's very important.
1149106 1153401 Because if you don't have a motive,<br />where's your case, right?
1153402 1156571 Anyway, that, uh, testimony<br />from those people...
1156572 1159699 in the apartment across the hall<br />from the kid's apartment...
1159700 1162035 that was very powerful.
1162036 1164913 Didn't they say something about a...<br />a fight and an argument...
1164914 1169417 between the old man and his son<br />around about, uh, 7:00 that night?
1169418 1171962 - I mean, I could be wrong, but I...<br />- It was 8:00.
1171963 1174089 It was 8:00. That's right.<br />They heard an argument.
1174090 1175924 They couldn't hear<br />what it was about.
1175925 1177968 Then they heard the<br />father hit the boy twice.
1177969 1180082 Finally they saw the boy run...
1180108 1182681 angrily out of the house.<br />What does that prove?
1182682 1186434 Well, it don't exactly prove anything.<br />It's just part of the picture.
1186435 1189437 Well, you said it provided a motive. The<br />prosecuting attorney said the same thing.
1189438 1191773 I don't think that was<br />a very strong motive.
1191774 1195443 This boy's been hit so many times in his<br />life that violence is practically a...
1195444 1197904 It's a normal state<br />of affairs with him.
1197905 1202200 I just... I can't see two slaps in the face<br />provoking him into committing murder.
1202200 1205887 It may have been two too many.<br />Everyone has a breaking point.
1208332 1210500 Anything else?
1210500 1213044 - No.<br />- Okay.
1213045 1214896 Uh, how about you?
1216632 1218692 I don't know. It's all been said.
1220136 1222862 You can talk here forever.<br />It's still the same thing.
1223973 1227017 This kid is five for 0.
1227018 1228977 Well, look at his record.
1228978 1231271 When he was 10,<br />he was in children's court.
1231272 1233148 He threw a rock at a teacher.
1233149 1235525 When he was 15,<br />he was in reform school.
1235526 1237444 He stole a car.
1237445 1240030 He's been arrested for mugging.
1240030 1242115 He was picked up twice<br />for knife fighting.
1242116 1244284 Oh, yeah, they say he's<br />real handy with a knife.
1244285 1247162 Oh, this is a very fine boy.
1247163 1250248 Ever since he was five years old,<br />his father beat him up regularly.
1250249 1252751 - He used his fists.<br />- Well, so would I.
1252752 1254336 A kid like that?
1254337 1257605 It's these kids, the way<br />they are nowadays.
1260009 1263278 When I was a kid,<br />I used to call my father "sir."
1263930 1265305 That's right. "Sir."
1265306 1267349 Do you ever hear a kid call<br />his father that any more?
1267350 1269951 Fathers don't seem to think<br />it's important any more.
1270645 1272787 - You got any kids?<br />- Three.
1274065 1275498 I got one.
1276900 1278752 Twenty-two years old.
1284784 1287635 When he was nine years old,<br />he ran away from a fight.
1289246 1292515 I saw it. I was so embarrassed<br />I almost threw up.
1294085 1298813 I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you<br />if I have to break you in two trying."
1301217 1303234 Well, I made a man out of him.
1304136 1306404 When he was 16, we had a fight.
1307890 1310366 Hit me in the jaw.<br />He was a big kid.
1313688 1315872 Haven't seen him for two years.
1317692 1320085 Kids.
1321696 1323755 Work your heart out.
1326242 1327575 Well, let's get going.
1327576 1329995 I think we're missing<br />the point here.
1329996 1333498 This boy, let's say he's the product of a<br />broken home and a filthy neighborhood.
1333499 1337168 We can't help that. We're here to decide<br />whether he's innocent or guilty...
1337169 1340171 not to go into the reasons why<br />he grew up the way he did.
1340172 1342966 He was born in a slum. Slums are<br />breeding grounds for criminals.
1342967 1344926 I know it, and so do you.
1344927 1347185 It's no secret children<br />from slum backgrounds
1347210 1349423 are potential menaces to society.
1349724 1351975 - Now I think...<br />- Brother, you can say that again.
1351976 1354246 The kids who crawl out of<br />these places are real trash.
1354272 1357476 - I don't want any part of them.<br />I'm telling you.<br />- Listen, mister. Listen.
1357502 1359571 I, uh... I've lived in<br />a slum all my life.
1359597 1361435 - Wait a minute.<br />- Please, I...
1361460 1364237 I played in backyards that<br />were filled with garbage.
1364238 1366364 I mean, maybe you can<br />still smell it on me.
1366365 1367782 Now, listen, sonny.
1367783 1369451 Come on now. There's nothing<br />personal about this.
1369452 1372078 - No, there was something personal.<br />- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
1372079 1374247 Let's not be so sensitive.
1374248 1376166 This sensitivity I can understand.
1376167 1380895 Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.<br />We're only wasting time, and...
1381964 1384190 Look, your turn down<br />there. Let's go.
1385426 1388344 Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br />you were all gonna try to convince me.
1388345 1390180 - Wasn't that the idea?<br />- Check. That was the idea.
1390180 1392474 - Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.<br />- What difference does it make?
1392475 1394893 He's the one who's keeping us in here.<br />Let's hear what he's got to say.
1394894 1397687 Oh, now wait a minute. We decided<br />to do this a certain way.
1397688 1399397 I think we ought to<br />stick to that way.
1399398 1401483 Oh, stop being a kid, will you?
1401484 1403568 - What do you mean "a kid"?<br />- What do you think I mean?
1403569 1405295 K-I-D. Kid.
1407782 1411534 What? Listen, just because I'm<br />trying to keep this thing organized?
1411535 1413745 Here, you take it. You take<br />on the responsibility.
1413746 1415705 I'll just... I'll keep my<br />mouth shut. That's all.
1415706 1417791 What are you getting so hot about?<br />Calm down, will you?
1417792 1419209 Don't tell me to calm down.
1419210 1421419 Here. You wanna take the chair,<br />just take the chair. That's all.
1421420 1423963 - Did you ever see such a thing?<br />- See if you can keep it running.
1423964 1425219 Listen, you think it's<br />funny or something?
1425245 1427675 Hey, forget it, fella. The whole<br />thing's unimportant. Come on.
1427676 1430887 - Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.<br />- No, nobody wants to change.
1430888 1432722 You're doing a beautiful job.<br />Sit down.
1432723 1435642 Yeah, you're doing great.<br />Just great, fella.
1435643 1437619 You stay in there and<br />pitch. You know?
1438479 1440788 All right. Let's hear<br />from somebody.
1442190 1446361 Well, if you want me to tell you how<br />I feel about it, it's all right with me.
1446362 1448571 Boy, I don't care what you do.
1448572 1451533 All right, I don't have<br />anything brilliant.
1451534 1453743 I only know as much as you do.
1453744 1457580 According to the testimony,<br />the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
1457580 1461851 I sat there in court for six days<br />listening while the evidence built up.
1462378 1464170 Everybody sounded so<br />positive, you know?
1464170 1466714 I-I began to get a peculiar<br />feeling about this trial.
1466715 1468883 I mean, nothing is that positive.
1468884 1471094 There are a lot of questions<br />I'd have liked to ask.
1471095 1473888 I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't<br />have meant anything, but...
1473889 1475932 I began to get the feeling<br />that the defense counsel...
1475933 1478518 wasn't conducting a thorough-enough<br />cross-examination.
1478519 1481980 I mean, he... he let too many<br />things go by, little things that...
1481980 1484816 What little things? Listen, when<br />these fellas don't ask questions...
1484817 1487402 it's because they know the answers<br />already and they figure they'll be hurt.
1487403 1491406 Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer<br />to be just plain stupid, isn't it?
1491407 1492782 I mean it's possible.
1492783 1494584 You sound like you met<br />my brother-in-law once.
1497538 1500348 I... I kept putting myself<br />in the kid's place.
1502084 1504294 I'd have asked for<br />another lawyer, I think.
1504295 1506921 I mean, if I was on<br />trial for my life...
1506922 1511801 I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br />witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
1511802 1515863 Look, there was one alleged<br />eyewitness to this killing.
1516307 1519767 Someone else claims he heard the killing,<br />saw the boy run out afterwards.
1519768 1521978 And there was a lot of<br />circumstantial evidence.
1521979 1525565 But actually, those two witnesses were<br />the entire case for the prosecution.
1525566 1527442 Supposing they're wrong.
1527443 1529319 What do you mean<br />supposing they're wrong?
1529320 1531279 What's the point of<br />having witnesses at all?
1531280 1533990 - Could they be wrong?<br />- What are you trying to say?
1533990 1535617 Those people sat on<br />the stand under oath.
1535618 1537243 They're only people.<br />People make mistakes.
1537244 1539053 Could they be wrong?
1539747 1542749 - Well, no, I don't think so.<br />- Do you know so?
1542750 1544667 Oh, come on. Nobody can<br />know a thing like that.
1544668 1546461 This isn't an exact science.
1546462 1547895 That's right. It isn't.
1552968 1555803 Okay, let...<br />Let's get to the point.
1555804 1558473 What about the switch knife they<br />found in the old man's chest?
1558474 1560975 Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's<br />some people who haven't talked yet.
1560976 1563061 - Shouldn't we go in order?<br />- They'll get a chance to talk.
1563062 1565480 Be quiet a second, will you?
1565480 1566856 What about it, this...
1566857 1570401 the knife this fine upright boy admitted<br />buying the night of the killing?
1570402 1571819 Let's talk about it.
1571820 1574155 All right, let's talk about it.<br />Let's get it in here and look at it.
1574156 1575990 I'd like to see it again.<br />Mr. Foreman?
1575990 1579160 We all saw what it looks like.<br />Why do we have to see it again?
1579160 1581281 The gentleman has a right<br />to see exhibits in evidence.
1583332 1584874 Say, could you bring us the knife?
1584875 1586768 - Knife?<br />- Yeah. Thank you.
1588337 1591673 The knife and the way it was bought is<br />pretty strong evidence, don't you think?
1591674 1593424 - I do.<br />- Good.
1593425 1596010 Now, suppose we take these<br />facts one at a time.
1596010 1599347 One. The boy admitted going out of the<br />house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...
1599348 1601349 after being slapped several<br />times by his father.
1601350 1604185 No, no. No, he didn't say<br />"slapped." He said "punched."
1604186 1606688 There's a difference between<br />a slap and a punch.
1606689 1609357 After being hit several<br />times by his father.
1609358 1611693 Two. He went directly to a<br />neighborhood junk shop...
1611694 1613903 - where he bought one of those...<br />- Switch knives.
1613904 1615989 Switchblade knives.
1615990 1617865 This wasn't what you'd<br />call an ordinary knife.
1617866 1620451 It had a very unusual<br />carved handle and blade.
1620452 1622036 The storekeeper who<br />sold it to him...
1622037 1625248 said it was the only one of its<br />kind he had ever had in stock.
1625249 1629085 Three. He met some friends of his<br />in front of a tavern about 8:45.
1629086 1630670 Am I right so far?
1630670 1632880 - Yes, you are.<br />- You bet he is.
1632880 1636134 He talked with his friends for about<br />an hour, leaving them at 9:45.
1636135 1639178 During this time,<br />they saw the switch knife.
1639179 1641055 Four.
1641056 1643558 They identified the death<br />weapon in court...
1643559 1646144 as that very same knife.
1646145 1649022 Five. He arrived<br />home at about 10:00.
1649023 1651441 Now this is where the stories<br />offered by the State and the boy...
1651442 1653443 begin to diverge slightly.
1653444 1656112 He claims that he went to<br />a movie at about 11:30...
1656113 1660241 returning home at 3:10 to find his<br />father dead and himself arrested.
1660242 1662368 He also claims that the two<br />detectives who arrested him...
1662369 1664746 threw him down a half<br />a flight of stairs.
1664747 1666664 Now, what happened<br />to the switch knife?
1666665 1669375 He claims that it fell through a hole in<br />his pocket on the way to the movies...
1669376 1674130 sometime between 11:30 and 3:10<br />and that he never saw it again.
1674130 1676174 Now there's a tale, gentlemen.
1676175 1679761 I think it's quite clear that the boy<br />never went to the movies that night.
1679762 1681804 No one in the house saw<br />him go out at 11:30.
1681805 1683389 No one at the theater<br />identified him.
1683390 1685710 He couldn't even remember the<br />names of the pictures he saw.
1688562 1690355 - What actually happened is this.<br />- Thank you.
1690356 1693649 The boy stayed home, had another<br />fight with his father...
1693650 1697445 stabbed him to death and left the<br />house at ten minutes after 12:00.
1697446 1700281 He even remembered to wipe the<br />knife clean of fingerprints.
1700282 1702992 Now are you trying to tell<br />me that this knife...
1702993 1704994 really fell through a hole<br />in the boy's pocket...
1704995 1707455 someone picked it up off the street,<br />went to the boy's house...
1707456 1710208 and stabbed his father with it<br />just to test its sharpness?
1710209 1712293 No. I'm just saying it's possible<br />the boy lost his knife...
1712294 1714587 and that somebody else stabbed<br />his father with a similar knife.
1714588 1715880 It's just possible.
1715880 1717565 Take a look at this knife.
1719385 1721677 It's a very unusual knife.
1721678 1723304 I've never seen one like it.
1723305 1726182 Neither had the storekeeper<br />who sold it to the boy.
1726183 1729227 Aren't you asking us to accept<br />a pretty incredible coincidence?
1729228 1731646 I'm just saying a<br />coincidence is possible.
1731647 1733247 And I say it's not possible.
1739780 1741572 Where did that come from?
1741573 1743032 - Where'd you get that?<br />- It's the same knife.
1743033 1744617 What do you think you're doing?
1744618 1746327 Where did you get it?
1746328 1748663 I went out walking for a<br />couple of hours last night.
1748664 1750748 I walked through the<br />boy's neighborhood.
1750749 1753835 I bought that at a little pawnshop<br />just two blocks from the boy's house.
1753836 1755378 It cost six dollars.
1755379 1758589 It's against the law to buy<br />or sell switchblade knives.
1758590 1760925 That's right. I broke the law.
1760926 1765012 Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.<br />Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.
1765013 1767181 Maybe there are 10<br />knives like that. So what?
1767182 1770059 - Maybe there are.<br />- Well, what does it mean?
1770060 1773438 You found another knife like it. What's that,<br />the discovery of the age or something?
1773439 1775857 You mean you're asking us to believe<br />that somebody else did the stabbing...
1775858 1777733 with exactly the<br />same kind of knife?
1777734 1779068 The odds are a million-to-one.
1779069 1781879 - It's possible.<br />- But not very probable.
1782990 1785074 Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
1785075 1787236 There's no point in standing<br />around all over the place.
1788745 1792248 You know, it's interesting that he'd find a<br />knife exactly like the one the boy bought.
1792249 1795084 What's interesting about it?<br />"Interesting."
1795085 1797044 Well, I don't know. I just<br />thought it was interesting.
1797045 1798921 There are still 11 of us<br />here who think he's guilty.
1798922 1801299 Right. What do you think<br />you're gonna accomplish?
1801300 1803217 You're not gonna<br />change anybody's mind.
1803218 1805678 So if you wanna be stubborn<br />and hang this jury, go ahead.
1805679 1808823 The kid will be tried again and<br />found guilty sure as he's born.
1810267 1812226 That's probably right.
1812227 1815521 So what are you gonna do?<br />You know, we could be here all night.
1815522 1818858 It's only one night.<br />A boy may die.
1818859 1821486 Well, why don't we just<br />set up house here, huh?
1821487 1824030 Someone send for Potsy the<br />policeman and get a pinochle deck...
1824030 1826616 and, uh, we'll just sweat the<br />whole thing out right here.
1828035 1831162 - I don't think he ought to joke about it.<br />- What do you want me to do about it?
1831163 1834916 Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff<br />about the knife's got to do with anything.
1834917 1837919 Somebody saw the kid stab his father.<br />What more do we need?
1837920 1840796 You guys can talk the ears right<br />off my head. You know what I mean?
1840797 1843591 I got three garages of mine goin'<br />to pot while you're talking.
1843592 1845343 So let's get done<br />and get outta here.
1845344 1848846 The knife was very important to the<br />district attorney. He spent a whole day...
1848847 1851390 He's a 15th assistant or something.<br />What does he know about it?
1851390 1852934 Hey, let's hold it down.
1852935 1855369 These side arguments<br />are only slowing us up.
1858148 1859607 Well, what about it?
1859608 1861208 You're the only one.
1869034 1871177 I have a proposition<br />to make to all of you.
1872162 1874013 I'm gonna call for another vote.
1875374 1880670 I want you 11 men to vote<br />by secret written ballot.
1880670 1882797 I'll abstain.
1882798 1885675 If there are 11 votes for guilty,<br />I won't stand alone.
1885676 1889570 We'll take in a guilty verdict<br />to the judge right now.
1890930 1894742 But if anyone votes not guilty,<br />we stay here and talk it out.
1897980 1900982 Well, that's it. If you<br />want to try it, I'm ready.
1900983 1902525 All right.<br />Let's do it the hard way.
1902526 1904527 Okay, that sounds fair.<br />Everyone agreed?
1904528 1906696 - Anyone doesn't agree?<br />- Fine, fine. Let's go.
1906697 1907822 Here, pass these along.
1907823 1909674 Is that the right time?
1941648 1942915 "Guilty."
1945485 1946752 "Guilty."
1948905 1950172 "Guilty."
1952409 1953676 "Guilty."
1955078 1956345 "Guilty."
1958165 1959432 "Guilty."
1961500 1962768 "Guilty."
1963837 1965104 "Guilty."
1966298 1967565 "Guilty."
1971553 1974263 "Not guilty."
1974264 1975765 "Guilty."
1975766 1977516 Boy, how do you like that?
1977517 1980061 Oh, and another chap<br />flaps his wings.
1980062 1982897 All right, who was it?<br />Come on. I want to know.
1982898 1985232 Excuse me.<br />This was a secret ballot.
1985233 1986859 We all agreed on that, no?
1986860 1989070 If the gentleman wanted<br />to remain secret...
1989070 1991030 Secret? What do you mean secret?
1991030 1994341 There are no secrets in a<br />jury room. I know who it was.
1994993 1996994 Brother, you really are something.
1996995 1999080 You sit here, vote guilty<br />like the rest of us...
1999080 2002458 and then some golden-voiced preacher<br />starts tearin' your poor heart out...
2002459 2005836 about some underprivileged kid just<br />couldn't help becomin' a murderer...
2005837 2007421 and you change your vote.
2007422 2009632 If that isn't the most sick...
2009633 2013386 Why don't you drop a quarter<br />in his collection box?
2013387 2015429 Oh, now just wait a minute.
2015430 2017098 Listen, you can't talk<br />to me like that.
2017099 2019016 - No. Who do you think you are?<br />- Calm down. Calm down.
2019017 2021435 No. Who does he think he is?<br />Did you hear him?
2021436 2022850 It doesn't matter. He's<br />very excitable. Sit down.
2022876 2024780 Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!
2024780 2027700 We're trying to put a guilty man<br />in the chair where he belongs!
2027900 2030653 Someone starts telling us fairy<br />tales, and we're listenin'!
2030654 2032488 Hey, uh, come on, huh?
2032489 2034490 What made you change your vote?
2034490 2036200 He didn't change his vote.
2036200 2037451 I did.
2037452 2039495 - Oh, fine.<br />- I knew it.
2039496 2041539 Would you like me to tell you why?
2041540 2043499 No, I wouldn't like<br />you to tell me why.
2043500 2046127 I'd like to make it clear<br />anyway, if you don't mind.
2046128 2047712 Do we have to listen to this?
2047713 2049547 The man wants to talk.
2049548 2051215 Thank you.
2051216 2054635 This gentleman has been<br />standing alone against us.
2054636 2056971 Now, he doesn't say<br />the boy is not guilty.
2056972 2059014 He just isn't sure.
2059015 2061934 Well, it's not easy to stand alone<br />against the ridicule of others.
2061935 2065146 So he gambled for support,<br />and I gave it to him.
2065147 2066939 I respect his motives.
2066940 2071569 The boy on trial is probably guilty,<br />but, uh, I want to hear more.
2071570 2073446 Right now, the vote is ten to two.
2073447 2075781 I'm talking here! You have<br />no right to leave this room!
2075782 2077742 He can't hear you. He never will.
2077743 2079426 Let's sit down.
2083498 2085791 Shall we continue?
2085792 2088085 Well, I... I think we<br />ought to take a break.
2088086 2092298 You know, one man's inside,<br />and I think we ought to wait for him.
2092299 2095342 Okay.
2095343 2097194 Looks like we're really<br />hung up here, huh?
2098472 2100906 And that thing with the old man,<br />that was pretty unexpected.
2102893 2105452 I wish I could figure out some<br />way we could break it up.
2108482 2112026 You know, in advertising...<br />I told you I worked in an agency.
2112027 2113110 Mm-hmm.
2113110 2115196 Well, there's some pretty<br />strange people working there.
2115197 2117364 Well, they're not strange really, I guess.
2117365 2120075 It's just that they have peculiar<br />ways of expressing themselves.
2120076 2121410 You know what I mean.
2121410 2123811 Of course, I suppose it's the same<br />in your business too, huh?
2124372 2125956 What do you do?
2125957 2128209 - I'm a watchmaker.<br />- Oh, really?
2128210 2131504 Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers<br />in the world come from Europe, huh?
2131505 2134590 Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,<br />when we reach a point like this...
2134590 2138177 I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when<br />a point like this is reached in a meeting...
2138178 2140888 there's always some character<br />ready with an idea, see.
2140889 2142932 And it kills me.
2142933 2144517 It's the weirdest<br />thing in the world...
2144518 2147937 the way they sometimes precede their<br />idea with a little phrase, see, like...
2147938 2150940 Some account exec will<br />get up, and he'll say, uh...
2150940 2152858 "Okay, here's an idea.
2152859 2156570 Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole<br />and see if anyone salutes it."
2156570 2159782 I mean, it's idiotic,<br />but it's funny, huh?
2159783 2164386 I, uh... I got a little<br />excited back there. I...
2165288 2167139 didn't mean to get nasty.
2167916 2171810 I'm glad you're not one of those lets<br />these emotional appeals influence him.
2172879 2175230 Uh...
2188395 2191395 I don't know what's the matter with<br />that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.
2197779 2199797 Eh!
2200824 2203117 Hey, you a salesman?
2203118 2204718 I'm an architect.
2205453 2206871 Hmm.
2206872 2209223 You know what the soft sell is?
2212043 2214061 Boy, you got it. Believe me.
2215630 2217439 I got a different technique.
2218133 2220009 Laughs, drinks, jokes.
2220010 2222361 Tricks. You know?
2223096 2224405 Yeah.
2225765 2228075 "Hit 'em where they live."<br />That's my motto.
2229394 2232246 I made 27 grand last<br />year sellin' marmalade.
2232980 2235582 That's not bad. I mean,<br />you know, considering marmalade.
2238695 2240587 Hey, what are you gettin'<br />outta this... kicks?
2242657 2245326 Or did somebody bump you on the head one<br />time and you haven't gotten over it?
2245327 2247136 Maybe.
2248038 2250664 You know, you do-gooders<br />are all alike.
2250665 2253434 You're always blowing your stacks<br />over some guy that fanned.
2256420 2258355 But what are you<br />wasting our time for?
2259007 2263152 Why don't you donate five dollars to the<br />cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.
2266348 2268682 This kid is guilty, pal.
2268683 2271185 It's as plain as the<br />nose on your face.
2271186 2273520 So why don't we stop<br />wasting our time here?
2273520 2276523 We're gonna all get sore throats<br />if we keep it up, you know?
2276524 2279205 What difference does it make if you<br />get it here or at the ball game?
2279860 2282863 Oh, no difference, pal.
2282864 2284757 No difference at all.
2296586 2298545 Nice bunch of guys, huh?
2298546 2300923 Oh, they're about the<br />same as anyone else.
2300924 2303817 Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.
2304719 2306845 You think we'll be much longer?
2306846 2308555 I don't know.
2308556 2310557 Aw, he's guilty for sure.
2310558 2312184 Not a doubt in the whole world.
2312185 2314828 We should...<br />Should've been done already.
2316982 2318315 Oh, I don't mind, you know.
2318316 2320834 Hmm. Beats workin'.
2324406 2325672 Uh...
2327950 2330119 You think he's not guilty, huh?
2330120 2332054 I don't know. It's possible.
2332706 2336583 Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'<br />you never been wronger in your life.
2336584 2339086 You're wasting your time.<br />You ought to wrap it up.
2339087 2341355 Supposing you were the<br />one who was on trial.
2342090 2344049 Well, I'm not used to supposing.
2344050 2348637 I'm just a workingman. My boss<br />does the supposing. But...
2348638 2350239 Well, I'll try one.
2351349 2357121 Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,<br />the kid really did knife his father. Huh?
2365947 2367322 Are you ready?
2367323 2368615 Hup.
2368616 2369616 That one.
2369617 2371385 Sorry, blue eyes.
2372203 2373370 - Well, where else...<br />- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
2373370 2375706 - Well, where else...<br />- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
2375707 2377708 Looks like we'll be<br />here for dinner, huh?
2377709 2380169 Okay, now let's...<br />Let's get down to business.
2380170 2381628 Now, who wants to start it off?
2381629 2383130 - I would.<br />- Okay, go.
2383130 2385299 You down there.
2385300 2389261 The old man who lived downstairs says he<br />heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."
2389262 2391972 A second later, he heard<br />the body hit the floor.
2391973 2395934 Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid<br />running down the stairs and out of the house.
2395935 2397394 What does that mean to you?
2397395 2399048 I was wondering how<br />clearly the old man could
2399049 2400856 have heard the boy's voice<br />through the ceiling.
2400857 2402983 He didn't hear it through the ceiling.<br />The window was open.
2402984 2404902 So was the one upstairs.<br />It was a hot night, remember?
2404903 2406320 Well, it was another apartment.
2406320 2408989 It's not that easy to identify a voice,<br />particularly a shouting voice.
2408990 2410657 - He identified it in court.<br />- That's right.
2410658 2412201 And don't forget the<br />lady across the street.
2412202 2415079 She looked right in the open window<br />and saw the boy stab his father.
2415080 2417623 - Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?<br />- No, it isn't.
2417624 2419666 Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?
2419667 2421585 It's like talking<br />into a dead phone.
2421586 2424838 She said she saw the killing through<br />the windows of a moving elevated train.
2424839 2428425 There were six cars on the train. She saw<br />the killing through the last two cars.
2428426 2430344 She remembered the most<br />insignificant details.
2430345 2432471 I don't see how you<br />can argue with that.
2432472 2437117 Has anybody here any idea<br />how long it would take an el...
2445693 2447361 Hey!
2447362 2448962 This isn't a game.
2453159 2455494 - Did you see him?<br />- Hey.
2455495 2457329 - The nerve.<br />- All right, listen...
2457330 2460666 - The absolute nerve.<br />- Forget it. It's not important.
2460667 2462709 - "This isn't a game"?<br />- Calm down.
2462710 2466130 - Who does he think he is?<br />- I'm telling you, forget it now.
2466130 2469550 Has anybody any idea how long<br />it takes an elevated train...
2469550 2471468 going at medium speed<br />to pass a given point?
2471469 2473428 - What has that to do with anything?<br />- How long? Take a guess.
2473429 2476181 - I wouldn't have the slightest idea.<br />- What do you think?
2476182 2478158 I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?
2479060 2480811 I think that's a pretty<br />good guess. Anyone else?
2480812 2483689 - That sounds right to me.<br />- Come on. What's the guessing game for?
2483690 2485607 - What do you say?<br />- Ten seconds is about right.
2485608 2487609 All right. Say ten seconds.<br />What are you getting at?
2487610 2492739 This. It takes a six-car el train<br />ten seconds to pass a given point.
2492740 2495075 Now let's say the given<br />point is the open window
2495100 2497077 of the room where the<br />killing took place.
2497078 2500455 You can reach out of that window<br />and almost touch the el tracks, right?
2500456 2502040 Now let me ask you this.
2502040 2504376 Has anyone here ever lived<br />near the el tracks?
2504377 2508088 Well, uh, I just finished painting an<br />apartment that overlooked an el line.
2508089 2509840 - I was there for three days.<br />- What was it like?
2509840 2511091 - What do you mean?<br />- Noisy?
2511092 2513719 Oh, brother. Don't matter though.<br />We were all punchy.
2513720 2516388 I lived in a second-floor<br />apartment near the el line once.
2516389 2519533 When the window was open and the train<br />goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.
2519559 2520685 You can hardly hear yourself think.
2520710 2522436 All right, you can't<br />hear yourself think.
2522437 2524938 - Will you get to the point?<br />- I will. Now just a minute.
2524939 2528650 Let's take two pieces of testimony<br />and try to put them together.
2528650 2532821 First. The old man in the<br />apartment downstairs.
2532822 2535490 He says he heard the boy say<br />"I'm gonna kill you"...
2535490 2538327 and a split second later<br />heard a body hit the floor.
2538328 2539995 - One second later, right?<br />- That's right.
2539996 2546084 Second. The woman across the street swore<br />positively she looked out of the window...
2546085 2549504 and saw the killing through the last two<br />cars of the passing elevated train, right?
2549505 2551924 - The last two cars.<br />- What are you giving us here?
2551925 2553342 Now, just a minute.
2553343 2557863 We've agreed that it takes ten seconds<br />for a train to pass a given point.
2558598 2562017 Since the woman saw the killing<br />through the last two cars...
2562018 2567064 we can assume that the body hit the<br />floor just as the train went by.
2567065 2571610 Therefore, the train had been<br />roaring by the old man's window...
2571610 2575197 a full ten seconds before<br />the body hit the floor.
2575198 2577491 The old man, according<br />to his own testimony...
2577492 2580494 "I'm gonna kill you," body hitting<br />the floor a split second later...
2580495 2583038 would have had to hear the<br />boy make this statement...
2583039 2584998 with the el roaring past his nose.
2584999 2586625 It's not possible he<br />could've heard it.
2586626 2588877 - That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.<br />- Do you think he could've heard it?
2588878 2591338 He said he yelled at the top of his<br />voice. That's good enough for me.
2591339 2593674 Even if he heard something, he still<br />couldn't have identified the voice.
2593675 2594883 With the el roaring by?
2594884 2597344 You're talking about a matter of seconds!<br />Nobody can be that accurate.
2597345 2602057 I think testimony that could put a boy into<br />the electric chair should be that accurate.
2604185 2606186 You know something? I don't<br />think he could've heard it.
2606187 2608605 Maybe he didn't hear it.<br />I mean, with all that el noise.
2608606 2610565 Oh, what are you<br />people talking about?
2610566 2612693 Well, it stands to reason<br />he couldn't have heard it.
2612694 2614695 Why should he lie?<br />What's he got to gain?
2614696 2616989 Attention maybe.
2616990 2618991 You keep coming in with<br />these bright sayings!
2618992 2622119 Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?<br />They pay three dollars apiece.
2622120 2624429 What are you talking<br />to him like that for?
2625290 2628792 Guy talks like that to an old man really<br />ought to get stepped on, you know?
2628793 2630727 You ought to have<br />more respect, mister.
2631838 2636316 If you say stuff like that to him<br />again, I'm gonna lay you out.
2646185 2649229 Now you go ahead. You...<br />You say anything you like.
2649230 2653358 Why do you think the<br />old man might lie?
2653359 2656878 It was just that I looked at<br />him for a very long time.
2657405 2660741 The seams of his jacket was split,<br />under the shoulder.
2660742 2662409 Or did you notice that?
2662410 2664995 I mean, to come to court like that.
2664996 2666763 Why...
2667790 2671752 He was a very old man<br />in a torn jacket.
2671753 2674729 And he walked very<br />slowly to the stand.
2675380 2679509 He was dragging his left leg<br />and trying to hide it...
2679510 2681278 because he was ashamed.
2682305 2685824 I think I know this man<br />better than anyone here.
2686600 2692105 This is a quiet, frightened,<br />insignificant old man who...
2692106 2694566 who has been nothing<br />all his life...
2694567 2697069 who has never had recognition...
2697070 2699254 or his name in the newspapers.
2699822 2702115 Nobody knows him.
2702116 2704242 Nobody quotes him.
2704243 2708305 Nobody seeks his<br />advice after 75 years.
2709040 2713018 Gentlemen, that's a very<br />sad thing... to be nothing.
2713628 2718064 A man like this needs to be<br />quoted, to be listened to.
2718590 2720634 To be quoted just once.
2720635 2722611 Very important to him.
2723012 2725514 It would be so hard for him to<br />recede into the background...
2725515 2727307 - Wait a minute.<br />- When there was a chance...
2727308 2730268 What are you trying to do... tell us he'd<br />lie just so he could be important once?
2730269 2732979 No. He wouldn't really lie.
2732980 2736525 But perhaps he made himself<br />believe he heard those words...
2736526 2738819 and recognized the boy's face.
2738820 2741196 That's the most fantastic<br />story I've ever heard.
2741197 2744341 How can you make up a thing like that?<br />What do you know about it?
2753292 2755419 Oh, uh, does anybody<br />want a cough drop?
2755420 2757754 - No, thanks.<br />- I'll take one.
2757755 2759156 You can say what you like.
2759157 2761341 I still don't see how anybody<br />can think he's not guilty.
2761342 2763927 There's something else I'd like<br />to talk about for a minute.
2763928 2765637 Thanks.
2765638 2769015 I think we've proved that the old man couldn't<br />have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."
2769016 2770684 - But supposing...<br />- You didn't prove it at all.
2770685 2773562 - What are you talking about?<br />- Supposing he really did hear it.
2773563 2776064 This phrase, how many times<br />have all of us used it?
2776065 2777649 Probably thousands.
2777650 2779359 "I could kill you<br />for that, darling."
2779360 2781361 "Junior, you do that once more,<br />and I'm gonna kill you."
2781362 2782737 "Get in there, Rocky,<br />and kill him."
2782738 2784698 We say it every day. That doesn't<br />mean we're really gonna kill anybody.
2784699 2786575 Wait a minute. What are you<br />trying to give us here?
2786576 2790370 The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."<br />The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
2790370 2791788 Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
2791789 2794166 Anybody says a thing like that<br />the way he said it, they mean it.
2794167 2795709 Well, gee, now I don't know.
2795710 2800505 I remember I was arguing with a guy I work<br />next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.
2800506 2802340 He called me an idiot,<br />so I yelled at him.
2802340 2805385 Now listen! This guy's trying to make<br />you believe things that aren't so.
2805386 2807554 The kid said he was gonna<br />kill him, and he did kill him.
2807555 2810599 Let me ask you this. Do you really think the<br />boy would shout out a thing like that...
2810600 2812476 so the whole neighborhood<br />could hear him?
2812477 2814394 I don't think so.<br />He's much too bright for that.
2814395 2819232 Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.<br />He don't even speak good English.
2819233 2822168 "He doesn't even<br />speak good English."
2824530 2828408 Mr. Foreman, I'd like to<br />change my vote to not guilty.
2828409 2829910 You what?
2829910 2832429 - You heard me.<br />- Are you sure?
2833247 2834748 Yeah, I'm sure.
2834749 2837292 The vote is nine to three,<br />favor of guilty.
2837293 2840186 Well, if this isn't<br />the living end. Huh?
2844133 2846985 What are you basing it on...<br />the stories this guy made up?
2847512 2849930 You ought to write for one of<br />those kooky detective magazines.
2849930 2851848 You'd make a fortune.
2851849 2855368 For crying out loud. The kid's own<br />lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.
2855770 2857437 Right from the beginning,<br />his own lawyer knew it.
2857438 2859314 You could see it.
2859315 2863001 Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,<br />this guy here is really something.
2863736 2865612 Look, the kid had a<br />lawyer, didn't he?
2865613 2868532 He presented his case, not you.<br />How come you got so much to say?
2868533 2871451 - Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.<br />- Baltimore, please. Huh?
2871452 2873245 He was court-appointed.
2873246 2875163 - What's that supposed to mean?<br />- It could mean a lot of things.
2875164 2878500 It could mean he didn't want the case,<br />or he resented being appointed.
2878500 2880418 It's the kind of case that<br />brings him nothing...
2880419 2883463 no money, no glory, not even<br />much chance of winning.
2883464 2886466 That's not a very promising<br />situation for a young lawyer.
2886467 2889469 He'd really have to believe in his client<br />to put up any kind of a good case...
2889470 2891555 and, as you pointed out a minute<br />ago, obviously he didn't.
2891556 2894474 Of course he didn't. Huh.
2894475 2896851 Who the heck could?
2896852 2899854 Except maybe some guy's<br />mother or somebody. I...
2899855 2902190 Ah, look. Will you<br />look at the time, huh?
2902190 2904818 - Come on. For crying out...<br />- Pardon me.
2904819 2907237 - I have made some notes here...<br />- Notes.
2907238 2909948 And I would like to...<br />please, to say something.
2909949 2912284 - Yeah.<br />- I have been listening very carefully.
2912285 2916788 And, uh, it seems to me that this man<br />has some very good points to make.
2916789 2921501 From what was presented at the trial,<br />the boy looks guilty on the surface.
2921502 2925672 - But maybe if we go deeper?<br />- Oh, come on, will ya?
2925673 2928049 There is a question I<br />would like to ask.
2928050 2931428 Let us assume that the boy<br />really did commit the murder.
2931429 2934848 Now, this happened at<br />ten minutes after 12:00.
2934849 2937392 Now, how was he<br />caught by the police?
2937393 2941980 He came back home,<br />uh, at 3:00 or so...
2941980 2945817 and he was captured by two detectives<br />in the hallway of his house.
2945818 2950488 Now, my question is, if he<br />really had killed his father...
2950489 2953783 why would he come back<br />home three hours later?
2953784 2956745 Wouldn't he be afraid<br />of being caught?
2956746 2958580 He came home to get his knife.
2958580 2961207 It's not nice to go around leaving<br />knives sticking in people's chests.
2961208 2964044 - Yeah, especially relatives.<br />- Yeah.
2964045 2966379 I don't see<br />anything funny about it.
2966380 2970008 The boy knew the knife could be<br />identified as the one he had just bought.
2970009 2972260 He had to get it<br />before the police did.
2972260 2974542 But if he knew the knife<br />could be identified,
2974568 2976848 why did he leave it there<br />in the first place?
2977266 2980226 Well, I think we can assume the boy<br />ran out in a state of panic...
2980227 2982687 after having just<br />killed his father.
2982688 2985732 When he finally calmed down,<br />he realized he had left his knife there.
2985733 2988735 Ah. This then depends on<br />your definition of panic.
2988736 2991196 He would have had to be<br />calm enough to see to it...
2991197 2993865 that there were no fingerprints<br />left on the knife.
2993866 2997994 Now, where did this panic<br />start and where did it end?
2997995 3000455 Look, you voted guilty.<br />What side are ya on?
3000456 3004084 I don't believe I have to be<br />loyal to one side or the other.
3004085 3005960 I'm simply asking questions.
3005960 3009047 Well, this is just off the<br />top of my head, but, uh...
3009048 3011633 well, if I were the boy and I'd<br />done the stabbing and everything...
3011634 3013843 I'd take a chance and<br />go back for the knife.
3013844 3016429 I'll bet he figured that nobody<br />had seen him running out...
3016430 3019015 and that the body wouldn't be<br />discovered till the next day.
3019016 3021142 Well, after all, it was<br />the middle of the night.
3021143 3023728 I'll bet he'd figured nobody would<br />find the body till the next day.
3023729 3025814 Pardon. This is my whole point.
3025815 3029609 The woman across the street testified that<br />the moment after she saw the killing...
3029610 3032278 that is, a moment after<br />the train went by...
3032279 3035365 she screamed and then went<br />to telephone the police.
3035366 3038827 Now, the boy certainly must<br />have heard the scream...
3038828 3042414 so he knew that<br />somebody saw something.
3042415 3045291 I just don't think that<br />he would have gone back.
3045292 3048128 Two things. One, in his state of panic,<br />he may not have heard the scream.
3048129 3049879 Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
3049880 3053341 Two, if he did hear it, he may not<br />have connected it with his own act.
3053342 3056469 Remember, he lived in a neighborhood<br />where screams were fairly commonplace.
3056470 3059013 - There's your answer.<br />- Maybe.
3059014 3061975 Maybe the boy did kill his father,<br />didn't hear the scream...
3061976 3065770 did run out in a panic,<br />did calm down three hours later...
3065770 3068481 and come back to get the knife,<br />risking being caught by the police.
3068482 3071484 Maybe all of those things happened,<br />but maybe they didn't.
3071485 3074320 I think there's enough doubt that we can<br />wonder whether he was there at all...
3074320 3076072 during the time the<br />killing took place.
3076073 3077907 What do you mean doubt?<br />What are you talking about?
3077908 3079701 Didn't the old man see him<br />running out of the house?
3079702 3081578 He's twisting the facts,<br />I'm telling you.
3081579 3084998 Did or didn't the old man see the kid<br />running out of the house at 12:10?
3084999 3087000 Well, did or didn't he?
3087000 3090295 - He says he did.<br />- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?
3090296 3093339 - Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.<br />- Sure, when you want them to, they do.
3093340 3095675 Or when he wants them to, they do.<br />You know what I mean?
3095676 3097594 - Keep the yelling down!<br />- Oh, you keep saying that.
3097595 3099387 Maybe what we need<br />is a little yelling in here.
3099388 3101181 These guys keep going<br />off every which way.
3101182 3103183 Did hear the scream.<br />Didn't hear the scream.
3103184 3106436 What difference does it make? You people<br />are talking only about the little details.
3106437 3109022 You're forgetting the important stuff.<br />I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...
3109023 3111483 - I want to call for another vote.<br />- I'm talking here!
3111484 3115253 There's another vote called for.<br />Now let's take our seats.
3119033 3121659 I never saw so much<br />time spent on nothing.
3121660 3123469 It only takes a second.
3124455 3127957 Okay. I guess the fastest way is to<br />find out who's voting not guilty.
3127958 3130810 Now, all those voting not guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
3131962 3135632 Still the same. One, two,<br />three not guilty. Nine guilty.
3135633 3137383 So, now where are we?
3137384 3140887 I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until<br />next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?
3140888 3143723 Pardon. I vote not guilty.
3143724 3146810 Oh!
3146810 3150188 What are ya talking about? I mean, we're<br />all going crazy in here or something.
3150189 3154067 The kid is guilty. Why don't<br />you listen to the facts?
3154068 3156402 Tell him, will ya? Now this<br />is getting to be a joke.
3156403 3159697 The vote is eight to four,<br />favor of guilty.
3159698 3163451 What is this, love your underprivileged<br />brother week or something?
3163452 3166037 I want you to get up and tell me<br />why you changed your vote.
3166038 3170416 - Come on. Give me your reasons.<br />- I don't have to defend my decision to you.
3170417 3172252 There is a reasonable<br />doubt in my mind.
3172253 3175338 What reasonable doubt? That's nothing<br />but words. Here, look at this.
3175339 3180343 The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br />was seen ramming this into his father.
3180344 3182428 Now, what about this,<br />Mr. Reasonable Doubt?
3182429 3185181 That's not the knife.<br />Don't you remember?
3185182 3187433 Oh, brilliant.
3187434 3189811 I'm telling ya,<br />this is the craziest.
3189812 3192063 I mean, what are we<br />supposed to believe?
3192064 3194983 I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling<br />stories out of thin air, you know?
3194984 3198778 A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting<br />ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...
3198779 3201322 he'd be trying to<br />tell you that, uh...
3201323 3203783 Look. Now, what about the old man?
3203784 3206452 Are we supposed to believe that he<br />didn't get up and run to his door...
3206453 3209539 and see the kid tearing down the<br />steps 15 seconds after the killing?
3209540 3212083 He's just saying so to<br />be important, right?
3212084 3213644 I mean, what's the point<br />of the whole thing?
3213670 3214961 Wait. Hold it a<br />second, will you?
3214962 3217255 Oh, and the Baltimore rooter<br />is heard from again now...
3217256 3219299 and pop-ups are fallin' for<br />base hits wherever we look.
3219300 3222635 Hold it a second. Now, look... Did<br />the old man say he ran to the door?
3222636 3224555 Ran, walked. What's the difference?<br />He got on, didn't he?
3224580 3225680 I mean, he got there, didn't he?
3225680 3228308 - No, now wait a second.<br />- He said he ran. At least I think he did.
3228309 3231811 Look, I don't remember what he said, but I<br />don't see how he could have run to the door.
3231812 3234272 He said he went from his<br />bedroom to the front door.
3234273 3235982 - Now, isn't that enough?<br />- Where was the bedroom?
3235983 3238318 - It was down the hall somewhere.<br />- I thought you remembered everything.
3238319 3240653 - Don't you remember that?<br />- No.
3240654 3242964 Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see<br />a diagram of the apartment.
3242990 3245558 Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all<br />over again so you can get everything straight?
3245559 3246284 Mr. Foreman.
3246285 3248995 How come you're the only one in this<br />room wants to see exhibits all the time?
3248996 3251789 - I want to see this one too.<br />- And I'd like to stop wasting time.
3251790 3254709 If we're gonna start wading through all that<br />nonsense about where the body was found...
3254710 3256753 We're not, not unless<br />somebody else wants to.
3256754 3258546 But I'd like to find<br />out if an old man...
3258547 3261007 who drags one foot when he walks<br />'cause he had a stroke last year...
3261008 3263509 can get from his bedroom to<br />his front door in 15 seconds.
3263510 3265261 - He said 20 seconds.<br />- He said 15.
3265262 3267513 He said 20 seconds. What are<br />you trying to distort...
3267514 3270850 - He said 15.<br />- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?
3270850 3272602 You can't judge a thing like that.
3272603 3275063 He said 15 seconds.<br />He was very positive about it.
3275064 3277357 He was an old man.<br />Half the time he was confused.
3277358 3279751 How could he be positive<br />about anything?
3287326 3289529 I don't see what you're<br />going to prove here.
3289555 3291537 The man said he saw<br />the boy running out.
3291538 3293790 Well, let's see if the<br />details bear him out.
3293790 3296751 As soon as the body hit the floor,<br />he said he heard footsteps upstairs...
3296752 3298503 running toward the front door...
3298504 3301673 heard the upstairs door open,<br />the footsteps start down the stairs.
3301674 3303883 He said he got to his own front<br />door as fast as he could...
3303884 3306052 and he swore it couldn't have<br />been more than 15 seconds.
3306053 3307804 Now, if the killer began<br />running immediately...
3307805 3310098 - Maybe he didn't.<br />- The old man said he did.
3310099 3312892 You ought to be at Atlantic City<br />at that hairsplitters convention.
3314103 3316312 Hey, why don't you stop makin'<br />smart remarks all the time, huh?
3316313 3319524 My friend, for your three dollars a day,<br />you have to listen to everything, you know?
3319525 3321317 Now that you've got that thing<br />in here, what about it?
3321318 3323569 All right. Here's the apartment<br />where the killing took place.
3323570 3326698 The old man's apartment was directly<br />beneath and exactly the same.
3326699 3329993 Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,<br />living room, kitchen, bathroom.
3329994 3332078 Here's the hall.<br />Here are the stairs.
3332079 3334414 Now, the old man was in<br />this bedroom right here.
3334415 3337166 He says he crossed to the door<br />and walked down the hall...
3337167 3340211 opened the front door just in time to<br />see the boy running down the stairs.
3340212 3343631 - Am I right so far?<br />- That's the story, for the 19th time.
3343632 3347260 - Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.<br />- Correct.
3347260 3349387 Now, let's see. It was...
3349388 3353474 It's 12 feet from the bed to<br />the door. The hall is 43 feet.
3353475 3356769 He would have had to walk 12 feet,<br />open the bedroom door...
3356770 3360481 walk 43 feet down and open the<br />front door all in 15 seconds.
3360482 3363276 - Do you think he could have done it?<br />- Sure he could have done it.
3363277 3365945 He can walk only very slowly. They had<br />to help him into the witness chair.
3365946 3367697 You make it sound like a long walk.
3367698 3370116 For an old man who had a<br />stroke, it is a long walk.
3370117 3371241 Oh! What are you doing?
3371267 3373636 I'm gonna try it,<br />see how long it took him.
3373662 3375011 What do you mean,<br />you want to try it?
3375012 3377098 Why didn't his lawyer bring<br />it up if it's so important?
3377124 3378381 Maybe he just didn't<br />think about it, huh?
3378382 3380835 What do you mean, didn't think of it?<br />You think the man's an idiot or something?
3380836 3382462 - It's an obvious thing.<br />- Did you think of it?
3382463 3384213 Listen, smart guy. Don't matter<br />whether I thought of it.
3384214 3386524 He didn't bring it up because he knew it would<br />hurt his case. What do you think of that?
3386550 3388487 Maybe he didn't bring it<br />up because it would have
3388488 3390470 meant bullying and badgering<br />a helpless old man.
3390470 3393890 You know that doesn't sit very well with<br />a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.
3393890 3396684 - So, what kind of a bum is he then?<br />- That's what I've been asking, buddy.
3396685 3399812 Pass me that chair, will you?<br />Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
3399813 3402774 I just paced off 12 feet across the room.<br />This will be the bedroom door.
3402775 3405485 Oh, that's crazy. You can't<br />recreate a thing like that.
3405486 3407779 - I'd like to see it.<br />- The hall was 43 feet.
3407780 3409881 I'll pace from that<br />wall and back again.
3411075 3414994 Look, this is absolutely insane. What are<br />you wasting everybody's time in here for?
3414995 3417955 According to you, it'll only take 15<br />seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.
3421835 3423586 Come on. Knock it off.
3423587 3425171 Okay.
3425172 3427298 Okay. Okay, killer.
3427299 3428983 Yeah.
3431220 3433346 Will you stand right there<br />and mark the front door?
3433347 3435932 It was chain-locked according<br />to the testimony, remember?
3435933 3437702 Has anybody got a watch<br />with a second hand?
3437728 3438184 I have.
3438185 3440686 When you want me to start, stamp<br />your foot. That'll be the body falling.
3440687 3442688 You can time me from there.
3442689 3444857 What are we gonna do,<br />play charades now?
3444858 3446984 - Come on! What are we waiting for?<br />- Okay, I'm ready.
3446985 3448986 Well, I want to wait till<br />the second hand reaches 60.
3448987 3451005 Oh, come on.
3457620 3460723 Come on. Speed it up. He could<br />walk twice as fast as that.
3462084 3464644 You want me to walk<br />faster than that, I will.
3481436 3483980 Lock. Door. Stop.
3483980 3486065 - Right.<br />- What's the time?
3486066 3489402 Uh, exactly 41 seconds.
3489403 3491737 This is what I think happened.
3491738 3494657 The old man heard the fight between the<br />boy and his father a few hours earlier.
3494658 3497577 Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the<br />body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...
3497578 3499410 heard the woman scream<br />from across the street,
3499436 3501164 got to his front door<br />as fast as he could...
3501165 3503833 heard somebody racing down the<br />stairs and assumed it was the boy.
3503834 3505751 - I think that's possible.<br />- Assumed?
3505752 3508337 Oh.
3508338 3511812 Brother, I've seen all kinds<br />of dishonesty in my day,
3511838 3514385 but this little display<br />takes the cake.
3514386 3516863 You all come in here with<br />your hearts bleeding all
3516864 3519182 over the floor about<br />slum kids and injustice.
3519183 3521267 You listen to some fairy tales.
3521268 3523644 Suddenly you start getting through<br />to some of these old ladies.
3523645 3526689 Well, you're not getting through<br />to me. I've had enough.
3526690 3528816 What's the matter with you guys?
3528817 3531611 You all know he's guilty!<br />He's got to burn!
3531612 3533487 You're letting him slip<br />through our fingers.
3533488 3535781 "Slip through our fingers"?<br />Are you his executioner?
3535782 3537550 I'm one of 'em!
3538619 3540536 Perhaps you'd like<br />to pull the switch.
3540537 3542622 For this kid, you bet I would.
3542623 3545975 I feel sorry for you. What it must<br />feel like to want to pull the switch.
3546752 3548815 Ever since you walked into<br />this room, you've been
3548816 3550755 acting like a self-appointed<br />public avenger.
3550756 3552819 You want to see this<br />boy die because you
3552845 3555134 personally want it,<br />not because of the facts.
3555135 3557386 - You're a sadist.<br />- You...
3557387 3561307 Let me go!<br />I'll kill him. I'll kill him!
3561308 3563826 You don't really mean<br />you'll kill me, do you?
3571026 3573444 Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?<br />I heard some noise.
3573445 3577531 Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...<br />You know, friendly little argument. It's...
3577532 3580926 Um, listen, we're through with that<br />diagram. You can take it if you want.
3582204 3583971 Here you are. Thank you.
3589419 3591604 What are you lookin' at?
3612276 3614402 I suppose somebody has<br />to start it off again.
3614403 3615174 I beg pardon.
3615200 3618197 "I beg pardon." What<br />are you so polite about?
3618198 3620366 For the same reason you're not.
3620367 3622468 It's the way I was brought up.
3624288 3626289 This fighting...
3626290 3628416 That's not why we<br />are here, to fight.
3628417 3630893 We have a responsibility.
3631962 3636632 This, I have always thought, is a<br />remarkable thing about democracy...
3636633 3638609 that we are...
3639720 3642388 Uh, what is the word?
3642389 3645558 Notified. That we are<br />notified by mail...
3645559 3649979 to come down to this place to<br />decide on the guilt or innocence...
3649980 3654108 of a man we have never<br />heard of before.
3654109 3658754 We have nothing to gain or<br />lose by... by our verdict.
3659573 3662800 This is one of the reasons<br />why we are strong.
3663994 3666929 We should not make<br />it a personal thing.
3668165 3669932 Thank you.
3671043 3673419 If nobody else has an idea,<br />I may have a cutie here.
3673420 3676255 I mean, I haven't given it much thought,<br />but let's throw it out on the stoop...
3676256 3677965 and see if the cat licks it up.
3677966 3680384 - The cat licks it up?<br />- Yeah. If the boy...
3684806 3687016 Look how dark it's<br />getting out there.
3687017 3689577 I'll bet we're gonna<br />have a storm now.
3691270 3693831 Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?
3695233 3698127 Pardon me, but don't<br />you ever sweat?
3699446 3701697 No, I don't.
3701698 3703783 Well, listen. I, uh...
3703784 3707036 I was wondering if, uh, maybe...
3707037 3709413 maybe we should take another vote.
3709414 3713793 Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up<br />with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?
3713794 3715686 - Hmm.<br />- Mr. Foreman?
3716380 3720007 Well, that's okay with me.<br />Anyone doesn't want to vote?
3720008 3723302 - Hey, come on. Come on.<br />- I'm sorry.
3723303 3726889 I think we ought to have an open<br />ballot... call out our votes, you know.
3726890 3729183 Let's see who stands where.
3729184 3731785 That sounds fair to me.<br />Anyone object?
3734439 3737249 Okay. I'll call off<br />your jury numbers. One.
3738150 3741028 Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.
3741029 3742905 Two?
3742906 3744507 Not guilty.
3744950 3747885 - Number three?<br />- Guilty.
3748787 3750429 Number four?
3751832 3753707 Guilty.
3753708 3756560 - Number five?<br />- Not guilty.
3757546 3760940 - Number six?<br />- Not guilty.
3761842 3763592 Number seven?
3763593 3765386 Guilty.
3765387 3767513 Number eight?
3767514 3769281 Not guilty.
3770517 3773519 - Number nine?<br />- Not guilty.
3773520 3775788 - Number 10?<br />- Guilty.
3777482 3779608 Number 11?
3779609 3781527 Not guilty.
3781528 3783128 Number 12?
3783947 3786365 Number 12.
3786366 3787967 Guilty.
3793790 3795958 The vote is now six to six.
3795959 3799211 Yeah, right. And we go into<br />extra innings here, huh?
3801548 3806135 Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you<br />people in here must be out of your minds.
3806136 3808053 A kid like that.
3808054 3811390 I don't think the kind of boy he<br />is has anything to do with it.
3811390 3813559 The facts are supposed<br />to determine the case.
3813560 3815811 Don't give me that!<br />I'm sick and tired of facts!
3815812 3817897 You can twist them any way you like.<br />You know what I mean?
3817898 3820566 That's exactly the point this<br />gentleman has been making.
3820567 3821167 Oh!
3821193 3823569 I mean, you keep shouting<br />at the top of your lungs.
3825155 3827156 I'd like to be a few years younger.
3827157 3829174 That man gets on my...
3832454 3835372 - My, it's hot in here, isn't it?<br />- Do you want a drink of water?
3835373 3839168 No. No, thanks. Thanks.
3846927 3848802 It's gonna rain.
3848803 3851155 Well, how'd you figure<br />that out, killer?
3852307 3854266 How come you changed your vote?
3854267 3856769 Well, it just seemed to me<br />there was room for doubt.
3856770 3859063 You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br />You know that, I hope.
3859064 3862149 I don't feel that way. There were a<br />lot of details that never came out.
3862150 3865778 - Yeah. Well, good luck.<br />- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.
3865779 3868088 You think too much.<br />You get mixed up.
3869240 3870373 You know what I mean?
3870399 3873285 Now, listen. I don't think<br />you have any right...
3873286 3875955 Loudmouth.
3928592 3931193 Look at that come down, will you?
3932262 3934221 You know...
3934222 3936807 this reminds me of a<br />storm we had last...
3936808 3940352 Oh, when was that? November...
3940353 3943522 I don't know. Something. It was<br />quite a storm we had there.
3943523 3945983 It was right in the<br />middle of a game.
3945984 3948694 Uh, we were behind 7-6...
3948695 3951363 but we just started to move the<br />ball, right off the tackle.
3951364 3954241 Started cutting right...<br />slash here and slash right in...
3954242 3956118 cut right through.
3956119 3958704 And, uh...
3958705 3961014 We had this kid Slattery, you know?
3962083 3965544 A real... He was an ox.<br />You know, a real ox.
3965545 3968130 I wish I had another<br />one just like him.
3968130 3972718 I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head<br />coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.
3972719 3974887 - Oh, yeah?<br />- That's out in Queens.
3974888 3977723 And, uh, anyway...
3977724 3979892 we're starting to<br />move along real nice.
3979893 3983162 Their whole line is just...<br />they're just coming apart.
3984356 3988192 And it starts to come down<br />cats and dogs, just like this.
3988193 3990919 Just whoosh...<br />you know, right down.
3992113 3995574 Well, that was murder, you know?
3995575 3998243 I swear, I... I nearly bawled.
3998244 4000679 You just...<br />You couldn't go nowhere.
4001830 4003265 Well.
4018807 4021408 Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br />How come...
4029067 4030901 Hey! Huh?
4030902 4034296 Must have been on the<br />same switch with the lights.
4035198 4038467 Well, things are<br />looking up here, huh?
4039035 4040636 Yeah, huh?
4045375 4047476 Boy. That's better.
4054050 4055634 Hey!
4055635 4057402 Two points.
4061307 4063408 Any of you guys ever<br />go to the Garden?
4065603 4068564 That's a damn stupid thing to do.
4068565 4070833 Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...
4071776 4073252 You know?
4074863 4076463 Pardon me.
4077449 4079867 Well, how do you like it?<br />Even Steven.
4079868 4082327 Pretty surprising, isn't it?
4082328 4083929 Yes.
4085623 4089209 Say, that business before, when<br />that tall guy... what's-his-name...
4089210 4092004 was trying to bait me...<br />That doesn't prove anything.
4092005 4094673 I'm a pretty excitable person.
4094674 4098594 I mean, where does he come off calling me<br />a public avenger, sadist and everything?
4098595 4102181 Anyone in his right mind<br />would blow his stack, huh?
4102182 4104558 He was just trying to bait me.
4104559 4106660 He did an excellent job.
4109355 4111648 I'll tell you what I think.<br />We're going nowhere here.
4111649 4114276 I'm ready to walk into court right<br />now and declare a hung jury.
4114277 4116195 There's no point in this<br />thing going on any more.
4116196 4117613 Yeah. I go for that too.
4117614 4120532 Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let<br />the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.
4120533 4123452 I don't think the judge will accept a hung<br />jury. We haven't been in here very long.
4123453 4125204 Well, let's find out.
4125205 4126997 I'm not in favor of that.
4126998 4130292 Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance<br />with another jury, and you know it.
4130293 4133212 Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna<br />change his vote. Let's take it inside.
4133213 4135506 You still don't think there's<br />room for reasonable doubt?
4135507 4136882 No, I don't.
4136883 4138258 Pardon.
4138259 4141595 Maybe you don't fully understand<br />the term "reasonable doubt."
4141596 4144239 What do you mean<br />I don't understand?
4145225 4147267 Boy, how do ya like this guy?
4147268 4149019 I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.
4149020 4151939 They come over here, running for their life,<br />and before they can take a deep breath...
4151940 4154399 they're telling us how<br />to run the show, huh?
4154400 4156276 Boy, the arrogance of this guy.
4156277 4160948 Hey, all right. Let's stop the<br />arguing for about two minutes in here.
4160949 4163408 Now, who's got something<br />constructive to say?
4163409 4167037 I'd like to go over something,<br />if you gentlemen don't mind.
4167038 4169790 An important point for the<br />prosecution was the fact...
4169790 4172626 that after the boy claimed<br />he'd been at the movies...
4172627 4174711 during the hours that the<br />killing took place...
4174712 4178674 couldn't remember the names of the movies<br />or the stars who appeared in them.
4178675 4181260 This gentleman here has put up<br />that point in here several times.
4181260 4182803 That's correct.
4182804 4184763 It was the only alibi<br />the boy offered...
4184764 4187349 and he himself couldn't back<br />it up with any details at all.
4187350 4190686 Putting yourself in the boy's place,<br />do you think you could remember details...
4190687 4194231 after an upsetting experience such as<br />being slapped in the face by your father?
4194232 4197526 I think so, if there were any<br />special details to remember.
4197527 4199231 The boy couldn't remember<br />the names of the movies
4199232 4200779 he saw because be wasn't<br />there that night.
4200780 4202906 According to the police<br />testimony in court...
4202907 4206118 the boy was questioned by the detectives<br />in the kitchen of his apartment...
4206119 4209121 while the body of his father was<br />lying on the floor in the bedroom.
4209122 4211790 Do you think you could remember<br />details under those circumstances?
4211790 4213876 - I do.<br />- Under great emotional stress?
4213877 4216461 - Under great emotional stress.<br />- He remembered them correctly in court.
4216462 4218505 He named the pictures and the<br />stars who played in them.
4218506 4221758 Yes. His lawyer took great<br />pains to bring that out.
4221759 4224386 He had three months from the night<br />of the murder to the day of the trial...
4224387 4226096 in which to memorize them.
4226097 4228849 It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out<br />what played at a particular theater...
4228850 4230601 on a particular night.
4230602 4232417 I'll take the testimony<br />of the policemen who
4232443 4234313 interrogated the boy right<br />after the murder...
4234314 4236815 when he couldn't remember<br />a thing about the movies...
4236816 4238817 great emotional stress or not.
4238818 4242195 - I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br />- Go ahead.
4242196 4245532 - Where were you last night?<br />- I was home.
4245533 4248160 - How about the night before that?<br />- Come on! What is this?
4248160 4249578 No, it's all right.
4249579 4252205 I left the office at 8:30 and<br />went straight home and to bed.
4252206 4253957 And the night before that?
4253958 4256460 That was, uh, Tuesday night?
4256460 4258545 The night of the bridge tournament.<br />I played bridge.
4258546 4259963 Monday night?
4259964 4263275 When you get down to New<br />Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?
4265178 4267237 Monday night?
4268389 4271475 Monday night, uh, my wife<br />and I went to the movies.
4271476 4273185 - What did you see?<br />- The Scarlet Circle.
4273186 4276521 - It was a clever whodunit.<br />- What was the second feature?
4276522 4279232 The, um...
4279233 4281985 I'll tell you in a minute.<br />The, uh...
4281986 4286239 Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...
4286240 4288784 The...
4288785 4291536 Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.
4291537 4294389 I saw that. It's called<br />The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
4295583 4298043 Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />I think that's right.
4298044 4300629 Who was in The Amazing<br />Mrs. Bainbridge?
4300630 4304383 Barbara... Long, I think it was.
4304384 4306485 A dark, very pretty girl.
4307720 4310305 Ling or Long...<br />something like that.
4310306 4313600 - Who else?<br />- I'd never heard of them before.
4313600 4318105 It was a very inexpensive second<br />feature with, uh, unknown...
4318106 4321333 And you weren't under an<br />emotional stress, were you?
4324153 4326363 No.
4326364 4328131 I wasn't.
4329909 4331743 I think the point is made.
4331744 4334579 Big point!
4334580 4336832 You can talk till your tongue<br />is draggin' on the floor.
4336833 4341003 The boy is guilty, period.<br />You know what I mean, my friend?
4341004 4344356 - Who's got those cough drops?<br />- They're all gone, my friend.
4346259 4348593 Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
4348594 4351054 There goes your ball game.
4351055 4353557 It's only a shower.
4353558 4355809 Besides, they got the<br />infield covered.
4355810 4359079 Right. Say, could I see that<br />knife a second, please?
4361774 4364192 Well, we're still<br />tied up six to six.
4364193 4366278 Who's got a suggestion?
4366279 4368363 It's five after 6:00.<br />Let's get some dinner.
4368364 4370907 Why don't we wait till 7:00,<br />give it another hour, huh?
4370908 4373118 Okay with me.
4373119 4375370 Uh, there's something<br />I'd like to say.
4375370 4378999 I mean, it's been bothering me a little,<br />and as long as we're stuck.
4379000 4382961 Well, there was this whole business about<br />the stab wound and how it was made...
4382962 4384671 the downward angle of it, you know?
4384672 4386757 Don't tell me we're gonna<br />start with that again.
4386758 4388467 They've been over it and over it.
4388468 4390844 Well, I know they did,<br />but I don't go along with it.
4390845 4394931 Now, the boy was 5 feet 7<br />inches tall. His father was 6'2...
4394932 4397184 That's a difference<br />of seven inches.
4397185 4399936 It's a very awkward thing to stab<br />down into the chest of someone...
4399937 4402022 who's more than half a<br />foot taller than you are.
4402023 4404232 Give me that.
4404233 4407127 I'll give you a demonstration.<br />Somebody get up.
4408404 4410422 You...
4414827 4417621 I want you to watch this 'cause<br />I don't want to have to do it again.
4417622 4420457 I'll make myself about six or<br />seven inches shorter, okay?
4420458 4423685 - It's about right. Maybe a little more.<br />- Okay. A little more.
4431385 4433904 That's not funny.
4435890 4439826 Now, nobody's hurt. Right?
4440394 4442287 Right. Nobody hurt.
4445650 4450529 Now, this is the way I'd stab a<br />man who was taller than I was.
4450530 4453073 Look at the angle... down and in.
4453074 4455242 And this is the way it was done.
4455243 4457510 Now tell me I'm wrong.
4459622 4463125 - Down and in. I guess there's no argument.<br />- Hold it a minute, will ya?
4463126 4465060 Can you give me that?
4465962 4467963 Boy, I hate these things.
4467964 4469714 - Did you ever see a knife fight?<br />- No.
4469715 4471383 - You?<br />- No.
4471384 4474261 Anybody here ever<br />see a knife fight?
4474262 4477139 Well, I have. You know,<br />on my back stoop...
4477140 4479558 the lot across<br />the street, backyard.
4479559 4482060 Switchblades came with the<br />neighborhood where I lived.
4482060 4485397 It's funny I never thought of it before.<br />I guess you try to forget those things.
4485398 4488875 - How do you use a switchblade?<br />- Well, you'd never use it like this.
4490528 4492921 See, you use too much<br />time switching hands.
4494574 4497175 Here's how... underhanded.
4499787 4502914 Anyone who's ever used a switch knife<br />wouldn't handle it any other way.
4502915 4505625 - Are you sure?<br />- I'm sure.
4505626 4507544 That's why they're made<br />to open like that.
4507545 4509713 You'd say the boy was<br />pretty handy with a knife?
4509739 4510255 Mm-hmm.
4510256 4513508 You think he could have made the kind<br />of wound that killed his father?
4513509 4517512 No. Not with the experience he'd had<br />all his life handling these things.
4517513 4519598 I feel he'd have gone<br />for him underhanded.
4519599 4522726 How do you know? Were you in the<br />room when the father was killed?
4522727 4524811 No. Neither was anybody else.
4524812 4528106 So what are you giving us all this<br />mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
4528107 4529757 I don't think you can<br />determine what type of
4529783 4531443 wound the boy might or<br />might not have made...
4531444 4534154 simply because he knew<br />how to handle a knife.
4534155 4536573 What do you think?
4536574 4538742 - I don't know.<br />- What do you mean you don't know?
4538743 4540677 I don't know.
4544790 4546875 How about you?
4546876 4548787 I don't know about the rest<br />of them, but I'm getting a
4548788 4550712 little tired of this<br />yackety-yackin' back and forth.
4550713 4554257 It's gettin' us nowhere. So I<br />guess I'll have to break it up.
4554258 4556885 I change my vote to not guilty.
4556886 4560305 - You what?<br />- You heard me. I've had enough.
4560306 4562849 What do you mean you've had enough?<br />That's no answer!
4562850 4566895 Hey, listen. You just take care<br />of yourself, huh? You know?
4566896 4570941 He's right. That's not an answer.
4570942 4573985 What kind of a man are you?
4573986 4577197 You have sat here and voted<br />guilty with everyone else...
4577198 4581534 because there are some baseball tickets<br />burning a hole in your pocket.
4581535 4585889 And now you've changed your vote because<br />you say you're sick of all the talking here?
4586790 4588333 Now listen, buddy!
4588334 4593088 Who tells you that you have the right<br />to play like this with a man's life?
4593089 4595674 - Don't you care...<br />- Now wait a minute!
4595675 4599761 - You can't talk like that to me!<br />- I can talk like that to you.
4599762 4601721 If you want to vote not guilty...
4601722 4604182 then do it because you are<br />convinced the man is not guilty...
4604183 4606059 not because you've had enough.
4606060 4608728 And if you think he is guilty,<br />then vote that way.
4608729 4612023 Or don't you have the guts to<br />do what you think is right?
4612024 4614376 - Now listen.<br />- Guilty or not guilty?
4615069 4618755 - I told you, not guilty.<br />- Why?
4620324 4622033 Look, I don't have to...
4622034 4625245 You do have to! Say it! Why?
4625246 4627806 All right. I don't, uh,<br />think he's guilty.
4637216 4638925 I want another vote.
4638926 4641511 Okay. There's another<br />vote called for.
4641512 4644472 I guess the quickest way is a<br />show of hands. Anyone object?
4644473 4647492 Okay. All those voting not<br />guilty, raise your hands.
4648310 4653581 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
4656319 4658086 eight.
4661907 4664134 Um, nine.
4665036 4670123 Um, all those voting guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4670124 4672584 One, two, three.
4672585 4675186 Well, the vote's nine to<br />three in favor of acquittal.
4676088 4678340 I don't understand you people!
4678340 4680592 I mean, all these picky little<br />points you keep bringing up.
4680593 4684012 They don't mean nothing!<br />You saw this kid just like I did.
4684013 4687599 You're not gonna tell me you believe that<br />phony story about losing the knife...
4687600 4689684 and that business about<br />being at the movies.
4689685 4692771 Look, you know how these<br />people lie. It's born in them.
4692772 4694898 I mean, what the heck.<br />I don't have to tell you.
4694899 4696941 They don't know what the truth is.
4696942 4700737 And let me tell you, they don't need any<br />real big reason to kill someone either.
4700738 4702572 No, sir.
4702573 4705700 They get drunk! Oh, they're<br />real big drinkers, all of 'em.
4705700 4708953 You know that. And bang...<br />someone's lying in the gutter.
4708954 4712040 Well, nobody's blaming them for it.<br />That's the way they are, by nature.
4712040 4714209 You know what I mean? Violent!
4714210 4715794 Where are you going?
4715795 4718897 Human life don't mean as much<br />to them as it does to us.
4719799 4722884 Look! They're lushing it up<br />and fighting all the time...
4722885 4724969 and if somebody gets killed,<br />so somebody gets killed!
4724970 4726429 They don't care!
4726430 4728723 Oh, sure, there's some<br />good things about 'em too.
4728724 4730767 Look, I'm the first<br />one to say that.
4730768 4734145 I've known a couple who were okay, but<br />that's the exception, you know what I mean?
4734146 4737982 Most of 'em, it's like they have<br />no feelings. They can do anything.
4737983 4740652 What's going on here?
4740653 4742779 I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...
4742780 4744864 you're making a big<br />mistake, you people.
4744865 4747967 This kid is a liar! I know it.<br />I know all about them.
4749578 4751830 Listen to me. They're no good.
4751830 4754265 There's not a one of<br />'em who's any good.
4756210 4758753 I mean, what...<br />What's happening in here?
4758754 4761105 I'm speaking my piece, and you...
4762216 4763983 Listen to me.
4764969 4766511 I...
4766512 4769055 We're... This kid on<br />trial here, his type...
4769056 4771157 Well, don't you know about them?
4773018 4776563 Th-There's...<br />There's a danger here.
4776564 4778731 These people are dangerous.
4778732 4781860 They're... wild.
4781860 4783862 Listen to me.
4783863 4786281 - Listen.<br />- I have.
4786282 4789384 Now sit down and don't<br />open your mouth again.
4793205 4796057 I was only trying to... tell you.
4832453 4836848 It's always difficult to keep personal<br />prejudice out of a thing like this.
4837875 4841978 Wherever you run into it,<br />prejudice always obscures the truth.
4843464 4845924 I don't really know<br />what the truth is.
4845925 4848943 I don't suppose anybody<br />will ever really know.
4850137 4854182 Nine of us now seem to feel<br />that the defendant is innocent.
4854183 4857268 But we're just gambling<br />on probabilities.
4857269 4859312 We may be wrong.
4859313 4861773 We may be trying to let<br />a guilty man go free.
4861774 4863316 I don't know.
4863317 4865401 Nobody really can.
4865402 4867862 But we have a reasonable doubt...
4867863 4871449 and that's something that's<br />very valuable in our system.
4871450 4876095 No jury can declare a man<br />guilty unless it's sure.
4877456 4879916 We nine can't understand...
4879917 4882727 how you three are still so sure.
4883462 4885563 - Maybe you can tell us.<br />- I'll try.
4886840 4890426 You've made some excellent points, but I<br />still believe the boy is guilty of murder...
4890427 4892220 and I have two reasons.
4892220 4895431 One, the evidence given by the<br />woman across the street...
4895432 4898142 who actually saw the<br />murder committed.
4898143 4900812 As far as I'm concerned,<br />that's the most important testimony.
4900813 4904148 And two, the fact that she described<br />the stabbing by saying...
4904149 4909862 she saw the boy raise his arm over his head<br />and stab down into the father's chest.
4909863 4911990 She saw him do it the wrong way.
4911990 4913992 That's absolutely right.
4913993 4916661 Let's talk about this<br />woman for a moment.
4916662 4919831 She said she went to bed<br />about 11:00 that night.
4919832 4923501 Her bed was next to the window,<br />and she could look out while lying down...
4923502 4927672 and see directly into the<br />boy's room across the street.
4927673 4930383 She tossed and turned for over<br />an hour, unable to sleep.
4930384 4934637 Finally, she turned toward the window<br />at about ten minutes after 12:00...
4934638 4939851 and, as she looked out, she saw the killing<br />through the windows of a passing el train.
4939852 4942645 She said the lights went out<br />immediately after the killing...
4942646 4947542 but that she got a good look at the boy<br />in the act of stabbing his father.
4948444 4952380 As far as I can see it,<br />this is unshakable testimony.
4953032 4955800 - Well, that's the whole case.<br />- What do you think?
4961080 4962849 How about you?
4964376 4966919 I-I don't know.
4966920 4969005 So much evidence to sift.
4969006 4971049 This is a pretty<br />complicated business.
4971050 4974927 Frankly, I don't see how you<br />can vote for acquittal.
4974928 4977347 It's not so easy to arrange<br />all the evidence in order.
4977348 4979474 You can throw out<br />all the other evidence!
4979475 4983144 The woman saw him do it!<br />What else do you want?
4983145 4985104 - Yeah, well, maybe...<br />- Let's vote on it.
4985105 4987357 Okay. There's another<br />vote called for.
4987358 4989275 Anybody object?
4989276 4992403 All right. I'm changing my vote.<br />He's guilty.
4992404 4994906 Anybody else?<br />The vote is eight to four.
4994907 4998576 Why is this such a personal<br />triumph for you... this one vote?
4998577 5002121 Okay. I say we're a hung jury.<br />I say we take it in to the judge.
5002122 5004916 How about it?<br />I want to hear arguments.
5004917 5007518 You, you're the leader of<br />the cause. What about it?
5009672 5011589 Let's go over it again.
5011590 5013591 We've been over it again!
5013592 5016170 The boy in the gray flannel<br />suit here is bouncin'
5016170 5018471 backwards and forwards<br />like a tennis ball.
5018472 5022408 No point in getting nasty and<br />trying to turn this into a contest.
5024269 5025812 Okay.
5025813 5028940 Maybe we can talk about setting<br />some kind of time limit.
5028940 5031167 Yeah, once around<br />for the deal, huh?
5031777 5035613 It's a quarter after 6:00.
5035614 5037657 Someone before mentioned 7:00.
5037658 5040118 I think that's a point at which<br />we might begin to discuss...
5040119 5043454 the question of whether<br />we're a hung jury or not.
5043455 5045223 Don't you feel well?
5046458 5048501 I feel perfectly well, thank you.
5048502 5051295 I was saying that 7:00<br />would be a reasonable time.
5051296 5054298 Uh, the reason I asked about<br />that was because, uh...
5054299 5055967 you were rubbing your nose like...
5055968 5058720 Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...
5058720 5062014 but you made a gesture that<br />reminded me of something.
5062015 5064142 I'm trying to settle something<br />here. Do you mind?
5064143 5066244 Well, I think this is important.
5067229 5069105 Thank you.
5069106 5071816 Now then, I'm sure you'll<br />pardon me for this...
5071817 5074819 but I was wondering why you were<br />rubbing your nose like that.
5074820 5076571 Oh, come on, will ya?
5076572 5080825 At this point, I happen to be talking<br />to the gentleman sitting next to you!
5080826 5084162 Now, why were you rubbing<br />your nose like that?
5084163 5088332 Well, if it's any of your business, I was<br />rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
5088333 5090042 Oh. I'm sorry.
5090043 5094005 - Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?<br />- It is.
5094006 5095840 Now can we get on<br />to something else?
5095840 5100511 Your eyeglasses made those two deep<br />impressions on the sides of your nose.
5100512 5102764 I hadn't noticed that before.
5102765 5106350 - That must be annoying.<br />- It is very annoying.
5106350 5108352 Well, I wouldn't know about that.
5108353 5111773 I've never worn eyeglasses.<br />Twenty-twenty.
5111774 5114417 Listen, will you come on already<br />with the optometrist bit?
5116236 5119864 The woman who testified<br />that she saw the killing...
5119865 5123509 had those same marks on<br />the sides of her nose.
5124410 5126704 Holy smokes! You know, he's right.
5126705 5128456 Please.
5128457 5132293 Just give me a minute,<br />and I'll be finished.
5132294 5135213 I don't know if anyone else<br />noticed that about her.
5135214 5139191 I didn't think of it then,<br />but I've been going over her face...
5140135 5142345 in my mind.
5142346 5144447 She had those same marks.
5145349 5149619 - She kept rubbing them in court.<br />- He's right. She did do that a lot.
5150562 5155316 This woman was about, uh...<br />about 45 years old.
5155317 5159362 She was making a tremendous<br />effort to look 35...
5159363 5161656 for her first public appearance.
5161657 5164992 Heavy makeup, dyed hair...
5164993 5168955 brand-new clothes that should have<br />been worn by a younger woman.
5168956 5170706 No glasses.
5170707 5172458 No, women do that.
5172459 5174961 See if you can get the<br />mental picture of it.
5174962 5176879 What do you mean, no glasses?
5176880 5179674 How do you know whether she wore glasses?<br />Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
5179675 5181968 Now, she had those<br />marks. I saw 'em.
5181969 5183970 So what? What do ya<br />think that means?
5183970 5186238 Listen, I'm getting so sick<br />of your yelling in here!
5186264 5187265 Come on. Forget it.
5187266 5190351 Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.<br />I saw them too.
5190352 5193563 I was the closest one to her. She had these,<br />these things on the side of her nose.
5193564 5196858 - What do you call those on the side?<br />- Well, what point are you making here?
5196859 5200820 She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br />Well, what does that mean?
5200820 5205216 Could those marks be made by<br />anything other than eyeglasses?
5208704 5211122 No, they couldn't.
5211123 5213224 I didn't see any marks!
5214750 5216544 I did.
5216545 5219171 Strange, but I didn't<br />think about it before.
5219172 5221382 Well, what about the lawyer?<br />Why didn't he say something?
5221383 5224385 There are 12 people in here<br />concentrating on this case.
5224386 5226554 Eleven of us didn't<br />think of it either.
5226555 5229807 Well, what about the district attorney?<br />Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?
5229808 5231784 Have her testify<br />without her glasses?
5231810 5233716 Did you ever see a woman who<br />had to wear glasses and
5233717 5235813 didn't want to because she<br />thinks they spoil her looks?
5235814 5239400 Okay. She had marks on her nose.
5239400 5243154 I'm giving you that.<br />From glasses, right?
5243155 5247408 She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house<br />so people would think she's gorgeous.
5247409 5252079 But when she saw this kid killing his<br />father, she was in the house alone.
5252080 5254373 That's all.
5254374 5258477 - Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?<br />- No, I don't.
5260088 5262089 No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
5262090 5265176 It's logical to assume that she wasn't<br />wearing them when she was in bed...
5265177 5267011 tossing and turning,<br />trying to fall asleep.
5267012 5269430 - How do you know?<br />- I don't know! I'm guessing.
5269430 5271974 I'm also guessing that she probably<br />didn't put her glasses on...
5271975 5274185 when she turned to look<br />casually out of the window.
5274186 5277021 And she herself testified the killing<br />took place just as she looked out.
5277022 5278481 The lights went off a<br />split second later.
5278507 5280149 She couldn't have had<br />time to put them on then.
5280150 5281859 - Wait a second.<br />- Here's another guess.
5281860 5286030 Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy<br />kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.
5286030 5289700 How do you know what she saw?<br />How does he know all that?
5289700 5292536 How do you know what kind of glasses<br />she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.
5292537 5295247 Maybe she was farsighted.<br />What do you know about it?
5295248 5298584 I only know the woman's<br />eyesight is in question now.
5298585 5304799 She had to be able to identify a person<br />60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
5304800 5307259 You can't send someone off to<br />die on evidence like that.
5307260 5309345 Oh, don't give me that.
5309346 5311597 Don't you think the woman<br />might have made a mistake?
5311598 5314100 - No.<br />- It's not possible?
5314100 5315826 No, it's not possible.
5318689 5320706 Is it possible?
5321733 5323501 Not guilty.
5327572 5330324 Do you think he's guilty?
5330325 5332426 I think he's guilty.
5335080 5336847 Do you?
5339626 5342753 No. I'm convinced.
5342754 5344422 Not guilty.
5344423 5346298 What's the matter with you?
5346299 5348300 I have a reasonable doubt now.
5348300 5349927 Eleven to one.
5349928 5352930 Well, what about all the other evidence?<br />What about all that stuff?
5352930 5355099 The knife, the whole business!
5355100 5358119 Well, you said we could throw<br />out all the other evidence.
5363775 5366043 Well, what do we do now?
5368947 5370698 You're alone.
5370699 5374635 I don't care whether<br />I'm alone or not! It's my right.
5377706 5379974 It's your right.
5389009 5391527 Well, what do you want?<br />I say he's guilty.
5393055 5396490 - We want to hear your arguments.<br />- I gave you my arguments.
5397392 5399602 We're not convinced.
5399603 5402480 We want to hear them again.
5402480 5404582 We have as much time as it takes.
5410155 5414700 Everything... Every single thing<br />that took place in that courtroom...
5414700 5416702 but I mean everything...<br />says he's guilty.
5416703 5419263 What do you think,<br />I'm an idiot or something?
5420832 5423000 Why don't you take that<br />stuff about the old man?
5423000 5426270 The old man who lived there<br />and heard everything.
5427839 5429590 Or this business about the knife.
5429590 5431675 What? 'Cause he found another<br />one exactly like it?
5431676 5435096 The old man saw him right<br />there on the stairs!
5435097 5438032 What's the difference how<br />many seconds it was?
5439100 5441202 Every single thing.
5442520 5445773 The knife falling through<br />a hole in his pocket.
5445774 5449193 You can't prove he<br />didn't get to the door.
5449194 5451695 Sure, you can take all the time,<br />hobble around the room.
5451696 5454381 But you can't prove it!
5456200 5459912 And what about this business<br />of the el and the movies?
5459913 5463040 There's a phony deal<br />if I ever heard one.
5463040 5467336 I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd<br />remember the movies I saw.
5467337 5469672 I'm telling ya, everything<br />that's gone on...
5469673 5473592 has been twisted and turned!
5473593 5475761 This business with the glasses?
5475762 5481392 How do you know she didn't have them on?<br />This woman testified in open court!
5481393 5485437 And what about hearing<br />the kid yell, huh?
5485438 5488791 I'm telling ya, I've got<br />all the facts here.
5489860 5491835 Here. Ah...
5494114 5496715 Well, that's it!<br />That's the whole case.
5503832 5505516 Well?
5507710 5509812 Say something!
5514843 5518529 You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.
5519097 5521098 You're not gonna intimidate me.
5521099 5523701 I'm entitled to my opinion.
5526980 5531375 Rotten kids.<br />You work your life out!
5536114 5538173 I can't keep...
5542746 5544513 No.
5548293 5550227 Not guilty.
5553506 5555274 Not guilty.
5558178 5559887 Not...
5570357 5572624 Um, we're ready now.
5686180 5687948 Hey!
5692187 5693937 What's your name?
5693938 5695522 Davis.
5695523 5697541 My name's McCardle.
5699778 5701528 Well, so long.
5701529 5703130 So long.
