68767 71361 You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
73287 75278 You did it. You did it!
78487 83561 To continue, you've listened to a long and<br />complex case, murder in the first degree.
83647 88482 Premeditated murder is the most serious<br />charge tried in our criminal courts.
88567 93083 You've listened to the testimony, had the<br />law interpreted as it applies in this case.
93167 97683 It's now your duty to sit down and try<br />and separate the facts from the fancy.
97767 101840 One man is dead.<br />Another man's life is at stake.
101927 105806 If there's a reasonable doubt in your<br />minds as to the guilt of the accused -
105887 110517 a reasonable doubt-then you must<br />bring me a verdict of not guilty.
110607 114486 If there's no reasonable doubt,<br />then you must, in good conscience,
114567 117365 find the accused guilty.
117447 121156 However you decide,<br />your verdict must be unanimous.
121247 124557 In the event that<br />you find the accused guilty,
124647 127798 the bench will not entertain<br />a recommendation for mercy.
127887 131004 The death sentence is mandatory<br />in this case.
131367 135440 You are faced with a grave responsibility.<br />Thank you, gentlemen.
136687 139838 The alternate jurors are excused.
144167 146556 The jury will now retire.
281207 283926 - Wanna piece of gum?<br />- No, thanks.
284247 286715 This thing isn't movin'.
289367 292882 - I'll give you a hand.<br />- That's it.
297447 300678 You know somethin'? I called<br />the Weather Bureau this morning.
300767 303645 This is gonna be<br />the hottest day of the year.
303727 306287 You'd think they'd air-condition this place.
306367 309484 - What is your name, sir?<br />- Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.
309567 313560 Thank you very much.<br />OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.
313647 318596 Now, if there's anything you want,<br />I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.
330687 333326 Good morning.<br />I never knew they locked the door.
333407 336319 Sure they lock the door.<br />What'd you think?
336407 339399 I don't know. It just never occurred to me.
340207 343995 - What's that for?<br />- I thought we might wanna vote by ballot.
344087 348080 Great idea. Maybe we can<br />get him elected senator.
353687 357362 - How'd you like it?<br />- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.
357447 361998 - Yeah? I almost fell asleep.<br />- I mean, I've never been on a jury before.
362087 364555 No? I've sat on many juries.
365647 370801 Those lawyers talk and talk, even when<br />it's an open-and-shut case like this one.
370887 374323 - Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?<br />- I guess they're entitled.
374407 377524 They're entitled. It's the system, but...
377607 382044 if you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids<br />down before they start any trouble.
382127 385517 It saves a lot of time and money.<br />Let's get started.
385607 388167 Yeah. We've probably all<br />got things to do here.
388247 392035 We can start with a five-minute break.<br />One gentleman is in the bathroom.
392127 394118 Are... we gonna sit in order?
394207 396801 Gee, I don't know. I guess so.
401407 403796 - Buddy, you're in my seat.<br />- Oh, excuse me.
403887 405878 That's all right.
407087 409681 Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
412367 416758 What did you think of the case?<br />I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
416847 420522 No real... dead spots.<br />You know what I mean?
420607 425044 We were lucky to get a murder case.<br />I figured us for an assault or burglary.
425127 427721 Boy, they can be the dullest!
428767 433795 - Hey, is that the Woolworth Building?<br />- That's right.
433887 437675 Isn't that funny? I've lived here all my life.<br />I've never been inside it.
437767 441646 If you had to sort out all that junk,<br />like that thing with the movies.
441727 444605 Yeah. What about<br />that business with the knife?
444687 447599 Asking grown-up people<br />to believe that kind of jazz.
447687 450326 You expect that.<br />You know what we're dealing with.
450407 451999 Yeah, I guess so.
452567 455445 Well, your horn works.<br />Now try your lights.
455527 459361 - You got a cold?<br />- And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.
459447 461802 I can hardly touch my nose.<br />Know what I mean?
461887 464481 Sure do. I just got over one.
465287 469678 - Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go.<br />- The guy's still in the bathroom.
469767 473442 What's new? I didn't get a chance<br />to see a paper this morning.
473527 475836 I was only wondering<br />how the market closed.
475927 480239 - You got a seat on the exchange?<br />- I'm a broker.
480327 482318 I run a messenger service.
482407 484637 The Beck and Call Company.
484727 486877 The name is my wife's idea.
486967 490357 Got 37 men workin'. Started with nothin'.
490447 493041 OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?
496527 501555 We can all get out of here pretty quick.<br />I have tickets to that ball game tonight.
501647 505276 Yanks and Cleveland. We've got<br />this kid Modjelewski in there.
505367 507562 He's a real bull, this kid. You know...
508807 510843 Real jug-handled. You know?
513447 517235 You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya?<br />Where do we sit here?
517327 520239 I thought we'd sit in order,<br />by jury numbers.
520327 523876 One, two, three and so on around the<br />table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.
523967 526925 - What's the difference?<br />- It's reasonable to sit in order.
527007 533401 - Let it be.<br />- That's twelve. We go around one, two...
533487 537400 What was your impression<br />of the prosecuting attorney?
537487 540160 - I beg pardon?<br />- I thought he was really sharp,
540247 543956 the way he handled all those points<br />one by one, in logical sequence.
544047 548723 - I was very impressed.<br />- I think he... he did an expert job.
548807 551879 A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.
551967 555277 OK, fellas. Can we<br />hold it down a minute? Fellas?
555367 557437 Say, we'd like to get started.
557527 560280 Gentleman at the window.
560367 563404 - We'd like to get started.<br />- Oh, I'm sorry.
563487 568322 - The kid kills his father, just like that.<br />- Listen, it happens all the time.
568407 570602 They let those kids run wild up there.
570687 573520 Well, maybe it serves him right.<br />You know what I mean?
573607 576440 - Is everyone here?<br />- The old man is inside.
576527 579166 - Would you knock on the door for him?<br />- Yeah.
580207 583279 - Are you a Yankee fan?<br />- No, Baltimore.
583647 585638 Baltimore?
586327 590206 That's like being hit in the head<br />with a crowbar once a day.
590287 593916 Who have they got? Who have they got<br />besides good groundkeepers?
594007 597079 - Say, we'd like to get started.<br />- Forgive me, gentlemen.
597167 600716 - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.<br />- Baltimore?
601047 606599 OK, if I can have your attention. You fellas<br />can handle this thing any way you want.
606687 609326 I'm... you know,<br />I'm not gonna make any rules.
609407 615118 We can, well, discuss it first, then vote<br />on it. That's, of course... that's one way.
615207 617846 And, well, we can vote on it right now.
617927 620566 I think it's customary<br />to take a preliminary vote.
620647 624322 Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?<br />Maybe we can all get outta here.
625807 631723 OK. Then I think that you know that we<br />have a first-degree murder charge here,
631807 636722 and if we vote the accused guilty,<br />we've got to send him to the chair.
636807 639321 Um... That's mandatory.
639407 642319 - I think we know that.<br />- Yeah, let's see who's where.
642407 645956 - OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote?<br />- It's fine with me.
647127 652281 OK, then, just remember that this<br />has to be twelve to nothing, either way.
652367 655279 That's the law. OK, are we ready?
655367 658757 All those voting guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
661887 665721 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
666607 668916 eight, nine, ten, eleven.
669007 671396 OK, that's eleven guilty.
671927 673918 Those voting not guilty?
674367 676483 One. Right.
676567 681163 Eleven guilty, one not guilty.<br />Well, now we know where we are.
681247 684284 Boy, oh boy! There's always one.
685567 688161 So, what do we do now?
688247 691205 - I guess we talk.<br />- Boy, oh boy!
691287 694085 You really think he's innocent?
696607 699724 - I don't know.<br />- You sat in court with the rest of us.
699807 702844 You heard what we did.<br />The kid's a dangerous killer.
702927 706237 - He's 18 years old.<br />- Well, that's old enough.
706327 709080 He stabbed his own father<br />four inches into the chest.
709167 711727 They proved it<br />a dozen different ways in court.
711807 715197 - Would you like me to list 'em for you?<br />- No.
715487 718365 - Then what do you want?<br />- I just want to talk.
718447 721484 What's there to talk about?<br />Eleven of us think he's guilty.
721567 723797 No one had to think about it twice<br />except you.
723887 726924 I want to ask you something.<br />Do you believe his story?
727007 731125 - I don't know. Maybe I don't.<br />- So how come you voted not guilty?
731207 733004 There were eleven votes for guilty.
733087 737956 It's not easy to raise my hand and send a<br />boy off to die without talking about it first.
738047 741437 - Well, now, who says it's easy?<br />- No one.
741527 746123 What? Just because I voted fast?<br />I honestly think the guy is guilty.
746207 748767 Couldn't change my mind<br />if you talked for 100 years.
748847 751441 I'm not trying to change your mind.<br />It's just that...
751527 754519 This is somebody's life.<br />We can't decide in five minutes.
754607 758839 - Supposing we're wrong?<br />- Supposing this building fell on my head?
758927 761680 - You can suppose anything.<br />- That's right.
761767 766602 What's the difference how long it takes?<br />Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?
766687 771397 Let's take an hour. The ball game<br />doesn't start till eight o'clock.
775967 779243 - Who's got something to say?<br />- /'m willing to sit for an hour.
779327 784447 - Great. I heard a good story last night...<br />- That's not why we're sitting here.
784527 788520 All right, then you tell me.<br />What are we sitting here for?
789167 791840 I don't know. Maybe no reason.
791927 795237 Look, this kid's been<br />kicked around all of his life.
795327 798956 You know, born in a slum,<br />mother dead since he was nine.
799047 801322 He lived for a year and a half<br />in an orphanage
801407 804240 when his father was serving<br />a jail term for forgery.
804327 806557 That's not a very happy beginning.
806647 810162 He's a wild, angry kid. That's all<br />he's ever been. And you know why?
810247 813956 Cos he's been hit on the head<br />by somebody once a day, every day.
814047 819121 He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.<br />I think we owe him a few words, that's all.
819207 823758 I don't mind telling you this, mister. We<br />don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.
823847 828204 What do you think that trial cost?<br />He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean?
828287 832405 Look, we're all grown-ups in here.<br />We heard the facts, didn't we?
832487 836639 You're not gonna tell me we're supposed<br />to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
836727 838877 I've lived among them all my life.
838967 844041 You can't believe a word they say.<br />You know that. I mean, they're born liars.
844127 847244 - Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br />- Now, listen...
847327 850080 Do you think you were born<br />with a monopoly on the truth?
850167 852840 Certain things should be<br />pointed out to this man.
852927 857796 - It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.<br />- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
857887 861516 Rice Pops. It's a product<br />I work on at the agency.
861607 864041 "The breakfast with the built-in bounce."
864127 866402 - I wrote that line.<br />- Very catchy.
866487 870958 - Say, do you mind?<br />- I'm sorry. I have this habit of doodling.
871047 873880 - It keeps me thinking clearly.<br />- We have work to do.
873967 876925 There's no point<br />staying here for ever. OK.
877447 883363 Perhaps if the gentleman down there who<br />is disagreeing with us could tell us why.
883447 887326 Tell us what you're thinking. We might be<br />able to show you where you're mixed up.
887407 893846 Maybe this is an idea. It seems to me that<br />it's up to us to convince this gentleman
893927 899320 that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if<br />we each took a couple of minutes just to...
899407 903116 - Well, it was just a quick idea.<br />- No, no, no. That's a good one.
903207 905163 Supposing we go once around the table?
905367 907278 I guess you're first.
910967 913435 It's hard to put into words.
914247 916442 I just think he's guilty.
916527 920156 I thought it was obvious from the word go.<br />Nobody proved otherwise.
920247 924081 Nobody has to prove otherwise.<br />The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
924167 928240 The defendant doesn't even have to open<br />his mouth. That's in the Constitution.
928327 932400 Sure, I know that. What I meant was...
933127 936676 Well... I just think he's guilty.<br />I mean, somebody saw him do it.
936767 941795 OK. Here's what I think. And I have<br />no personal feelings about this.
941887 944799 I just wanna talk about facts.
944887 947196 Number one.
947287 951326 The old man lived downstairs under<br />the room where the killing took place.
951407 954956 At 10 minutes after 12 on the night<br />of the killing, he heard loud noises.
955047 957038 Said it sounded like a fight.
957127 959800 And he heard the kid yell out<br />"I'm gonna kill ya."
959887 962117 A second later,<br />he heard a body hit the floor.
962207 966439 Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid<br />run down the stairs and out of the house.
966527 970281 Called the police. They found the old man<br />with the knife in his chest.
970367 973484 The coroner fixed the time of death<br />around midnight.
973567 978687 Now, these are facts.<br />You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.
978767 981918 I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.<br />I know he's only 18.
982007 986000 - But he's still gotta pay for what he did.<br />- I'm with you.
986087 989796 - OK. Are you finished?<br />- Yeah.
989887 993243 It is obvious to me that<br />the boy's entire story was flimsy.
993327 995158 He claimed he was at the movies,
995247 999035 yet he couldn't remember the names<br />of the films he saw or who played in them.
999127 1001800 - That's right.<br />- And no one saw him at the theatre.
1001887 1006085 And the woman across the street-if her<br />testimony don't prove it, nothing does.
1006167 1010445 - That's right. She actually saw the killing.<br />- Fellas, please. Let's go in order.
1010527 1012518 Just a minute. Here's a woman...
1013807 1018198 Here's a woman who's lying in bed.<br />She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.
1018287 1021245 She looks out the window,<br />and right across the street
1021327 1024797 she sees the kid stick the knife<br />into his father.
1024887 1027879 The time is 12.10 on the nose.<br />Everything fits.
1027967 1030162 She's known the kid all his life.
1030247 1033956 His window is opposite hers across the<br />el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.
1034047 1036515 Through the windows<br />of a passing el train.
1036607 1040680 This el train had no passengers on it.<br />It was just being moved downtown.
1040767 1043964 The lights were out,<br />and they proved in court that at night
1044047 1047722 you can look through the windows and<br />see what's happening on the other side.
1047807 1050844 - They proved it.<br />- I'd like to ask you something.
1050927 1053725 You don't believe the boy.<br />How come you believe the woman?
1053807 1056924 She's one of "them" too, isn't she?
1058007 1061761 - You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya?<br />- OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.
1061847 1065965 - Come on, sit down. Sit down.<br />- What's he so wise about? I'm telling ya...
1066047 1069198 Come on. Now we're not gonna<br />get anywhere fighting.
1069287 1073360 - Whose turn is it next?<br />- Oh, his. Number five.
1076487 1078955 May I... Can I pass?
1079047 1081800 Well... That's your privilege.
1081887 1084037 How about the next gentleman?
1084127 1086595 Oh. Well... I don't know.
1086687 1091158 I started to be convinced,<br />you know, very early in the case.
1091247 1094319 You see, I was looking for a motive.
1094407 1099720 That's very important because if you don't<br />have a motive, where's your case, right?
1099807 1105325 Anyway, that testimony from those people<br />across the hall from the kid's apartment,
1105407 1110606 that was very powerful. Didn't they say<br />something about a fight, an argument,
1110687 1114805 between the old man and his son<br />around about seven o'clock that night?
1114887 1118084 - I could be wrong but...<br />- It was eight o'clock, not seven.
1118167 1123719 They heard an argument. Then<br />they heard the father hit the boy twice.
1123807 1127880 Finally they saw the boy run, angry,<br />out of the house. What does that prove?
1127967 1130845 It don't prove anything.<br />It's just part of the picture.
1130927 1133964 You said it provided a motive.<br />So did the prosecution.
1134047 1136083 That wasn't a very strong motive.
1136167 1139921 This boy has been hit so many times<br />that violence is practically...
1140007 1142237 It's a normal state of affairs with him.
1142327 1146400 I just can't see two slaps in the face<br />provoking him into committing murder.
1146487 1150844 It may have been two too many.<br />Everyone has a breaking point.
1152087 1154282 Anything else?
1154367 1157598 - No.<br />- OK. How about you?
1160087 1163363 I don't know. It's all been said.
1163447 1166757 You can talk here for ever.<br />It's still the same thing.
1167127 1171803 This kid is five for 0.<br />Well, look at his record.
1171887 1176005 When he was 10, he was in children's<br />court: He threw a rock at a teacher.
1176087 1180000 When he was 15, he was<br />in reform school: He stole a car.
1180087 1184717 He's been arrested for muggin'.<br />He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.
1184807 1189323 They say he's real handy with a knife.<br />Oh, this is a very fine boy.
1189407 1193764 Ever since he was five, his father<br />beat him up regularly. He used his fists.
1193847 1196236 So would I. A kid like that?
1196327 1199524 It's these kids -<br />the way they are nowadays.
1201687 1205236 When I was a kid,<br />I used to call my father "sir".
1205327 1208364 That's right. Ever hear a kid<br />call his father that any more?
1208447 1211678 Fathers don't seem to think<br />it's important any more.
1211767 1214076 - You got any kids?<br />- Three.
1215087 1217078 I got one.
1217967 1219958 He's 22 years old.
1225407 1229685 When he was nine years old,<br />he ran away from a fight.
1229767 1234363 I saw it. I was so embarrassed,<br />I almost threw up.
1234447 1239680 I said "I'm gonna make a man out of you<br />if I have to break you in two tryin'."
1241207 1243801 Well, I made a man out of him.
1243887 1246481 When he was 16, we had a fight.
1247687 1250679 Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.
1253127 1255960 I haven't seen him for two years.
1258287 1260278 Kids.
1260687 1262678 You work your heart out...
1265087 1268477 - Well, let's get goin'.<br />- I think we're missing the point.
1268567 1272082 This boy's the product of a broken home<br />and a filthy neighbourhood.
1272167 1275523 We can't help that. We're here<br />to decide his innocence or guilt,
1275607 1278440 not to go into the reasons<br />why he grew up the way he did.
1278527 1282884 He was born in a slum.<br />Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
1282967 1288200 It's no secret that children from slums<br />are potential menaces to society. I think...
1288287 1292326 You can say that again. The kids who<br />crawl out of these places are real trash.
1292407 1297606 - I don't want any part of them.<br />- Listen, I... I've lived in a slum all my life.
1297687 1299439 - Wait a minute.<br />- Please. I...
1299527 1302360 I've played in back yards<br />that were filled with garbage.
1302447 1305120 - Maybe you can still smell it on me.<br />- Listen, sonny...
1305207 1307482 Come on, now. There's nothing personal.
1307567 1311003 Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.<br />Let's not be so sensitive.
1311087 1313681 This sensitivity I can understand.
1313767 1318397 OK, look. Let's stop the arguing.<br />We're only wasting time.
1318487 1320876 Your turn down there. Let's go.
1321927 1325681 I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br />you were all gonna to try to convince me.
1325767 1327883 - That was the idea.<br />- I forgot. He's right.
1327967 1331164 He's the one keeping us in here.<br />Let's hear what he's got to say.
1331247 1334956 Wait. We decided to do this a certain way.<br />I think we ought to stick to it.
1335047 1337242 Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?
1337327 1341798 - What do you mean, a kid?<br />- What do you think I mean? K-I-D: Kid.
1344167 1346806 Just because I'm trying<br />to keep this organised?
1346887 1350926 Here, you take on the responsibility.<br />I'll just keep my mouth shut.
1351007 1354238 - Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down.<br />- Don't tell me to calm down.
1354327 1356602 You want to take the chair?<br />Take the chair.
1356687 1358962 Did you ever see such a thing?
1359047 1362244 - You think it's funny?<br />- Forget it, fella. It's unimportant.
1362327 1364158 Unimportant? Here, you try it.
1364247 1367239 Nobody wants to change.<br />You're doing a beautiful job.
1367327 1372720 Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella.<br />You stay in there and pitch.
1372807 1376277 All right, let's hear from somebody.
1376367 1380360 Well, if you want me to tell you<br />how I feel about it, it's all right with me.
1380447 1385202 - Boy, I don't care what you do.<br />- All right. I don't have anything brilliant.
1385287 1387357 I only know as much as you do.
1387447 1390962 According to the testimony,<br />the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
1391047 1395563 I sat there in court for six days<br />listening while the evidence built up.
1395647 1397638 Everybody sounded so positive.
1397727 1402437 I began to get a peculiar feeling about<br />this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive.
1402527 1406759 There are questions I'd have liked to ask.<br />Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...
1406847 1411443 I felt that the defence wasn't conducting<br />a thorough enough cross-examination.
1411527 1414325 He let too many things go by-little things.
1414407 1417126 What little things?<br />When they don't ask questions,
1417207 1420005 it's because they know<br />the answers already.
1420087 1424797 It's also possible for a lawyer to be just<br />plain stupid, isn't it? I mean, it's possible.
1424887 1427845 You sound like you met<br />my brother-in-law once.
1429767 1435876 I kept putting myself in the kid's place.<br />I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.
1435967 1438276 I mean, if I was on trial for my life,
1438367 1443157 I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br />witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
1443247 1447320 Look, there was one alleged<br />eyewitness to this killing.
1447407 1450797 Someone else claims he heard the killing,<br />saw the boy run out after,
1450887 1453003 and there was circumstantial evidence.
1453087 1456875 But those two witnesses<br />were the entire case for the prosecution.
1456967 1458366 Supposing they're wrong?
1458447 1461644 What do you mean? What's the point<br />of having witnesses at all?
1461727 1465925 - Could they be wrong?<br />- Those people were under oath.
1466007 1469841 They're only people. People<br />make mistakes. Could they be wrong?
1469927 1472885 - Well, no. I don't think so.<br />- Do you know so?
1472967 1476277 Nobody can know a thing like that.<br />This isn't an exact science.
1476367 1478756 That's right, it isn't.
1482607 1484996 OK, let's get to the point.
1485087 1488079 What about the switch knife<br />they found in the old man's chest?
1488167 1491239 Some people haven't talked yet.<br />Shouldn't we go in order?
1491327 1494763 They'll get a chance to talk.<br />Be quiet a second, will ya?
1494847 1499318 What about the knife this fine, upright boy<br />admitted buying the night of the killing?
1499407 1502877 - Let's talk about it.<br />- All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.
1502967 1507802 - I'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman?<br />- Why do we have to see it again?
1507887 1511357 The gentleman has a right<br />to see exhibits in evidence.
1512047 1515244 - Say, could you bring us the knife?<br />- The knife? Sure.
1516527 1519997 The knife and the way it was bought<br />is strong evidence, don't you think?
1520087 1523762 - I do.<br />- Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.
1523847 1527123 One: The boy admitted leaving the house<br />at eight o'clock at night
1527207 1529323 after being slapped by his father.
1529407 1534083 No, he didn't say "slapped".<br />He said "punched". There's a difference.
1534167 1536601 After being hit several times by his father.
1536687 1540521 Two: He went directly to a local junk shop<br />where he bought one of those...
1540607 1542916 - Switch knives.<br />- Switchblade knives.
1543007 1547523 This wasn't an ordinary knife. It had<br />a very unusual carved handle and blade.
1547607 1551964 The storekeeper said it was the only one<br />of its kind he had ever had in stock.
1552047 1557075 Three: He met some friends of his in front<br />of a tavern about 8.45. Am I right so far?
1557167 1559123 - Yes, you are.<br />- You bet he is.
1559207 1562517 He talked with his friends<br />for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.
1562607 1565280 During this time,<br />they saw the switch knife.
1565367 1571966 Four: They identified the death weapon<br />in court as that very same knife.
1572047 1574766 Five: He arrived home<br />at about ten o'clock.
1574847 1578965 This is where the stories offered<br />by the State and the boy diverge slightly.
1579047 1581436 He claims that he went to a movie<br />at about 11.30,
1581527 1585645 returning home at 3.10 to find<br />his father dead and himself arrested.
1585727 1589640 He also claims that the two detectives<br />threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
1589727 1593436 What happened to the knife? He claims<br />it fell through a hole in his pocket
1593527 1597122 on the way to the movies,<br />sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,
1597207 1600722 and that he never saw it again.<br />Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.
1600807 1603958 I think it's clear the boy<br />never went to the movies that night.
1604047 1607676 No one in the house saw him go out.<br />No one at the theatre identified him.
1607767 1610918 He couldn't even remember<br />the names of the pictures he saw.
1612567 1614478 What actually happened is this.
1614567 1617718 The boy stayed home,<br />had another fight with his father,
1617807 1621163 stabbed him to death and left the house<br />at 10 minutes after 12.
1621247 1623920 He even wiped the knife<br />clean of fingerprints.
1624007 1628239 Are you trying to tell me that this knife<br />fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,
1628327 1630602 someone picked it up,<br />went to the boy's house
1630687 1633520 and stabbed his father with it<br />just to test its sharpness?
1633607 1635757 No, but it's possib/e the boy lost his knife
1635847 1638805 and somebody else stabbed his father<br />with a similar knife.
1638887 1641276 Take a look at this knife.
1642247 1644363 It's a very unusual knife.
1644447 1648520 I've never seen one like it. Neither had<br />the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.
1648607 1651724 Aren't you asking us to accept<br />an incredible coincidence?
1651807 1656403 - I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.<br />- And I say it's not possible.
1661967 1663844 Where did that come from?
1663927 1666600 - It's the same knife!<br />- What do you think you're doin'?
1666687 1670236 - Where did you get it?<br />- I went out walking last night.
1670327 1672318 Through the boy's neighbourhood.
1672407 1677481 I bought that at a pawn shop two blocks<br />from the boy's house. It cost six dollars.
1677567 1680206 It's against the law<br />to buy or sell switchblade knives.
1680287 1683359 - That's right. I broke the law.<br />- You pulled a real bright trick.
1683447 1685836 Now supposing you tell me what it proves.
1685927 1689044 - Maybe there are ten knives like that.<br />- Maybe there are!
1689127 1693917 What does it mean? You found a knife like<br />it. What's that? The discovery of the age?
1694007 1698046 You think somebody else did the stabbing<br />with exactly the same kind of knife?
1698127 1701005 - The odds are a million to one.<br />- It's possible!
1701087 1705080 - But not very probable.<br />- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.
1705167 1708557 There's no point standing around<br />all over the place.
1708647 1712196 It's interesting that he'd find a knife<br />exactly like the boy's.
1712287 1716678 - What's interesting about it? Interesting!<br />- I just thought it was interesting.
1716767 1718997 Eleven of us still think he's guilty.
1719087 1722762 Right. You're not gonna<br />change anybody's mind.
1722847 1725042 If you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.
1725127 1729120 The kid'll be tried again<br />and found guilty, as sure as he's born.
1729447 1731483 You're probably right.
1731567 1734286 So, what are you gonna do?<br />We can be here all night.
1734367 1737518 It's only one night. A boy may die.
1737607 1740246 Well, why don't we just<br />set up house here?
1740327 1742557 Someone send for a pinochle deck
1742647 1746162 and we'll just sweat<br />the whole thing out right here.
1746247 1749922 - I don't think he oughta joke about it.<br />- What do you want me to do about it?
1750007 1752999 I don't see what the knife<br />has got to do with anything.
1753087 1755885 Somebody saw the kid stab his father.<br />What more do we need?
1755967 1758686 You guys can talk the ears<br />right off my head.
1758767 1763124 I got three garages going to pot.<br />So let's get done and get outta here.
1763207 1766643 The knife was important to the<br />district attorney. He spent a day...
1766727 1769446 He's a 15th assistant or something.<br />What does he know?
1769527 1773645 Let's hold it down. These side arguments<br />are only slowin' us up.
1775407 1778638 - Well, what about it?<br />- You're the only one.
1785727 1791643 I have a proposition to make to all of you.<br />I'm going to call for another vote.
1791727 1794400 I want you eleven men to...
1794487 1796796 vote by secret written ballot.
1797247 1801684 I'll abstain. If there are eleven votes<br />for guilty, I won't stand alone.
1801767 1806477 We'll take in a guilty verdict<br />to the judge right now.
1806567 1811561 But if anyone votes not guilty,<br />we'll stay here and talk it out.
1813367 1817997 - That's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.<br />- All right. Let's do it the hard way.
1818087 1821762 That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?<br />Anyone doesn't agree?
1821847 1823838 OK, pass these along.
1855327 1857318 Guilty.
1859047 1860639 Guilty.
1862327 1863919 Guilty.
1865487 1867079 Guilty.
1868247 1869839 Guilty.
1871167 1872759 Guilty.
1874327 1875919 Guilty.
1876407 1877999 Guilty.
1878967 1880559 Guilty.
1884487 1886398 Not guilty.
1886487 1887966 Guilty.
1888047 1892040 - Boy, how do you like that?<br />- And another chap flips his wings!
1892127 1894846 All right. Who was it?<br />Come on, I wanna know.
1894927 1898442 Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.<br />We all agreed on that, no?
1898527 1900882 If the gentleman<br />wants it to remain secret...
1900967 1906325 Secret? What do you mean? There are no<br />secrets in a jury room. I know who it was.
1906407 1910480 Brother, you really are somethin'.<br />You vote guilty like the rest of us,
1910567 1913639 then some golden-voiced preacher<br />tears your heart out -
1913727 1916878 some underprivileged kid<br />couldn't help becoming a murderer -
1916967 1920562 and you change your vote.<br />If that isn't the most sickening...
1920647 1923957 Why don't you drop a quarter<br />in his collection box?
1924047 1928518 Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk<br />to me like that. Who do you think you are?
1928607 1931280 Calm down, calm down. It doesn't matter.
1931367 1934837 - He's very excitable. Sit down.<br />- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!
1934927 1938124 We're tryin' to put a guilty man<br />in the chair, where he belongs.
1938207 1941756 Someone starts tellin' us<br />fairy tales and we're listenin'!
1942407 1947117 - What made you change your vote?<br />- He didn't change his vote. I did.
1947207 1949118 - Oh, fine.<br />- I knew it.
1949207 1952916 - Would you like me to tell you why?<br />- No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.
1953007 1956920 - I'd like to anyway, if you don't mind.<br />- Do we have to listen to this?
1957007 1960363 - The man wants to talk.<br />- Thank you.
1960447 1963678 This gentleman has been<br />standing alone against us.
1963767 1965917 He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.
1966007 1970717 He just isn't sure. It's not easy to stand<br />alone against the ridicule of others.
1970807 1975358 So he gambled for support and I gave it<br />to him. I respect his motives.
1975447 1979918 The boy on trial is probably guilty,<br />but... I want to hear more.
1980007 1983522 The vote is ten to two. I'm talking!<br />You have no right to leave this room!
1983607 1986758 He can't hear you. He never will.<br />Let's sit down.
1991727 1995606 - Shall we continue?<br />- Well, I think we ought to take a break.
1995687 2000124 You know, one man's inside and<br />I think we ought to wait for him.
2002767 2005486 Looks like we're really<br />hung up here, huh?
2005567 2009879 I mean, that thing with the old man,<br />that was pretty unexpected.
2009967 2013437 Wish I could figure out some way<br />we could break it up.
2015207 2019598 You know, in advertising...<br />I told you I worked in an agency?
2019687 2023362 Some pretty strange people work there.<br />Well, not strange, really.
2023447 2027565 I guess it's just they have peculiar ways<br />of expressing themselves.
2027647 2030525 I suppose it's the same<br />in your business too, huh?
2030607 2033041 - What do you do?<br />- I'm a watchmaker.
2033127 2037086 Really? I imagine the finest watchmakers<br />in the world come from Europe.
2037167 2040045 Anyway, in an agency,<br />when we reach a point like this...
2040127 2043802 I'm telling him, in an ad agency when<br />a point like this is reached in a meeting,
2043887 2046879 there's always some character<br />ready with an idea, see.
2046967 2049276 It kills me. It's the weirdest thing,
2049367 2052279 the way they sometimes precede<br />their idea with a phrase.
2052367 2055916 Like, some account exec<br />will get up and he'll say:
2056007 2062082 "OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up<br />the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it."
2062167 2064601 I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.
2064687 2068157 I... got a little excited back there.
2068247 2071080 I... didn't mean to get nasty.
2072367 2077487 Glad you're not one of those who lets<br />these emotional appeals influence him.
2091967 2094561 I don't know what's the matter<br />with that fan.
2103927 2107044 - Are you a salesman?<br />- I'm an architect.
2109647 2112366 You know what the soft sell is?
2114647 2117559 Well, you've got it, believe me.
2118047 2120481 I've got a different technique.
2120567 2124355 Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?
2125327 2127318 Yeah.
2127927 2131203 Hit 'em where they live-that's my motto.
2131287 2134836 I made 27 grand last year<br />sellin' marmalade.
2134927 2138363 That's not bad. I mean, you know,<br />considerin' marmalade.
2140407 2143001 What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?
2143727 2147276 Or did somebody bump you on the head<br />once and you haven't gotten over it?
2147367 2151519 - Maybe.<br />- You know, you do-gooders are all alike.
2151607 2156044 You're always blowin' your stacks<br />over some guy that fanned.
2157207 2159801 But what are you wastin' our time for?
2159887 2165166 Why don't you donate five dollars to the<br />cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.
2166767 2168837 This kid is guilty, pal.
2168927 2173523 It's as plain as the nose on your face. So<br />why don't we stop wastin' our time here?
2173607 2176360 We're gonna all get sore throats<br />if we keep it up.
2176447 2180122 What difference does it make<br />if you get it here or at the ball game?
2180207 2182516 No difference, pal.
2182607 2184598 No difference at all.
2195807 2200562 - Nice bunch of guys, huh?<br />- They're about the same as anyone else.
2200647 2203036 Boy, what a murderous day.
2203447 2207042 - Do you think we'll be much longer?<br />- I don't know.
2207127 2210676 He's guilty for sure.<br />Not a doubt in the whole world.
2210767 2214362 We should've...<br />We should've been done already.
2215247 2217556 Oh, I don't mind, you know.
2217647 2219638 Beats workin'.
2225727 2230039 - You think he's not guilty, huh?<br />- I don't know. It's possible.
2230127 2234006 Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'<br />you've never been wronger in your life.
2234087 2236396 You're wastin' your time.<br />You ought to wrap it up.
2236487 2239240 Supposing you were the one<br />who was on trial?
2239327 2242444 Well, I'm not used to supposin'.<br />I'm just a workin' man.
2242527 2245360 My boss does the supposin'. But...
2245447 2247438 I'll try one.
2248207 2251517 Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...
2251607 2255282 the kid really did knife his father, huh?
2262247 2264203 Are you ready?
2265607 2267598 Sorry, blue eyes.
2268287 2271279 - Well, where else?<br />- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.
2271367 2275838 - Looks like we'll be here for dinner.<br />- OK, now let's get down to business.
2275927 2277679 - Who wants to start?<br />- I will.
2277767 2280520 - OK, go.<br />- You, down there.
2280607 2284486 The old man who lived downstairs says<br />he heard the kid yell "I'm gonna kill ya."
2284567 2286956 A second later,<br />he heard the body hit the floor.
2287047 2291962 He ran to the door and saw the kid run out<br />of the house. What's that mean to you?
2292047 2295483 I wonder how clearly he heard<br />the boy's voice through the ceiling.
2295567 2299480 He didn't. The window was open. So was<br />the one upstairs. It was a hot night.
2299567 2303003 It was another apartment.<br />It's not easy to identify a shouting voice.
2303087 2304839 He identified it in court.
2304927 2309205 The lady across the street looked right in<br />the open window and saw the stabbing.
2309287 2311676 - Isn't that enough for you?<br />- No, it isn't.
2311767 2315362 Boy, how do you like this guy?<br />It's like talkin' into a dead phone.
2315447 2318405 She said she saw it through<br />the windows of a moving el train.
2318487 2321877 There were six cars on the train.<br />She saw it through the last two.
2321967 2325801 She remembered insignificant details.<br />How can you argue with that?
2325887 2331007 Has anybody here any idea<br />how long it would take an el...
2340127 2342516 This isn't a game.
2345567 2347797 Did you see him?
2347887 2351038 The nerve! The absolute nerve!
2351127 2354802 - Forget it. It's not important.<br />- This isn't a game?
2354887 2358163 - Who does he think he is?<br />- Forget it now.
2358247 2363321 Any idea how long it takes an el train<br />at medium speed to pass a given point?
2363407 2365204 - What has that to do with it?<br />- Guess.
2365287 2367562 - I wouldn't have any idea.<br />- What do you think?
2367647 2372163 - I don't know. Ten, twelve seconds?<br />- A pretty good guess. Anyone else?
2372247 2374807 - Sounds right to me.<br />- What's the guessing game for?
2374887 2376684 - What do you say?<br />- Ten seconds.
2376767 2379918 - All right. What are you getting at?<br />- This.
2380007 2383522 It takes a six-car el train<br />ten seconds to pass a given point.
2383607 2387885 Say the given point is the open window<br />of the room where the killing took place.
2387967 2390845 You can reach out<br />and almost touch the el tracks, right?
2390927 2394636 Now let me ask you this. Has anyone<br />here ever lived near the el tracks?
2394727 2399323 I just finished painting an apartment that<br />overlooked an el line. It took three days.
2399407 2403605 - What was it like? Noisy?<br />- Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.
2403687 2406281 I lived in an apartment<br />near the el line once.
2406367 2409359 When the window's open,<br />the train noise is almost unbearable.
2409447 2412996 - You can hardly hear yourself think.<br />- Will you get to the point?
2413087 2417956 I will. Now, let's take two pieces of<br />testimony and try to put them together.
2418047 2422086 First: The old man<br />in the apartment downstairs.
2422167 2424601 He says he heard the boy say<br />"I'm gonna kill you",
2424687 2427247 and a split second later<br />heard a body hit the floor.
2427327 2428999 - One second later.<br />- Right.
2429087 2431681 Second: The woman across the street
2431767 2435646 swore positively she looked<br />out of the window and saw the killing
2435727 2439003 through the last two cars<br />of a passing el train-the last two cars.
2439087 2441726 - What are you givin' us here?<br />- Now, just a minute.
2441807 2446756 We've agreed that it takes ten seconds<br />for a train to pass a given point.
2446847 2449919 Since the woman saw the killing<br />through the last two cars,
2450007 2455206 we can assume that the body hit<br />the floor just as the train went by.
2455287 2459405 Therefore, the train had been<br />roaring by the old man's window
2459487 2462763 a full ten seconds<br />before the body hit the floor.
2462847 2467841 The old man - "I'm gonna kill you",<br />body hitting the floor a second later -
2467927 2471920 would have had to hear the boy's words<br />with the el roaring past his nose!
2472007 2474805 - It's not possible he heard it.<br />- Of course he heard it.
2474887 2478084 - Do you think so?<br />- He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
2478167 2481284 He couldn't have identified the voice<br />with the el roaring by.
2481367 2484086 It was a matter of seconds!<br />Nobody can be that accurate.
2484167 2489161 Testimony that could put a boy into the<br />electric chair shou/d be that accurate.
2490647 2494879 - I don't think he could have heard it.<br />- Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.
2494967 2498721 - What are you people talkin' about?<br />- It stands to reason he couldn't have.
2498807 2502720 - Why lie? What's he got to gain?<br />- Attention, maybe.
2502807 2507801 You keep comin' in with bright sayings.<br />Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!
2507887 2510560 What are you talkin' to him like that for?
2510647 2514037 A guy who talks like that to an old man<br />really oughta get stepped on.
2514127 2517039 You oughta have more respect, mister.
2517127 2521996 You say stuff like that to him again...<br />I'm gonna lay you out.
2531047 2533800 You go ahead. You say anything you like.
2534847 2537839 Why do you think the old man might lie?
2537927 2541806 It was just that I looked at him<br />for a very long time.
2541887 2545004 The seam of his jacket was split,<br />under the shoulder.
2545087 2549285 Did you notice that?<br />I mean, to come into court like that.
2551687 2554918 He was a very old man in a torn jacket.
2555407 2558763 And he walked very slowly to the stand.
2558847 2562965 He was dragging his left leg<br />and trying to hide it,
2563047 2565481 because he was ashamed.
2565567 2569606 I think I know this man<br />better than anyone here.
2569687 2572406 This is a quiet, frightened,
2572487 2574842 insignificant old man who...
2574927 2577566 who has been nothing all his life.
2577647 2582357 Who has never had recognition<br />or his name in the newspapers.
2582447 2586486 Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.
2586567 2590162 Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
2591087 2595524 Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -<br />to mean nothing.
2595607 2600237 A man like this needs to be quoted,<br />to be listened to.
2600367 2604280 To be quoted just once -<br />very important to him.
2604367 2607279 It would be so hard for him<br />to recede into the background.
2607367 2611280 Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie<br />just so he could be important once?
2611367 2614086 No. He wouldn't really lie.
2614167 2617398 But perhaps he made himself believe<br />he heard those words
2617487 2619717 and recognised the boy's face.
2619807 2622116 That's the most fantastic story ever.
2622207 2625961 How can you make up a thing like that?<br />What do you know about it?
2634407 2637763 - Does anybody want a cough drop?<br />- I'll take one.
2637847 2641283 I still don't see how anybody<br />can think he's not guilty.
2641367 2645360 There's something else I'd like<br />to talk about for a minute. Thanks.
2645447 2649326 We've proved the old man couldn't have<br />heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."
2649407 2653161 - You didn't prove it at all!<br />- Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?
2653247 2656956 This phrase, how many times have<br />all of us used it? Probably thousands.
2657047 2661837 "I could kill you for that." "Junior, do that<br />again and I'll kill you." "Rocky, kill him."
2661927 2666921 - It doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody.<br />- The phrase was: "I'm gonna kill you."
2667007 2669202 The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
2669287 2672757 Don't tell me he didn't mean it.<br />Anybody says it like that, they mean it!
2672847 2674678 Gee, I don't know.
2674767 2678362 I was arguing with the guy I work next to<br />at the bank a few weeks ago.
2678447 2680802 He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.
2680887 2683560 This guy is trying to make you<br />believe what isn't so!
2683647 2685638 The kid said he'd kill him and he did!
2685727 2690198 Do you really think the boy'd shout it out<br />so the whole neighbourhood could hear?
2690287 2694997 - He's much too bright for that.<br />- Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.
2695087 2697078 He don't even speak good English.
2697167 2700477 He doesn't even speak good English.
2701927 2705636 Mr Foreman, I'd like to<br />change my vote to not guilty.
2706247 2708283 - You what?<br />- You heard me.
2708367 2711677 - Are you sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
2711767 2714327 The vote is nine to three<br />in favour of guilty.
2714407 2716796 Well, if this isn't the livin' end!
2720767 2724203 What are you basin' it on?<br />Stories this guy made up?
2724287 2728200 You oughta write for one of those kooky<br />detective magazines, make a fortune.
2728287 2731802 For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer<br />knew he didn't stand a chance.
2731887 2735277 Right from the beginning, his own<br />lawyer knew, and you could see it.
2735367 2739406 Boy, oh boy, I'm telling ya.<br />This guy here is really somethin'.
2739487 2742718 The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?<br />He presented his case, not you.
2742807 2745560 - How come you say so much?<br />- Lawyers aren't infallible.
2745647 2748559 - Baltimore, please.<br />- He was court-appointed.
2748647 2750763 - What's that supposed to mean?<br />- A lot.
2750847 2753964 He didn't want the case<br />or he resented being appointed.
2754047 2758325 It's the kind of case that brings no money,<br />no glory, not much chance of winning.
2758407 2761399 That's not a very promising<br />situation for a young lawyer.
2761487 2766197 He'd really have to believe in his client to<br />put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.
2766287 2768278 Of course he didn't.
2769127 2771357 Who the heck could?
2771447 2774280 Except maybe some guy's mother<br />or somebody.
2774367 2777165 Oh, look.<br />Will you look at the time? Come on.
2777247 2780637 Pardon me. I have made some notes here,
2780727 2784003 and I would like, please,<br />to say something.
2784087 2786760 I have been listening very carefully and...
2786847 2790556 it seems to me that this man<br />has some very good points to make.
2790647 2795118 From what was presented at the trial,<br />the boy looks guilty, on the surface.
2795207 2798882 - But maybe if we go deeper...<br />- Come on, will ya?
2798967 2801117 There is a question I would like to ask.
2801207 2804517 Let us assume that the boy<br />really did commit the murder.
2804607 2807838 Now, this happened<br />at 10 minutes after 12.
2807927 2810361 Now, how was he caught by the police?
2810447 2814406 He came back home...<br />at three o'clock or so,
2814487 2818116 and he was captured by two detectives<br />in the hallway of his house.
2818207 2822644 Now, my question is:<br />If he really had killed his father,
2822727 2826037 why would he come back home<br />three hours later?
2826127 2828880 Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
2828967 2832880 He came home for his knife. It's not nice<br />to leave knives in people's chests.
2832967 2835686 Yeah, especially relatives'.
2835767 2838281 I don't see anything funny about it.
2838367 2841439 The boy knew the knife<br />could be identified.
2841527 2845839 - He had to get it before the police did.<br />- If he knew the knife could be identified,
2845927 2848441 why did he leave it there in the first place?
2848527 2853760 I think we can assume the boy ran out in a<br />state of panic, having just killed his father.
2853847 2856725 He calmed down and realised<br />he'd left his knife there.
2856807 2859605 This, then, depends<br />on your definition of panic.
2859687 2864442 He would have had to be calm enough to<br />wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.
2864527 2868236 Now, where did this panic start<br />and where did it end?
2868327 2871000 You voted guilty. What side are you on?
2871087 2874124 I don't believe I have to be loyal<br />to one side or the other.
2874207 2879235 - I'm simply asking questions.<br />- This is just off the top of my head but...
2879327 2883366 If /'d done the stabbing, I'd take a chance<br />and go back for the knife.
2883447 2885915 I'll bet he figured<br />nobody'd seen him running out
2886007 2888680 and the body wouldn't be discovered<br />till the next day.
2888767 2892806 After all, it was the middle of the night.<br />He figured it'd be found the next day.
2892887 2894843 Pardon. This is my whole point.
2894927 2898761 The woman across the street testified<br />that the moment after she saw the killing,
2898847 2900997 that is, a moment after the train went by,
2901087 2904124 she screamed, and then went<br />to telephone the police.
2904207 2907597 Now, the boy certainly<br />must have heard the scream.
2907687 2910804 So he knew that<br />somebody saw something.
2910887 2913640 I just don't think<br />that he would have gone back.
2913727 2918164 Two things. One: He may not have heard<br />the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
2918247 2921444 Two: If he did, he may not<br />have connected it with his own acts.
2921527 2924439 He lived in a neighbourhood<br />where screams were commonplace.
2924527 2928725 - There's your answer.<br />- Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.
2928807 2931116 Didn't hear the scream,<br />did run out in a panic,
2931207 2935883 calmed down later and came back for the<br />knife, risking being caught by the police.
2935967 2938800 Maybe those things happened,<br />but maybe they didn't.
2938887 2942960 There's enough doubt to wonder if he was<br />there at all at the time of the killing.
2943047 2946357 What do you mean? Didn't the old man<br />see him running out of the house?
2946447 2948199 He's twisting the facts.
2948287 2951723 Did or didn't the old man see the kid<br />running out of the house at 12.10?
2951807 2954367 - Well, did or didn't he?<br />- He says he did.
2954447 2956802 Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?
2956887 2959879 - Witnesses can make mistakes.<br />- Sure, when you want them to!
2959967 2962561 - Or when he wants them to!<br />- Keep the yelling down.
2962647 2967277 Maybe we need a little yelling. These<br />guys keep going off every which way.
2967367 2970518 Did hear the scream, didn't hear it -<br />what difference does it make?
2970607 2974316 You're talking about little details<br />and forgetting the important stuff.
2974407 2976967 - I call for another vote.<br />- I'm talking here!
2977047 2979038 Another vote called for.
2979127 2981516 Now let's take our seats.
2984487 2986842 I never saw so much time<br />spent on nothin'.
2986927 2989122 It only takes a second.
2989767 2993043 OK, I guess the fastest way is<br />to find out who's voting not guilty.
2993127 2996756 All those voting not guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
2996847 3000317 Still the same. One, two, three<br />not guilty. Nine guilty.
3000407 3005162 So now where are we? We can yakety-yak<br />till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?
3005247 3008159 Pardon. I vote not guilty.
3010127 3014325 What are you talkin' about? I mean,<br />we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.
3014407 3017683 The kid is guilty.<br />Why don't you listen to the facts?
3017767 3020235 Tell them, will ya?<br />This is gettin' to be a joke.
3020327 3023558 The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.
3023647 3027242 What is this?<br />Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?
3027327 3030842 I want you to tell me why<br />you changed your vote. Give me reasons.
3030927 3035318 I don't have to defend my decision to you.<br />There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
3035407 3038240 Reasonable doubt?<br />Nothing but words. Look at this.
3038327 3043117 The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br />was seen ramming this into his father!
3043207 3047883 - What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt?<br />- That's not the knife, remember?
3047967 3052358 - Oh, brilliant!<br />- I'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.
3052447 3057202 I mean, what are we supposed to believe?<br />You're pullin' stories out of thin air.
3057287 3060962 A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside<br />at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,
3061047 3062799 he'd be trying to tell you that...
3063327 3065522 Look. Now what about the old man?
3065607 3069156 Are we supposed to believe he didn't<br />see the kid tearin' down the steps
3069247 3071124 15 seconds after the killing?
3071247 3073761 He's just sayin' so to be important, right?
3073847 3075883 - What's the point of it all?<br />- Hold it.
3075967 3078162 The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.
3078247 3081637 - And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits.<br />- Hold on a second. Look.
3081727 3085117 - Did the old man say he ran to the door?<br />- What's the difference?
3085207 3089120 - He got there, didn't he?<br />- He said he ran. At least I think he did.
3089207 3092279 I don't remember, but I don't see<br />how he could have run.
3092367 3095803 He said he went from his bedroom<br />to the front door. Isn't that enough?
3095887 3098242 - Where was the bedroom?<br />- Down the hall.
3098327 3100966 - Don't you remember that?<br />- No.
3101047 3105916 - I want to see a diagram of the apartment.<br />- Why don't we have him on trial again?
3106007 3108202 You're the only one<br />wants to see exhibits.
3108287 3111484 - I want to see this one, too.<br />- I'd like to stop wastin' time.
3111567 3114684 If we're gonna wade through<br />that nonsense about the body...
3114767 3120000 No, but I'd like to know if an old man<br />who drags one foot cos he had a stroke
3120087 3122760 can get from his bedroom<br />to his front door in 15 seconds.
3122847 3124519 - He said 20.<br />- He said 15.
3124607 3128122 - 20. What are you tryin' to distort?<br />- He said 15.
3128207 3131244 How does he know how long<br />15 seconds is? You can't judge that.
3131327 3133761 He said 15. He was positive about it.
3133847 3135997 He was an old man! He was confused!
3136087 3139557 How could he be positive about anything?
3145887 3149846 I don't see what you're going to prove.<br />The man said he saw the boy running out.
3149927 3153078 Let's see if the details bear him out.<br />As the body hit the floor,
3153167 3156443 he said he heard footsteps upstairs,<br />running to the front door.
3156527 3159599 Heard the upstairs door open,<br />the footsteps start down.
3159687 3165205 He said he got to his own door in, at most,<br />15 seconds. If the killer ran immediately...
3165287 3167755 - Maybe he didn't.<br />- The old man said he did.
3167847 3171044 You oughta be at<br />that hair-splitters' convention.
3171127 3173357 Why don't you stop<br />making smart remarks?
3173447 3177838 My friend, for your three dollars a day,<br />you have to listen to everything.
3177927 3183604 Here's the apartment. The old man's was<br />directly beneath and exactly the same.
3183687 3188715 Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living<br />room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.
3188807 3190957 The old man was in this bedroom here.
3191047 3194278 He says he crossed to the door,<br />walked down the hall, opened the door
3194367 3197518 just in time to see the boy<br />running down the stairs. Am I right?
3197607 3199837 That's the story, for the 19th time.
3199927 3203283 - 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.<br />- Correct.
3203367 3205358 Now, let's see. It was...
3205447 3209076 It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.<br />The hall is 43 feet.
3209167 3212477 He would have had to walk 12 feet,<br />open the bedroom door,
3212567 3216003 walk 43 feet down and open<br />the front door, all in 15 seconds.
3216087 3218078 - Could he have done it?<br />- Sure.
3218167 3221045 He walks slowly. He needed help<br />into the witness chair.
3221127 3226247 - You make it sound like a long walk.<br />- For an old man who had a stroke, it is.
3226327 3228795 - What are you doin'?<br />- I'm gonna try it.
3228887 3231765 What do you mean?<br />Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?
3231847 3235806 - Maybe he just didn't think of it.<br />- Do you think he's an idiot? It's obvious.
3235887 3238799 - Did you think of it?<br />- It don't matter. He didn't bring it up
3238887 3240798 because he knew it'd hurt his case.
3240887 3244766 Or because it would have meant bullying<br />and badgering a helpless old man.
3244847 3248044 That doesn't sit well with a jury.<br />Most lawyers avoid it.
3248127 3250687 - What kind of a bum is he?<br />- That's what I'm asking.
3250767 3253679 Pass me that chair.<br />Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
3253767 3256440 I just paced off 12 feet.<br />This is the bedroom door.
3256527 3259280 That's crazy.<br />You can't re-create a thing like that.
3259367 3264600 The hall was 43 feet.<br />I'll pace from that wall and back again.
3264687 3268077 This is insane. What are you<br />wasting everybody's time for?
3268167 3271318 According to you, it'll only take<br />15 seconds. We can spare that.
3274567 3276558 Come on. Knock it off.
3276647 3279445 OK. OK, OK, killer.
3280207 3282198 Yeah.
3283927 3288079 Will you stand there and mark the front<br />door? It was chain-locked, remember.
3288167 3290442 - Who's got a watch with a second hand?<br />- I have.
3290527 3294759 Stamp your foot. That'll be the body<br />falling. You can time me from there.
3294847 3298726 - What are we gonna do, play charades?<br />- What are we waiting for?
3298807 3301116 I wanna wait till<br />the second hand reaches 60.
3301207 3303198 Aw, come on!
3309207 3313359 Come on, speed it up.<br />He can walk twice as fast as that.
3313447 3317042 If you want me to walk<br />faster than that, I will.
3332047 3335119 - Lock. Door. Stop.<br />- Right.
3335207 3337118 What's the time?
3337207 3340279 Exactly... 41 seconds.
3340367 3344679 This is what I think happened. The old<br />man heard the fight a few hours earlier.
3344767 3347327 When he's in bed,<br />he heard the body hit the floor,
3347407 3350797 heard the woman scream, got to<br />his front door as fast as he could,
3350887 3353355 heard somebody running<br />and assumed it was the boy.
3353447 3356439 - I think that's possible.<br />- Assumed?
3357847 3360680 Brother, I've seen all kinds<br />of dishonesty in my day,
3360767 3363600 but this little display takes the cake.
3363687 3368397 You all come in here with your hearts<br />bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.
3368487 3372605 You listen to some fairy tales. You start<br />getting through to these old ladies.
3372687 3375440 You're not getting through to me.<br />I've had enough.
3375527 3379566 What's the matter with you guys?<br />You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!
3379647 3382923 - He'll slip through our fingers.<br />- Slip through our fingers?
3383007 3386761 - Are you his executioner?<br />- I'm one of 'em.
3386847 3390635 - Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.<br />- For this kid, you bet I would.
3390727 3394436 I feel sorry for you. What it must<br />feel like to wanna pull the switch!
3394527 3398361 Ever since you walked in, you've acted<br />like a self-appointed public avenger.
3398447 3402326 You want to see this boy die because<br />you want it, not because of the facts.
3402407 3404841 - You're a sadist.<br />- You...
3404927 3408522 Let me go! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
3408607 3411758 You don't really mean<br />you'll kill me, do you?
3417927 3421556 - Anything wrong? I heard some noise.<br />- No, everything's all right.
3421647 3424286 We're just... Friendly little argument.
3424367 3429361 We're through with that diagram.<br />You can take it if you want. Here you are.
3435687 3438076 What are you lookin' at?
3457527 3460280 - Somebody has to start off again.<br />- I beg pardon...
3460367 3463165 "I beg pardon."<br />What are you so polite about?
3463247 3468196 For the same reason you're not.<br />It's the way I was brought up.
3469167 3472955 This fighting... That's not<br />why we are here, to fight.
3473047 3475436 We have a responsibility.
3476527 3480759 This, I have always thought,<br />is a remarkable thing about democracy.
3480847 3483042 That we are...
3484407 3486398 What is the word?
3486487 3490639 Notified. That we are notified by mail<br />to come down to this place
3490727 3497724 to decide on the guilt or innocence of a<br />man we... we have never heard of before.
3497807 3502801 We have nothing to gain or lose<br />by... by our verdict.
3502887 3506926 This is one of the reasons<br />why we are strong.
3507007 3510795 We should not make it a... personal thing.
3514207 3517677 If nobody else has an idea,<br />I might have a cutie here.
3517767 3520201 Let's throw it out<br />and see if the cat licks it up.
3520287 3522642 - The cat licks it up?<br />- Yeah. The boy...
3527087 3532286 Look how dark it's gettin' out there.<br />I bet we're gonna have a storm now.
3533287 3536438 Boy, oh boy. It's really hot, huh?
3537127 3542155 - Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat?<br />- No, I don't.
3543447 3546598 Listen. I... I was wonderin' if...
3547967 3550720 Maybe... maybe we should<br />take another vote.
3550807 3555881 Great. Maybe we can follow this one up<br />with a little dancing and refreshments!
3555967 3558959 - Mr Foreman?<br />- Well, that's OK with me.
3559047 3562642 Anyone doesn't wanna vote?<br />Hey, come on.
3563487 3566320 - Sorry.<br />- I think we ought to have an open ballot.
3566407 3569558 Call out our votes, you know?<br />Let's see who stands where.
3569647 3573037 Well, that sounds fair to me.<br />Anyone object?
3574767 3578157 OK. I'll call off your jury numbers. One?
3578247 3581364 Oh, that's me. I vote guilty. Two?
3582807 3584638 Not guilty.
3584727 3586399 Number three?
3586487 3588318 Guilty.
3588407 3590398 Number four?
3591567 3593159 Guilty.
3593247 3594726 Number five?
3594807 3596798 Not guilty.
3596887 3598923 Number six?
3599007 3600884 Not guilty.
3600967 3602605 Number seven?
3602687 3604405 Guilty.
3604487 3606284 Number eight?
3606367 3608358 Not guilty.
3609447 3612280 - Number nine?<br />- Not guilty.
3612367 3615200 - Number ten?<br />- Guilty.
3616047 3617958 Number eleven?
3618047 3619799 Not guilty.
3619887 3621878 Number twelve?
3622247 3624397 Number twelve!
3624487 3626682 Guilty.
3631767 3634327 The vote is now six to six.
3634407 3637205 And we go into extra innings here, eh?
3638567 3643595 Six to six! I'm telling you, some of you<br />people in here must be out of your minds.
3643687 3645200 A kid like that!
3645287 3648597 I don't think the kind of boy he is<br />has anything to do with it.
3648687 3651326 - Facts determine the case.<br />- Don't give me that!
3651407 3654479 I'm sick and tired of facts.<br />You can twist 'em any way you like.
3654567 3657718 That's exactly the point<br />this gentleman has been making.
3657807 3660480 You keep shouting<br />at the top of your lungs...
3661727 3665686 I'd like to be a few years younger.<br />That man gets on my...
3668927 3671316 - My, it's hot in here.<br />- Want a drink of water?
3671407 3673398 No, no. Thanks. Thanks.
3682607 3686919 - It's gonna rain.<br />- Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
3687887 3692244 - How come you changed your vote?<br />- It just seemed there was room for doubt.
3692327 3695239 - You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br />- I don't feel that way.
3695327 3698399 - A lot of details never came out.<br />- Yeah, well, good luck.
3698487 3704005 Come on. You're like everybody else.<br />You think too much, you get mixed up.
3704087 3707921 - You know what I mean?<br />- I don't think you have any right to...
3708007 3709998 Loudmouth.
3761087 3763999 Look at that come down, will ya?
3764567 3769004 You know, this reminds me<br />of a storm we had last...
3770327 3773797 Was it November?<br />I don't know. Something.
3773887 3777596 It was quite a storm we had.<br />It was right in the middle of a game.
3777687 3782522 We were behind-seven to six. We'd just<br />started to move the ball, made a tackle.
3782607 3787203 It was gonna cut right in, slash through,<br />slashed right in, cut right through...
3787287 3789278 And...
3789767 3792156 We had this kid - Slattery.
3793167 3795556 He was an ox. A real ox.
3796367 3798676 I wish I had another one just like him.
3798767 3803045 I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head<br />coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.
3803127 3805277 That's out in Queens.
3805367 3809838 And anyway... we're starting<br />to move along real nice.
3809927 3814443 You know, their whole line is just...<br />just comin' apart.
3814527 3817997 And it starts to come down,<br />cats and dogs, just like this.
3818087 3821716 Just... whoosh! You know, right down.
3821807 3825117 Well, it was murder, you know?
3825207 3830201 I swear, I... I nearly bawled.<br />Just... We couldn't go nowhere.
3847527 3850963 Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br />How come...
3860407 3863205 Must have been<br />on the same switch with the lights.
3863287 3866165 Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?
3866847 3868838 Yeah.
3872887 3874878 Boy, that's better.
3881287 3883676 Hey! Two points.
3888327 3891046 You guys ever go to the Garden?
3892407 3895160 That's a damn stupid thing to do.
3895247 3897238 Oh, I'm sorry. I...
3898327 3900318 You know?
3901367 3903642 Pardon me.
3903727 3908357 Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.<br />Pretty surprising, isn't it?
3908447 3910438 Yes.
3911607 3916442 That... business before, when that tall guy,<br />whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?
3916527 3920202 That doesn't prove anything.<br />I'm a... pretty excitable person.
3920287 3923916 Where does he come off<br />calling me a public avenger, a sadist?
3924007 3927522 Anyone in his right mind<br />would blow his stack.
3927607 3929757 He was just tryin' to bait me.
3929847 3932236 He did an excellent job.
3934207 3936243 I think we're going nowhere here.
3936327 3938795 I'm ready to walk into court<br />and declare a hung jury.
3938887 3942004 - There's no point in this thing going on.<br />- I go for that, too.
3942087 3944681 Let the kid take his chance<br />with 12 other guys.
3944767 3947884 The judge won't accept a hung jury.<br />We haven't been here long.
3947967 3950879 - Well, let's find out.<br />- I am not in favour of that.
3950967 3954357 This kid wouldn't stand a chance<br />with another jury, and you know it.
3954447 3957245 Come on, we're hung.<br />Nobody's gonna change his vote.
3957327 3960558 - Still no room for reasonable doubt?<br />- No.
3960647 3965641 Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand<br />the term "reasonable doubt".
3965727 3968719 What do you mean, I don't understand?
3968807 3972004 How do you like this guy?<br />I'm tellin' you, they're all alike.
3972087 3974726 They come over here<br />and before they can take a breath,
3974807 3977401 they're telling us how to run the show.
3977487 3980445 - Boy, the arrogance of this guy!<br />- All right.
3980527 3983599 Let's stop the arguing<br />for about two minutes in here.
3983687 3986121 Now, who's got<br />something constructive to say?
3986207 3989483 I'd like to go over something,<br />if you gentlemen don't mind.
3989567 3991922 An important point<br />for the prosecution was
3992007 3996876 the fact that after the boy claimed he was<br />at the movies when the killing took place,
3996967 4000880 he couldn't remember the names<br />of the movies or who starred in them.
4000967 4004755 - This gentleman has made that point.<br />- That's correct.
4004847 4009125 It's the only alibi the boy offered, and<br />he couldn't back it up with any details.
4009207 4012199 In the boy's place,<br />do you think you could remember details
4012287 4015643 after an upsetting experience<br />such as being slapped by your father?
4015727 4018878 I think so, if there were<br />any special details to remember.
4018967 4022164 The boy couldn't remember the movies<br />because he wasn't there.
4022247 4027002 According to the police testimony,<br />the boy was questioned in the kitchen,
4027087 4029885 while the body of his father<br />was lying in the bedroom.
4029967 4032322 Do you think<br />you could remember details?
4032407 4034443 - I do.<br />- Under great emotional stress?
4034527 4038520 - Under great emotional stress.<br />- He remembered them correctly in court.
4038607 4042122 Yes. His lawyer took great pains<br />to bring that out.
4042207 4046086 He had three months to the day of the trial<br />in which to memorise them.
4046167 4050524 It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out<br />what played on a particular night.
4050607 4054077 I'll take the testimony<br />from right after the murder,
4054167 4058319 when he couldn't remember a thing about<br />the movies, great emotional stress or not.
4058647 4061798 - I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br />- Go ahead.
4061887 4064959 - Where were you last night?<br />- I was home all night.
4065047 4067436 - How about the night before that?<br />- What is this?
4067527 4071236 It's all right. I left the office at 8.30<br />and went straight home and to bed.
4071327 4075445 - And the night before that?<br />- That was... Tuesday night.
4075527 4078360 - The bridge tournament. I played bridge.<br />- Monday night?
4078447 4081757 When you get to<br />New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.
4083527 4089636 Monday night? Monday night...<br />my wife and I went to the movies.
4089727 4092560 - What did you see?<br />- The Scar/et Circ/e. A whodunit.
4092647 4095400 - What was the second feature?<br />- The...
4097167 4099761 I'll tell you in a minute. The...
4099847 4101838 Remarkab/e Mrs...
4103167 4105158 Something.
4106327 4108795 Mrs Bainbridge.<br />The Remarkab/e Mrs Bainbridge.
4108887 4112482 I saw that. It's called<br />The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.
4112567 4115035 Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.
4115127 4117561 Who was in<br />The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?
4117647 4121322 Barbara... Long, I think it was.
4121407 4123682 A dark, very pretty girl.
4124567 4127798 - Ling or... Long. Something like that.<br />- Who else?
4127887 4129957 I'd never heard of them before.
4130047 4134484 It was a very inexpensive<br />second feature, with unknown...
4134567 4138560 And you weren't under<br />an emotional stress, were you?
4140207 4142198 No.
4142287 4144278 I wasn't.
4145767 4148645 - I think the point is made.<br />- Big point.
4150247 4154001 You can talk till your tongue is<br />draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.
4154087 4156237 Know what I mean, my friend?
4156327 4160320 - You got those cough drops?<br />- They're all gone, my friend.
4161567 4165446 Oh, boy. Look at that rain.<br />There goes your ball game.
4166047 4168277 It's only a shower.
4168367 4170961 Besides, they got the infield covered.
4171047 4174403 Say, could I see that knife<br />a second, please?
4176127 4180564 Well, we're still tied up six to six.<br />Who's got a suggestion?
4180647 4184640 - It's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner.<br />- Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?
4184727 4185557 OK with me.
4187047 4190483 There's something I'd like to say.<br />It's been bothering me a little,
4190567 4192762 and as long as we're stuck...
4192847 4196556 There was this whole business about<br />the stab wound and how it was made.
4196647 4200037 - The downward angle of it, you know?<br />- Don't start with that again.
4200127 4203881 - They've been over it and over it.<br />- I know, but I don't go along with it.
4203967 4207880 The boy was five feet seven inches tall.<br />His father was six two.
4207967 4210197 That's a difference of seven inches.
4210287 4214405 It's very awkward to stab down into the<br />chest of someone over half a foot taller.
4214487 4216842 Give me that.
4216927 4220522 I'll give you a demonstration.<br />Somebody get up.
4227327 4229602 Watch this - I don't wanna<br />have to do it again.
4229687 4232440 I'll make myself about<br />six or seven inches shorter.
4232527 4236042 - That's about right. Maybe a little more.<br />- OK, a little more.
4247087 4249476 Now... nobody's hurt.
4250327 4252716 - Right?<br />- Right. Nobody hurt.
4256527 4261317 Now, this is the way I'd stab a man<br />who was... taller than I was.
4261407 4263796 Look at the angle. Down and in.
4263887 4267482 And this is the way it was done.<br />Now tell me I'm wrong.
4270167 4273284 - Down and in. There's no argument.<br />- Hold on a minute.
4273367 4275358 Will you give me that?
4276047 4278038 Boy, I hate these things.
4278127 4281164 - Did you ever see a knife fight?<br />- No.
4281247 4284159 Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
4284247 4289162 Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop,<br />the lot across the street, back yard.
4289247 4291522 Switchblades came<br />with the neighbourhood.
4291607 4294565 Funny I never thought of it before.<br />I guess you try to forget.
4294647 4299596 - How do you use a switchblade?<br />- Well, you'd never use it like this.
4299687 4302997 See, you'd lose too much time<br />switching hands.
4303647 4306036 Here's how. Underhand.
4308567 4311604 Anyone who's ever used one<br />wouldn't handle it any other way.
4311687 4313996 - Are you sure?<br />- I'm sure.
4314087 4318558 - It's why they're made to open like that.<br />- The boy was pretty handy with a knife?
4318647 4321605 You think he could have made<br />the wound that killed his father?
4321687 4325566 No. Not with the experience he got<br />all his life handling these things.
4325647 4328684 - I feel he'd have gone for him underhand.<br />- How do you know?
4328767 4332555 - Were you there when he was killed?<br />- No. Neither was anybody else.
4332647 4335764 What are you giving us this<br />mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
4335847 4338964 I don't think you can tell<br />what wound he might have made
4339047 4341402 simply because he knew<br />how to handle a knife.
4341487 4344479 - What do you think?<br />- I don't know.
4344567 4347843 - What do you mean, you don't know?<br />- I don't know.
4351847 4354600 - How about you?<br />- I don't know about the rest of 'em,
4354687 4358600 but I'm gettin' tired of this<br />yakety-yakkin'. It's gettin' us nowhere.
4358687 4363363 So I guess /'// have to break it up.<br />I'm changin' my vote to not guilty.
4363447 4366359 - You're what?<br />- You heard me. I've had enough.
4366447 4371601 - You've had enough? That's no answer.<br />- Listen, you just take care of yourself.
4371687 4374042 - You know?<br />- He's right.
4374407 4376762 That's not an answer.
4376847 4379645 What kind of a man are you?
4379727 4382764 You have sat here and voted<br />guilty with everyone else
4382847 4386965 because there are some baseball tickets<br />burning a hole in your pocket.
4387047 4391757 Now you have changed your vote because<br />you say you're sick of all the talking?
4391847 4395476 - Now, listen, buddy...<br />- Who tells you that you have the right
4395567 4398445 to play like this with a man's life?<br />Don't you care...
4398527 4401678 Now, wait a minute.<br />You can't talk like that to me.
4401767 4406079 I can talk like that to you.<br />If you want to vote not guilty,
4406167 4410445 do it because you are convinced he is not<br />guilty, not because you've had enough.
4410527 4413200 And if you think he is guilty,<br />then vote that way.
4413287 4416085 Or don't you have the guts<br />to do what you think is right?
4416167 4419000 - Now, listen...<br />- Guilty or not guilty?
4419087 4422557 - I told you. Not guilty.<br />- Why?
4424367 4428918 - Look, I don't have to...<br />- You do have to. Say it. Why?
4429007 4431237 I... I don't think he's guilty.
4440327 4444366 - I want another vote.<br />- OK, that's another vote called for.
4444447 4447359 I guess the quickest way<br />is a show of hands. Anyone object?
4447447 4450166 OK, all those voting not guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4450527 4452563 One, two, three,
4452967 4455959 four, five, six, seven...
4458487 4460478 eight.
4465167 4467158 Nine.
4468767 4471884 All those voting guilty, raise your hands.
4471967 4474162 One, two, three.
4474247 4477557 Well, the vote's nine to three<br />in favour of acquittal.
4477727 4479445 I don't understand you people!
4479527 4483361 All these picky little points you keep<br />bringing up, they don't mean nothing!
4483447 4485085 You saw this kid just like I did.
4485167 4488523 Don't tell me you believe that<br />phoney story about losing the knife
4488607 4490598 and about being at the movies.
4490687 4493599 Look, you know how these people lie.<br />It's born in them.
4493687 4497566 What the heck? I don't have to tell you.<br />They don't know what the truth is!
4497647 4501117 And they don't need any real big reason<br />to kill someone, either.
4501207 4505917 No, sir. They get drunk.<br />They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
4506007 4508965 You know that. And bang!<br />Someone's lying in the gutter.
4509047 4512005 Nobody's blaming 'em.<br />That's the way they are by nature.
4512087 4515443 You know what I mean? Violent.<br />Where are you going?
4515527 4519520 Human life don't mean<br />as much to them as it does to us.
4519607 4522121 They're lushing it up<br />and fighting all the time,
4522207 4525722 and if somebody gets killed,<br />somebody gets killed! They don't care!
4525807 4529686 Sure, there's some good things about 'em,<br />too. I'm the first one to say that.
4529767 4533203 I've known a couple who were OK,<br />but that's the exception.
4533287 4536802 Most of 'em, it's like they have<br />no feelings! They can do anything!
4536887 4538878 What's going on here?
4539567 4543446 I'm trying to tell you.<br />You're making a big mistake, you people.
4543527 4547122 This kid is a liar. I know it.<br />I know all about them.
4548047 4550038 Listen to me. They're no good.
4550127 4552721 There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
4554407 4556796 I mean, what's happening in here?
4556887 4559355 I speak my piece, and you...
4560127 4562118 Listen to me.
4562847 4565236 I... We're... we're...
4565327 4569718 This kid on trial here. His type.<br />Well, don't you know about them?
4570527 4572916 There's a... There's a danger here.
4573927 4575997 These people are dangerous.
4576087 4578282 They're... wild.
4579167 4581556 Listen to me. Listen to me.
4582127 4585961 I have. Now, sit down<br />and don't open your mouth again.
4589727 4592446 Some of the time... I tell you.
4627367 4632646 It's always difficult to keep personal<br />prejudice out of a thing like this.
4632727 4638006 Wherever you run into it,<br />prejudice always obscures the truth.
4638087 4640362 I don't really know what the truth is.
4640447 4644486 I don't suppose anybody<br />will ever really know.
4644567 4648196 Nine of us now seem to feel<br />that the defendant is innocent.
4648287 4653202 But we're just gambling on<br />probabilities. We may be wrong.
4653287 4658998 We may be trying to let a guilty man<br />go free. I don't know. Nobody really can.
4659087 4661282 But we have a reasonable doubt.
4661367 4664962 And that's something<br />that's very valuable in our system.
4665047 4669484 No jury can declare a man guilty<br />unless it's sure.
4670567 4675721 We nine can't understand<br />how you three are still so sure.
4676687 4679076 - Maybe you can tell us.<br />- I'll try.
4679887 4683402 You've made some excellent points,<br />but I still believe the boy is guilty.
4683487 4687765 I have two reasons. One: The evidence<br />given by the woman across the street,
4687847 4690566 who actually saw the murder committed.
4690647 4693241 That's the most important testimony.
4693327 4695841 And two: The fact that<br />she described the stabbing
4695927 4698919 by saying she saw the boy<br />raise his arm over his head
4699007 4701805 and stab down into the father's chest.
4701887 4705721 - She saw him do it, the wrong way.<br />- That's absolutely right.
4706167 4708476 Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
4708567 4711604 She said she went to bed<br />about eleven o'clock that night.
4711687 4714884 Her bed was next to the window,<br />and she could look out
4714967 4718926 and see directly into<br />the boy's room across the street.
4719007 4721441 She tossed and turned for over an hour.
4721527 4725520 Finally, she turned toward the window<br />at about 10 minutes after 12,
4725607 4730727 and as she looked out, she saw the killing<br />through the windows of a passing el train.
4730807 4733116 She said the lights went out<br />after the killing,
4733207 4738759 but that she got a good look at the boy<br />in the act of stabbing his father.
4738847 4743204 As far as I can see it,<br />this is unshakeable testimony.
4743287 4746677 - Well, that's the whole case.<br />- What do you think?
4751167 4753158 How about you?
4754407 4760437 I don't know. So much evidence to sift.<br />This is a pretty complicated business.
4760527 4764315 Frankly, I don't see how<br />you can vote for acquittal.
4764407 4768400 - It's not so easy to arrange the evidence.<br />- Throw out all the other evidence!
4768487 4771957 The woman saw him do it!<br />What else do you want?
4772047 4774117 - Well, maybe...<br />- Let's vote on it.
4774207 4777916 OK, there's another vote called for.<br />Anyone object?
4778007 4780157 All right. I'm changing my vote.
4780247 4783319 - He's guilty.<br />- Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.
4783407 4786797 Why is this such a personal triumph<br />for you, this one vote?
4786887 4790197 OK. I say we're a hung jury.<br />I say we take it in to the judge.
4790287 4793085 How about it? I wanna hear arguments.
4793167 4796762 You, you're the leader of the cause.<br />What about it?
4797607 4801236 - Let's go over it again.<br />- We've been over it again.
4801327 4805923 The boy in the grey flannel suit is<br />bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.
4806007 4811240 There's no point in getting nasty.<br />You keep trying to turn this into a contest.
4811847 4812882 OK.
4812967 4815925 Maybe we can talk about<br />setting some kind of time limit.
4816007 4818805 Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?
4818887 4824484 It's... a quarter after six. Someone<br />before mentioned seven o'clock.
4824567 4830039 That's a point at which we might begin to<br />discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.
4830127 4834803 - Don't you feel well?<br />- I feel perfectly well, thank you.
4834887 4837720 I was saying seven o'clock<br />would be a reasonable time...
4837807 4841880 The reason I asked that was because<br />you were rubbing your nose like...
4841967 4844527 Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting.
4844607 4847883 But you made a gesture<br />that reminded me of something.
4847967 4852677 - I'm trying to settle something here.<br />- Well, I think this is important.
4852887 4857085 Thank you. Now, then.<br />I'm sure you'll pardon me for this,
4857167 4860079 but I was wondering why<br />you rub your nose like that.
4860167 4861395 Come on, will you?
4861487 4865765 At this point I happen to be talking<br />to the gentleman sitting next to you.
4865847 4869123 Now, why were you<br />rubbing your nose like that?
4869207 4872961 If it's any of your business, I was<br />rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
4873047 4876881 Oh, I'm sorry. Is it...<br />Is it because of your eyeglasses?
4876967 4880357 It is. Now could we get on<br />to something else?
4880447 4884804 Your eyeglasses made those two deep<br />impressions on the sides of your nose.
4884887 4888323 I hadn't noticed that before.<br />That must be annoying.
4888407 4890398 It is very annoying.
4890487 4895686 I wouldn't know about that.<br />I've never worn eyeglasses. 20/20.
4895767 4899806 Listen, will you come on already<br />with the optometrist bit?
4899887 4903402 The woman who testified<br />that she saw the killing
4903487 4907526 had those same marks<br />on the sides of her nose.
4907607 4909598 Holy smoke! He's right.
4909687 4915159 Please. Just give me a minute...<br />and I'll be finished.
4915247 4918080 I don't know if anyone else<br />noticed that about her.
4918167 4924800 I didn't think of it then, but I've been<br />going over her face... in my mind.
4924887 4928960 She had those same marks.<br />She kept rubbing them in court.
4929367 4932643 He's right. She did do that a lot.
4932727 4936356 This woman was about 45 years old.
4937327 4941161 She was making<br />a tremendous effort to look 35.
4941247 4946560 For her first public appearance.<br />Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.
4946647 4950322 Brand-new clothes that should have<br />been worn by a younger woman.
4950407 4956118 No glasses. Well, women do that.<br />See if you can get a mental picture of her.
4956207 4959597 What do you mean, no glasses? How do<br />you know whether she wore glasses?
4959687 4962918 - Just cos she was rubbin' her nose?<br />- She had those marks. I saw 'em.
4963007 4966238 - So? What do you think that means?<br />- I'm sick of your yellin'...
4966327 4967760 Come on. Forget it.
4967847 4972238 Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw<br />them too. I was the closest one to her.
4972327 4975285 She had these things<br />on the side of her nose.
4975567 4977205 What point are you makin'?
4977287 4980757 She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br />What does that mean?
4980847 4985238 Could those marks be made<br />by anything other than eyeglasses?
4988527 4990563 No. They couldn't.
4990647 4993036 I didn't see any marks!
4994447 4998406 I did. Strange,<br />but I didn't think about it before.
4998487 5000637 Why didn't the lawyer say something?
5000727 5003560 There are twelve people in here<br />concentrating on this case.
5003647 5007196 - Eleven of us didn't think of it either.<br />- What about the district attorney?
5007287 5010677 You think he'd pull that?<br />Have her testify without her glasses?
5010767 5014840 Ever see a woman who didn't want to<br />wear them because they spoil her looks?
5014927 5019523 OK. She had marks on her nose.<br />I'm givin' you that.
5019607 5022804 From glasses, right? She didn't<br />wanna wear 'em out of the house
5022887 5025799 so people'd think she's gorgeous.
5025887 5030039 But when she saw this kid killin'<br />his father, she was in the house alone.
5030127 5032118 That's all.
5032247 5034602 Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
5034687 5036678 No. I don't.
5037687 5039643 No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
5039727 5044118 It's logical to assume<br />that she wasn't wearing them in bed.
5044207 5046562 - How do you know?<br />- I don't know. I'm guessing.
5046647 5051118 I'm also guessing that she didn't put them<br />on when she looked out of the window.
5051207 5054199 She testified the killing<br />took place just as she looked out.
5054287 5057165 The lights went off.<br />She didn't have time to put them on.
5057247 5060956 Here's another guess. She honestly<br />thought she saw the boy kill his father.
5061047 5064403 - I say she only saw a blur.<br />- How do you know what she saw?
5064487 5067843 How does he know all that? How<br />do you know what glasses she wore?
5067927 5071681 Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe<br />she was far-sighted! What do you know?
5071767 5074645 I only know the woman's eyesight<br />is in question now.
5074727 5080518 She had to be able to identify a person<br />60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
5080607 5083485 You can't send someone off<br />to die on evidence like that.
5083567 5085000 Aw, don't give me that.
5085087 5087965 - Might she not have made a mistake?<br />- No.
5088167 5091079 - It's not possible?<br />- No, it's not possible.
5094207 5096198 Is it possible?
5097047 5099038 Not guilty.
5102607 5105121 Do you think he's guilty?
5105207 5107402 I think he's guilty.
5109807 5111798 Do you?
5113967 5115400 No.
5115487 5118399 I'm convinced. Not guilty.
5118487 5122275 - What's the matter with you?<br />- I have a reasonable doubt now.
5122367 5125325 - It's eleven to one.<br />- What about all the other evidence?
5125407 5128843 What about all that stuff? The...<br />The knife? The whole business?
5128927 5132840 Well, you said we could<br />throw out all the other evidence.
5137247 5139636 Well, what do we do now?
5142367 5144164 You're alone.
5144247 5148365 I don't care whether I'm alone or not.<br />It's my right.
5150607 5152518 It's your right.
5161607 5164440 Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.
5165247 5169286 - We want to hear your arguments.<br />- I gave you my arguments.
5169687 5173282 We're not convinced.<br />We want to hear them again.
5174367 5177040 We have as much time as it takes.
5181807 5187882 Everything-every single thing that took<br />place in that courtroom says he's guilty.
5187967 5190959 What do you think?<br />I'm an idiot or somethin'?
5191967 5197439 Take that stuff about the old man,<br />who lived there and heard everything!
5198647 5202162 Or this business about the knife.<br />They found another one exactly like it?
5202247 5205603 The old man saw him!<br />Right there, on the stairs.
5205687 5209157 What's the difference<br />how many seconds it was?
5209647 5215643 Every single thing. The knife<br />fallin' through a hole in his pocket.
5215727 5219242 You can't prove he didn't get to the door!
5219327 5223878 Sure, you can take all the time, hobble<br />around the room, but you can't prove it!
5226327 5229239 And what about this business of the el?<br />And the movies?
5229327 5232478 There's a phoney deal if I ever heard one.
5232567 5236401 I'll bet you $5,000<br />/'d remember the movies I saw.
5236487 5242437 I'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on<br />has been twisted and turned!
5242527 5246076 This business with the glasses?<br />How do you know she didn't have 'em on?
5246167 5249398 This woman testified in open court!
5250127 5253836 And what about<br />hearin' the kid yell? Huh?
5253927 5257920 I'm tellin' ya, I've got all the facts here.
5258327 5260318 Here...
5262287 5265484 Well, that's it. That's the whole case.
5271687 5273678 Well?
5275367 5277358 Say something!
5282167 5285398 You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.
5286167 5291195 You're not gonna intimidate me.<br />I'm entitled to my opinion.
5293647 5297242 Rotten kids... You work your life out!
5308647 5310638 No...
5314047 5316038 Not guilty.
5319127 5321118 Not guilty.
5335927 5337918 We're ready now.
5446207 5448198 Hey!
5452247 5455125 - What's your name?<br />- Davis.
5455207 5457198 My name's McCardle.
5459407 5462001 - Well, so long.<br />- So long.
