76452 78661 Thank you very much, sir.
78746 80913 You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
80998 83374 Shh. Shh.
83459 84876 We did it, Pete. We did it.
86962 88731 For a moment, we had our doubts.<br />Shh.
88756 92175 To continue, you've listened<br />to a long and complex case...
92259 94051 murder in the first degree.
94136 99098 A premeditated murder is the most serious<br />charge tried in our criminal courts.
99183 100933 You've listened to the testimony.
101018 103938 You've had the law read to you<br />and interpreted as it applies in this case.
104021 108024 It's now your duty to sit down and try<br />and separate the facts from the fancy.
108942 112487 One man is dead.<br />Another man's life is at stake.
113280 117283 If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds<br />as to the guilt of the accused...
117367 119285 a reasonable doubt...
119369 122163 then you must bring me<br />a verdict of not guilty.
122247 124123 Now if, however,<br />there's no reasonable doubt...
124208 128085 then you must in good conscience<br />find the accused guilty.
129213 133341 However you decide,<br />your verdict must be unanimous.
133425 136803 In the event<br />that you find the accused guilty...
136887 140223 the bench will not entertain<br />a recommendation for mercy.
140307 143518 The death sentence<br />is mandatory in this case.
143602 147313 You're faced with a grave responsibility.<br />Thank you, gentlemen.
149316 151359 The alternate jurors are excused.
157366 159367 The jury will now retire.
277361 279441 Try this one. See if I can get it...
280697 282448 It's a muggy day.
285702 288079 Hey. Oh, oh.
300133 302218 Piece of gum?<br />No, thanks.
302302 304387 This thing is...
304471 306097 Huh?<br />move it.
307724 309952 Come on, I'll give you a hand.<br />Give me a hand with that.
309977 311310 That's it.
316942 318567 You know something?<br />Yeah?
318652 320403 I called the weather bureau this morning.
320487 322405 This is gonna be<br />the hottest day of the year.
322489 324073 Could be.
324157 326134 Boy, you'd think they'd at least<br />air-condition these places.
326159 329495 What is your name, sir?<br />Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.
329579 330997 Thank you very much.
331081 333833 Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.
333917 336752 Now, if there's anything you want,<br />I'll be right outside the door.
336837 339088 Just knock.<br />Okay, thanks. We will.
351601 352810 Good morning.
352894 354353 I never knew they locked the door.
354438 356605 Sure they lock the door.<br />What'd you think?
357691 360109 I don't know.<br />It just never occurred to me.
361737 363529 What's that for?
363613 365489 Oh, I thought we might want<br />to vote by ballot.
365574 368242 Great idea. Maybe we can<br />get him elected senator.
370495 372246 Just in case, you know.
375751 377877 How'd you like it?<br />Oh, I don't know.
377961 379628 It was pretty interesting.
379713 381672 Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
381757 384341 I mean, I've never been<br />on a jury before.
384426 387136 No? I've sat on many juries.
388305 391223 What gets me is the way<br />those lawyers talk and talk and talk...
391308 393476 even when it's an open-and-shut case<br />like this one.
393560 395320 Did you ever hear<br />so much talk about nothin'?
395353 397229 Well, I guess they're entitled.
397314 399774 Yeah. They're entitled.<br />It's the system, but...
400984 405071 If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids<br />down before they start any trouble.
405155 407239 It would save us a lot of time and money.
407324 408925 Hey, let's get started, huh?<br />That's a good idea.
408950 411636 Yeah, let's get goin', huh?<br />We probably all got things to do here.
411661 414765 I figured we'd start out with a five-minute<br />break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.
414790 415748 Mr. Foreman.<br />Huh?
415832 418626 Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order?<br />Gee, I don't know.
418710 420461 I, uh - Well, I guess so.
425467 426926 Uh, you're in my seat.
427010 429011 Oh. Excuse me.<br />That's all right.
431556 433307 Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
436937 439396 What did you think of the case?
439481 441524 I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
441608 444735 No real... dead spots.<br />You know what I mean?
445612 448072 I tell you, we were lucky<br />to get a murder case.
448156 450116 I figured us for an assault or burglary.
450200 452451 Boy, they can be the dullest.
454037 455329 Hey.
455413 456997 That the Woolworth Building?
457082 458999 That's right.
459084 460668 Isn't that funny?
460752 463188 You know, I've lived here all my life.<br />I've never been inside that.
463213 465357 If you had to sort out all that junk...
465382 467466 Like that thing with the movies.
467551 470612 Yeah. You can say that again. And<br />what about that business with the knife?
470637 473514 I mean, asking grown-up people<br />to believe that kind of jazz, huh?
473598 476058 Well, I expected that.<br />You know what we're dealing with.
476143 478602 Yeah, I guess so.
478687 480396 Well, your horn works.<br />Now try your lights.
482065 483524 What do you got, a cold?<br />And how.
483608 485818 These hot-weather colds can kill you.
485902 488320 I can hardly touch my nose.<br />You know what I mean?
488405 491949 I sure do. I just got over one.
492033 494794 Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,<br />let's go here, huh?
494870 496495 Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.
496580 499415 Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance<br />to see a paper this morning.
499499 500583 Hmm?
500667 503085 I was only wondering<br />how the market closed.
503170 505880 You got a seat on the Exchange?
505964 507715 I'm a broker.
507799 512178 I run a messenger service.<br />the Beck and Call Company.
512262 514388 The name is my wife's idea.
514472 518100 Got 37 men working.<br />Started with nothing.
518185 521353 Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?
524524 526418 Yeah, we can all get outta here<br />pretty quick, huh?
526443 529713 I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen<br />to have tickets to that ball game tonight.
529738 531572 Yanks and Cleveland.
531656 533449 Yeah, we got this kid,<br />Modjelewski, in there.
533533 535201 Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.
535285 537411 You know - Phoom!
537495 539747 A real jug handle. You know?
539831 542082 Phoom!
542167 544501 You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?<br />Huh? Yeah.
544586 546045 Where do we sit here?
546129 549215 Well, I thought we'd sit in order,<br />you know, by jury numbers.
549299 551717 One, two, three, four, five.<br />so on, around the table.
551801 553111 If that's okay with you gentlemen.
553136 554279 Sure.<br />What's the difference?
554304 557348 I think it's reasonable to sit in order.<br />Let it be.
557432 559743 Number 12. Do I sit down here?<br />Yeah. That's 12. We go around...
559768 563020 We start with you. One, right?<br />One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.
563104 565439 What was your impression<br />of the prosecuting attorney?
565523 567233 Okay. Two. You're two.
567317 568484 I beg pardon?
568568 572738 I thought he was really sharp, the way<br />he handled all those points one by one.
572822 575950 Logical sequence.<br />I was very impressed.
576034 579036 I think he - he did an expert job.
579120 582122 A lot of drive too, you know?<br />Real drive.
582207 584291 Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?<br />Sure.
584376 585960 Uh, fellas.
586044 589505 Say, we'd like to get started.<br />Gentleman at the window.
591174 593342 We'd like to get started.<br />Oh, I'm sorry.
593426 597096 Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid<br />kills his father - bing, just like that.
597180 599824 Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,<br />you'll see it happens all the time.
599849 601767 They let those kids<br />run wild up there.
601851 604561 Well, maybe it serves 'em right.<br />You know what I mean?
604646 606230 Is - Is everyone here?
606314 608148 The old man is inside.
608233 610859 Oh. Would you, uh,<br />knock on the door for him?
610944 612903 You a Yankee fan?
612988 614530 No. Baltimore.
615448 616949 Baltimore?<br />Yeah.
618243 620786 That's like being hit in the head<br />with a crowbar once a day.
622539 623789 Who have they got?
623873 626292 No, I mean, who have they got<br />besides good groundskeepers?
626376 627978 Say, uh, we'd like to get started.
628003 631046 Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.<br />I - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
631840 633632 Baltimore?
633717 636510 Okay, gentlemen,<br />if I can have your attention.
636594 639555 You fellas can handle this thing<br />any way that you want to.
639639 642141 I'm, um - You know,<br />I'm not gonna make any rules.
642225 645519 Uh, we can, well, discuss it first<br />and, uh, then vote on it.
645603 648272 That's, of course, uh.<br />That's, uh, one way.
648356 651317 And, uh, well, we can<br />vote on it right now, and...
651401 653902 I think it's customary<br />to take a preliminary vote.
653987 657573 Yeah, let's - Let's vote. Who knows?<br />Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?
657657 659366 Uh-huh.
659451 662536 Okay, then I think that, uh...
662620 665497 Of course you know that we have<br />a first-degree murder charge here...
665582 667666 and if we vote the accused guilty...
667751 671003 uh, we've got to send him<br />to the chair.
671087 674840 Um, that's mandatory.<br />I think we know that.
674924 676675 Let's see who's where.<br />We might as well.
676760 680554 Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?<br />All right with me.
681765 686352 Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this<br />has to be 12 to nothing either way.
686436 687895 Um, that's the law.
687979 690022 Okay, are we ready?
690106 693108 Now, all those voting guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
697113 700616 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
701951 704536 eight, nine, 10, 11.
704621 707539 Okay. That's 11 guilty.
707624 709124 Those voting not guilty.
710293 712378 One. Right.
712462 714755 That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.
715673 717257 Well, now we know where we are.
717342 721512 Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
722055 724348 So, what do we do now?
724432 726266 Well, I guess we talk.
726351 727684 Boy, oh, boy.
727769 729603 You really think he's innocent?
733066 734608 I don't know.
734692 737569 I mean, you sat in court with the rest<br />of us. You heard what we did.
737654 739780 The kid's a dangerous killer.<br />You could see it.
739864 741490 He's 18 years old.
741574 743659 Well, that's old enough. He...
743743 746412 He stabbed his own father<br />four inches into the chest.
746496 748747 They proved it<br />a dozen different ways in court.
748832 751375 Would you like me to list them for you?
751459 752751 No.
752836 754920 Then what do you want?
755004 757923 I just want to talk.<br />What's there to talk about?
758007 759401 Eleven men in here think he's guilty.
759426 761677 No one had to think about it twice<br />except you.
761761 764972 I want to ask you something.<br />Do you believe his story?
765056 767766 I don't know whether I believe it or not.<br />Maybe I don't.
767851 769435 So how come you vote not guilty?
769519 771437 Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.
771521 774273 It's not easy to raise my hand<br />and send a boy off to die...
774357 776442 without talking about it first.
776526 778944 Well, now, who says it's easy?<br />No one.
780238 782406 What, just because I voted fast?
782490 784908 I honestly think the guy's guilty.
784993 787786 You couldn't change my mind<br />if you talked for a hundred years.
787871 789951 I'm not trying to change your mind.<br />It's just that...
790457 792708 We're talking about somebody's life here.
792792 794936 We can't decide it in five minutes.<br />Supposing we're wrong.
794961 796378 "Supposing we're wrong."
796463 798523 Supposing this whole building<br />should fall down on my head.
798548 800549 You can suppose anything.<br />That's right.
801384 803184 Look, what's the difference<br />how long it takes?
803219 805804 Suppose we do it in five minutes.<br />So what?
805889 808015 Let's take an hour.
808099 810017 The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.
812729 813896 Hmm?
816065 817900 Who's got something to say?
817984 819401 I'm willing to sit for an hour.
819486 822196 Great. I heard<br />a pretty good story last night.
822280 824364 That's not why we're sitting here.
825074 828619 All right, then you tell me.<br />What are we sitting here for?
829871 831705 I don't know. Maybe no reason.
832707 836168 Look, this kid's been kicked around<br />all of his life...
836252 840172 you know, born in a slum,<br />mother dead since he was nine.
840256 842525 He lived for a year and a half<br />in an orphanage when his...
842550 845469 his father was serving a jail term<br />for forgery.
845553 847888 It's not a very happy beginning.
847972 850098 He's a - a wild, angry kid.
850183 851903 That's all he's ever been.<br />And you know why?
851976 855687 'Cause he's been hit on the head<br />by somebody once a day every day.
855772 857981 He's had a.<br />He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.
858066 861026 I - I just think we owe him a few words.<br />That's all.
861110 864655 I don't mind telling you this, mister.<br />We don't owe him a thing.
864739 867824 He got a fair trial, didn't he?<br />What do you think that trial cost?
867909 870994 He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?<br />You know it.
871079 873413 Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.
873498 875374 We heard the facts, didn't we?
875458 879253 You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed<br />to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
879337 881713 Listen, I've lived among them<br />all my life.
881798 885133 You can't believe a word they say.<br />You know that.
885218 887052 I mean, they're born liars.
887136 890472 Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br />Now listen...
890557 893392 Do you think you were born<br />with a monopoly on the truth?
893476 896061 I think certain things should be<br />pointed out to this man.
896145 898289 Come on. This isn't Sunday.<br />We don't need a sermon.
898314 900595 Come on.<br />We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
901609 904653 Rice Pops.<br />It's a product I work on at the agency.
905488 908115 "The breakfast with the built-in bounce."
908199 909825 I wrote that line.<br />Very catchy.
909909 912077 Yeah.<br />Say, do you mind?
912161 913870 Oh, I'm sorry.
913955 916415 I have this habit of doodling.<br />Keeps me thinking clearly.
916499 918208 Yeah, we have all this work to do.
918293 920061 There's no point staying here forever.<br />Sorry.
920086 922296 Okay. Um...
922380 926174 perhaps if the gentleman down there<br />who's disagreeing with us...
926259 929553 Well, perhaps you could tell us why.<br />You know, let us know what you're thinking.
929637 932014 And we might be able to show you<br />where you're mixed up.
932098 933765 Well, look, maybe.<br />Maybe this is an idea.
933850 936268 Now, I haven't given it much thought,<br />but it seems to me...
936352 940772 that it's up to the group of us to convince<br />this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.
940857 943400 Now, maybe if we each took<br />a couple of minutes just to...
944819 946236 Well, it was just a quick idea.
946321 947779 No, no, no. That's a good one.
947864 950949 Uh, suppose we go<br />once around the table.
951034 953910 I guess you're first.<br />Oh.
953995 955329 Well, uh...
956873 959291 Well, it-it's hard to put into words.
960335 962336 I just think he's guilty.
962420 964921 I thought it was obvious<br />from the word "go."
965006 966506 I mean, nobody proved otherwise.
966591 968133 Nobody has to prove otherwise.
968217 970469 The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
970553 973013 The defendant doesn't even<br />have to open his mouth.
973097 976224 That's in the Constitution.<br />Oh, well, sure, I know that.
976309 978268 Uh, what I meant was, is...
980063 982064 Well, I just think he's guilty.
982148 983857 I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.
983941 988987 Okay. Uh, here's what I think,<br />and I have no personal feelings about this.
989072 991239 I just want to talk about facts.
992241 994368 Number one.
994911 999039 The old man lived downstairs under the room<br />where the killing took place.
999123 1001309 At 10 minutes after 12:00<br />on the night of the killing...
1001334 1005003 he heard loud noises,<br />said it sounded like a fight.
1005088 1007964 And he heard the kid yell out,<br />"I'm gonna kill ya."
1008049 1010342 A second later,<br />he heard a body hit the floor.
1010426 1012135 Ran to the door, opened it up...
1012220 1014638 saw the kid running down the stairs<br />and out of the house.
1014722 1016014 Called the police.
1016099 1018767 They came in, found the old man<br />with a knife in his chest.
1018851 1022104 The coroner fixed the time of death<br />around midnight.
1022188 1025273 Now these are facts.<br />You can't refute facts.
1025358 1027526 The kid is guilty.
1027610 1029611 I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
1029696 1033573 I know he's only 18, but he's still<br />gotta pay for what he did.
1033658 1035117 I'm with you.
1035201 1037744 Okay. Are you finished?
1037829 1039287 Yeah.<br />Right. Next.
1039372 1042582 It is obvious, to me anyway,<br />that the boy's entire story was flimsy.
1042667 1044936 He claimed he was at the movies<br />during the time of the killing...
1044961 1047563 and yet, one hour later, he couldn't<br />remember the names of the films he saw...
1047588 1049482 or who played in them.<br />That's right.
1049507 1051800 And no one saw him going in<br />or out of the theater.
1051884 1053569 Listen, what about the woman<br />across the street?
1053594 1055887 If her testimony don't prove it,<br />nothing does.
1055972 1058306 That's right. She was the one<br />who actually saw the killing.
1058391 1060809 Now, fellas, please.<br />Let's go in order here, huh?
1060893 1064146 Just a minute. Here's a woman.
1064230 1066690 Here's a woman who was lying in bed.<br />She can't sleep.
1066774 1068692 She's dying with the heat.<br />You know what I mean?
1068776 1070610 Anyway, she looks out the window...
1070695 1074281 and right across the street she sees<br />the kid stick the knife into his father.
1074365 1077242 The time is 12:10 on the nose.
1077326 1079202 Everything fits.
1079287 1081121 Look, she's known the kid all his life.
1081205 1083391 His window is right opposite hers<br />across the el tracks...
1083416 1085083 and she swore she saw him do it.
1085168 1087836 Through the windows<br />of the passing el train. Right.
1087920 1092090 This el train had no passengers on it.<br />It was just being moved downtown.
1092175 1095093 The lights were out, remember?<br />And they proved in court that, at night...
1095178 1097655 you can look through the windows<br />of an el train when the lights are out...
1097680 1100015 and see what's happening<br />on the other side.
1100099 1102934 They proved it.<br />I'd like to ask you something.
1103019 1105699 You don't believe the boy's story.<br />How come you believe the woman's?
1105772 1107522 She's one of them too, isn't she?
1110193 1112194 You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?
1112278 1113695 Okay, gentlemen.<br />Now, now.
1113780 1115989 Now, gentlemen.<br />Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
1116073 1118617 Oh, what's he so wise about?<br />I'm telling you.
1118701 1121953 Okay, now come on.<br />Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.
1122038 1123288 Whose turn is it next?
1123372 1126208 Oh, uh, his. Number five.
1128461 1131213 Okay, may I - Can I pass? It...
1132006 1134049 Well, uh, that's your privilege.
1134133 1137260 Uh, how about the next gentleman?
1137345 1140013 Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.
1140097 1144309 I started to be convinced, you know,<br />very early in the case.
1144894 1149022 You see, I was looking for a motive.<br />That's very important.
1149106 1153318 Because if you don't have a motive,<br />where's your case, right?
1153402 1156488 Anyway, that, uh, testimony<br />from those people...
1156572 1159616 in the apartment across the hall<br />from the kid's apartment...
1159700 1161952 that was very powerful.
1162036 1164830 Didn't they say something about a.<br />a fight and an argument...
1164914 1169334 between the old man and his son<br />around about, uh, 7:00 that night?
1169418 1171878 I mean, I could be wrong, but I.<br />It was 8:00.
1171963 1174005 It was 8:00. That's right.<br />They heard an argument.
1174090 1175841 They couldn't hear what it was about.
1175925 1177884 Then they heard<br />the father hit the boy twice.
1177969 1180929 Finally they saw the<br />boy run angrily out of the house.
1181013 1182597 What does that prove?
1182682 1186351 Well, it don't exactly prove anything.<br />It's just part of the picture.
1186435 1189413 Well, you said it provided a motive. The<br />prosecuting attorney said the same thing.
1189438 1191690 I don't think<br />that was a very strong motive.
1191774 1195360 This boy's been hit so many times in his life<br />that violence is practically a...
1195444 1197821 It's a normal state of affairs with him.
1197905 1202117 I just - I can't see two slaps in the face<br />provoking him into committing murder.
1202201 1205787 It may have been two too many.<br />Everyone has a breaking point.
1208332 1210417 Anything else?
1210501 1212961 No.<br />Okay.
1213045 1214796 Uh, how about you?
1216632 1218592 I don't know. It's all been said.
1220136 1222762 You can talk here forever.<br />It's still the same thing.
1223973 1226933 This kid is five for 0.
1227018 1228894 Well, look at his record.
1228978 1231187 When he was 10,<br />he was in children's court.
1231272 1233064 He threw a rock at a teacher.
1233149 1235442 When he was 15, he was in reform school.
1235526 1237360 He stole a car.
1237445 1239946 He's been arrested for mugging.
1240031 1242032 He was picked up twice for knife fighting.
1242116 1244200 Oh, yeah, they say<br />he's real handy with a knife.
1244285 1247078 Oh, this is a very fine boy.
1247163 1250165 Ever since he was five years old,<br />his father beat him up regularly.
1250249 1252667 He used his fists.<br />Well, so would I.
1252752 1254252 A kid like that?
1254337 1257505 It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.
1260009 1263178 When I was a kid,<br />I used to call my father "sir."
1263930 1265221 That's right. "Sir."
1265306 1267325 Do you ever hear a kid<br />call his father that anymore?
1267350 1269851 Fathers don't seem to think<br />it's important anymore.
1270645 1272687 You got any kids?<br />Three.
1274065 1275398 I got one.
1276901 1278652 Twenty-two years old.
1284784 1287535 When he was nine years old,<br />he ran away from a fight.
1289246 1292415 I saw it. I was so embarrassed<br />I almost threw up.
1294085 1298713 I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you<br />if I have to break you in two trying."
1301217 1303134 Well, I made a man out of him.
1304136 1306304 When he was 16, we had a fight.
1307890 1310266 Hit me in the jaw.<br />He was a big kid.
1313688 1315772 Haven't seen him for two years.
1317692 1319985 Kids.
1321696 1323655 Work your heart out.
1326242 1327492 Well, let's get going.
1327576 1329911 I think we're missing the point here.
1329996 1333415 This boy, let's say he's the product<br />of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.
1333499 1337085 We can't help that. We're here to decide<br />whether he's innocent or guilty...
1337169 1340088 not to go into the reasons<br />why he grew up the way he did.
1340172 1342882 He was born in a slum.<br />Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
1342967 1344843 I know it, and so do you.
1344927 1349639 It's no secret children from slum backgrounds<br />are potential menaces to society.
1349724 1351891 Now I think.<br />Brother, you can say that again.
1351976 1354519 The kids who crawl out of these places<br />are real trash.
1354603 1356914 I don't want any part of them. I'm<br />telling you. Listen, mister. Listen.
1356939 1360650 I, uh - I've lived in a slum all my life.<br />Wait a minute.
1360735 1364154 Please, I - I played in backyards<br />that were filled with garbage.
1364238 1366281 I mean, maybe you can still<br />smell it on me.
1366365 1367699 Now, listen, sonny.
1367783 1369427 Come on now.<br />There's nothing personal about this.
1369452 1372054 No, there was something personal.<br />Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
1372079 1374164 Let's not be so sensitive.
1374248 1376082 This sensitivity I can understand.
1376167 1380795 Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.<br />We're only wasting time, and...
1381964 1384090 Look, your turn down there.<br />Let's go.
1385426 1388320 Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br />you were all gonna try to convince me.
1388345 1390156 Wasn't that the idea?<br />Check. That was the idea.
1390181 1392450 Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.<br />What difference does it make?
1392475 1394869 He's the one who's keeping us in here.<br />Let's hear what he's got to say.
1394894 1397604 Oh, now wait a minute.<br />We decided to do this a certain way.
1397688 1399314 I think we ought to stick to that way.
1399398 1401399 Oh, stop being a kid, will you?
1401484 1403544 What do you mean "a kid"?<br />What do you think I mean?
1403569 1405195 K-I-D. Kid.
1407782 1411451 What? Listen, just because I'm trying<br />to keep this thing organized?
1411535 1413661 Here, you take it.<br />You take on the responsibility.
1413746 1415626 I'll just - I'll keep my mouth shut.<br />That's all.
1415706 1417767 What are you getting so hot about?<br />Calm down, will you?
1417792 1419125 Don't tell me to calm down.
1419210 1421395 Here. You wanna take the chair,<br />just take the chair. That's all.
1421420 1423939 Did you ever see such a thing?<br />See if you can keep it running.
1423964 1425983 Listen, you think it's funny or something?<br />Hey, forget it, fella.
1426008 1427592 The whole thing's unimportant.<br />Come on.
1427676 1430804 Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.<br />No, nobody wants to change.
1430888 1432639 You're doing a beautiful job.<br />Sit down.
1432723 1435558 Yeah, you're doing great.<br />Just great, fella.
1435643 1437519 You stay in there and pitch. You know?
1438479 1440688 All right. Let's hear from somebody.
1442191 1446277 Well, if you want me to tell you how I feel<br />about it, it's all right with me.
1446362 1448488 Boy, I don't care what you do.
1448572 1451449 All right, I don't have anything brilliant.
1451534 1453660 I only know as much as you do.
1453744 1457497 According to the testimony,<br />the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
1457581 1461751 I sat there in court for six days<br />listening while the evidence built up.
1462378 1464087 Everybody sounded so positive, you know?
1464171 1466631 I-I began to get a peculiar feeling<br />about this trial.
1466715 1468800 I mean, nothing is that positive.
1468884 1471010 There are a lot of questions<br />I'd have liked to ask.
1471095 1473805 I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't<br />have meant anything, but...
1473889 1475908 I began to get the feeling<br />that the defense counsel...
1475933 1478434 wasn't conducting a thorough-enough<br />cross-examination.
1478519 1481896 I mean, he - he let too many things go by,<br />little things that...
1481981 1484732 What little things? Listen,<br />when these fellas don't ask questions...
1484817 1487378 it's because they know the answers already<br />and they figure they'll be hurt.
1487403 1491322 Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer<br />to be just plain stupid, isn't it?
1491407 1492699 I mean it's possible.
1492783 1494583 You sound like you met<br />my brother-in-law once.
1497538 1500248 I - I kept putting myself<br />in the kid's place.
1502084 1504210 I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.
1504295 1506838 I mean, if I was on trial for my life...
1506922 1511718 I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br />witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
1511802 1515763 Look, there was one alleged eyewitness<br />to this killing.
1516307 1519684 Someone else claims he heard the killing,<br />saw the boy run out afterwards.
1519768 1521895 And there was a lot<br />of circumstantial evidence.
1521979 1525481 But actually, those two witnesses<br />were the entire case for the prosecution.
1525566 1527358 Supposing they're wrong.
1527443 1529235 What do you mean<br />supposing they're wrong?
1529320 1531196 What's the point<br />of having witnesses at all?
1531280 1533907 Could they be wrong?<br />What are you trying to say?
1533991 1535593 Those people sat on the stand under oath.
1535618 1537219 They're only people.<br />People make mistakes.
1537244 1538953 Could they be wrong?
1539747 1542665 Well, no, I don't think so.<br />Do you know so?
1542750 1544590 Oh, come on.<br />Nobody can know a thing like that.
1544668 1546377 This isn't an exact science.
1546462 1547795 That's right. It isn't.
1552968 1555720 Okay, let - Let's get to the point.
1555804 1558389 What about the switch knife<br />they found in the old man's chest?
1558474 1560951 Uh, wait-wait a minute.<br />There's some people who haven't talked yet.
1560976 1563037 Shouldn't we go in order?<br />They'll get a chance to talk.
1563062 1565396 Be quiet a second, will you?
1565481 1566773 What about it, this...
1566857 1570318 the knife this fine upright boy<br />admitted buying the night of the killing?
1570402 1571736 Let's talk about it.
1571820 1574131 All right, let's talk about it.<br />Let's get it in here and look at it.
1574156 1575907 I'd like to see it again.<br />Mr. Foreman?
1575991 1579077 We all saw what it looks like.<br />Why do we have to see it again?
1579161 1581281 The gentleman has a right<br />to see exhibits in evidence.
1583332 1584791 Say, could you bring us the knife?
1584875 1586668 Knife?<br />Yeah. Thank you.
1588337 1591589 The knife and the way it was bought<br />is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?
1591674 1593341 I do.<br />Good.
1593425 1595927 Now, suppose we take these facts<br />one at a time.
1596011 1599264 One. The boy admitted going out of the house<br />at 8:00 on the night of the murder...
1599348 1601266 after being slapped several times<br />by his father.
1601350 1604102 No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."<br />He said "punched."
1604186 1606604 There's a difference<br />between a slap and a punch.
1606689 1609274 After being hit several times<br />by his father.
1609358 1611609 Two. He went directly<br />to a neighborhood junk shop...
1611694 1613820 where he bought one of those.<br />Switch knives.
1613904 1615905 Switchblade knives.
1615990 1617790 This wasn't what you'd call<br />an ordinary knife.
1617866 1620368 It had a very unusual carved handle<br />and blade.
1620452 1621953 The storekeeper who sold it to him...
1622037 1625164 said it was the only one of its kind<br />he had ever had in stock.
1625249 1629002 Three. He met some friends of his<br />in front of a tavern about 8:45.
1629086 1630586 Am I right so far?
1630671 1632797 Yes, you are.<br />You bet he is.
1632881 1636050 He talked with his friends<br />for about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.
1636135 1639095 During this time,<br />they saw the switch knife.
1639179 1640972 Four.
1641056 1643474 They identified the death weapon<br />in court...
1643559 1646060 as that very same knife.
1646145 1648938 Five. He arrived home at about 10:00.
1649023 1651417 Now this is where the stories<br />offered by the State and the boy...
1651442 1653359 begin to diverge slightly.
1653444 1656029 He claims that he went to a movie<br />at about 11:30...
1656113 1660158 returning home at 3:10 to find<br />his father dead and himself arrested.
1660242 1662344 He also claims that<br />the two detectives who arrested him...
1662369 1664662 threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
1664747 1666581 Now, what happened to the switch knife?
1666665 1669351 He claims that it fell through a hole<br />in his pocket on the way to the movies...
1669376 1674047 sometime between 11:30 and 3:10<br />and that he never saw it again.
1674131 1676090 Now there's a tale, gentlemen.
1676175 1679677 I think it's quite clear that the boy<br />never went to the movies that night.
1679762 1681721 No one in the house<br />saw him go out at 11:30.
1681805 1683306 No one at the theater identified him.
1683390 1685710 He couldn't even remember<br />the names of the pictures he saw.
1688562 1690331 What actually happened is this.<br />Thank you.
1690356 1693566 The boy stayed home,<br />had another fight with his father...
1693650 1697362 stabbed him to death and left<br />the house at 10 minutes after 12:00.
1697446 1700198 He even remembered to wipe the knife<br />clean of fingerprints.
1700282 1702909 Now are you trying to tell me<br />that this knife...
1702993 1704913 really fell through a hole<br />in the boy's pocket...
1704995 1707431 someone picked it up off the street,<br />went to the boy's house...
1707456 1710124 and stabbed his father with it<br />just to test its sharpness?
1710209 1712269 No. I'm just saying it's possible<br />the boy lost his knife...
1712294 1714563 and that somebody else stabbed his father<br />with a similar knife.
1714588 1715797 It's just possible.
1715881 1717465 Take a look at this knife.
1719385 1721594 It's a very unusual knife.
1721678 1723221 I've never seen one like it.
1723305 1726099 Neither had the storekeeper<br />who sold it to the boy.
1726183 1729143 Aren't you asking us to accept<br />a pretty incredible coincidence?
1729228 1731562 I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
1731647 1733147 And I say it's not possible.
1739780 1741548 Where did that come from?
1741573 1743008 Where'd you get that?<br />It's the same knife.
1743033 1744534 What do you think you're doing?
1744618 1746244 Where did you get it?
1746328 1748579 I went out walking<br />for a couple of hours last night.
1748664 1750665 I walked through the boy's neighborhood.
1750749 1753751 I bought that at a little pawnshop<br />just two blocks from the boy's house.
1753836 1755294 It cost six dollars.
1755379 1758506 It's against the law<br />to buy or sell switchblade knives.
1758590 1760842 That's right. I broke the law.
1760926 1764929 Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.<br />Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.
1765013 1767098 Maybe there are 10 knives like that.<br />So what?
1767182 1769976 Maybe there are.<br />Well, what does it mean?
1770060 1773380 You found another knife like it. What's that,<br />the discovery of the age or something?
1773439 1775833 You mean you're asking us to believe<br />that somebody else did the stabbing...
1775858 1777650 with exactly the same kind of knife?
1777734 1778985 The odds are a million-to-one.
1779069 1781779 It's possible.<br />But not very probable.
1782990 1784991 Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
1785075 1787235 There's no point in standing around<br />all over the place.
1788745 1792165 You know, it's interesting that he'd find<br />a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.
1792249 1795001 What's interesting about it?<br />"Interesting."
1795085 1797020 Well, I don't know.<br />I just thought it was interesting.
1797045 1798897 There are still 11 of us here<br />who think he's guilty.
1798922 1801275 Right.<br />What do you think you're gonna accomplish?
1801300 1803134 You're not gonna change anybody's mind.
1803218 1805595 So if you wanna be stubborn<br />and hang this jury, go ahead.
1805679 1808723 The kid will be tried again<br />and found guilty sure as he's born.
1810267 1812143 That's probably right.
1812227 1815438 So what are you gonna do?<br />You know, we could be here all night.
1815522 1818774 It's only one night. A boy may die.
1818859 1821402 Well, why don't we just<br />set up house here, huh?
1821487 1823967 Someone send for Potsy the policeman<br />and get a pinochle deck...
1824031 1826532 and, uh, we'll just<br />sweat the whole thing out right here.
1828035 1831138 I don't think he ought to joke about it.<br />What do you want me to do about it?
1831163 1834832 Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff<br />about the knife's got to do with anything.
1834917 1837835 Somebody saw the kid stab his father.<br />What more do we need?
1837920 1840713 You guys can talk the ears right<br />off my head. You know what I mean?
1840797 1843508 I got three garages of mine goin' to pot<br />while you're talking.
1843592 1845259 So let's get done and get outta here.
1845344 1848763 The knife was very important to the<br />district attorney. He spent a whole day...
1848847 1851327 He's a 15th assistant or something.<br />What does he know about it?
1851391 1852850 Hey, let's hold it down.
1852935 1855269 These side arguments<br />are only slowing us up.
1858148 1859524 Well, what about it?
1859608 1861108 You're the only one.
1869034 1871077 I have a proposition<br />to make to all of you.
1872162 1873913 I'm gonna call for another vote.
1875374 1880586 I want you 11 men to vote<br />by secret written ballot.
1880671 1882713 I'll abstain.
1882798 1885591 If there are 11 votes for guilty,<br />I won't stand alone.
1885676 1889470 We'll take in a guilty verdict<br />to the judge right now.
1890931 1894642 But if anyone votes not guilty,<br />we stay here and talk it out.
1897980 1900898 Well, that's it.<br />If you want to try it, I'm ready.
1900983 1902441 All right. Let's do it the hard way.
1902526 1904443 Okay, that sounds fair.<br />Everyone agreed?
1904528 1906612 Anyone doesn't agree?<br />Fine, fine. Let's go.
1906697 1907738 Here, pass these along.
1907823 1909574 Is that the right time?
1941648 1942398 "Guilty."
1971553 1974180 "Not guilty."
1974264 1975681 "Guilty."
1975766 1977433 Boy, how do you like that?
1977517 1979977 Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.
1980062 1982813 All right, who was it?<br />Come on. I want to know.
1982898 1985149 Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
1985233 1986776 We all agreed on that, no?
1986860 1988986 If the gentleman wanted<br />to remain secret...
1989071 1990946 Secret? What do you mean secret?
1991031 1994241 There are no secrets in a jury room.<br />I know who it was.
1994993 1996911 Brother, you really are something.
1996995 1998996 You sit here, vote guilty<br />like the rest of us...
1999081 2002375 and then some golden-voiced preacher<br />starts tearin' your poor heart out...
2002459 2005753 about some underprivileged kid<br />just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...
2005837 2007338 and you change your vote.
2007422 2009548 If that isn't the most sick...
2009633 2013302 Why don't you drop a quarter<br />in his collection box?
2013387 2015346 Oh, now just wait a minute.
2015430 2017074 Listen, you can't talk to me like that.
2017099 2018992 No. Who do you think you are?<br />Calm down. Calm down.
2019017 2021352 No. Who does he think he is?<br />Did you hear him?
2021436 2024897 It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit<br />down. Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!
2024981 2027817 We're trying to put a guilty man<br />in the chair where he belongs!
2027901 2030569 Someone starts telling us fairy tales,<br />and we're listenin'!
2030654 2032405 Hey, uh, come on, huh?
2032489 2034407 What made you change your vote?
2034491 2036117 He didn't change his vote.
2036201 2037368 I did.
2037452 2039412 Oh, fine.<br />I knew it.
2039496 2041455 Would you like me to tell you why?
2041540 2043475 No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.
2043500 2046043 I'd like to make it clear anyway,<br />if you don't mind.
2046128 2047628 Do we have to listen to this?
2047713 2049463 The man wants to talk.
2049548 2051132 Thank you.
2051216 2054552 This gentleman has been<br />standing alone against us.
2054636 2056887 Now, he doesn't say<br />the boy is not guilty.
2056972 2058931 He just isn't sure.
2059015 2061851 Well, it's not easy to stand alone<br />against the ridicule of others.
2061935 2065062 So he gambled for support,<br />and I gave it to him.
2065147 2066856 I respect his motives.
2066940 2071485 The boy on trial is probably guilty,<br />but, uh, I want to hear more.
2071570 2073362 Right now, the vote is 10 to two.
2073447 2075698 I'm talking here!<br />You have no right to leave this room!
2075782 2077658 He can't hear you. He never will.
2077743 2079326 Let's sit down.
2083498 2085708 Shall we continue?
2085792 2088002 Well, I - I think we ought<br />to take a break.
2088086 2092214 You know, one man's inside,<br />and I think we ought to wait for him.
2092299 2095259 Okay.
2095343 2097094 Looks like we're really<br />hung up here, huh?
2098472 2100832 And that thing with the old man,<br />that was pretty unexpected.
2102893 2105352 I wish I could figure out some way<br />we could break it up.
2108482 2111942 You know, in advertising.<br />I told you I worked in an agency.
2112027 2113027 Mm-hmm.
2113111 2115172 Well, there's some pretty strange people<br />working there.
2115197 2117281 Well, they're not strange really, I guess.
2117365 2119992 It's just that they have peculiar ways<br />of expressing themselves.
2120076 2121327 You know what I mean.
2121411 2123811 Of course, I suppose it's the same<br />in your business too, huh?
2124372 2125873 What do you do?
2125957 2128125 I'm a watchmaker.<br />Oh, really?
2128210 2131420 Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers<br />in the world come from Europe, huh?
2131505 2134566 Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,<br />when we reach a point like this...
2134591 2138111 I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when<br />a point like this is reached in a meeting...
2138178 2140805 there's always some character<br />ready with an idea, see.
2140889 2142848 And it kills me.
2142933 2144493 It's the weirdest thing in the world...
2144518 2147853 the way they sometimes precede their idea<br />with a little phrase, see, like...
2147938 2150856 Some account exec will get up,<br />and he'll say, uh...
2150941 2152775 "Okay, here's an idea.
2152859 2156487 Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole<br />and see if anyone salutes it."
2156571 2159698 I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?
2159783 2164286 I, uh - I got a little excited<br />back there. I...
2165288 2167039 didn't mean to get nasty.
2167916 2171710 I'm glad you're not one of those<br />lets these emotional appeals influence him.
2172879 2175130 Uh.

2342090 2343966 Well, I'm not used to supposing.
2344050 2348554 I'm just a workingman.<br />My boss does the supposing. But...
2348638 2350139 Well, I'll try one.
2351349 2357021 Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,<br />uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?
2365947 2367239 Are you ready?

2368616 2369533 That one.

2372203 2375622 Well, where else.<br />Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
2375707 2377624 Looks like we'll be here<br />for dinner, huh?
2377709 2380085 Okay, now let's.<br />Let's get down to business.
2380170 2381545 Now, who wants to start it off?
2381629 2383047 I would.<br />Okay, go.
2383131 2385215 You down there.
2385300 2389178 The old man who lived downstairs says he heard<br />the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."
2389262 2391889 A second later,<br />he heard the body hit the floor.
2391973 2395851 Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid<br />running down the stairs and out of the house.
2395935 2397311 What does that mean to you?
2397395 2400832 I was wondering how clearly the old man could<br />have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.
2400857 2402959 He didn't hear it through the ceiling.<br />The window was open.
2402984 2404878 So was the one upstairs.<br />It was a hot night, remember?
2404903 2406236 Well, it was another apartment.
2406321 2408965 It's not that easy to identify a voice,<br />particularly a shouting voice.
2408990 2410633 He identified it in court.<br />That's right.
2410658 2412177 And don't forget the lady<br />across the street.
2412202 2414995 She looked right in the open window<br />and saw the boy stab his father.
2415080 2417539 Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?<br />No, it isn't.
2417624 2419583 Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?
2419667 2421502 It's like talking into a dead phone.
2421586 2424814 She said she saw the killing through the windows<br />of a moving elevated train.
2424839 2428342 There were six cars on the train. She saw<br />the killing through the last two cars.
2428426 2430260 She remembered<br />the most insignificant details.
2430345 2432387 I don't see how you can argue with that.
2432472 2437017 Has anybody here any idea<br />how long it would take an el...
2445693 2447277 Hey!
2447362 2448862 This isn't a game.
2453159 2455410 Did you see him?<br />Hey.
2455495 2457246 The nerve.<br />All right, listen...
2457330 2460582 The absolute nerve.<br />Forget it. It's not important.
2460667 2462626 "This isn't a game"?<br />Calm down.
2462710 2466046 Who does he think he is?<br />I'm telling you, forget it now.
2466131 2469466 Has anybody any idea how long<br />it takes an elevated train...
2469551 2471385 going at medium speed<br />to pass a given point?
2471469 2473404 What has that to do with anything?<br />How long? Take a guess.
2473429 2476098 I wouldn't have the slightest idea.<br />What do you think?
2476182 2478058 I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?
2479060 2480787 I think that's a pretty good guess.<br />Anyone else?
2480812 2483665 That sounds right to me.<br />Come on. What's the guessing game for?
2483690 2485570 What do you say?<br />Ten seconds is about right.
2485608 2487585 All right. Say 10 seconds.<br />What are you getting at?
2487610 2492656 This. It takes a six-car el train<br />10 seconds to pass a given point.
2492740 2496994 Now let's say the given point is the open window<br />of the room where the killing took place.
2497078 2500372 You can reach out of that window<br />and almost touch the el tracks, right?
2500456 2501957 Now let me ask you this.
2502041 2504293 Has anyone here<br />ever lived near the el tracks?
2504377 2508005 Well, uh, I just finished painting<br />an apartment that overlooked an el line.
2508089 2509816 I was there for three days.<br />What was it like?
2509841 2511008 What do you mean?<br />Noisy?
2511092 2513635 Oh, brother. Don't matter though.<br />We were all punchy.
2513720 2516305 I lived in a second-floor apartment<br />near the el line once.
2516389 2519509 When the window was open and the train<br />goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.
2519559 2522412 You can hardly hear yourself think.<br />All right, you can't hear yourself think.
2522437 2524855 Will you get to the point?<br />I will. Now just a minute.
2524939 2528567 Let's take two pieces of testimony<br />and try to put them together.
2528651 2532738 First. The old man<br />in the apartment downstairs.
2532822 2535407 He says he heard the boy say<br />"I'm gonna kill you"...
2535491 2538243 and a split second later<br />heard a body hit the floor.
2538328 2539971 One second later, right?<br />That's right.
2539996 2546001 Second. The woman across the street swore<br />positively she looked out of the window...
2546085 2549421 and saw the killing through the last two cars<br />of the passing elevated train, right?
2549505 2551900 The last two cars.<br />What are you giving us here?
2551925 2553258 Now, just a minute.
2553343 2557763 We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds<br />for a train to pass a given point.
2558598 2561934 Since the woman saw the killing<br />through the last two cars...
2562018 2566980 we can assume that the body<br />hit the floor just as the train went by.
2567065 2571526 Therefore, the train had been roaring<br />by the old man's window...
2571611 2575113 a full 10 seconds<br />before the body hit the floor.
2575198 2577407 The old man,<br />according to his own testimony...
2577492 2580410 "I'm gonna kill you," body hitting<br />the floor a split second later...
2580495 2582955 would have had to hear the boy<br />make this statement...
2583039 2584915 with the el roaring past his nose.
2584999 2586559 It's not possible he could've heard it.
2586626 2588853 That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.<br />Do you think he could've heard it?
2588878 2591314 He said he yelled at the top of his voice.<br />That's good enough for me.
2591339 2593650 Even if he heard something, he still<br />couldn't have identified the voice.
2593675 2594800 With the el roaring by?
2594884 2597320 You're talking about a matter of seconds!<br />Nobody can be that accurate.
2597345 2601974 I think testimony that could put a boy<br />into the electric chair should be that accurate.
2604185 2606162 You know something?<br />I don't think he could've heard it.
2606187 2608522 Maybe he didn't hear it.<br />I mean, with all that el noise.
2608606 2610541 Oh, what are you people talking about?
2610566 2612669 Well, it stands to reason<br />he couldn't have heard it.
2612694 2614611 Why should he lie?<br />What's he got to gain?
2614696 2616905 Attention maybe.
2616990 2618907 You keep coming in<br />with these bright sayings!
2618992 2622035 Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?<br />They pay three dollars apiece.
2622120 2624329 What are you talking to him<br />like that for?
2625290 2628709 Guy talks like that to an old man<br />really ought to get stepped on, you know?
2628793 2630627 You ought to have more respect, mister.
2631838 2636216 If you say stuff like that to him again,<br />I'm gonna lay you out.
2646185 2649146 Now you go ahead.<br />You - You say anything you like.
2649230 2653275 Why do you think<br />the old man might lie?
2653359 2656778 It was just that I looked at him<br />for a very long time.
2657405 2660657 The seams of his jacket was split,<br />under the shoulder.
2660742 2662326 Or did you notice that?
2662410 2664911 I mean, to come to court like that.
2664996 2666663 Why.
2667790 2671668 He was a very old man<br />in a torn jacket.
2671753 2674629 And he walked very slowly<br />to the stand.
2675381 2679426 He was dragging his left leg<br />and trying to hide it...
2679510 2681178 because he was ashamed.
2682305 2685724 I think I know this man<br />better than anyone here.
2686601 2692022 This is a quiet, frightened,<br />insignificant old man who...
2692106 2694483 who has been nothing all his life...
2694567 2696985 who has never had recognition...
2697070 2699154 or his name in the newspapers.
2699822 2702032 Nobody knows him.
2702116 2704159 Nobody quotes him.
2704243 2708205 Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
2709040 2712918 Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing.<br />to be nothing.
2713628 2717964 A man like this needs to be quoted,<br />to be listened to.
2718591 2720550 To be quoted just once.
2720635 2722511 Very important to him.
2723012 2725430 It would be so hard for him<br />to recede into the background...
2725515 2727283 Wait a minute.<br />When there was a chance...
2727308 2730244 What are you trying to do - tell us he'd lie<br />just so he could be important once?
2730269 2732896 No. He wouldn't really lie.
2732980 2736441 But perhaps he made himself believe<br />he heard those words...
2736526 2738735 and recognized the boy's face.
2738820 2741113 That's the most fantastic story<br />I've ever heard.
2741197 2744241 How can you make up a thing like that?<br />What do you know about it?
2753292 2755335 Oh, uh, does anybody<br />want a cough drop?
2755420 2757671 No, thanks.<br />I'll take one.
2757755 2761317 You can say what you like. I still don't<br />see how anybody can think he's not guilty.
2761342 2763844 There's something else<br />I'd like to talk about for a minute.
2763928 2765554 Thanks.
2765638 2768991 I think we've proved that the old man couldn't<br />have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."
2769016 2770660 But supposing.<br />You didn't prove it at all.
2770685 2773478 What are you talking about?<br />Supposing he really did hear it.
2773563 2775981 This phrase, how many times<br />have all of us used it?
2776065 2777566 Probably thousands.
2777650 2779276 "I could kill you for that, darling."
2779360 2781337 "Junior, you do that once more,<br />and I'm gonna kill you."
2781362 2782713 "Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."
2782738 2784674 We say it every day. That doesn't mean<br />we're really gonna kill anybody.
2784699 2786551 Wait a minute.<br />What are you trying to give us here?
2786576 2790287 The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."<br />The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
2790371 2791705 Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
2791789 2794142 Anybody says a thing like that<br />the way he said it, they mean it.
2794167 2795625 Well, gee, now I don't know.
2795710 2800422 I remember I was arguing with a guy I work<br />next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.
2800506 2802257 He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.
2802341 2805302 Now listen! This guy's trying to make you<br />believe things that aren't so.
2805386 2807530 The kid said he was gonna kill him,<br />and he did kill him.
2807555 2810575 Let me ask you this. Do you really think<br />the boy would shout out a thing like that...
2810600 2812392 so the whole neighborhood could hear him?
2812477 2814357 I don't think so.<br />He's much too bright for that.
2814395 2819149 Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.<br />He don't even speak good English.
2819233 2822068 "He doesn't even speak good English."
2824530 2828325 Mr. Foreman, I'd like<br />to change my vote to not guilty.
2828409 2829826 You what?
2829911 2832329 You heard me.<br />Are you sure?
2833247 2834664 Yeah, I'm sure.
2834749 2837209 The vote is nine to three,<br />favor of guilty.
2837293 2840086 Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?
2844133 2846885 What are you basing it on.<br />the stories this guy made up?
2847512 2849906 You ought to write for one of those<br />kooky detective magazines.
2849931 2851765 You'd make a fortune.
2851849 2855268 For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer<br />knew he didn't stand a chance.
2855770 2857413 Right from the beginning,<br />his own lawyer knew it.
2857438 2859231 You could see it.
2859315 2862901 Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,<br />this guy here is really something.
2863736 2865529 Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
2865613 2868448 He presented his case, not you.<br />How come you got so much to say?
2868533 2871368 Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.<br />Baltimore, please. Huh?
2871452 2873161 He was court-appointed.
2873246 2875139 What's that supposed to mean?<br />It could mean a lot of things.
2875164 2878416 It could mean he didn't want the case,<br />or he resented being appointed.
2878501 2880381 It's the kind of case<br />that brings him nothing...
2880419 2883380 no money, no glory,<br />not even much chance of winning.
2883464 2886383 That's not a very promising situation<br />for a young lawyer.
2886467 2889445 He'd really have to believe in his client<br />to put up any kind of a good case...
2889470 2891531 and, as you pointed out a minute ago,<br />obviously he didn't.
2891556 2894391 Of course he didn't. Huh.
2894475 2896768 Who the heck could?
2896852 2899771 Except maybe<br />some guy's mother or somebody. I...
2899855 2902107 Ah, look.<br />Will you look at the time, huh?
2902191 2904734 Come on. For crying out.<br />Pardon me.
2904819 2907153 I have made some notes here.<br />Notes.
2907238 2909864 And I would like to.<br />please, to say something.
2909949 2912200 Yeah.<br />I have been listening very carefully.
2912285 2916705 And, uh, it seems to me that this man<br />has some very good points to make.
2916789 2921418 From what was presented at the trial,<br />the boy looks guilty on the surface.
2921502 2925589 But maybe if we go deeper?<br />Oh, come on, will ya?
2925673 2927966 There is a question I would like to ask.
2928050 2931344 Let us assume that the boy<br />really did commit the murder.
2931429 2934764 Now, this happened<br />at 10 minutes after 12:00.
2934849 2937309 Now, how was he caught by the police?
2937393 2941896 He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...
2941981 2945734 and he was captured by two detectives<br />in the hallway of his house.
2945818 2950405 Now, my question is,<br />if he really had killed his father...
2950489 2953700 why would he come back home<br />three hours later?
2953784 2956661 Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
2956746 2958496 He came home to get his knife.
2958581 2961183 It's not nice to go around leaving knives<br />sticking in people's chests.
2961208 2963960 Yeah, especially relatives.<br />Yeah.
2964045 2966296 I don't see anything funny about it.
2966380 2969924 The boy knew the knife could be identified<br />as the one he had just bought.
2970009 2972177 He had to get it before the police did.
2972261 2976723 But if he knew the knife could be identified,<br />why did he leave it there in the first place?
2977266 2980143 Well, I think we can assume<br />the boy ran out in a state of panic...
2980227 2982604 after having just killed his father.
2982688 2985649 When he finally calmed down,<br />he realized he had left his knife there.
2985733 2988652 Ah. This then depends<br />on your definition of panic.
2988736 2991112 He would have had to be<br />calm enough to see to it...
2991197 2993782 that there were no fingerprints<br />left on the knife.
2993866 2997911 Now, where did this panic start<br />and where did it end?
2997995 3000372 Look, you voted guilty.<br />What side are ya on?
3000456 3004000 I don't believe I have to be loyal<br />to one side or the other.
3004085 3005877 I'm simply asking questions.
3005961 3008963 Well, this is just off the top of my head,<br />but, uh...
3009048 3011609 well, if I were the boy<br />and I'd done the stabbing and everything...
3011634 3013760 I'd take a chance<br />and go back for the knife.
3013844 3016346 I'll bet he figured that nobody<br />had seen him running out...
3016430 3018932 and that the body wouldn't be discovered<br />till the next day.
3019016 3021059 Well, after all,<br />it was the middle of the night.
3021143 3023704 I'll bet he'd figured nobody<br />would find the body till the next day.
3023729 3025730 Pardon. This is my whole point.
3025815 3029526 The woman across the street testified<br />that the moment after she saw the killing...
3029610 3032195 that is, a moment<br />after the train went by...
3032279 3035281 she screamed<br />and then went to telephone the police.
3035366 3038743 Now, the boy certainly<br />must have heard the scream...
3038828 3042330 so he knew<br />that somebody saw something.
3042415 3045208 I just don't think<br />that he would have gone back.
3045292 3048104 Two things. One, in his state of panic,<br />he may not have heard the scream.
3048129 3049796 Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
3049880 3053258 Two, if he did hear it, he may not<br />have connected it with his own act.
3053342 3056386 Remember, he lived in a neighborhood<br />where screams were fairly commonplace.
3056470 3058930 There's your answer.<br />Maybe.
3059014 3061891 Maybe the boy did kill his father,<br />didn't hear the scream...
3061976 3065687 did run out in a panic,<br />did calm down three hours later...
3065771 3068411 and come back to get the knife,<br />risking being caught by the police.
3068482 3071401 Maybe all of those things happened,<br />but maybe they didn't.
3071485 3074296 I think there's enough doubt that we can<br />wonder whether he was there at all...
3074321 3075989 during the time the killing took place.
3076073 3077883 What do you mean doubt?<br />What are you talking about?
3077908 3079677 Didn't the old man see him<br />running out of the house?
3079702 3081494 He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.
3081579 3084914 Did or didn't the old man see the kid<br />running out of the house at 12:10?
3084999 3086916 Well, did or didn't he?
3087001 3090211 He says he did.<br />"Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?
3090296 3093315 Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.<br />Sure, when you want them to, they do.
3093340 3095592 Or when he wants them to, they do.<br />You know what I mean?
3095676 3097570 Keep the yelling down!<br />Oh, you keep saying that.
3097595 3099363 Maybe what we need<br />is a little yelling in here.
3099388 3101097 These guys<br />keep going off every which way.
3101182 3103099 Did hear the scream.<br />Didn't hear the scream.
3103184 3106412 What difference does it make? You people<br />are talking only about the little details.
3106437 3108998 You're forgetting the important stuff.<br />I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...
3109023 3111399 I want to call for another vote.<br />I'm talking here!
3111484 3115153 There's another vote called for.<br />Now let's take our seats.
3119033 3121576 I never saw so much time<br />spent on nothing.
3121660 3123369 It only takes a second.
3124455 3127874 Okay. I guess the fastest way<br />is to find out who's voting not guilty.
3127958 3130710 Now, all those voting not guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
3131962 3135548 Still the same.<br />One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.
3135633 3137300 So, now where are we?
3137384 3140804 I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until<br />next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?
3140888 3143640 Pardon. I vote not guilty.
3143724 3146726 Oh!
3146811 3150104 What are ya talking about? I mean,<br />we're all going crazy in here or something.
3150189 3153983 The kid is guilty.<br />Why don't you listen to the facts?
3154068 3156319 Tell him, will ya?<br />Now this is getting to be a joke.
3156403 3159614 The vote is eight to four,<br />favor of guilty.
3159698 3163368 What is this, love your underprivileged<br />brother week or something?
3163452 3165954 I want you to get up and tell me<br />why you changed your vote.
3166038 3170333 Come on. Give me your reasons.<br />I don't have to defend my decision to you.
3170417 3172168 There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
3172253 3175255 What reasonable doubt? That's nothing<br />but words. Here, look at this.
3175339 3180260 The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br />was seen ramming this into his father.
3180344 3182345 Now, what about this,<br />Mr. Reasonable Doubt?
3182429 3185098 That's not the knife.<br />Don't you remember?
3185182 3187350 Oh, brilliant.
3187434 3189727 I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.
3189812 3191980 I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
3192064 3194959 I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling<br />stories out of thin air, you know?
3194984 3198695 A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting<br />ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...
3198779 3201239 he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...
3201323 3203700 Look. Now, what about the old man?
3203784 3206428 Are we supposed to believe that he didn't<br />get up and run to his door...
3206453 3209455 and see the kid tearing down the steps<br />15 seconds after the killing?
3209540 3212000 He's just saying so to be important, right?
3212084 3214937 I mean, what's the point of the whole<br />thing? Wait. Hold it a second, will you?
3214962 3217171 Oh, and the Baltimore rooter<br />is heard from again now...
3217256 3219275 and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits<br />wherever we look.
3219300 3222552 Hold it a second. Now, look.<br />Did the old man say he ran to the door?
3222636 3225656 Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on,<br />didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?
3225681 3228284 No, now wait a second.<br />He said he ran. At least I think he did.
3228309 3231749 Look, I don't remember what he said, but I don't<br />see how he could have run to the door.
3231812 3234188 He said he went<br />from his bedroom to the front door.
3234273 3235958 Now, isn't that enough?<br />Where was the bedroom?
3235983 3238294 It was down the hall somewhere.<br />I thought you remembered everything.
3238319 3240570 Don't you remember that?<br />No.
3240654 3242864 Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see<br />a diagram of the apartment.
3242990 3246260 Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again<br />so you can get everything straight? Mr. Foreman.
3246285 3248971 How come you're the only one in this room<br />wants to see exhibits all the time?
3248996 3251765 I want to see this one too.<br />And I'd like to stop wasting time.
3251790 3254685 If we're gonna start wading through all that nonsense<br />about where the body was found...
3254710 3256729 We're not,<br />not unless somebody else wants to.
3256754 3258463 But I'd like to find out if an old man...
3258547 3260983 who drags one foot when he walks<br />'cause he had a stroke last year...
3261008 3263426 can get from his bedroom<br />to his front door in 15 seconds.
3263510 3265178 He said 20 seconds.<br />He said 15.
3265262 3267430 He said 20 seconds.<br />What are you trying to distort...
3267514 3270767 He said 15.<br />How does he know how long 15 seconds is?
3270851 3272518 You can't judge a thing like that.
3272603 3275039 He said 15 seconds.<br />He was very positive about it.
3275064 3277273 He was an old man.<br />Half the time he was confused.
3277358 3279651 How could he be positive about anything?
3287326 3291454 I don't see what you're going to prove here.<br />The man said he saw the boy running out.
3291538 3293706 Well, let's see<br />if the details bear him out.
3293791 3296671 As soon as the body hit the floor,<br />he said he heard footsteps upstairs...
3296752 3298419 running toward the front door...
3298504 3301589 heard the upstairs door open,<br />the footsteps start down the stairs.
3301674 3303859 He said he got to his own front door<br />as fast as he could...
3303884 3306028 and he swore it couldn't have been<br />more than 15 seconds.
3306053 3307780 Now, if the killer<br />began running immediately...
3307805 3310074 Maybe he didn't.<br />The old man said he did.
3310099 3312809 You ought to be at Atlantic City<br />at that hairsplitters convention.
3314103 3316288 Hey, why don't you stop makin'<br />smart remarks all the time, huh?
3316313 3319500 My friend, for your three dollars a day,<br />you have to listen to everything, you know?
3319525 3321293 Now that you've got that thing in here,<br />what about it?
3321318 3323545 All right. Here's the apartment<br />where the killing took place.
3323570 3326614 The old man's apartment<br />was directly beneath and exactly the same.
3326699 3329909 Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,<br />living room, kitchen, bathroom.
3329994 3331995 Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.
3332079 3334330 Now, the old man<br />was in this bedroom right here.
3334415 3337083 He says he crossed to the door<br />and walked down the hall...
3337167 3340128 opened the front door just in time<br />to see the boy running down the stairs.
3340212 3343548 Am I right so far?<br />That's the story, for the 19th time.
3343632 3347176 Fifteen seconds after the body<br />hit the floor. Correct.
3347261 3349303 Now, let's see. It was...
3349388 3353391 It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.<br />The hall is 43 feet.
3353475 3356686 He would have had to walk 12 feet,<br />open the bedroom door...
3356770 3360398 walk 43 feet down and open the front door<br />all in 15 seconds.
3360482 3363252 Do you think he could have done it?<br />Sure he could have done it.
3363277 3365921 He can walk only very slowly. They had<br />to help him into the witness chair.
3365946 3367613 You make it sound like a long walk.
3367698 3370033 For an old man who had a stroke,<br />it is a long walk.
3370117 3373536 Oh! What are you doing?<br />I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.
3373662 3377099 What do you mean, you want to try it? Why didn't<br />his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?
3377124 3380811 Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh? What do you mean,<br />didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?
3380836 3382438 It's an obvious thing.<br />Did you think of it?
3382463 3384189 Listen, smart guy.<br />Don't matter whether I thought of it.
3384214 3386525 He didn't bring it up because he knew it<br />would hurt his case. What do you think of that?
3386550 3390430 Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have<br />meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.
3390471 3393806 You know that doesn't sit very well<br />with a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.
3393891 3396660 So, what kind of a bum is he then?<br />That's what I've been asking, buddy.
3396685 3399729 Pass me that chair, will you?<br />Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
3399813 3402690 I just paced off 12 feet across the room.<br />This will be the bedroom door.
3402775 3405401 Oh, that's crazy.<br />You can't recreate a thing like that.
3405486 3407755 I'd like to see it.<br />The hall was 43 feet.
3407780 3409781 I'll pace from that wall and back again.
3411075 3414911 Look, this is absolutely insane. What are you<br />wasting everybody's time in here for?
3414995 3417915 According to you, it'll only take 15<br />seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.
3417956 3421751 ♪♪
3421835 3423503 Come on. Knock it off.
3423587 3425088 Okay.
3425172 3427215 Okay. Okay, killer.
3427299 3428883 Yeah.
3431220 3433262 Will you stand right there<br />and mark the front door?
3433347 3435848 It was chain-locked according<br />to the testimony, remember?
3435933 3438101 Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?<br />I have.
3438185 3440662 When you want me to start, stamp your foot.<br />That'll be the body falling.
3440687 3442605 You can time me from there.
3442689 3444774 What are we gonna do, play charades now?
3444858 3446960 Come on! What are we waiting for?<br />Okay, I'm ready.
3446985 3448962 Well, I want to wait<br />till the second hand reaches 60.
3448987 3450905 Oh, come on.
3457621 3460623 Come on. Speed it up.<br />He could walk twice as fast as that.
3462084 3464544 You want me to walk faster than that,<br />I will.
3481436 3483896 Lock. Door. Stop.
3483981 3485982 Right.<br />What's the time?
3486066 3489318 Uh, exactly 41 seconds.
3489403 3491654 This is what I think happened.
3491738 3494633 The old man heard the fight between the boy<br />and his father a few hours earlier.
3494658 3497553 Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the body<br />hit the floor in the boy's apartment...
3497578 3501140 heard the woman scream from across the street,<br />got to his front door as fast as he could...
3501165 3503749 heard somebody racing down the stairs<br />and assumed it was the boy.
3503834 3505668 I think that's possible.<br />Assumed?
3505752 3508254 Oh.
3508338 3514302 Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty<br />in my day, but this little display takes the cake.
3514386 3519098 You all come in here with your hearts bleeding<br />all over the floor about slum kids and injustice.
3519183 3521184 You listen to some fairy tales.
3521268 3523620 Suddenly you start getting through<br />to some of these old ladies.
3523645 3526606 Well, you're not getting through to me.<br />I've had enough.
3526690 3528733 What's the matter with you guys?
3528817 3531527 You all know he's guilty!<br />He's got to burn!
3531612 3533404 You're letting him slip<br />through our fingers.
3533488 3535698 "Slip through our fingers"?<br />Are you his executioner?
3535782 3537450 I'm one of 'em!
3538619 3540453 Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.
3540537 3542538 For this kid, you bet I would.
3542623 3545875 I feel sorry for you. What it must<br />feel like to want to pull the switch.
3546752 3550671 Ever since you walked into this room, you've been acting<br />like a self-appointed public avenger.
3550756 3555051 You want to see this boy die because you<br />personally want it, not because of the facts.
3555135 3557303 You're a sadist.<br />You...
3557387 3561224 Let me go!<br />I'll kill him. I'll kill him!
3561308 3563726 You don't really mean<br />you'll kill me, do you?
3571026 3573361 Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?<br />I heard some noise.
3573445 3577448 Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just.<br />You know, friendly little argument. It's...
3577532 3580826 Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.<br />You can take it if you want.
3582204 3583871 Here you are. Thank you.
3589419 3591504 What are you lookin' at?
3612276 3614318 I suppose somebody<br />has to start it off again.
3614403 3618114 I beg pardon. "I beg pardon."<br />What are you so polite about?
3618198 3620283 For the same reason you're not.
3620367 3622368 It's the way I was brought up.
3624288 3626205 This fighting...
3626290 3628332 That's not why we are here, to fight.
3628417 3630793 We have a responsibility.
3631962 3636549 This, I have always thought,<br />is a remarkable thing about democracy...
3636633 3638509 that we are...
3639720 3642305 Uh, what is the word?
3642389 3645474 Notified.<br />That we are notified by mail...
3645559 3649895 to come down to this place<br />to decide on the guilt or innocence...
3649980 3654025 of a man we have never heard of before.
3654109 3658654 We have nothing to gain or lose<br />by - by our verdict.
3659573 3662700 This is one of the reasons<br />why we are strong.
3663994 3666829 We should not make it a personal thing.
3668165 3669832 Thank you.
3671043 3673336 If nobody else has an idea,<br />I may have a cutie here.
3673420 3676231 I mean, I haven't given it much thought,<br />but let's throw it out on the stoop...
3676256 3677882 and see if the cat licks it up.
3677966 3680301 The cat licks it up?<br />Yeah. If the boy...
3684806 3686932 Look how dark it's getting out there.
3687017 3689477 I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.
3691271 3693731 Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?
3695233 3698027 Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?
3699446 3701614 No, I don't.
3701698 3703699 Well, listen. I, uh...
3703784 3706952 I was wondering if, uh, maybe...
3707037 3709330 maybe we should take another vote.
3709414 3713709 Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this<br />one up with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?
3713794 3715586 Hmm.<br />Mr. Foreman?
3716380 3719924 Well, that's okay with me.<br />Anyone doesn't want to vote?
3720008 3723219 Hey, come on. Come on.<br />I'm sorry.
3723303 3726806 I think we ought to have an open ballot.<br />call out our votes, you know.
3726890 3729100 Let's see who stands where.
3729184 3731685 That sounds fair to me.<br />Anyone object?
3734439 3737149 Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.<br />One.
3738151 3740945 Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.
3741029 3742822 Two?
3742906 3744407 Not guilty.
3744950 3747785 Number three?<br />Guilty.
3748787 3750329 Number four?
3751832 3753624 Guilty.
3753708 3756460 Number five?<br />Not guilty.
3757546 3760840 Number six?<br />Not guilty.
3761842 3763509 Number seven?
3763593 3765302 Guilty.
3765387 3767430 Number eight?
3767514 3769181 Not guilty.
3770517 3773436 Number nine?<br />Not guilty.
3773520 3775688 Number 10?<br />Guilty.
3777482 3779525 Number 11?
3779609 3781444 Not guilty.
3781528 3783028 Number 12?
3783947 3786282 Number 12.
3786366 3787867 Guilty.
3793790 3795875 The vote is now six to six.
3795959 3799128 Yeah, right.<br />And we go into extra innings here, huh?
3801548 3806051 Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you<br />people in here must be out of your minds.
3806136 3807970 A kid like that.
3808054 3811307 I don't think the kind of boy he is<br />has anything to do with it.
3811391 3813476 The facts are supposed<br />to determine the case.
3813560 3815728 Don't give me that!<br />I'm sick and tired of facts!
3815812 3817873 You can twist them any way you like.<br />You know what I mean?
3817898 3820483 That's exactly the point<br />this gentleman has been making.
3820567 3823486 Oh! I mean, you keep shouting<br />at the top of your lungs.
3825155 3827072 I'd like to be a few years younger.
3827157 3829074 That man gets on my...
3832454 3835289 My, it's hot in here, isn't it?<br />Do you want a drink of water?
3835373 3839084 No. No, thanks. Thanks.
3846927 3848719 It's gonna rain.
3848803 3851055 Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
3852307 3854183 How come you changed your vote?
3854267 3856685 Well, it just seemed to me<br />there was room for doubt.
3856770 3859010 You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br />You know that, I hope.
3859064 3862066 I don't feel that way. There were<br />a lot of details that never came out.
3862150 3865694 Yeah. Well, good luck.<br />Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.
3865779 3867988 You think too much.<br />You get mixed up.
3869241 3873202 You know what I mean? Now, listen.<br />I don't think you have any right...
3873286 3875871 Loudmouth.
3928592 3931093 Look at that come down, will you?
3932262 3934138 You know...
3934222 3936724 this reminds me of a storm we had last...
3936808 3940269 Oh, when was that? November...
3940353 3943439 I don't know. Something.<br />It was quite a storm we had there.
3943523 3945899 It was right in the middle of a game.
3945984 3948611 Uh, we were behind 7-6...
3948695 3951280 but we just started to move the ball,<br />right off the tackle.
3951364 3954158 Started cutting right.<br />slash here and slash right in...
3954242 3956035 cut right through.
3956119 3958621 And, uh.
3958705 3960914 We had this kid Slattery, you know?
3962083 3965461 A real - He was an ox.<br />You know, a real ox.
3965545 3968047 I wish I had another one just like him.
3968131 3972635 I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head<br />coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.
3972719 3974803 Oh, yeah?<br />That's out in Queens.
3974888 3977640 And, uh, anyway...
3977724 3979808 we're starting to move along real nice.
3979893 3983062 Their whole line is just.<br />they're just coming apart.
3984356 3988108 And it starts to come down<br />cats and dogs, just like this.
3988193 3990819 Just whoosh - you know, right down.
3992113 3995491 Well, that was murder, you know?
3995575 3998160 I swear, I - I nearly bawled.
3998244 4000579 You just - You couldn't go nowhere.
4001831 4003165 Well.
4018807 4021308 Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br />How come...
4029067 4030818 Hey! Huh?
4030902 4034196 Must have been<br />on the same switch with the lights.
4035198 4038367 Well, things are looking up here, huh?
4039035 4040536 Yeah, huh?
4045375 4047376 Boy. That's better.
4054050 4055551 Hey!
4055635 4057302 Two points.
4061307 4063308 Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?
4065603 4068480 That's a damn stupid thing to do.
4068565 4070733 Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...
4071776 4073152 You know?
4074863 4076363 Pardon me.
4077449 4079783 Well, how do you like it?<br />Even Steven.
4079868 4082244 Pretty surprising, isn't it?
4082328 4083829 Yes.
4085623 4089126 Say, that business before,<br />when that tall guy - what's-his-name...
4089210 4091920 was trying to bait me.<br />That doesn't prove anything.
4092005 4094590 I'm a pretty excitable person.
4094674 4098510 I mean, where does he come off calling me<br />a public avenger, sadist and everything?
4098595 4102097 Anyone in his right mind<br />would blow his stack, huh?
4102182 4104475 He was just trying to bait me.
4104559 4106560 He did an excellent job.
4109355 4111565 I'll tell you what I think.<br />We're going nowhere here.
4111649 4114193 I'm ready to walk into court right now<br />and declare a hung jury.
4114277 4116157 There's no point in this thing<br />going on anymore.
4116196 4117529 Yeah. I go for that too.
4117614 4120508 Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let<br />the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.
4120533 4123428 I don't think the judge will accept a hung<br />jury. We haven't been in here very long.
4123453 4125120 Well, let's find out.
4125205 4126914 I'm not in favor of that.
4126998 4130209 Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance<br />with another jury, and you know it.
4130293 4133188 Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna<br />change his vote. Let's take it inside.
4133213 4135422 You still don't think there's room<br />for reasonable doubt?
4135507 4136799 No, I don't.
4136883 4138175 Pardon.
4138259 4141512 Maybe you don't fully understand<br />the term "reasonable doubt."
4141596 4144139 What do you mean I don't understand?
4145225 4147184 Boy, how do ya like this guy?
4147268 4148936 I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.
4149020 4151915 They come over here, running for their life,<br />and before they can take a deep breath...
4151940 4154316 they're telling us<br />how to run the show, huh?
4154400 4156193 Boy, the arrogance of this guy.
4156277 4160864 Hey, all right. Let's stop<br />the arguing for about two minutes in here.
4160949 4163325 Now, who's got something<br />constructive to say?
4163409 4166954 I'd like to go over something,<br />if you gentlemen don't mind.
4167038 4169706 An important point for the prosecution<br />was the fact...
4169791 4172543 that after the boy claimed<br />he'd been at the movies...
4172627 4174628 during the hours<br />that the killing took place...
4174712 4178590 couldn't remember the names of the movies<br />or the stars who appeared in them.
4178675 4181195 This gentleman here has put up that point<br />in here several times.
4181261 4182719 That's correct.
4182804 4184680 It was the only alibi the boy offered...
4184764 4187266 and he himself couldn't back it up<br />with any details at all.
4187350 4190602 Putting yourself in the boy's place,<br />do you think you could remember details...
4190687 4194147 after an upsetting experience such as<br />being slapped in the face by your father?
4194232 4197442 I think so, if there were<br />any special details to remember.
4197527 4200755 The boy couldn't remember the names of the movies<br />he saw because be wasn't there that night.
4200780 4202823 According to<br />the police testimony in court...
4202907 4206034 the boy was questioned by the detectives<br />in the kitchen of his apartment...
4206119 4209037 while the body of his father<br />was lying on the floor in the bedroom.
4209122 4211722 Do you think you could remember details<br />under those circumstances?
4211791 4213792 I do.<br />Under great emotional stress?
4213877 4216437 Under great emotional stress.<br />He remembered them correctly in court.
4216462 4218481 He named the pictures<br />and the stars who played in them.
4218506 4221675 Yes. His lawyer took great pains<br />to bring that out.
4221759 4224362 He had three months from the night<br />of the murder to the day of the trial...
4224387 4226013 in which to memorize them.
4226097 4228825 It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out<br />what played at a particular theater...
4228850 4230517 on a particular night.
4230602 4234229 I'll take the testimony of the policemen<br />who interrogated the boy right after the murder...
4234314 4236732 when he couldn't remember<br />a thing about the movies...
4236816 4238734 great emotional stress or not.
4238818 4242112 I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br />Go ahead.
4242196 4245449 Where were you last night?<br />I was home.
4245533 4248136 How about the night before that?<br />Come on! What is this?
4248161 4249494 No, it's all right.
4249579 4252122 I left the office at 8:30<br />and went straight home and to bed.
4252206 4253874 And the night before that?
4253958 4256376 That was, uh, Tuesday night?
4256461 4258501 The night of the bridge tournament.<br />I played bridge.
4258546 4259880 Monday night?
4259964 4263175 When you get down<br />to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?
4265178 4267137 Monday night?
4268389 4271391 Monday night, uh,<br />my wife and I went to the movies.
4271476 4273101 What did you see?<br />The Scarlet Circle.
4273186 4276438 It was a clever whodunit.<br />What was the second feature?
4276522 4279149 The, um...
4279233 4281902 I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...
4281986 4286156 Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...
4286240 4288700 The...
4288785 4291453 Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.
4291537 4294289 I saw that.<br />It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
4295583 4297960 Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />I think that's right.
4298044 4300545 Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?
4300630 4304299 Barbara... Long, I think it was.
4304384 4306385 A dark, very pretty girl.
4307720 4310222 Ling or Long - something like that.
4310306 4313517 Who else?<br />I'd never heard of them before.
4313601 4318021 It was a very inexpensive second feature<br />with, uh, unknown...
4318106 4321233 And you weren't under<br />an emotional stress, were you?
4324153 4326279 No.
4326364 4328031 I wasn't.
4329909 4331660 I think the point is made.
4331744 4334496 Big point!
4334580 4336748 You can talk till your tongue<br />is draggin' on the floor.
4336833 4340919 The boy is guilty, period.<br />You know what I mean, my friend?
4341004 4344256 Who's got those cough drops?<br />They're all gone, my friend.
4346259 4348510 Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
4348594 4350971 There goes your ball game.
4351055 4353473 It's only a shower.
4353558 4355726 Besides, they got the infield covered.
4355810 4358979 Right. Say, could I see that knife<br />a second, please?
4361774 4364109 Well, we're still tied up six to six.
4364193 4366194 Who's got a suggestion?
4366279 4368280 It's five after 6:00.<br />Let's get some dinner.
4368364 4370824 Why don't we wait till 7:00,<br />give it another hour, huh?
4370908 4373035 Okay with me.
4373119 4375287 Uh, there's something I'd like to say.
4375371 4378915 I mean, it's been bothering me a little,<br />and as long as we're stuck.
4379000 4382878 Well, there was this whole business<br />about the stab wound and how it was made...
4382962 4384588 the downward angle of it, you know?
4384672 4386673 Don't tell me we're gonna<br />start with that again.
4386758 4388383 They've been over it and over it.
4388468 4390761 Well, I know they did,<br />but I don't go along with it.
4390845 4394848 Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.<br />His father was 6'2".
4394932 4397100 That's a difference of seven inches.
4397185 4399853 It's a very awkward thing to stab down<br />into the chest of someone...
4399937 4401938 who's more than half a foot<br />taller than you are.
4402023 4404149 Give me that.
4404233 4407027 I'll give you a demonstration.<br />Somebody get up.
4408404 4410322 You...
4414827 4417537 I want you to watch this 'cause<br />I don't want to have to do it again.
4417622 4420373 I'll make myself about six<br />or seven inches shorter, okay?
4420458 4423585 It's about right. Maybe a little more.<br />Okay. A little more.
4431385 4433804 That's not funny.
4435890 4439726 Now, nobody's hurt. Right?
4440394 4442187 Right. Nobody hurt.
4445650 4450445 Now, this is the way I'd stab a man<br />who was taller than I was.
4450530 4452989 Look at the angle - down and in.
4453074 4455158 And this is the way it was done.
4455243 4457410 Now tell me I'm wrong.
4459622 4463041 Down and in. I guess there's no argument.<br />Hold it a minute, will ya?
4463126 4464960 Can you give me that?
4465962 4467879 Boy, I hate these things.
4467964 4469631 Did you ever see a knife fight?<br />No.
4469715 4471299 You?<br />No.
4471384 4474177 Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
4474262 4477055 Well, I have.<br />You know, on my back stoop...
4477140 4479474 the lot across the street, backyard.
4479559 4481977 Switchblades came<br />with the neighborhood where I lived.
4482061 4485313 It's funny I never thought of it before.<br />I guess you try to forget those things.
4485398 4488775 How do you use a switchblade?<br />Well, you'd never use it like this.
4490528 4492821 See, you use too much time<br />switching hands.
4494574 4497075 Here's how - underhanded.
4499787 4502831 Anyone who's ever used a switch knife<br />wouldn't handle it any other way.
4502915 4505542 Are you sure?<br />I'm sure.
4505626 4507460 That's why they're made to open like that.
4507545 4510172 You'd say the boy was pretty<br />handy with a knife? Mm-hmm.
4510256 4513425 You think he could have made<br />the kind of wound that killed his father?
4513509 4517429 No. Not with the experience he'd had<br />all his life handling these things.
4517513 4519514 I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.
4519599 4522642 How do you know? Were you<br />in the room when the father was killed?
4522727 4524728 No. Neither was anybody else.
4524812 4528023 So what are you giving us all this<br />mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
4528107 4531419 I don't think you can determine what type<br />of wound the boy might or might not have made...
4531444 4534070 simply because he knew<br />how to handle a knife.
4534155 4536489 What do you think?
4536574 4538658 I don't know.<br />What do you mean you don't know?
4538743 4540577 I don't know.
4544790 4546791 How about you?
4546876 4550688 I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting<br />a little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.
4550713 4554174 It's gettin' us nowhere.<br />So I guess I'll have to break it up.
4554258 4556801 I change my vote to not guilty.
4556886 4560222 You what?<br />You heard me. I've had enough.
4560306 4562766 What do you mean you've had enough?<br />That's no answer!
4562850 4566811 Hey, listen. You just take care<br />of yourself, huh? You know?
4566896 4570857 He's right. That's not an answer.
4570942 4573902 What kind of a man are you?
4573986 4577113 You have sat here and voted guilty<br />with everyone else...
4577198 4581451 because there are some baseball tickets<br />burning a hole in your pocket.
4581535 4585789 And now you've changed your vote because you<br />say you're sick of all the talking here?
4586791 4588250 Now listen, buddy!
4588334 4593004 Who tells you that you have the right<br />to play like this with a man's life?
4593089 4595590 Don't you care.<br />Now wait a minute!
4595675 4599678 You can't talk like that to me!<br />I can talk like that to you.
4599762 4601638 If you want to vote not guilty...
4601722 4604122 then do it because you are convinced<br />the man is not guilty...
4604183 4605976 not because you've had enough.
4606060 4608645 And if you think he is guilty,<br />then vote that way.
4608729 4611940 Or don't you have the guts<br />to do what you think is right?
4612024 4614276 Now listen.<br />Guilty or not guilty?
4615069 4618655 I told you, not guilty.<br />Why?
4620324 4621950 Look, I don't have to...
4622034 4625161 You do have to! Say it! Why?
4625246 4627706 All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.
4637216 4638842 I want another vote.
4638926 4641428 Okay. There's another vote called for.
4641512 4644389 I guess the quickest way is a show<br />of hands. Anyone object?
4644473 4647392 Okay. All those voting not guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4648311 4653481 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
4656319 4657986 eight.
4661907 4664034 Um, nine.
4665036 4670040 Um, all those voting guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4670124 4672500 One, two, three.
4672585 4675086 Well, the vote's nine to three<br />in favor of acquittal.
4676088 4678256 I don't understand you people!
4678341 4680568 I mean, all these picky little points<br />you keep bringing up.
4680593 4683928 They don't mean nothing!<br />You saw this kid just like I did.
4684013 4687515 You're not gonna tell me you believe<br />that phony story about losing the knife...
4687600 4689601 and that business<br />about being at the movies.
4689685 4692687 Look, you know how these people lie.<br />It's born in them.
4692772 4694814 I mean, what the heck.<br />I don't have to tell you.
4694899 4696858 They don't know what the truth is.
4696942 4700653 And let me tell you, they don't need<br />any real big reason to kill someone either.
4700738 4702489 No, sir.
4702573 4705617 They get drunk!<br />Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
4705701 4708870 You know that.<br />And bang - someone's lying in the gutter.
4708954 4711956 Well, nobody's blaming them for it.<br />That's the way they are, by nature.
4712041 4714125 You know what I mean? Violent!
4714210 4715710 Where are you going?
4715795 4718797 Human life don't mean<br />as much to them as it does to us.
4719799 4722801 Look! They're lushing it up<br />and fighting all the time...
4722885 4724945 and if somebody gets killed,<br />so somebody gets killed!
4724970 4726346 They don't care!
4726430 4728640 Oh, sure, there's some good things<br />about 'em too.
4728724 4730683 Look, I'm the first one to say that.
4730768 4734062 I've known a couple who were okay,<br />but that's the exception, you know what I mean?
4734146 4737899 Most of 'em, it's like they have<br />no feelings. They can do anything.
4737983 4740568 What's going on here?
4740653 4742695 I'm - I'm trying to tell ya...
4742780 4744781 you're making a big mistake, you people.
4744865 4747867 This kid is a liar!<br />I know it. I know all about them.
4749578 4751746 Listen to me.<br />They're no good.
4751831 4754165 There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
4756210 4758670 I mean, what.<br />What's happening in here?
4758754 4761005 I'm speaking my piece, and you...
4762216 4763883 Listen to me.
4764969 4766428 I...
4766512 4768972 We're - This kid on trial here, his type...
4769056 4771057 Well, don't you know about them?
4773018 4776479 Th-There's - There's a danger here.
4776564 4778648 These people are dangerous.
4778732 4781776 They're... wild.
4781861 4783778 Listen to me.
4783863 4786197 Listen.<br />I have.
4786282 4789284 Now sit down<br />and don't open your mouth again.
4793205 4795957 I was only trying to... tell you.
4832453 4836748 It's always difficult to keep personal<br />prejudice out of a thing like this.
4837875 4841878 Wherever you run into it,<br />prejudice always obscures the truth.
4843464 4845840 I don't really know what the truth is.
4845925 4848843 I don't suppose anybody<br />will ever really know.
4850137 4854098 Nine of us now seem to feel<br />that the defendant is innocent.
4854183 4857185 But we're just gambling on probabilities.
4857269 4859229 We may be wrong.
4859313 4861689 We may be trying to let<br />a guilty man go free.
4861774 4863233 I don't know.
4863317 4865318 Nobody really can.
4865402 4867779 But we have a reasonable doubt...
4867863 4871366 and that's something<br />that's very valuable in our system.
4871450 4875995 No jury can declare a man guilty<br />unless it's sure.
4877456 4879832 We nine can't understand...
4879917 4882627 how you three are still so sure.
4883462 4885463 Maybe you can tell us.<br />I'll try.
4886840 4890343 You've made some excellent points, but I still<br />believe the boy is guilty of murder...
4890427 4892136 and I have two reasons.
4892221 4895348 One, the evidence<br />given by the woman across the street...
4895432 4898059 who actually saw the murder committed.
4898143 4900728 As far as I'm concerned,<br />that's the most important testimony.
4900813 4904065 And two, the fact that she<br />described the stabbing by saying...
4904149 4909779 she saw the boy raise his arm over his head<br />and stab down into the father's chest.
4909863 4911906 She saw him do it the wrong way.
4911991 4913908 That's absolutely right.
4913993 4916578 Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
4916662 4919747 She said she went to bed<br />about 11:00 that night.
4919832 4923418 Her bed was next to the window,<br />and she could look out while lying down...
4923502 4927589 and see directly into the boy's room<br />across the street.
4927673 4930300 She tossed and turned for over an hour,<br />unable to sleep.
4930384 4934554 Finally, she turned toward the window<br />at about 10 minutes after 12:00...
4934638 4939767 and, as she looked out, she saw the killing<br />through the windows of a passing el train.
4939852 4942562 She said the lights went out<br />immediately after the killing...
4942646 4947442 but that she got a good look at the boy<br />in the act of stabbing his father.
4948444 4952280 As far as I can see it,<br />this is unshakable testimony.
4953032 4955700 Well, that's the whole case.<br />What do you think?
4961081 4962749 How about you?
4964376 4966836 I-I don't know.
4966920 4968921 So much evidence to sift.
4969006 4970965 This is a pretty complicated business.
4971050 4974844 Frankly, I don't see<br />how you can vote for acquittal.
4974928 4977263 It's not so easy to arrange<br />all the evidence in order.
4977348 4979428 You can throw out<br />all the other evidence!
4979475 4983061 The woman saw him do it!<br />What else do you want?
4983145 4985021 Yeah, well, maybe.<br />Let's vote on it.
4985105 4987273 Okay. There's another vote called for.
4987358 4989192 Anybody object?
4989276 4992320 All right. I'm changing my vote.<br />He's guilty.
4992404 4994822 Anybody else?<br />The vote is eight to four.
4994907 4998493 Why is this such a personal triumph<br />for you - this one vote?
4998577 5002038 Okay. I say we're a hung jury.<br />I say we take it in to the judge.
5002122 5004832 How about it?<br />I want to hear arguments.
5004917 5007418 You, you're the leader of the cause.<br />What about it?
5009672 5011506 Let's go over it again.
5011590 5013508 We've been over it again!
5013592 5018388 The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'<br />backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.
5018472 5022308 No point in getting nasty<br />and trying to turn this into a contest.
5024269 5025728 Okay.
5025813 5028856 Maybe we can talk about<br />setting some kind of time limit.
5028941 5031067 Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?
5031777 5035530 It's a quarter after 6:00.
5035614 5037573 Someone before mentioned 7:00.
5037658 5040034 I think that's a point at which<br />we might begin to discuss...
5040119 5043371 the question of whether<br />we're a hung jury or not.
5043455 5045123 Don't you feel well?
5046458 5048418 I feel perfectly well, thank you.
5048502 5051212 I was saying that 7:00<br />would be a reasonable time.
5051296 5054215 Uh, the reason I asked about that<br />was because, uh...
5054299 5055883 you were rubbing your nose like...
5055968 5058636 Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...
5058721 5061931 but you made a gesture<br />that reminded me of something.
5062015 5064058 I'm trying to settle something here.<br />Do you mind?
5064143 5066144 Well, I think this is important.
5067229 5069021 Thank you.
5069106 5071733 Now then,<br />I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...
5071817 5074736 but I was wondering why<br />you were rubbing your nose like that.
5074820 5076487 Oh, come on, will ya?
5076572 5080742 At this point, I happen to be talking<br />to the gentleman sitting next to you!
5080826 5084078 Now, why were you rubbing<br />your nose like that?
5084163 5088249 Well, if it's any of your business, I was rubbing<br />it because it bothers me a little.
5088333 5089959 Oh. I'm sorry.
5090043 5093921 Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses?<br />It is.
5094006 5095757 Now can we get on to something else?
5095841 5100428 Your eyeglasses made those two<br />deep impressions on the sides of your nose.
5100512 5102680 I hadn't noticed that before.
5102765 5106267 That must be annoying.<br />It is very annoying.
5106351 5108269 Well, I wouldn't know about that.
5108353 5111689 I've never worn eyeglasses.<br />Twenty-twenty.
5111774 5114317 Listen, will you come on already<br />with the optometrist bit?
5116236 5119781 The woman who testified<br />that she saw the killing...
5119865 5123409 had those same marks<br />on the sides of her nose.
5124411 5126621 Holy smokes! You know, he's right.
5126705 5128372 Please.
5128457 5132210 Just give me a minute,<br />and I'll be finished.
5132294 5135129 I don't know if anyone else<br />noticed that about her.
5135214 5139091 I didn't think of it then,<br />but I've been going over her face...
5140135 5142261 in my mind.
5142346 5144347 She had those same marks.
5145349 5149519 She kept rubbing them in court.<br />He's right. She did do that a lot.
5150562 5155233 This woman was about, uh.<br />about 45 years old.
5155317 5159278 She was making a tremendous effort<br />to look 35...
5159363 5161572 for her first public appearance.
5161657 5164909 Heavy makeup, dyed hair...
5164993 5168871 brand-new clothes that should have<br />been worn by a younger woman.
5168956 5170623 No glasses.
5170707 5172375 No, women do that.
5172459 5174877 See if you can get<br />the mental picture of it.
5174962 5176796 What do you mean, no glasses?
5176880 5179650 How do you know whether she wore glasses?<br />Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
5179675 5181884 Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.
5181969 5183886 So what?<br />What do ya think that means?
5183971 5187181 Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling<br />in here! Come on. Forget it.
5187266 5190268 Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.<br />I saw them too.
5190352 5193539 I was the closest one to her. She had these,<br />uh - these things on the side of her nose.
5193564 5196774 What do you call those on the side?<br />Well, what point are you making here?
5196859 5200736 She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br />Well, what does that mean?
5200821 5205116 Could those marks be made<br />by anything other than eyeglasses?
5208704 5211038 No, they couldn't.
5211123 5213124 I didn't see any marks!
5214751 5216460 I did.
5216545 5219088 Strange, but I didn't<br />think about it before.
5219172 5221358 Well, what about the lawyer?<br />Why didn't he say something?
5221383 5224302 There are 12 people in here<br />concentrating on this case.
5224386 5226470 Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
5226555 5229755 Well, what about the district attorney?<br />Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?
5229808 5231684 Have her testify without her glasses?
5231810 5235789 Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and didn't<br />want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?
5235814 5239317 Okay. She had marks on her nose.
5239401 5243070 I'm giving you that.<br />From glasses, right?
5243155 5247325 She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house<br />so people would think she's gorgeous.
5247409 5251996 But when she saw this kid killing<br />his father, she was in the house alone.
5252080 5254290 That's all.
5254374 5258377 Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?<br />No, I don't.
5260088 5262006 No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
5262090 5265092 It's logical to assume that she wasn't<br />wearing them when she was in bed...
5265177 5266928 tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.
5267012 5269347 How do you know?<br />I don't know! I'm guessing.
5269431 5271950 I'm also guessing that she probably<br />didn't put her glasses on...
5271975 5274101 when she turned<br />to look casually out of the window.
5274186 5276997 And she herself testified the killing<br />took place just as she looked out.
5277022 5280125 The lights went off a split second later. She<br />couldn't have had time to put them on then.
5280150 5281776 Wait a second.<br />Here's another guess.
5281860 5285947 Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy<br />kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.
5286031 5289617 How do you know what she saw?<br />How does he know all that?
5289701 5292512 How do you know what kind of glasses<br />she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.
5292537 5295164 Maybe she was farsighted.<br />What do you know about it?
5295248 5298501 I only know the woman's eyesight<br />is in question now.
5298585 5304715 She had to be able to identify a person<br />60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
5304800 5307176 You can't send someone off to die<br />on evidence like that.
5307260 5309261 Oh, don't give me that.
5309346 5311514 Don't you think the woman<br />might have made a mistake?
5311598 5314016 No.<br />It's not possible?
5314101 5315726 No, it's not possible.
5318689 5320606 Is it possible?
5321733 5323401 Not guilty.
5327572 5330241 Do you think he's guilty?
5330325 5332326 I think he's guilty.
5335080 5336747 Do you?
5339626 5342670 No. I'm convinced.
5342754 5344338 Not guilty.
5344423 5346215 What's the matter with you?
5346299 5348217 I have a reasonable doubt now.
5348301 5349844 Eleven to one.
5349928 5352847 Well, what about all the other evidence?<br />What about all that stuff?
5352931 5355016 The knife, the whole business!
5355100 5358019 Well, you said we could throw out<br />all the other evidence.
5363775 5365943 Well, what do we do now?
5368947 5370614 You're alone.
5370699 5374535 I don't care whether I'm alone or not!<br />It's my right.
5377706 5379874 It's your right.
5389009 5391427 Well, what do you want?<br />I say he's guilty.
5393055 5396390 We want to hear your arguments.<br />I gave you my arguments.
5397392 5399518 We're not convinced.
5399603 5402396 We want to hear them again.
5402481 5404482 We have as much time as it takes.
5410155 5414617 Everything - Every single thing<br />that took place in that courtroom...
5414701 5416619 but I mean everything.<br />says he's guilty.
5416703 5419163 What do you think,<br />I'm an idiot or something?
5420832 5422917 Why don't you take that stuff<br />about the old man?
5423001 5426170 The old man who lived there<br />and heard everything.
5427839 5429507 Or this business about the knife.
5429591 5431592 What? 'Cause he found another one<br />exactly like it?
5431676 5435012 The old man saw him<br />right there on the stairs!
5435097 5437932 What's the difference<br />how many seconds it was?
5439101 5441102 Every single thing.
5442521 5445689 The knife falling through<br />a hole in his pocket.
5445774 5449110 You can't prove he didn't get to the door.
5449194 5451612 Sure, you can take all the time,<br />hobble around the room.
5451696 5454281 But you can't prove it!
5456201 5459829 And what about this business<br />of the el and the movies?
5459913 5462957 There's a phony deal<br />if I ever heard one.
5463041 5467253 I'll bet ya $5,000<br />I'd remember the movies I saw.
5467337 5469588 I'm telling ya,<br />everything that's gone on...
5469673 5473509 has been twisted and turned!
5473593 5475678 This business with the glasses?
5475762 5481308 How do you know she didn't have them on?<br />This woman testified in open court!
5481393 5485354 And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?
5485438 5488691 I'm telling ya, I've got<br />all the facts here.
5489860 5491735 Here. Ah...
5494114 5496615 Well, that's it!<br />That's the whole case.
5503832 5505416 Well?
5507711 5509712 Say something!
5514843 5518429 You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.
5519097 5521015 You're not gonna intimidate me.
5521099 5523601 I'm entitled to my opinion.
5526980 5531275 Rotten kids.<br />You work your life out!
5536114 5538073 I can't keep...
5542746 5544413 No.
5548293 5550127 Not guilty.
5553506 5555174 Not guilty.
5558178 5559803 Not...
5570357 5572524 Um, we're ready now.
5686181 5687848 Hey!
5692187 5693854 What's your name?
5693938 5695439 Davis.
5695523 5697441 My name's McCardle.
5699778 5701445 Well, so long.
5701529 5703030 So long.
