72381 75373 [PEOPLE CHATTERING, LAUGHING]
76760 78966 MAN: Thank you very much, sir.
79053 81215 You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
81306 83673 -[MEN LAUGHING]<br />-Shh. Shh.
83766 85184 MAN: We did it, Pete. We did it.
85268 87179 [LAUGHTER CONTINUES]
87270 88979 -MAN 2: For a moment, we had our doubts.<br />-GUARD: Shh.
89063 92483 [PERFUNCTORILY] To continue,<br />you've listened to a long and complex case
92567 94353 murder in the first degree.
94444 99405 A premeditated murder is the most serious<br />charge tried in our criminal courts.
99490 101231 You've listened to the testimony.
101326 104244 You've had the law read to you and<br />interpreted as it applies in this case.
104328 108322 It's now your duty to sit down and try<br />and separate the facts from the fancy.
109249 112787 One man is dead.<br />Another man's life is at stake.
113587 117581 If there's a reasonable doubt in your<br />minds as to the guilt of the accused
117674 119585 a reasonable doubt
119676 122464 then you must bring<br />me a verdict of not guilty.
122554 124429 Now if, however, there's<br />no reasonable doubt
124513 128381 then you must in good<br />conscience find the accused guilty.
129518 133637 However you decide, your<br />verdict must be unanimous.
133731 137099 In the event that you<br />find the accused guilty
137193 140527 the bench will not entertain<br />a recommendation for mercy.
140613 143822 The death sentence is<br />mandatory in this case.
143908 147616 You're faced with a grave responsibility.<br />Thank you, gentlemen.
149621 151658 The alternate jurors are excused.
152707 154038 [COUGHS]
157671 159662 The jury will now retire.
271488 274480 [SCATTERED CHATTERING]
277660 280110 MAN [AT WINDOW]: Try this one.<br />See if I can get it
280997 282737 MAN 2: It's a muggy day.
286001 288368 -Hey. Oh, oh.<br />-[HORNS HONKING]

300432 302514 -Piece of gum?<br />-No, thanks.
302601 305082 [BANGING ON WINDOW] This thing is…
305166 306385 -Huh?<br />-…move it.
308022 310190 -Come on, I'll give you a hand.<br />-Give me a hand with that.
310274 311605 That's it.
313194 315936 [SIGHS, EXHALES]
317240 318856 -You know something?<br />-Yeah?
318950 320701 I called the weather bureau this morning.
320785 322703 This is gonna be the<br />hottest day of the year.
322787 324369 Could be.
324455 326372 Boy, you'd think they'd at<br />least air-condition these places.
326456 329790 -What is your name, sir?<br />-Oh, it's, uh… That one, yeah.
329876 331287 Thank you very much.
331378 334120 Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.
334214 337050 Now, if there's anything you<br />want, I'll be right outside the door.
337134 339375 -Just knock.<br />-Okay, thanks. We will.
346268 348384 [KEY TURNS IN LOCK]
351897 353103 Good morning.
353190 354649 I never knew they locked the door.
354733 356895 Sure they lock the door. What'd you think?
357987 360399 I don't know.<br />It just never occurred to me.
362032 363818 What's that for?
363909 365786 Oh, I thought we might<br />want to vote by ballot.
365870 368532 Great idea.<br />Maybe we can get him elected senator.
368622 370704 [LAUGHING, COUGHING]
370791 372531 Just in case, you know.
376045 378161 -How'd you like it?<br />-Oh, I don't know.
378256 379917 It was pretty interesting.
380008 381965 Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
382051 384634 I mean, I've never been on a jury before.
384721 387429 No? I've sat on many juries.
388600 391519 What gets me is the way those<br />lawyers talk and talk and talk
391603 393770 even when it's an<br />open-and-shut case like this one.
393854 395563 Did you ever hear so<br />much talk about nothin'?
395647 397513 Well, I guess they're entitled.
397608 400066 Yeah. They're entitled.<br />It's the system, but
401278 405363 If you ask me, I'd slap those tough<br />kids down before they start any trouble.
405449 407531 It would save us a lot of time and money.
407618 409160 -Hey, let's get started, huh?<br />-That's a good idea.
409244 411871 MAN IN HAT: Yeah, let's get goin', huh?<br />We probably all got things to do here.
411955 413358 I figured we'd start<br />out with a five-minute
413442 414999 break.<br />There's one gentleman in the bathroom.
415083 416038 -Mr. Foreman.<br />-Huh?
416125 418919 -Are, uh… Are we gonna sit in order?<br />-Gee, I don't know.
419003 420744 I, uh… Well, I guess so.
425760 427216 Uh, you're in my seat.
427303 429294 -Oh. Excuse me.<br />-That's all right.
431849 433590 Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
437230 439687 What did you think of the case?
439773 441810 I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
441900 445018 No real… dead spots. You know what I mean?
445904 448362 I tell you, we were lucky<br />to get a murder case.
448448 450408 I figured us for an assault or burglary.
450492 452733 Boy, they can be the dullest.
452827 454238 [SNIFFS]
454329 455615 Hey.
455705 457287 That the Woolworth Building?
457374 459285 That's right.
459376 460957 [CHUCKLES] isn't that funny?
461043 463420 You know, I've lived here all my life.<br />I've never been inside that.
463504 465589 MAN WITH COLD: If you<br />had to sort out all that junk
465673 467755 Like that thing with the movies.
467841 469241 MAN WITH HAT: Yeah.<br />You can say that again.
469325 470844 And what about that<br />business with the knife?
470928 473805 I mean, asking grown-up people<br />to believe that kind of jazz, huh?
473889 476349 Well, I expected that.<br />You know what we're dealing with.
476433 478891 -Yeah, I guess so.<br />-[BLOWS NOSE]
478978 480687 Well, your horn works.<br />Now try your lights.
480771 482261 [LAUGHS]
482356 483814 -What do you got, a cold?<br />-And how.
483898 486105 These hot-weather colds can kill you.
486192 488604 I can hardly touch my nose.<br />You know what I mean?
488695 492233 I sure do. I just got over one.
492323 494187 Aw, come on.<br />Mr. Foreman, let's go here, huh?
494271 495075 [SNAPPING FINGERS]
495159 496785 Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.
496869 499705 Hey, what's new? I didn't get a<br />chance to see a paper this morning.
499789 500870 Hmm?
500957 503369 I was only wondering<br />how the market closed.
503459 506166 You got a seat on the Exchange?
506253 507994 I'm a broker.
508088 512457 I run a messenger service…<br />the Beck and Call Company.
512551 514667 The name is my wife's idea.
514761 518379 Got 37 men working. Started with nothing.
518473 521636 Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?
521727 524719 [CHATTERING]
524813 526648 Yeah, we can all get outta<br />here pretty quick, huh?
526732 528360 I don't know about the<br />rest of you, but I happen
528444 529942 to have tickets to that ball game tonight.
530026 531858 Yanks and Cleveland.
531944 533737 Yeah, we got this kid,<br />Modjelewski, in there.
533821 535482 Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.
535573 537689 You know… Phoom!
537783 540024 A real jug handle. You know?
540119 542360 Phoom!
542455 544790 You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?<br />Huh? Yeah.
544874 546330 Where do we sit here?
546417 549500 Well, I thought we'd sit in<br />order, you know, by jury numbers.
549587 552004 One, two, three, four, five…<br />so on, around the table.
552088 553339 If that's okay with you gentlemen.
553423 554507 -Sure.<br />-What's the difference?
554591 557629 -I think it's reasonable to sit in order.<br />-Let it be.
557719 559971 -Number 12. Do I sit down here?<br />-Yeah. That's 12. We go around
560055 563307 -We start with you. One, right?<br />-One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.
563391 565726 What was your impression<br />of the prosecuting attorney?
565810 567517 Okay. Two. You're two.
567604 568765 I beg pardon?
568855 573018 I thought he was really sharp, the way<br />he handled all those points one by one.
573108 576226 Logical sequence. I was very impressed.
576320 579312 I think he… he did an expert job.
579406 582398 A lot of drive too, you know? Real drive.
582493 584243 Okay, fellas, can we<br />hold it down a minute?
584327 584577 Sure.
584661 586243 -Uh, fellas.<br />-[TAPS ON TABLE]
586330 589789 Say, we'd like to get started.<br />Gentleman at the window.
591460 593622 -We'd like to get started.<br />-Oh, I'm sorry.
593712 597381 Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid<br />kills his father… bing, just like that.
597465 600050 Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,<br />you'll see it happens all the time.
600134 602045 They let those kids run wild up there.
602136 604844 Well, maybe it serves 'em right.<br />You know what I mean?
604931 606513 Is… is everyone here?
606599 608431 The old man is inside.
608518 611135 Oh.<br />Would you, uh, knock on the door for him?
611229 613186 You a Yankee fan?
613272 614808 No. Baltimore.
615733 617223 -Baltimore?<br />-Yeah.
618527 621070 That's like being hit in the<br />head with a crowbar once a day.
621154 622736 [CHUCKLES]
622823 624063 Who have they got?
624157 626576 No, I mean, who have they got<br />besides good groundskeepers?
626660 628202 FOREMAN: Say, uh,<br />we'd like to get started.
628286 631486 Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.<br />I… I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
632124 633910 Baltimore?
634000 636788 Okay, gentlemen, if I<br />can have your attention.
636878 639836 You fellas can handle this<br />thing any way that you want to.
639923 642414 I'm, um… You know, I'm<br />not gonna make any rules.
642508 645796 Uh, we can, well, discuss it<br />first and, uh, then vote on it.
645886 648548 That's, of course, uh…<br />That's, uh, one way.
648639 651597 And, uh, well, we can<br />vote on it right now, and
651684 654176 I think it's customary to<br />take a preliminary vote.
654270 657856 Yeah, let's… Let's vote. Who knows?<br />Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?
657940 659647 Uh-huh.
659733 662816 Okay, then I think that, uh
662902 665780 Of course you know that we have<br />a first-degree murder charge here,
665864 667946 and if we vote the accused guilty
668032 671275 uh, we've got to send him to the chair.
671369 675112 -Um, that's mandatory.<br />-I think we know that.
675206 676957 -Let's see who's where.<br />-We might as well.
677041 680830 -Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?<br />-All right with me.
682046 686630 Okay. Then, uh, just remember that<br />this has to be 12 to nothing either way.
686717 688173 Um, that's the law.
688260 690297 Okay, are we ready?
690387 693379 Now, all those voting guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
697394 700887 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
702232 704815 eight, nine, 10, 11.
704902 707814 Okay. That's 11 guilty.
707904 709394 Those voting not guilty.
710573 712655 One. Right.
712742 715029 That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.
715953 717535 Well, now we know where we are.
717622 721786 Boy, oh, boy.<br />There's always one. [LAUGHING]
722335 724622 So, what do we do now?
724712 726544 Well, I guess we talk.
726631 727962 Boy, oh, boy.
728049 729881 You really think he's innocent?
733345 734881 I don't know.
734971 737849 I mean, you sat in court with the<br />rest of us. You heard what we did.
737933 740059 The kid's a dangerous killer.<br />You could see it.
740143 741759 He's 18 years old.
741853 743935 Well, that's old enough. He
744022 746684 He stabbed his own father<br />four inches into the chest.
746775 749026 They proved it a dozen<br />different ways in court.
749110 751647 Would you like me to list them for you?
751738 753023 No.
753113 755195 Then what do you want?
755282 758195 -I just want to talk.<br />-What's there to talk about?
758285 759619 Eleven men in here think he's guilty.
759703 761953 No one had to think<br />about it twice except you.
762039 765248 I want to ask you something.<br />Do you believe his story?
765334 768044 I don't know whether I believe it or not.<br />Maybe I don't.
768128 769713 So how come you vote not guilty?
769797 771708 Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.
771799 774551 It's not easy to raise my<br />hand and send a boy off to die
774635 776716 without talking about it first.
776803 779215 -Well, now, who says it's easy?<br />-No one.
780515 782677 What, just because I voted fast?
782767 785179 I honestly think the guy's guilty.
785270 788063 You couldn't change my mind if<br />you talked for a hundred years.
788147 790649 I'm not trying to change your mind.<br />It's just that
790733 792974 We're talking about somebody's life here.
793069 795154 We can't decide it in five minutes.<br />Supposing we're wrong.
795238 796649 "Supposing we're wrong."
796739 798740 Supposing this whole building<br />should fall down on my head.
798824 800824 -You can suppose anything.<br />-That's right.
801660 803411 Look, what's the<br />difference how long it takes?
803495 806078 Suppose we do it in five minutes. So what?
806164 808280 Let's take an hour.
808375 810286 The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.
813005 814166 Hmm?
816341 818173 Who's got something to say?
818260 819677 I'm willing to sit for an hour.
819761 822468 Great.<br />I heard a pretty good story last night.
822555 824637 That's not why we're sitting here.
825349 828887 All right, then you tell me.<br />What are we sitting here for?
830146 831978 I don't know. Maybe no reason.
832982 836441 Look, this kid's been<br />kicked around all of his life
836527 840441 you know, born in a slum,<br />mother dead since he was nine.
840531 842740 He lived for a year and a<br />half in an orphanage when his
842824 845737 his father was serving<br />a jail term for forgery.
845827 848159 It's not a very happy beginning.
848246 850362 He's a… a wild, angry kid.
850457 852166 That's all he's ever been.<br />And you know why?
852250 855959 'Cause he's been hit on the head<br />by somebody once a day every day.
856046 858256 He's had a… He's had a<br />pretty miserable 18 years.
858340 861298 I… I just think we owe him a few words.<br />That's all.
861384 864922 I don't mind telling you this, mister.<br />We don't owe him a thing.
865012 868098 He got a fair trial, didn't he?<br />What do you think that trial cost?
868182 870155 He's lucky he got it.<br />You know what I mean?
870239 871268 JUROR 7: You know it.
871352 873684 Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.
873771 875637 We heard the facts, didn't we?
875731 877635 You're not gonna tell<br />me that we're supposed
877719 879526 to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
879610 881977 Listen, I've lived among them all my life.
882071 885405 You can't believe a word they say.<br />You know that.
885491 887323 I mean, they're born liars.
887409 890742 -Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br />-Now listen
890828 893661 Do you think you were born<br />with a monopoly on the truth?
893748 896333 I think certain things should<br />be pointed out to this man.
896417 898502 JUROR 7: Come on. This isn't Sunday.<br />We don't need a sermon.
898586 901286 FOREMAN: Come on.<br />We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
901881 904919 Rice Pops.<br />It's a product I work on at the agency.
905760 908377 "The breakfast with the built-in bounce."
908471 910086 -I wrote that line.<br />-Very catchy.
910180 912342 -Yeah.<br />-Say, do you mind?
912432 914139 Oh, I'm sorry.
914226 916686 I have this habit of doodling.<br />Keeps me thinking clearly.
916770 918477 Yeah, we have all this work to do.
918563 920273 -There's no point staying here forever.<br />-Sorry.
920357 922556 Okay. Um… Okay. Um
922651 926440 perhaps if the gentleman down<br />there who's disagreeing with us
926530 929824 Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You<br />know, let us know what you're thinking.
929908 932284 And we might be able to show<br />you where you're mixed up.
932368 934036 Well, look, maybe… Maybe this is an idea.
934120 936538 Now, I haven't given it much<br />thought, but it seems to me
936622 938650 that it's up to the<br />group of us to convince
938734 941043 this gentleman that he's<br />wrong and we're right.
941127 943877 Now, maybe if we each took<br />a couple of minutes just to
945089 946506 Well, it was just a quick idea.
946590 948050 No, no, no. That's a good one.
948134 951217 Uh, suppose we go once around the table.
951303 954170 -I guess you're first.<br />-Oh.
954265 955595 Well, uh
957142 959554 Well, it… it's hard to put into words.
960603 962594 I just think he's guilty.
962689 965181 I thought it was obvious<br />from the word "go."
965275 966776 I mean, nobody proved otherwise.
966860 968396 Nobody has to prove otherwise.
968486 970727 The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
970822 973280 The defendant doesn't<br />even have to open his mouth.
973366 976484 -That's in the Constitution.<br />-Oh, well, sure, I know that.
976578 978534 Uh, what I meant was, is
980330 982321 Well, I just think he's guilty.
982416 984123 I… I mean, somebody saw him do it.
984209 989249 Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I<br />have no personal feelings about this.
989339 991501 I just want to talk about facts.
992509 994625 -Number one.<br />-[NOTEBOOK RUSTLES]
995179 999298 The old man lived downstairs under<br />the room where the killing took place.
999391 1001517 At ten minutes after 12:00<br />on the night of the killing
1001601 1005265 he heard loud noises,<br />said it sounded like a fight.
1005354 1008221 And he heard the kid<br />yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."
1008316 1010603 A second later, he<br />heard a body hit the floor.
1010693 1012400 Ran to the door, opened it up
1012487 1014905 saw the kid running down<br />the stairs and out of the house.
1014989 1016275 Called the police.
1016365 1019034 They came in, found the old<br />man with a knife in his chest.
1019118 1022360 The coroner fixed the time<br />of death around midnight.
1022454 1025537 Now these are facts.<br />You can't refute facts.
1025624 1027786 The kid is guilty.
1027876 1029877 I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
1029961 1033829 I know he's only 18, but he's<br />still gotta pay for what he did.
1033924 1035380 JUROR 7: I'm with you.
1035467 1038004 FOREMAN: Okay. Are you finished?
1038094 1039550 -Yeah.<br />-Right. Next.
1039638 1042849 It is obvious, to me anyway, that<br />the boy's entire story was flimsy.
1042933 1045142 He claimed he was at the<br />movies during the time of the killing,
1045226 1047769 and yet, one hour later, he couldn't<br />remember the names of the films he saw,
1047853 1049688 -or who played in them.<br />-JUROR 3: That's right.
1049772 1052065 And no one saw him<br />going in or out of the theater.
1052149 1053775 Listen, what about the<br />woman across the street?
1053859 1056146 If her testimony don't<br />prove it, nothing does.
1056237 1058572 That's right. She was the one<br />who actually saw the killing.
1058656 1061074 FOREMAN: Now, fellas, please.<br />Let's go in order here, huh?
1061158 1064401 Just a minute. Here's a woman [COUGHING]
1064495 1066955 Here's a woman who was lying in bed.<br />She can't sleep.
1067039 1068956 She's dying with the heat.<br />You know what I mean?
1069040 1070872 Anyway, she looks out the window,
1070959 1074545 and right across the street she sees<br />the kid stick the knife into his father.
1074629 1077496 [DEEP BREATH] The<br />time is 12:10 on the nose.
1077590 1079456 Everything fits.
1079551 1081385 Look, she's known the kid all his life.
1081469 1083596 His window is right opposite<br />hers across the el tracks,
1083680 1085341 and she swore she saw him do it.
1085431 1087651 Through the windows<br />of the passing el train.
1087735 1088093 Right.
1088184 1092347 This el train had no passengers on it.<br />It was just being moved downtown.
1092437 1095356 The lights were out, remember?<br />And they proved in court that, at night
1095440 1097859 you can look through the windows<br />of an el train when the lights are out,
1097943 1100275 and see what's happening<br />on the other side.
1100362 1103195 -They proved it.<br />-I'd like to ask you something.
1103282 1105950 You don't believe the boy's story.<br />How come you believe the woman's?
1106034 1107775 She's one of <i>them</i> too, isn't she?
1110455 1112455 You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?
1112540 1113951 -Okay, gentlemen.<br />-Now, now.
1114041 1116251 -Now, gentlemen.<br />-Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
1116335 1118872 Oh, what's he so wise about?<br />I'm telling you.
1118963 1122216 FOREMAN: Okay, now come on.<br />Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.
1122300 1123540 Whose turn is it next?
1123634 1126467 JUROR 12: Oh, uh, his. Number five.
1128723 1131465 Okay, may I… Can I pass? It
1132268 1134305 Well, uh, that's your privilege.
1134395 1137512 Uh, how about the next gentleman?
1137606 1140268 Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.
1140358 1144568 I started to be convinced, you<br />know, very early in the case.
1145155 1149274 You see, I was looking for a motive.<br />That's very important.
1149367 1153577 Because if you don't have a<br />motive, where's your case, right?
1153663 1156746 Anyway, that, uh,<br />testimony from those people
1156833 1159870 in the apartment across the<br />hall from the kid's apartment
1159960 1162201 that was very powerful.
1162296 1165090 Didn't they say something<br />about a… a fight and an argument
1165174 1169589 between the old man and his son<br />around about, uh, 7:00 that night?
1169678 1172136 -I mean, I could be wrong, but I…<br />-It was 8:00.
1172222 1174266 It was 8:00. That's right.<br />They heard an argument.
1174350 1176101 They couldn't hear what it was about.
1176185 1178144 Then they heard the<br />father hit the boy twice.
1178228 1178637 [COUGHING]
1178721 1181188 Finally they saw the boy<br />run angrily out of the house.
1181272 1182854 What does that prove?
1182941 1186605 Well, it don't exactly prove anything.<br />It's just part of the picture.
1186694 1189613 Well, you said it provided a motive. The<br />prosecuting attorney said the same thing.
1189697 1191938 I don't think that was<br />a very strong motive.
1192033 1195619 This boy's been hit so many times<br />in his life that violence is practically a
1195703 1198070 It's a normal state of affairs with him.
1198164 1202373 I just… I can't see two slaps in the face<br />provoking him into committing murder.
1202459 1206043 It may have been two too many.<br />Everyone has a breaking point.
1208590 1210672 FOREMAN: Anything else?
1210759 1213217 -No.<br />-Okay.
1213303 1215044 Uh, how about you?
1216890 1218847 I don't know. It's all been said.
1220394 1223011 You can talk here forever.<br />It's still the same thing.
1224231 1227188 This kid is five for 0.
1227274 1229140 Well, look at his record.
1229235 1231442 When he was ten, he<br />was in children's court.
1231529 1233315 He threw a rock at a teacher.
1233406 1235693 When he was 15, he was in reform school.
1235783 1237615 He stole a car.
1237702 1240194 He's been arrested for mugging.
1240287 1242289 He was picked up twice for knife fighting.
1242373 1244458 Oh, yeah, they say he's<br />real handy with a knife.
1244542 1247329 [SCOFFS] Oh, this is a very fine boy.
1247419 1250421 Ever since he was five years<br />old, his father beat him up regularly.
1250505 1252917 -He used his fists.<br />-Well, so would I.
1253008 1254498 A kid like that? [SCOFFS]
1254592 1257755 It's these kids, the<br />way they are nowadays.
1260265 1263428 When I was a kid, I<br />used to call my father "sir."
1264185 1265471 That's right. "Sir."
1265562 1267521 Do you ever hear a kid<br />call his father that anymore?
1267605 1270555 JUROR 8: Fathers don't seem<br />to think it's important anymore.
1270899 1272936 -You got any kids?<br />-Three.
1274319 1275650 I got one.
1277156 1278897 Twenty-two years old.
1280784 1281945 [MURMURS]
1285039 1287781 When he was nine years<br />old, he ran away from a fight.
1289501 1292663 I saw it.<br />I was so embarrassed I almost threw up.
1294338 1298957 I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of<br />you if I have to break you in two trying."
1301471 1303382 Well, I made a man out of him.
1304390 1306552 When he was 16, <i>we</i> had a fight.
1308144 1310511 Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.
1313941 1316022 Haven't seen him for two years.
1317944 1320231 [SCOFFS] Kids.
1321948 1323905 Work your heart out.
1326495 1327735 Well, let's get going.
1327829 1330161 JUROR 4: I think we're<br />missing the point here.
1330248 1333668 This boy, let's say he's the product of a<br />broken home and a filthy neighborhood.
1333752 1337337 We can't help that. We're here to<br />decide whether he's innocent or guilty
1337421 1340334 not to go into the reasons<br />why he grew up the way he did.
1340424 1343135 He was born in a slum.<br />Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
1343219 1345085 I know it, and so do you.
1345179 1347088 It's no secret children from slum
1347172 1349889 backgrounds are potential<br />menaces to society.
1349975 1352144 -Now I think…<br />-Brother, you can say that again.
1352228 1354771 The kids who crawl out of<br />these places are real trash.
1354855 1356272 I don't want any part of them.<br />I'm telling you.
1356356 1357107 Listen, mister. Listen.
1357191 1360899 -I, uh… I've lived in a slum all my life.<br />-Wait a minute.
1360985 1364398 Please, I… I played in backyards<br />that were filled with garbage.
1364489 1366532 I mean, maybe you<br />can still smell it on me.
1366616 1367950 JUROR 10: Now, listen, sonny.
1368034 1369618 FOREMAN: Come on now.<br />There's nothing personal about this.
1369702 1372246 -No, there was something personal.<br />-Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
1372330 1374412 Let's not be so sensitive.
1374499 1376331 This sensitivity I can understand.
1376417 1381036 Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.<br />We're only wasting time, and
1382214 1384330 Look, your turn down there. Let's go.
1385676 1388511 Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br />you were all gonna try to convince me.
1388595 1390346 -Wasn't that the idea?<br />-Check. That was the idea.
1390430 1392640 -Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.<br />-What difference does it make?
1392724 1395060 He's the one who's keeping us in here.<br />Let's hear what he's got to say.
1395144 1397854 Oh, now wait a minute.<br />We decided to do this a certain way.
1397938 1399564 I think we ought to stick to that way.
1399648 1401639 Oh, stop being a kid, will you?
1401733 1403735 -What do you mean "a kid"?<br />-What do you think I mean?
1403819 1405434 K-I-D. Kid.
1408030 1411694 What? Listen, just because I'm<br />trying to keep this thing organized?
1411784 1413911 Here, you take it.<br />You take on the responsibility.
1413995 1415871 I'll just… I'll keep my mouth shut.<br />That's all.
1415955 1417956 What are you getting so hot about?<br />Calm down, will you?
1418040 1419374 Don't tell me to calm down.
1419458 1421585 Here. You wanna take the<br />chair, just take the chair. That's all.
1421669 1424129 -Did you ever see such a thing?<br />-See if you can keep it running.
1424213 1425406 Listen, you think it's funny or something?
1425490 1426173 Hey, forget it, fella.
1426257 1427840 The whole thing's unimportant. Come on.
1427924 1431052 -Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.<br />-No, nobody wants to change.
1431136 1432887 You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down.
1432971 1435804 JUROR 7: Yeah, you're doing great.<br />Just great, fella.
1435891 1437791 You stay in there and pitch. You know?
1438727 1440934 All right. Let's hear from somebody.
1442439 1444326 JUROR 8: Well, if you want me to tell you
1444410 1446526 how I feel about it,<br />it's all right with me.
1446610 1448726 Boy, I don't care what you do.
1448820 1451686 All right, I don't have<br />anything brilliant.
1451780 1453896 I only know as much as you do.
1453991 1457734 According to the testimony,<br />the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
1457828 1461992 I sat there in court for six days<br />listening while the evidence built up.
1462625 1464334 Everybody sounded so positive, you know?
1464418 1466878 I… I began to get a peculiar<br />feeling about this trial.
1466962 1469044 I mean, nothing is that positive.
1469131 1471257 There are a lot of questions<br />I'd have liked to ask.
1471341 1474051 I don't know. Maybe they<br />wouldn't have meant anything, but
1474135 1476095 I began to get the feeling<br />that the defense counsel
1476179 1478681 wasn't conducting a<br />thorough-enough cross-examination.
1478765 1482133 I mean, he… he let too many<br />things go by, little things that
1482227 1484979 What little things? Listen, when<br />these fellas don't ask questions
1485063 1487565 it's because they know the answers<br />already and they figure they'll be hurt.
1487649 1491563 Maybe it's also possible for a<br />lawyer to be just plain stupid, isn't it?
1491653 1492939 I mean it's possible.
1493029 1494696 You sound like you met<br />my brother-in-law once.
1494780 1497192 [CHUCKLES, COUGHS]
1497783 1500491 I… I kept putting<br />myself in the kid's place.
1502329 1504455 I'd have asked for<br />another lawyer, I think.
1504539 1507076 I mean, if I was on trial for my life…
1507167 1511957 I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br />witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
1512047 1516006 Look, there was one alleged<br />eyewitness to this killing.
1516550 1519928 Someone else claims he heard the<br />killing, saw the boy run out afterwards.
1520012 1522139 And there was a lot of<br />circumstantial evidence.
1522223 1525726 But actually, those two witnesses<br />were the entire case for the prosecution.
1525810 1527596 Supposing they're wrong.
1527687 1529479 What do you mean supposing they're wrong?
1529563 1531440 What's the point of<br />having witnesses at all?
1531524 1534141 -Could they be wrong?<br />-What are you trying to say?
1534235 1535777 Those people sat on the stand under oath.
1535861 1537404 They're only people. People make mistakes.
1537488 1539194 Could they be wrong?
1539990 1542903 -Well, no, I don't think so.<br />-Do you know so?
1542993 1544827 Oh, come on.<br />Nobody can know a thing like that.
1544911 1546618 This isn't an exact science.
1546705 1548036 That's right. It isn't.
1553211 1555953 Okay, let… Let's get to the point.
1556047 1558633 What about the switch knife<br />they found in the old man's chest?
1558717 1561134 Uh, wait… wait a minute. There's<br />some people who haven't talked yet.
1561218 1563220 -Shouldn't we go in order?<br />-They'll get a chance to talk.
1563304 1565636 Be quiet a second, will you?
1565723 1567009 What about it, this
1567099 1570560 the knife this fine upright boy<br />admitted buying the night of the killing?
1570644 1571975 Let's talk about it.
1572062 1574314 All right, let's talk about it.<br />Let's get it in here and look at it.
1574398 1576149 I'd like to see it again. Mr. Foreman?
1576233 1579319 JUROR 3: We all saw what it looks like.<br />Why do we have to see it again?
1579403 1581363 JUROR 4: The gentleman has a<br />right to see exhibits in evidence.
1581447 1582937 [KEY TURNS IN LOCK]
1583574 1585032 Say, could you bring us the knife?
1585116 1586902 -Knife?<br />-Yeah. Thank you.
1588578 1591830 The knife and the way it was bought is<br />pretty strong evidence, don't you think?
1591914 1593575 -I do.<br />-Good.
1593666 1596158 Now, suppose we take<br />these facts one at a time.
1596252 1599505 One. The boy admitted going out of the<br />house at 8:00 on the night of the murder
1599589 1601507 after being slapped<br />several times by his father.
1601591 1604333 No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."<br />He said "punched."
1604427 1606838 There's a difference<br />between a slap and a punch.
1606928 1609511 After being hit several<br />times by his father.
1609598 1611849 Two. He went directly to<br />a neighborhood junk shop
1611933 1614060 -where he bought one of those…<br />-Switch knives.
1614144 1616135 Switchblade knives.
1616229 1618022 This wasn't what you'd<br />call an ordinary knife.
1618106 1620598 It had a very unusual<br />carved handle and blade.
1620692 1622193 The storekeeper who sold it to him
1622277 1625395 said it was the only one of its<br />kind he had ever had in stock.
1625489 1629231 Three. He met some friends of<br />his in front of a tavern about 8:45.
1629325 1630815 Am I right so far?
1630910 1633026 -Yes, you are.<br />-You bet he is.
1633120 1636290 He talked with his friends for<br />about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.
1636374 1639332 During this time, they<br />saw the switch knife.
1639418 1641204 Four.
1641295 1643707 They identified the death weapon in court
1643798 1646290 as that very same knife.
1646384 1649172 Five. He arrived home at about 10:00.
1649261 1651595 Now this is where the stories<br />offered by the State and the boy
1651679 1653590 begin to diverge slightly.
1653681 1656264 He claims that he went<br />to a movie at about 11:30
1656351 1660390 returning home at 3:10 to find his<br />father dead and himself arrested.
1660480 1662523 He also claims that the two<br />detectives who arrested him
1662607 1664894 threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
1664984 1666819 Now, what happened to the switch knife?
1666903 1669530 He claims that it fell through a hole<br />in his pocket on the way to the movies
1669614 1674278 sometime between 11:30 and<br />3:10 and that he never saw it again.
1674368 1676325 Now there's a tale, gentlemen.
1676412 1679914 I think it's quite clear that the boy<br />never went to the movies that night.
1679998 1681958 No one in the house<br />saw him go out at 11:30.
1682042 1683543 No one at the theater identified him.
1683627 1685754 He couldn't even remember<br />the names of the pictures he saw.
1685838 1686999 [KEY TURNS IN LOCK]
1688799 1690508 -What actually happened is this.<br />-Thank you.
1690592 1693801 The boy stayed home, had<br />another fight with his father
1693887 1697595 stabbed him to death and left the<br />house at ten minutes after 12:00.
1697682 1700434 He even remembered to wipe<br />the knife clean of fingerprints.
1700518 1703135 Now are you trying<br />to tell me that this knife
1703229 1705147 really fell through a<br />hole in the boy's pocket
1705231 1707608 someone picked it up off the<br />street, went to the boy's house,
1707692 1710361 and stabbed his father with<br />it just to test its sharpness?
1710445 1712446 No. I'm just saying it's<br />possible the boy lost his knife,
1712530 1714740 and that somebody else stabbed<br />his father with a similar knife.
1714824 1716030 It's just possible.
1716117 1717699 Take a look at this knife.
1719619 1721826 It's a very unusual knife.
1721913 1723449 I've never seen one like it.
1723540 1726328 Neither had the storekeeper<br />who sold it to the boy.
1726418 1729379 Aren't you asking us to accept<br />a pretty incredible coincidence?
1729463 1731795 I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
1731882 1733372 And I say it's not possible.
1740015 1741723 -Where did that come from?<br />-[OTHERS CLAMORING]
1741807 1743183 -Where'd you get that?<br />-It's the same knife.

1744852 1746468 Where did you get it?
1746562 1748814 I went out walking for a<br />couple of hours last night.
1748898 1750898 I walked through the boy's neighborhood.
1750983 1753985 I bought that at a little pawnshop<br />just two blocks from the boy's house.
1754069 1755525 It cost six dollars.
1755613 1758731 It's against the law to buy<br />or sell switchblade knives.
1758824 1761065 That's right. I broke the law.
1761160 1765162 Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.<br />Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.
1765246 1767331 Maybe there are ten knives like that.<br />So what?
1767415 1770203 -Maybe there are.<br />-Well, what does it mean?
1770293 1771757 You found another knife like it. What's
1771841 1773587 that, the discovery of<br />the age or something?
1773671 1776006 You mean you're asking us to believe<br />that somebody else did the stabbing
1776090 1777883 with exactly the same kind of knife?
1777967 1779218 The odds are a million-to-one.

2409195 2410779 -He identified it in court.<br />-JUROR 12: That's right.
2410863 2412322 And don't forget the<br />lady across the street.
2412406 2415199 She looked right in the open window<br />and saw the boy stab his father.
2415283 2417744 -Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?<br />-No, it isn't.
2417828 2419785 Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?
2419871 2421703 It's like talking into a dead phone.
2421790 2423404 JUROR 4: She said she<br />saw the killing through
2423488 2424959 the windows of a moving elevated train.
2425043 2428546 There were six cars on the train. She<br />saw the killing through the last two cars.
2428630 2430465 She remembered the<br />most insignificant details.
2430549 2432586 I don't see how you can argue with that.
2432676 2437215 Has anybody here any idea<br />how long it would take an el…
2445896 2447478 JUROR 3: Hey!
2447565 2449055 This isn't a game.
2453362 2455603 -Did you see him?<br />-FOREMAN: Hey.
2455698 2457439 -The nerve.<br />-All right, listen
2457533 2460775 -The absolute nerve.<br />-Forget it. It's not important.
2460869 2462826 -"This isn't a game"?<br />-Calm down.
2462912 2466246 -Who does he think he is?<br />-I'm telling you, forget it now.
2466332 2469666 Has anybody any idea how<br />long it takes an elevated train
2469752 2471587 going at medium speed<br />to pass a given point?
2471671 2473547 -What has that to do with anything?<br />-How long? Take a guess.
2473631 2476300 -I wouldn't have the slightest idea.<br />-What do you think?
2476384 2478250 I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?
2479262 2480930 I think that's a pretty good guess.<br />Anyone else?
2481014 2483807 -JUROR 11: That sounds right to me.<br />-Come on. What's the guessing game for?
2483891 2485725 -What do you say?<br />-Ten seconds is about right.
2485809 2487727 All right. Say ten seconds.<br />What are you getting at?
2487811 2492851 This. It takes a six-car el train<br />ten seconds to pass a given point.
2492941 2494817 Now let's say the given point is the open
2494901 2497195 window of the room<br />where the killing took place.
2497279 2500573 You can reach out of that window<br />and almost touch the el tracks, right?
2500657 2502147 Now let me ask you this.
2502242 2504492 Has anyone here ever<br />lived near the el tracks?
2504577 2508205 Well, uh, I just finished painting an<br />apartment that overlooked an el line.
2508289 2509957 -I was there for three days.<br />-What was it like?
2510041 2511208 -What do you mean?<br />-Noisy?
2511292 2513836 Oh, brother. Don't matter though.<br />We were all punchy.
2513920 2516505 I lived in a second-floor<br />apartment near the el line once.
2516589 2519675 When the window was open and the train<br />goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.
2519759 2520831 You can hardly hear yourself think.
2520915 2522553 JUROR 3: All right, you<br />can't hear yourself think.
2522637 2525055 -Will you get to the point?<br />-I will. Now just a minute.
2525139 2528756 Let's take two pieces of testimony<br />and try to put them together.
2528850 2532935 First.<br />The old man in the apartment downstairs.
2533021 2535604 He says he heard the<br />boy say "I'm gonna kill you,"
2535690 2538432 and a split second later<br />heard a body hit the floor.
2538526 2540111 -One second later, right?<br />-JUROR 2: That's right.
2540195 2546191 Second. The woman across the street swore<br />positively she looked out of the window,
2546284 2549619 and saw the killing through the last two<br />cars of the passing elevated train, right?
2549703 2552038 -The last two cars.<br />-JUROR 3: What are you giving us here?
2552122 2553453 Now, just a minute.
2553540 2557955 We've agreed that it takes ten<br />seconds for a train to pass a given point.
2558796 2562130 Since the woman saw the<br />killing through the last two cars
2562216 2567177 we can assume that the body hit<br />the floor just as the train went by.
2567263 2571723 Therefore, the train had been<br />roaring by the old man's window
2571808 2575301 a full ten seconds before<br />the body hit the floor.
2575395 2577602 The old man, according<br />to his own testimony
2577689 2580608 "I'm gonna kill you," body<br />hitting the floor a split second later
2580692 2583152 would have had to hear<br />the boy make this statement
2583236 2585102 with the el roaring past his nose.
2585196 2586739 It's not possible he could've heard it.
2586823 2588991 -That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.<br />-Do you think he could've heard it?
2589075 2591452 He said he yelled at the top of his voice.<br />That's good enough for me.
2591536 2593787 Even if he heard something, he<br />still couldn't have identified the voice.
2593871 2594996 With the el roaring by?
2595080 2597457 You're talking about a matter of seconds!<br />Nobody can be that accurate.
2597541 2599767 I think testimony that<br />could put a boy into
2599851 2602160 the electric chair<br />should be that accurate.
2602254 2604291 [JURORS MURMURING]
2604381 2606299 You know something?<br />I don't think he could've heard it.
2606383 2608718 Maybe he didn't hear it.<br />I mean, with all that el noise.
2608802 2610678 JUROR 3: Oh, what are<br />you people talking about?
2610762 2612805 JUROR 5: Well, it stands to<br />reason he couldn't have heard it.
2612889 2614807 Why should he lie? What's he got to gain?
2614891 2617097 Attention maybe.
2617184 2619102 You keep coming in<br />with these bright sayings!
2619186 2622231 Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?<br />They pay three dollars apiece.
2622315 2624522 What are you talking to him like that for?
2625484 2628904 Guy talks like that to an old man<br />really ought to get stepped on, you know?
2628988 2630938 You ought to have more respect, mister.
2632033 2636402 If you say stuff like that to him<br />again, I'm gonna lay you out.
2646379 2649337 Now you go ahead.<br />You… You say anything you like.
2649424 2653463 Why do you think the old man might lie?
2653553 2656966 It was just that I looked<br />at him for a very long time.
2657599 2660842 The seams of his jacket<br />was split, under the shoulder.
2660935 2662516 Or did you notice that?
2662603 2665095 I mean, to come to court like that.
2665189 2666850 -Why…<br />-[JUROR 10 COUGHS]
2667983 2671851 He was a very old man in a torn jacket.
2671945 2674812 And he walked very slowly to the stand.
2675574 2679613 He was dragging his<br />left leg and trying to hide it
2679703 2681364 because he was ashamed.
2682498 2685910 I think I know this man<br />better than anyone here.
2686793 2692209 This is a quiet, frightened,<br />insignificant old man who
2692298 2694665 who has been nothing all his life
2694759 2697171 who has never had recognition,
2697261 2699343 or his name in the newspapers.
2700014 2702221 Nobody knows him.
2702308 2704345 Nobody quotes him.
2704435 2708393 Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
2709231 2713099 Gentlemen, that's a very<br />sad thing… to be nothing.
2713819 2718154 A man like this needs to<br />be quoted, to be listened to.
2718782 2720739 To be quoted just once.
2720826 2722692 Very important to him.
2723203 2725621 It would be so hard for him<br />to recede into the background
2725705 2727415 -JUROR 7: Wait a minute.<br />-When there was a chance
2727499 2730375 What are you trying to do… tell us he'd<br />lie just so he could be important once?
2730459 2733076 No. He wouldn't really lie.
2733170 2736629 But perhaps he made himself<br />believe he heard those words,
2736715 2738922 and recognized the boy's face.
2739009 2741303 That's the most fantastic<br />story I've ever heard.
2741387 2744587 How can you make up a thing like that?<br />What do you know about it?
2753481 2755518 Oh, uh, does anybody want a cough drop?
2755608 2757860 -JUROR 12: No, thanks.<br />-JUROR 8: I'll take one.
2757944 2759535 JUROR 12: You can say what you like.<br />I still
2759619 2761447 don't see how anybody<br />can think he's not guilty.
2761531 2764033 There's something else I'd<br />like to talk about for a minute.
2764117 2765733 Thanks.
2765827 2767427 I think we've proved<br />that the old man couldn't
2767511 2769121 have heard the boy<br />say "I'm gonna kill you."
2769205 2770790 -But supposing…<br />-You didn't prove it at all.
2770874 2773667 -What are you talking about?<br />-Supposing he really did hear it.
2773751 2776169 This phrase, how many<br />times have all of us used it?
2776253 2777743 Probably thousands.
2777838 2779464 "I could kill you for that, darling."
2779548 2781466 "Junior, you do that once<br />more, and I'm gonna kill you."
2781550 2782842 "Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."
2782926 2784803 We say it every day. That doesn't<br />mean we're really gonna kill anybody.
2784887 2786679 Wait a minute.<br />What are you trying to give us here?
2786763 2790475 The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."<br />The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
2790559 2791893 Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
2791977 2794270 Anybody says a thing like that<br />the way he said it, they mean it.
2794354 2795810 Well, gee, now I don't know.
2795898 2800607 I remember I was arguing with a guy I work<br />next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.
2800693 2802444 He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.
2802528 2805489 Now listen! This guy's trying to<br />make you believe things that aren't so.
2805573 2807658 The kid said he was gonna<br />kill him, and he did kill him.
2807742 2810702 Let me ask you this. Do you really think<br />the boy would shout out a thing like that,
2810786 2812579 so the whole neighborhood could hear him?
2812663 2814498 I don't think so.<br />He's much too bright for that.
2814582 2819326 Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.<br />He don't even speak good English.
2819419 2822252 "He <i>doesn't</i> even speak good English."
2824716 2828505 Mr. Foreman, I'd like to<br />change my vote to not guilty.
2828595 2830006 You what?
2830096 2832508 -You heard me.<br />-FOREMAN: Are you sure?
2833433 2834844 Yeah, I'm sure.
2834935 2837393 The vote is nine to<br />three, favor of guilty.
2837479 2840267 Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?
2844318 2847118 What are you basing it on…<br />the stories this guy made up?
2847696 2850031 You ought to write for one of<br />those kooky detective magazines.
2850115 2851947 You'd make a fortune.
2852034 2855584 For crying out loud. The kid's own<br />lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.
2855955 2857539 Right from the beginning,<br />his own lawyer knew it.
2857623 2859409 You could see it.
2859500 2863084 Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,<br />this guy here is really something.
2863920 2865713 Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
2865797 2868632 He presented his case, not you.<br />How come you got so much to say?
2868716 2870452 Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
2870536 2871552 Baltimore, please. Huh?
2871636 2873343 He was court-appointed.
2873429 2875264 -What's that supposed to mean?<br />-It could mean a lot of things.
2875348 2878601 It could mean he didn't want the<br />case, or he resented being appointed.
2878685 2880519 It's the kind of case<br />that brings him nothing
2880603 2883561 no money, no glory, not<br />even much chance of winning.
2883648 2886560 That's not a very promising<br />situation for a young lawyer.
2886650 2889569 He'd really have to believe in his<br />client to put up any kind of a good case,
2889653 2891654 and, as you pointed out a<br />minute ago, obviously he didn't.
2891738 2894571 Of course he didn't. Huh.
2894658 2896945 Who the heck could?
2897035 2899948 Except maybe some<br />guy's mother or somebody. I
2900038 2902279 Ah, look. Will you look at the time, huh?
2902374 2904918 -Come on. For crying out…<br />-Pardon me.
2905002 2907334 -I have made some notes here…<br />-Notes.
2907421 2910037 And I would like to…<br />please, to say something.
2910131 2912372 -Yeah.<br />-I have been listening very carefully.
2912466 2916881 And, uh, it seems to me that this man<br />has some very good points to make.
2916971 2921590 From what was presented at the trial,<br />the boy looks guilty on the surface.
2921684 2925769 -But maybe if we go deeper?<br />-Oh, come on, will ya?
2925855 2928142 There is a question I would like to ask.
2928232 2931519 Let us assume that the boy<br />really did commit the murder.
2931610 2934944 Now, this happened at<br />ten minutes after 12:00.
2935030 2937488 Now, how was he caught by the police?
2937574 2942068 He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so,
2942162 2945905 and he was captured by two<br />detectives in the hallway of his house.
2945999 2950584 Now, my question is, if he<br />really had killed his father
2950670 2953878 why would he come back<br />home three hours later?
2953964 2956831 Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
2956925 2958666 He came home to get his knife.
2958761 2961304 It's not nice to go around leaving<br />knives sticking in people's chests.
2961388 2964130 -Yeah, especially relatives.<br />-Yeah. [GIGGLING]
2964224 2966465 JUROR 4: I don't see<br />anything funny about it.
2966560 2970105 The boy knew the knife could be<br />identified as the one he had just bought.
2970189 2972351 He had to get it before the police did.
2972441 2974607 But if he knew the<br />knife could be identified,
2974691 2976940 why did he leave it<br />there in the first place?
2977445 2980322 Well, I think we can assume<br />the boy ran out in a state of panic
2980406 2982773 after having just killed his father.
2982867 2985828 When he finally calmed down, he<br />realized he had left his knife there.
2985912 2988825 Ah. This then depends<br />on your definition of panic.
2988915 2991292 He would have had to<br />be calm enough to see to it
2991376 2993959 that there were no<br />fingerprints left on the knife.
2994045 2998084 Now, where did this panic<br />start and where did it end?
2998174 3000540 Look, you voted guilty.<br />What side are ya on?
3000634 3004172 I don't believe I have to be<br />loyal to one side or the other.
3004262 3006048 I'm simply asking questions.
3006139 3009131 Well, this is just off the<br />top of my head, but, uh
3009226 3011728 well, if I were the boy and I'd<br />done the stabbing and everything…
3011812 3013938 I'd take a chance and<br />go back for the knife.
3014022 3016524 I'll bet he figured that nobody<br />had seen him running out,
3016608 3019110 and that the body wouldn't<br />be discovered till the next day.
3019194 3021236 Well, after all, it was<br />the middle of the night.
3021320 3023822 I'll bet he'd figured nobody<br />would find the body till the next day.
3023906 3025897 Pardon. This is my whole point.
3025991 3029703 The woman across the street testified<br />that the moment after she saw the killing
3029787 3032370 that is, a moment after the train went by
3032456 3035448 she screamed and then<br />went to telephone the police.
3035543 3038911 Now, the boy certainly<br />must have heard the scream,
3039004 3042497 so he knew that somebody saw something.
3042591 3045378 I just don't think that he<br />would have gone back.
3045468 3048220 Two things. One, in his state of panic,<br />he may not have heard the scream.
3048304 3049965 Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
3050056 3053434 Two, if he did hear it, he may not<br />have connected it with his own act.
3053518 3056562 Remember, he lived in a neighborhood<br />where screams were fairly commonplace.
3056646 3059104 -There's your answer.<br />-Maybe.
3059190 3062068 Maybe the boy did kill his<br />father, didn't hear the scream
3062152 3065861 did run out in a panic, did<br />calm down three hours later,
3065946 3068573 and come back to get the knife,<br />risking being caught by the police.
3068657 3071570 Maybe all of those things<br />happened, but maybe they didn't.
3071660 3074412 I think there's enough doubt that we<br />can wonder whether he was there at all
3074496 3076164 during the time the killing took place.
3076248 3077999 What do you mean doubt?<br />What are you talking about?
3078083 3079793 Didn't the old man see him<br />running out of the house?
3079877 3081670 He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.
3081754 3085090 Did or didn't the old man see the<br />kid running out of the house at 12:10?
3085174 3087085 Well, did or didn't he?
3087176 3090384 -He says he did.<br />-"Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?
3090470 3093430 -Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.<br />-Sure, when you want them to, they do.
3093514 3095766 Or when he wants them to, they do.<br />You know what I mean?
3095850 3097685 -Keep the yelling down!<br />-Oh, you keep saying that.
3097769 3099478 Maybe what we need<br />is a little yelling in here.
3099562 3101271 These guys keep going off every which way.
3101355 3103273 Did hear the scream.<br />Didn't hear the scream.
3103357 3106527 What difference does it make? You people<br />are talking only about the little details.
3106611 3109113 You're forgetting the important stuff.<br />I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here

3111656 3115320 There's another vote called for.<br />Now let's take our seats.
3119206 3121743 I never saw so much time spent on nothing.
3121833 3123540 It only takes a second.
3124628 3128047 FOREMAN: Okay. I guess the fastest way<br />is to find out who's voting not guilty.
3128131 3130981 Now, all those voting not<br />guilty, please raise your hands.
3132135 3135718 Still the same.<br />One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

3137556 3140976 I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until<br />next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

3154240 3156490 Tell him, will ya?<br />Now this is getting to be a joke.
3156574 3159783 FOREMAN: The vote is<br />eight to four, favor of guilty.
3159869 3163533 What is this, love your underprivileged<br />brother week or something?
3163623 3166125 I want you to get up and tell<br />me why you changed your vote.

3168006 3170498 I don't have to defend my decision to you.
3170588 3172339 There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
3172423 3175426 What reasonable doubt? That's<br />nothing but words. Here, look at this.
3175510 3180424 The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br />was seen ramming this into his father.
3180514 3182515 Now, what about this,<br />Mr. Reasonable Doubt?
3182599 3185261 That's not the knife. Don't you remember?
3185352 3187514 Oh, brilliant.
3187604 3189891 I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.
3189982 3192144 I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
3192234 3195069 I mean, you're sittin' here, you're<br />pulling stories out of thin air, you know?
3195153 3198865 A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting<br />ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight
3198949 3201406 he'd be trying to tell you that, uh
3201492 3203859 Look. Now, what about the old man?
3203953 3206538 Are we supposed to believe that<br />he didn't get up and run to his door,
3206622 3209625 and see the kid tearing down the<br />steps 15 seconds after the killing?
3209709 3212169 He's just saying so to be<br />important, right? [CHUCKLES]
3212253 3213761 I mean, what's the<br />point of the whole thing?

3219468 3222721 Hold it a second. Now, look… Did<br />the old man say he <i>ran</i> to the door?
3222805 3224251 Ran, walked.<br />What's the difference? He got on,
3224335 3225765 didn't he?<br />I mean, he got there, didn't he?
3225849 3228392 -No, now wait a second.<br />-He said he ran. At least I think he did.
3228476 3230062 Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
3230146 3231896 don't see how he could<br />have run to the door.
3231980 3234357 He said he <i>went</i> from his<br />bedroom to the front door.
3234441 3236067 -Now, isn't that enough?<br />-Where was the bedroom?
3236151 3238402 -It was down the hall somewhere.<br />-I thought you remembered everything.

3249163 3251873 -JUROR 5: I want to see this one too.<br />-And I'd like to stop wasting time.
3251957 3253206 If we're gonna start wading through all
3253290 3254793 that nonsense about<br />where the body was found
3254877 3256837 JUROR 8: We're not, not<br />unless somebody else wants to.
3256921 3258630 But I'd like to find out if an old man
3258714 3261091 who drags one foot when he walks<br />'cause he had a stroke last year
3261175 3263593 can get from his bedroom to<br />his front door in 15 seconds.
3263677 3265338 -He said 20 seconds.<br />-He said 15.
3265429 3267597 He said 20 seconds.<br />What are you trying to distort
3267681 3270923 -JUROR 11: He said 15.<br />-How does he know how long 15 seconds is?
3271017 3272685 You can't judge a thing like that.
3272769 3275145 JUROR 9: He said 15 seconds.<br />He was very positive about it.
3275229 3277439 He was an old man.<br />Half the time he was confused.
3277523 3279810 How could he be positive about anything?
3287492 3289570 I don't see what you're<br />going to prove here.
3289654 3291619 The man said he saw the boy running out.
3291703 3293865 Well, let's see if the<br />details bear him out.
3293956 3296833 As soon as the body hit the floor,<br />he said he heard footsteps upstairs
3296917 3298578 running toward the front door
3298669 3301754 heard the upstairs door open,<br />the footsteps start down the stairs.
3301838 3303965 He said he got to his own<br />front door as fast as he could,
3304049 3306134 and he swore it couldn't have<br />been more than 15 seconds.
3306218 3307886 Now, if the killer began<br />running immediately
3307970 3310179 -JUROR 12: Maybe he didn't.<br />-The old man said he did.

3316477 3317900 My friend, for your three dollars a day,
3317984 3319605 you have to listen to<br />everything, you know?
3319689 3321398 Now that you've got that<br />thing in here, what about it?
3321482 3323650 All right. Here's the apartment<br />where the killing took place.
3323734 3326778 The old man's apartment was<br />directly beneath and exactly the same.
3326862 3330073 Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,<br />living room, kitchen, bathroom.
3330157 3332148 Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.
3332243 3334494 Now, the old man was<br />in this bedroom right here.
3334578 3337246 He says he crossed to the<br />door and walked down the hall
3337330 3340291 opened the front door just in time to<br />see the boy running down the stairs.
3340375 3341266 Am I right so far?
3341350 3343709 JUROR 3: That's the<br />story, for the 19th time.
3343795 3346215 Fifteen seconds after<br />the body hit the floor.
3346299 3347333 JUROR 11: Correct.
3347424 3349461 Now, let's see. It was
3349551 3353545 It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.<br />The hall is 43 feet.
3353638 3356847 He would have had to walk<br />12 feet, open the bedroom door
3356933 3360550 walk 43 feet down and open<br />the front door all in 15 seconds.
3360644 3363355 -Do you think he could have done it?<br />-JUROR 10: Sure he could have done it.
3363439 3366024 He can walk only very slowly. They<br />had to help him into the witness chair.
3366108 3367776 You make it sound like a long walk.
3367860 3370195 For an old man who had<br />a stroke, it is a long walk.
3370279 3371400 Oh! What are you doing?
3371484 3373692 I'm gonna try it, see<br />how long it took him.
3373824 3375502 What do you mean, <i>you</i> want to try it?<br />Why didn't
3375586 3377202 his lawyer bring it<br />up if it's so important?
3377286 3378440 Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
3378524 3380913 What do you mean, didn't think of it?<br />You think the man's an idiot or something?
3380997 3382539 -It's an obvious thing.<br />-Did you think of it?
3382623 3384291 Listen, smart guy.<br />Don't matter whether I thought of it.
3384375 3385482 He didn't bring it up<br />because he knew it would
3385566 3386627 hurt his case. What do you think of that?
3386711 3388565 Maybe he didn't bring it<br />up because it would have
3388649 3390547 meant bullying and<br />badgering a helpless old man.
3390631 3393968 You know that doesn't sit very well with<br />a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.
3394052 3396762 -So, what kind of a bum is he then?<br />-That's what I've been asking, buddy.
3396846 3399890 Pass me that chair, will you?<br />Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
3399974 3402850 I just paced off 12 feet across the room.<br />This will be the bedroom door.
3402934 3405561 Oh, that's crazy.<br />You can't recreate a thing like that.
3405645 3407855 -JUROR 11: I'd like to see it.<br />-The hall was 43 feet.
3407939 3409939 I'll pace from that wall and back again.

3848944 3851185 Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
3852447 3854313 How come you changed your vote?
3854407 3856826 Well, it just seemed to me<br />there was room for doubt.
3856910 3859120 You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br />You know that, I hope.
3859204 3862206 I don't feel that way. There were<br />a lot of details that never came out.
3862290 3865828 -Yeah. Well, good luck.<br />-Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.
3865919 3868126 You think too much. You get mixed up.
3869380 3870577 You know what I mean?
3870661 3873339 Now, listen.<br />I don't think you have any right

3928728 3931220 Look at that come down, will you?
3932399 3936851 You know this reminds<br />me of a storm we had last
3936945 3940404 Oh, when was that? November
3940490 3943572 I don't know. Something.<br />It was quite a storm we had there.
3943659 3946026 It was right in the middle of a game.
3946120 3948737 Uh, we were behind 7-6,
3948831 3951416 but we just started to move<br />the ball, right off the tackle.
3951500 3954288 Started cutting right…<br />slash here and slash right in
3954378 3956164 cut right through.
3956255 3958747 And, uh [CHUCKLES]
3958841 3961048 We had this kid Slattery, you know?
3962219 3965586 A real… He was an ox. You know, a real ox.
3965680 3968172 I wish I had another one just like him.
3968266 3970429 I forgot to tell you.<br />I'm the assistant head
3970513 3972760 coach at the Andrew J.<br />McCorkle High School.
3972854 3974936 -Oh, yeah?<br />-That's out in Queens.
3975023 3979941 And, uh, anyway we're<br />starting to move along real nice.
3980028 3983191 Their whole line is just…<br />they're just coming apart.
3984490 3988232 And it starts to come down<br />cats and dogs, just like this.
3988327 3990944 Just whoosh… you know, right down.
3992247 3995615 Well, that was murder, you know?
3995709 3998292 I swear, I… I nearly bawled.
3998378 4000710 You just… You couldn't go nowhere.
4001965 4003296 Well.
4018939 4021431 Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br />How come…
4029200 4030941 Hey! Huh?
4031035 4034322 [LAUGHS] Must have been on<br />the same switch with the lights.
4035330 4038493 Well, things are looking up here, huh?<br />[CHUCKLES]
4039167 4040657 Yeah, huh?
4045507 4047498 Boy. That's better.
4051012 4052673 [CRUMPLING PAPER]
4054181 4055671 Hey!
4055766 4057427 Two points.
4061438 4063429 Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?
4065734 4068601 That's a damn stupid thing to do.
4068696 4070858 Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh
4071907 4073272 You know? [CHUCKLING]
4074993 4076483 Pardon me.
4077578 4079910 Well, how do you like it? Even Steven.
4079997 4082364 Pretty surprising, isn't it?
4082458 4083948 Yes.
4085753 4089246 Say, that business before, when<br />that tall guy… what's-his-name
4089340 4092048 was trying to bait me…<br />That doesn't prove anything.
4092135 4094718 I'm a pretty excitable person.
4094804 4098641 I mean, where does he come off calling me<br />a public avenger, sadist and everything?
4098725 4102217 Anyone in his right mind<br />would blow his stack, huh?
4102310 4104597 He was just trying to bait me.
4104688 4106679 He did an excellent job.
4109484 4111694 I'll tell you what I think.<br />We're going nowhere here.
4111778 4114322 I'm ready to walk into court<br />right now and declare a hung jury.
4114406 4116240 There's no point in this<br />thing going on anymore.
4116324 4117655 Yeah. I go for that too.
4117743 4119092 Listen, let's take it<br />in to the judge and let
4119176 4120578 the kid take his chances<br />with 12 other guys.
4120662 4123497 I don't think the judge will accept a hung<br />jury. We haven't been in here very long.
4123581 4125242 Well, let's find out.
4125332 4127039 I'm not in favor of that.
4127126 4130337 Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a<br />chance with another jury, and you know it.
4130421 4133256 Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna<br />change his vote. Let's take it inside.
4133340 4135550 You still don't think there's<br />room for reasonable doubt?
4135634 4136920 No, I don't.
4137011 4138297 Pardon.
4138387 4141630 Maybe you don't fully understand<br />the term "reasonable doubt."
4141724 4144260 What do you mean I don't understand?
4145351 4147308 Boy, how do ya like this guy?
4147395 4149063 I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.
4149147 4150377 They come over here, running for their
4150461 4151982 life, and before they<br />can take a deep breath
4152066 4154433 they're telling us how<br />to run the show, huh?
4154527 4156313 Boy, the arrogance of this guy.
4156404 4160989 FOREMAN: Hey, all right. Let's stop<br />the arguing for about two minutes in here.
4161075 4163442 Now, who's got something<br />constructive to say?
4163536 4167073 I'd like to go over something,<br />if you gentlemen don't mind.
4167164 4169826 An important point for the<br />prosecution was the fact
4169917 4172659 that after the boy claimed<br />he'd been at the movies
4172753 4174754 during the hours that<br />the killing took place
4174838 4178706 couldn't remember the names of the<br />movies or the stars who appeared in them.
4178801 4181302 This gentleman here has put up<br />that point in here several times.
4181386 4182842 That's correct.
4182930 4184806 It was the only alibi the boy offered,
4184890 4187392 and he himself couldn't back<br />it up with any details at all.
4187476 4190728 Putting yourself in the boy's place, do<br />you think you could remember details
4190812 4194273 after an upsetting experience such as<br />being slapped in the face by your father?
4194357 4197566 I think so, if there were any<br />special details to remember.
4197652 4199031 The boy couldn't remember the names of the
4199115 4200821 movies he saw because<br />he wasn't there that night.
4200905 4202948 According to the police testimony in court
4203032 4206160 the boy was questioned by the<br />detectives in the kitchen of his apartment
4206244 4209163 while the body of his father was<br />lying on the floor in the bedroom.
4209247 4211831 Do you think you could remember<br />details under those circumstances?
4211915 4213906 -I do.<br />-Under great emotional stress?
4214000 4216502 -Under great emotional stress.<br />-He remembered them correctly in court.
4216586 4218546 He named the pictures and<br />the stars who played in them.
4218630 4221793 Yes. His lawyer took<br />great pains to bring that out.
4221883 4224427 He had three months from the night<br />of the murder to the day of the trial
4224511 4226127 in which to memorize them.
4226221 4228890 It's not difficult for a lawyer to find<br />out what played at a particular theater
4228974 4230635 on a particular night.
4230725 4232475 I'll take the testimony<br />of the policemen who
4232559 4234352 interrogated the boy<br />right after the murder
4234436 4236855 when he couldn't remember<br />a thing about the movies
4236939 4238850 great emotional stress or not.
4238941 4242229 -I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br />-Go ahead.
4242319 4245562 -Where were you last night?<br />-I was home.
4245656 4248200 -How about the night before that?<br />-JUROR 10: Come on! What is this?
4248284 4249615 No, it's all right.
4249702 4252245 I left the office at 8:30 and<br />went straight home and to bed.
4252329 4253990 And the night before that?
4254081 4256492 That was, uh, Tuesday night?
4256583 4258584 The night of the bridge tournament.<br />I played bridge.
4258668 4259999 Monday night?
4260086 4263486 JUROR 7: When you get down to<br />New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?
4265300 4267257 Monday night?
4268511 4271503 Monday night, uh, my wife<br />and I went to the movies.
4271598 4273224 -What did you see?<br /><i>-The Scarlet Circle.</i>
4273308 4276551 -It was a clever whodunnit.<br />-What was the second feature?
4276644 4282016 <i>The,</i> um I'll tell you in a minute. <i>The,</i> uh
4282107 4288819 <i>Remarkable Mrs.,</i> uh, something <i>The</i>
4288906 4291568 <i>Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>
4291658 4294400 I saw that.<br />It's called <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.</i>
4295704 4298081 Uh, yes. <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.</i><br />I think that's right.
4298165 4300657 Who was in <i>The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?</i>
4300751 4304414 Barbara… Long, I think it was.
4304503 4306494 A dark, very pretty girl.
4307840 4310332 Ling or Long… something like that.
4310426 4313635 -Who else?<br />-I'd never heard of them before.
4313721 4318136 It was a very inexpensive<br />second feature with, uh, unknown
4318225 4321343 And you weren't under an<br />emotional stress, were you?
4324272 4326388 No.
4326483 4328144 I wasn't.
4330028 4331769 I think the point is made.
4331863 4334605 Big point! [COUGHING]
4334699 4336868 You can talk till your<br />tongue is draggin' on the floor.
4336952 4341037 The boy is guilty, period.<br />You know what I mean, my friend?
4341122 4344365 -Who's got those cough drops?<br />-They're all gone, my friend.
4346377 4348618 Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
4348712 4351079 There goes your ball game.
4351173 4353585 It's only a shower.
4353676 4355838 Besides, they got the infield covered.
4355928 4359091 Right. Say, could I see<br />that knife a second, please?
4361892 4364224 Well, we're still tied up six to six.
4364311 4366302 Who's got a suggestion?
4366397 4368398 It's five after 6:00.<br />Let's get some dinner.
4368482 4370941 Why don't we wait till 7:00,<br />give it another hour, huh?
4371025 4373141 Okay with me.
4373236 4375398 Uh, there's something I'd like to say.
4375488 4379026 I mean, it's been bothering me a<br />little, and as long as we're stuck.
4379117 4382985 Well, there was this whole business<br />about the stab wound and how it was made
4383079 4384705 the downward angle of it, you know?
4384789 4386790 Don't tell me we're<br />gonna start with that again.
4386874 4388500 They've been over it and over it.
4388584 4390877 Well, I know they did,<br />but I don't go along with it.
4390961 4394955 Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.<br />His father was 6'2."
4395048 4397210 That's a difference of seven inches.
4397300 4399969 It's a very awkward thing to stab<br />down into the chest of someone
4400053 4402055 who's more than half a<br />foot taller than you are.
4402139 4404255 Give me that.
4404349 4407137 I'll give you a demonstration.<br />Somebody get up.
4408520 4410431 You…
4414942 4417653 I want you to watch this 'cause I<br />don't want to have to do it again.
4417737 4420489 I'll make myself about six or<br />seven inches shorter, okay?
4420573 4423691 -It's about right. Maybe a little more.<br />-Okay. A little more.
4431500 4433912 -[EXCITED CHATTERING]<br />-JUROR 6: That's not funny.
4436004 4439838 Now, nobody's hurt. Right?
4440508 4442294 Right. Nobody hurt.
4445764 4450554 Now, this is the way I'd stab a<br />man who was taller than I was.
4450643 4453101 Look at the angle… down and in.
4453188 4455270 And this is the way it was done.
4455356 4457518 Now tell me I'm wrong.
4459735 4463154 -Down and in. I guess there's no argument.<br />-Hold it a minute, will ya?
4463238 4465070 Can you give me that?
4466075 4467986 Boy, I hate these things.
4468077 4469744 -Did you ever see a knife fight?<br />-No.
4469828 4471410 -You?<br />-No.
4471497 4474285 -Anybody here ever see a knife fight?<br />-[MURMURING]
4474374 4477162 Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop
4477252 4479584 the lot across the street, backyard.
4479671 4482089 Switchblades came with the<br />neighborhood where I lived.
4482173 4485426 It's funny I never thought of it before.<br />I guess you try to forget those things.
4485510 4488878 -How do you use a switchblade?<br />-Well, you'd never use it like this.
4490640 4492927 See, you use too much<br />time switching hands.
4494685 4497177 Here's how… underhanded.
4499899 4502943 Anyone who's ever used a switch<br />knife wouldn't handle it any other way.
4503027 4505643 -Are you sure?<br />-I'm sure.
4505737 4507572 That's why they're made to open like that.
4507656 4509830 You'd say the boy was<br />pretty handy with a knife?
4509914 4510283 Mm-hmm.
4510367 4513536 You think he could have made the<br />kind of wound that killed his father?
4513620 4517534 No. Not with the experience he'd<br />had all his life handling these things.
4517624 4519625 I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.
4519709 4522754 How do you know? Were you in<br />the room when the father was killed?
4522838 4524829 No. Neither was anybody else.
4524923 4528133 So what are you giving us all this<br />mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
4528217 4529797 I don't think you can<br />determine what type of
4529881 4531470 wound the boy might or might not have made
4531554 4534171 simply because he knew<br />how to handle a knife.
4534265 4536597 What do you think?
4536684 4538769 -I don't know.<br />-What do you mean you don't know?
4538853 4540685 I don't know.
4544900 4546891 How about you?
4546986 4548743 I don't know about the<br />rest of them, but I'm getting
4548827 4550738 a little tired of this<br />yackety-yackin' back and forth.
4550822 4554281 It's gettin' us nowhere.<br />So I guess I'll have to break it up.
4554367 4556904 I change my vote to not guilty.
4556995 4560329 -You what?<br />-You heard me. I've had enough.
4560415 4562875 What do you mean you've had enough?<br />That's no answer!
4562959 4566918 Hey, listen. You just take care<br />of yourself, huh? You know?
4567005 4570963 He's right. That's not an answer.
4571049 4574007 What kind of a man are you?
4574094 4577212 You have sat here and<br />voted guilty with everyone else
4577306 4581550 because there are some baseball<br />tickets burning a hole in your pocket.
4581643 4583580 And now you've changed your vote because
4583664 4585887 you say you're sick<br />of all the talking here?
4586899 4588355 Now listen, buddy!
4588442 4593106 Who tells you that you have the<br />right to play like this with a man's life?
4593196 4595688 -Don't you care…<br />-Now wait a minute!
4595781 4599775 -You can't talk like that to me!<br />-I can talk like that to you.
4599869 4601735 If you want to vote not guilty
4601829 4604206 then do it because you are<br />convinced the man is not guilty
4604290 4606076 not because you've had enough.
4606167 4608750 And if you think he is<br />guilty, then vote that way.
4608836 4612045 Or don't you have the guts<br />to do what you think is right?
4612131 4614372 -Now listen.<br />-Guilty or not guilty?
4615176 4618759 -I told you, not guilty.<br />-Why?
4620430 4625258 Look, I don't have to You do have to!<br />Say it! Why?
4625352 4627810 All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.
4637322 4638937 I want another vote.
4639031 4641523 FOREMAN: Okay.<br />There's another vote called for.
4641617 4644494 I guess the quickest way is a<br />show of hands. Anyone object?
4644578 4647491 Okay. All those voting<br />not guilty, raise your hands.
4648415 4653581 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…
4656423 4658084 Eight.
4662011 4664127 Um, nine.
4665139 4670134 Um, all those voting<br />guilty, raise your hands.
4670228 4672595 One, two, three.
4672689 4675289 Well, the vote's nine to<br />three in favor of acquittal.
4676192 4678354 I don't understand you people!
4678444 4680613 I mean, all these picky little<br />points you keep bringing up.
4680697 4684030 They don't mean nothing!<br />You saw this kid just like I did.
4684116 4687619 You're not gonna tell me you believe<br />that phony story about losing the knife,
4687703 4689704 and that business about<br />being at the movies.
4689788 4692780 Look, you know how these people lie.<br />It's born in them.
4692874 4694918 I mean, what the heck.<br />I don't have to tell you.
4695002 4696959 They don't know what the truth is.
4697045 4700757 And let me tell you, they don't need any<br />real big reason to kill someone either.
4700841 4702582 No, sir.
4702676 4705713 They get drunk!<br />Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
4705803 4708966 You know that.<br />And bang… someone's lying in the gutter.
4709056 4712059 Well, nobody's blaming them for it.<br />That's the way they are, by nature.
4712143 4714225 You know what I mean? Violent!
4714312 4715802 Where are you going?
4715896 4718888 Human life don't mean as<br />much to them as it does to us.
4719900 4722892 Look! They're lushing it<br />up and fighting all the time,
4722987 4724988 and if somebody gets killed,<br />so somebody gets killed!
4725072 4726437 They don't care!
4726532 4728741 Oh, sure, there's some<br />good things about 'em too.
4728825 4730782 Look, I'm the first one to say that.
4730869 4732330 I've known a couple who were okay, but
4732414 4734163 that's the exception,<br />you know what I mean?
4734247 4737990 Most of 'em, it's like they have<br />no feelings. They can do anything.
4738084 4740667 What's going on here?
4740754 4742791 I'm… I'm trying to tell ya
4742881 4744881 you're making a big mistake, you people.
4744966 4747958 This kid is a liar! I know it.<br />I know all about them.
4749679 4751840 Listen to me. They're no good.
4751930 4754262 There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
4756310 4758768 I mean, what… What's happening in here?
4758854 4761095 I'm speaking my piece, and you
4762316 4763977 Listen to me.
4765069 4769070 I… We're… This kid on trial here, his type
4769156 4771147 Well, don't you know about them?
4773117 4776576 Th… There's… There's a danger here.
4776662 4778744 These people are dangerous.
4778831 4781869 They're… wild.
4781959 4783870 Listen to me.
4783961 4786293 -Listen.<br />-I have.
4786381 4789373 Now sit down and don't<br />open your mouth again.
4793304 4796045 I was only trying to… tell you.
4832550 4836839 It's always difficult to keep personal<br />prejudice out of a thing like this.
4837972 4841965 Wherever you run into it,<br />prejudice always obscures the truth.
4843560 4845927 I don't really know what the truth is.
4846020 4848933 I don't suppose anybody<br />will ever really know.
4850233 4854192 Nine of us now seem to feel<br />that the defendant is innocent.
4854279 4857271 But we're just gambling on probabilities.
4857365 4859322 We may be wrong.
4859409 4861776 We may be trying to<br />let a guilty man go free.
4861870 4863325 I don't know.
4863412 4865403 Nobody really can.
4865497 4867864 But we have a reasonable doubt,
4867958 4871451 and that's something that's<br />very valuable in our system.
4871545 4876085 No jury can declare a<br />man guilty unless it's sure.
4877551 4879918 We nine can't understand
4880012 4882720 how you three are still so sure.
4883557 4885547 -Maybe you can tell us.<br />-I'll try.
4886934 4890437 You've made some excellent points, but I<br />still believe the boy is guilty of murder,
4890521 4892228 and I have two reasons.
4892315 4895433 One, the evidence given by<br />the woman across the street
4895526 4898143 who actually saw the murder committed.
4898237 4900823 As far as I'm concerned, that's<br />the most important testimony.
4900907 4904150 And two, the fact that she<br />described the stabbing by saying
4904243 4906796 she saw the boy raise his arm over his
4906880 4909863 head and stab down<br />into the father's chest.
4909956 4911993 She saw him do it the wrong way.
4912083 4913994 That's absolutely right.
4914085 4916668 Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
4916755 4919838 She said she went to<br />bed about 11:00 that night.
4919925 4923511 Her bed was next to the window,<br />and she could look out while lying down,
4923595 4927680 and see directly into the<br />boy's room across the street.
4927766 4930392 She tossed and turned for<br />over an hour, unable to sleep.
4930476 4934640 Finally, she turned toward the<br />window at about ten minutes after 12:00,
4934730 4937236 and, as she looked<br />out, she saw the killing
4937320 4939850 through the windows of a passing el train.
4939944 4942654 She said the lights went out<br />immediately after the killing,
4942738 4947528 but that she got a good look at the<br />boy in the act of stabbing his father.
4948536 4952370 As far as I can see it, this<br />is unshakable testimony.
4953122 4955784 -Well, that's the whole case.<br />-What do you think?
4961172 4962833 How about you?
4964467 4966925 I… I don't know.
4967011 4969002 So much evidence to sift.
4969097 4971054 This is a pretty complicated business.
4971140 4974928 Frankly, I don't see how<br />you can vote for acquittal.
4975018 4977353 It's not so easy to arrange<br />all the evidence in order.
4977437 4979481 JUROR 3: You can throw<br />out all the other evidence!
4979565 4983149 The woman saw him do it!<br />What else do you want?
4983235 4985111 -Yeah, well, maybe…<br />-Let's vote on it.
4985195 4987363 FOREMAN: Okay.<br />There's another vote called for.
4987447 4989279 Anybody object?
4989366 4992404 All right. I'm changing my vote.<br />He's guilty.
4992494 4994906 Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.
4994997 4998580 Why is this such a personal<br />triumph for you… this one vote?
4998666 5002125 Okay. I say we're a hung jury.<br />I say we take it in to the judge.
5002211 5004919 How about it? I want to hear arguments.
5005006 5007506 You, you're the leader of the cause.<br />What about it?
5009760 5011592 Let's go over it again.
5011679 5013590 We've been over it again!
5013681 5016176 The boy in the gray<br />flannel suit here is bouncin'
5016260 5018471 backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.
5018561 5022394 No point in getting nasty and<br />trying to turn this into a contest.
5024357 5025813 Okay.
5025900 5028938 Maybe we can talk about<br />setting some kind of time limit.
5029029 5031145 Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?
5031865 5035608 It's a quarter after 6:00.
5035702 5037659 Someone before mentioned 7:00.
5037746 5040122 I think that's a point at which<br />we might begin to discuss
5040206 5043448 the question of whether<br />we're a hung jury or not.
5043542 5045203 Don't you feel well?
5046545 5048502 I feel perfectly well, thank you.
5048589 5051297 I was saying that 7:00<br />would be a reasonable time.
5051383 5054296 Uh, the reason I asked<br />about that was because, uh
5054386 5055971 you were rubbing your nose like
5056055 5058717 Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting,
5058807 5062016 but you made a gesture that<br />reminded me of something.
5062102 5064145 I'm trying to settle something here.<br />Do you mind?
5064229 5066219 Well, I think this is important.
5067315 5069101 Thank you.
5069192 5071809 Now then, I'm sure<br />you'll pardon me for this,
5071903 5074822 but I was wondering why you<br />were rubbing your nose like that.
5074906 5076567 JUROR 3: Oh, come on, will ya?
5076658 5080822 At this point, I happen to be talking<br />to the gentleman sitting next to you!
5080912 5084155 Now, why were you<br />rubbing your nose like that?
5084248 5086182 Well, if it's any of your business, I was
5086266 5088334 rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
5088418 5090034 Oh. I'm sorry.
5090128 5093996 -Is it… is it because of your eyeglasses?<br />-It is.
5094091 5095842 Now can we get on to something else?
5095926 5100511 Your eyeglasses made those two deep<br />impressions on the sides of your nose.
5100597 5102759 I hadn't noticed that before.
5102849 5106342 -That must be annoying.<br />-It is very annoying.
5106436 5108347 Well, I wouldn't know about that.
5108438 5111771 I've never worn eyeglasses. Twenty-twenty.
5111857 5114707 Listen, will you come on<br />already with the optometrist bit?
5116320 5119858 The woman who testified<br />that she saw the killing
5119949 5123487 had those same marks<br />on the sides of her nose.
5124495 5126702 JUROR 6: Holy smokes!<br />You know, he's right.
5126789 5128457 -[ALL CHATTERING]<br />-JUROR 9: Please.
5128541 5132283 Just give me a minute,<br />and I'll be finished.
5132377 5135210 I don't know if anyone<br />else noticed that about her.
5135296 5139164 I didn't think of it then, but<br />I've been going over her face
5140218 5142334 in my mind.
5142429 5144420 She had those same marks.
5145432 5149596 -She kept rubbing them in court.<br />-He's right. She did do that a lot.
5150645 5155309 This woman was about,<br />uh… about 45 years old.
5155399 5159358 She was making a<br />tremendous effort to look 35,
5159445 5161652 for her first public appearance.
5161739 5164982 Heavy makeup, dyed hair
5165075 5168943 brand-new clothes that should<br />have been worn by a younger woman.
5169037 5170698 No glasses.
5170789 5172450 No, women do that.
5172541 5174953 See if you can get<br />the mental picture of it.
5175043 5176875 What do you mean, no glasses?
5176962 5179672 How do you know whether she wore glasses?<br />Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
5179756 5181963 Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.
5182049 5183960 So what? What do ya think that means?
5184051 5186298 Listen, I'm getting so<br />sick of your yelling in here!
5186382 5187262 Come on. Forget it.
5187346 5190338 Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.<br />I saw them too.
5190433 5191949 I was the closest one to her.<br />She had these,
5192033 5193560 uh… these things on the side of her nose.
5193644 5196855 -What do you call those on the side?<br />-Well, what point are you making here?
5196939 5200806 She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br />Well, what does that mean?
5200901 5205190 Could those marks be made by<br />anything other than eyeglasses?
5208784 5211116 No, they couldn't.
5211203 5213194 JUROR 3: I didn't see any marks!
5214831 5216538 I did.
5216625 5219162 Strange, but I didn't<br />think about it before.
5219252 5221379 Well, what about the lawyer?<br />Why didn't he say something?
5221463 5224375 There are 12 people in here<br />concentrating on this case.
5224465 5226547 Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
5226634 5229803 Well, what about the district attorney?<br />Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?
5229887 5231753 Have her testify without her glasses?
5231889 5233710 Did you ever see a woman<br />who had to wear glasses and
5233794 5235809 didn't want to because she<br />thinks they spoil her looks?
5235893 5239386 Okay. She had marks on her nose.
5239480 5243144 I'm giving you that. From glasses, right?
5243234 5245103 She didn't want to wear 'em out of the
5245187 5247397 house so people would<br />think she's gorgeous.
5247487 5252072 But when she saw this kid killing<br />his father, she was in the house alone.
5252158 5254365 That's all.
5254452 5258446 -Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?<br />-No, I don't.
5260166 5262077 No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
5262168 5265171 It's logical to assume that she wasn't<br />wearing them when she was in bed
5265255 5267005 tossing and turning,<br />trying to fall asleep.
5267089 5269421 -How do you know?<br />-I don't know! I'm guessing.
5269508 5271968 I'm also guessing that she<br />probably didn't put her glasses on
5272052 5274179 when she turned to look<br />casually out of the window.
5274263 5277015 And she herself testified the killing<br />took place just as she looked out.
5277099 5278572 The lights went off a split second later.<br />She
5278656 5280143 couldn't have had time<br />to put them on then.
5280227 5281853 -Wait a second.<br />-Here's another guess.
5281937 5283872 Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
5283956 5286024 kill his father.<br />I say she only saw a blur.
5286108 5289691 How do you know what she saw?<br />How does he know all that?
5289777 5292529 How do you know what kind of glasses<br />she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.
5292613 5295230 Maybe she was farsighted.<br />What do you know about it?
5295324 5298567 I only know the woman's<br />eyesight is in question now.
5298661 5304782 She had to be able to identify a person<br />60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
5304876 5307252 You can't send someone<br />off to die on evidence like that.
5307336 5309327 Oh, don't give me that.
5309422 5311590 Don't you think the woman<br />might have made a mistake?
5311674 5314085 -No.<br />-It's not possible?
5314175 5315791 No, it's not possible.
5318763 5320674 Is it possible?
5321808 5323469 Not guilty.
5327647 5330309 Do you think he's guilty?
5330400 5332391 I think he's guilty.
5335154 5336815 Do you?
5339700 5342738 No. I'm convinced.
5342828 5344410 Not guilty.
5344496 5346282 What's the matter with you?
5346373 5348284 I have a reasonable doubt now.
5348375 5349911 Eleven to one.
5350002 5352921 Well, what about all the other evidence?<br />What about all that stuff?
5353005 5355087 The knife, the whole business!
5355174 5358086 Well, you said we could<br />throw out all the other evidence.
5363848 5366010 JUROR 7: Well, what do we do now?
5369020 5370681 You're alone.
5370772 5374606 I don't care whether I'm alone or not!<br />It's my right.
5377779 5379940 It's your right.
5389081 5391493 Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.
5393126 5396460 -We want to hear your arguments.<br />-I gave you my arguments.
5397464 5399580 We're not convinced.
5399675 5402462 We want to hear them again.
5402551 5404542 We have as much time as it takes.
5410226 5414686 Everything… Every single thing<br />that took place in that courtroom,
5414772 5416690 but I mean everything… says he's guilty.
5416774 5419232 What do you think, I'm<br />an idiot or something?
5420903 5422988 Why don't you take that<br />stuff about the old man?
5423072 5426234 The old man who lived<br />there and heard everything.
5427909 5429570 Or this business about the knife.
5429661 5431662 What? 'Cause he found<br />another one exactly like it?
5431746 5435080 The old man saw him<br />right there on the stairs!
5435166 5437999 What's the difference<br />how many seconds it was?
5439170 5441161 Every single thing.
5442590 5445753 The knife falling through<br />a hole in his pocket.
5445844 5449177 You can't prove he didn't get to the door.
5449263 5451681 Sure, you can take all the<br />time, hobble around the room.
5451765 5454348 But you can't prove it!
5456270 5459888 And what about this business<br />of the el and the movies?
5459982 5463020 There's a phony deal if I ever heard one.

5467406 5469646 I'm telling ya, everything that's gone on
5469741 5473575 has been twisted and turned!
5473661 5475743 This business with the glasses?
5475830 5481371 How do you know she didn't have them on?<br />This woman testified in open court!
5481461 5485420 And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?
5485506 5488749 I'm telling ya, I've<br />got all the facts here.
