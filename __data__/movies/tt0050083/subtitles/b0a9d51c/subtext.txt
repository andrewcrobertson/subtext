62376 64582 Thank you very much, sir.
64667 66832 You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
66917 69291 Shh. Shh.
69376 71376 We did it, Pete. We did it.
72875 74582 - For a moment, we had our doubts.<br />- Shh.
74667 78083 To continue, you've listened<br />to a long and complex case...
78167 79957 murder in the first degree.
80042 84999 A premeditated murder is the most serious<br />charge tried in our criminal courts.
85084 86832 You've listened to the testimony.
86917 89837 You've had the law read to you<br />and interpreted as it applies in this case.
89917 93916 It's now your duty to sit down and try<br />and separate the facts from the fancy.
94833 98375 One man is dead.<br />Another man's life is at stake.
99167 103166 If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds<br />as to the guilt of the accused...
103250 105166 a reasonable doubt...
105250 108041 then you must bring me<br />a verdict of not guilty.
108125 109999 Now if, however,<br />there's no reasonable doubt...
110084 113957 then you must in good conscience<br />find the accused guilty.
115084 119208 However you decide,<br />your verdict must be unanimous.
119292 122666 In the event<br />that you find the accused guilty...
122750 126083 the bench will not entertain<br />a recommendation for mercy.
126167 129375 The death sentence<br />is mandatory in this case.
129459 133166 You're faced with a grave responsibility.<br />Thank you, gentlemen.
135167 137208 The alternate jurors are excused.
143209 145209 The jury will now retire.
263084 265084 Try this one. See if I can get it...
266417 268417 It's a muggy day.
271417 273791 Hey. Oh, oh.
285833 287916 - Piece of gum?<br />- No, thanks.
288000 290083 This thing is...
290167 292167 - Huh?<br />- ...move it.
293417 295643 - Come on, I'll give you a hand.<br />- Give me a hand with that.
295667 297667 That's it.
302625 304249 - You know something?<br />- Yeah?
304334 306083 I called the weather bureau this morning.
306167 308083 This is gonna be<br />the hottest day of the year.
308167 309749 Could be.
309833 311749 Boy, you'd think they'd at least<br />air-condition these places.
311833 315166 - What is your name, sir?<br />- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.
315250 316666 Thank you very much.
316750 319500 Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.
319583 322416 Now, if there's anything you want,<br />I'll be right outside the door.
322500 324749 - Just knock.<br />- Okay, thanks. We will.
337250 338458 Good morning.
338541 339999 I never knew they locked the door.
340084 342249 Sure they lock the door.<br />What'd you think?
343334 345749 I don't know.<br />It just never occurred to me.
347376 349166 What's that for?
349250 351124 Oh, I thought we might want<br />to vote by ballot.
351209 353874 Great idea. Maybe we can<br />get him elected senator.
356125 358125 Just in case, you know.
361376 363500 - Ηow'd you like it?<br />- Oh, I don't know.
363583 365249 It was pretty interesting.
365334 367334 Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
367376 369957 I mean, I've never been<br />on a jury before.
370042 372749 No? I've sat on many juries.
373917 376832 What gets me is the way<br />those lawyers talk and talk and talk...
376917 379083 even when it's an open-and-shut case<br />like this one.
379167 380874 Did you ever hear<br />so much talk about nothin'?
380958 382832 Well, I guess they're entitled.
382917 385375 Yeah. They're entitled.<br />It's the system, but...
386583 390666 If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids<br />down before they start any trouble.
390750 392832 It would save us a lot of time and money.
392917 394458 - Hey, let's get started, huh?<br />- That's a good idea.
394541 397226 - Yeah, let's get goin', huh?<br />- We probably all got things to do here.
397250 400352 I figured we'd start out with a five-minute<br />break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.
400376 401333 - Mr. Foreman.<br />- Huh?
401417 404208 - Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?<br />- Gee, I don't know.
404292 406292 I, uh... Well, I guess so.
411042 412500 Uh, you're in my seat.
412583 414583 - Oh. Excuse me.<br />- That's all right.
417125 419125 Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
422500 424957 What did you think of the case?
425042 427083 I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
427167 430291 No real... dead spots.<br />You know what I mean?
431167 433624 I tell you, we were lucky<br />to get a murder case.
433708 435708 I figured us for an assault or burglary.
435750 437999 Boy, they can be the dullest.
439583 440874 Hey.
440958 442540 That the Woolworth Building?
442625 444540 That's right.
444625 446208 Isn't that funny?
446292 448726 You know, I've lived here all my life.<br />I've never been inside that.
448750 450832 If you had to sort out all that junk...
450917 452999 Like that thing with the movies.
453084 456143 - Yeah. You can say that again.<br />- And what about that business with the knife?
456167 459041 I mean, asking grown-up people<br />to believe that kind of jazz, huh?
459125 461582 Well, I expected that.<br />You know what we're dealing with.
461667 464124 Yeah, I guess so.
464209 466209 Well, your horn works.<br />Now try your lights.
467583 469041 - What do you got, a cold?<br />- And how.
469125 471333 These hot-weather colds can kill you.
471417 473832 I can hardly touch my nose.<br />You know what I mean?
473917 477458 I sure do. I just got over one.
477541 480291 Aw, come on. Mr.<br />Foreman, let's go here, huh?
480376 481999 Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.
482084 484916 Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance<br />to see a paper this morning.
485000 486083 Hmm?
486167 488582 I was only wondering<br />how the market closed.
488667 491375 You got a seat on the Exchange?
491459 493208 I'm a broker.
493292 497666 I run a messenger service...<br />the Beck and Call Company.
497750 499874 The name is my wife's idea.
499958 503582 Got 37 men working.<br />Started with nothing.
503667 506832 Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?
510000 511832 Yeah, we can all get outta here<br />pretty quick, huh?
511917 513633 I don't know about the rest of you,<br />but I happen
513657 515185 to have tickets to<br />that ball game tonight.
515209 517041 Yanks and Cleveland.
517125 518916 Yeah, we got this kid,<br />Modjelewski, in there.
519000 520666 Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.
520750 522874 You know... Phoom!
522958 525208 A real jug handle. You know?
525292 527540 Phoom!
527625 529957 You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?<br />Huh? Yeah.
530042 531500 Where do we sit here?
531583 534666 Well, I thought we'd sit in order,<br />you know, by jury numbers.
534750 537166 One, two, three, four, five...<br />so on, around the table.
537250 538500 If that's okay with you gentlemen.
538583 539666 - Sure.<br />- What's the difference?
539750 542791 - I think it's reasonable to sit in order.<br />- Let it be.
542875 545185 - Number 12. Do I sit down here?<br />- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...
545209 548458 - We start with you. One, right?<br />- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.
548541 550874 What was your impression<br />of the prosecuting attorney?
550958 552666 Okay. Two. You're two.
552750 553916 I beg pardon?
554000 558166 I thought he was really sharp, the way<br />he handled all those points one by one.
558250 561375 Logical sequence.<br />I was very impressed.
561459 564458 I think he... he did an expert job.
564541 567540 A lot of drive too, you know?<br />Real drive.
567625 569707 - Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?<br />- Sure.
569792 571375 Uh, fellas.
571459 574916 Say, we'd like to get started.<br />Gentleman at the window.
576583 578749 - We'd like to get started.<br />- Oh, I'm sorry.
578833 582500 Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?<br />Kid kills his father... bing, just like that.
582583 585226 Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,<br />you'll see it happens all the time.
585250 587166 They let those kids<br />run wild up there.
587250 589957 Well, maybe it serves 'em right.<br />You know what I mean?
590042 591624 Is... Is everyone here?
591708 593540 The old man is inside.
593625 596249 Oh. Would you, uh,<br />knock on the door for him?
596334 598334 You a Yankee fan?
598376 600376 No. Baltimore.
600833 602833 - Baltimore?<br />- Yeah.
603625 606166 That's like being hit in the head<br />with a crowbar once a day.
607917 609166 Who have they got?
609250 611666 No, I mean, who have they got<br />besides good groundskeepers?
611750 613291 Say, uh, we'd like to get started.
613376 616416 Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.<br />I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
617209 618999 Baltimore?
619084 621874 Okay, gentlemen,<br />if I can have your attention.
621958 624916 You fellas can handle this thing<br />any way that you want to.
625000 627500 I'm, um... You know,<br />I'm not gonna make any rules.
627583 630874 Uh, we can, well, discuss it first<br />and, uh, then vote on it.
630958 633624 That's, of course, uh...<br />That's, uh, one way.
633708 636666 And, uh, well, we can<br />vote on it right now, and...
636750 639249 I think it's customary<br />to take a preliminary vote.
639334 642916 Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?<br />Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?
643000 644707 Uh-huh.
644792 647874 Okay, then I think that, uh...
647958 650832 Of course you know that we have<br />a first-degree murder charge here...
650917 652999 and if we vote the accused guilty...
653084 656333 uh, we've got to send him<br />to the chair.
656417 660166 - Um, that's mandatory.<br />- I think we know that.
660250 661999 - Let's see who's where.<br />- We might as well.
662084 665874 - Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?<br />- All right with me.
667084 671666 Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this<br />has to be 12 to nothing either way.
671750 673208 Um, that's the law.
673292 675333 Okay, are we ready?
675417 678416 Now, all those voting guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
682417 685916 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
687250 689832 eight, nine, 10, 11.
689917 692832 Okay. That's 11 guilty.
692917 694917 Those voting not guilty.
695583 697666 One. Right.
697750 700041 That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.
700958 702540 Well, now we know where we are.
702625 706791 Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
707334 709624 So, what do we do now?
709708 711540 Well, I guess we talk.
711625 712957 Boy, oh, boy.
713042 715042 You really think he's innocent?
718334 719874 I don't know.
719958 722832 I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.<br />You heard what we did.
722917 725041 The kid's a dangerous killer.<br />You could see it.
725125 726749 He's 18 years old.
726833 728916 Well, that's old enough. Ηe...
729000 731666 He stabbed his own father<br />four inches into the chest.
731750 733999 They proved it<br />a dozen different ways in court.
734084 736624 Would you like me to list them for you?
736708 737999 No.
738084 740166 Then what do you want?
740250 743166 - I just want to talk.<br />- What's there to talk about?
743250 744582 Eleven men in here think he's guilty.
744667 746916 No one had to think about it twice<br />except you.
747000 750208 I want to ask you something.<br />Do you believe his story?
750292 752999 I don't know whether I believe it or not.<br />Maybe I don't.
753084 754666 So how come you vote not guilty?
754750 756666 Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.
756750 759500 It's not easy to raise my hand<br />and send a boy off to die...
759583 761666 without talking about it first.
761750 764166 - Well, now, who says it's easy?<br />- No one.
765459 767624 What, just because I voted fast?
767708 770124 I honestly think the guy's guilty.
770209 772999 You couldn't change my mind<br />if you talked for a hundred years.
773084 775165 I'm not trying to change your mind.<br />It's just that...
775667 777916 We're talking about somebody's life here.
778000 780143 We can't decide it in five minutes.<br />Supposing we're wrong.
780167 781582 "Supposing we're wrong."
781667 783726 Supposing this whole building<br />should fall down on my head.
783750 785750 - You can suppose anything.<br />- That's right.
786583 788333 Look, what's the difference<br />how long it takes?
788417 790999 Suppose we do it in five minutes.<br />So what?
791084 793208 Let's take an hour.
793292 795292 The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.
797917 799917 Hmm?
801250 803083 Who's got something to say?
803167 804582 I'm willing to sit for an hour.
804667 807375 Great. I heard<br />a pretty good story last night.
807459 809540 That's not why we're sitting here.
810250 813791 All right, then you tell me.<br />What are we sitting here for?
815042 817042 I don't know. Maybe no reason.
817875 821333 Look, this kid's been kicked around<br />all of his life...
821417 825333 you know, born in a slum,<br />mother dead since he was nine.
825417 827684 He lived for a year and a half<br />in an orphanage when his...
827708 830624 his father was serving a jail term<br />for forgery.
830708 833041 It's not a very happy beginning.
833125 835249 He's a... a wild, angry kid.
835334 837041 That's all he's ever been.<br />And you know why?
837125 840832 'Cause he's been hit on the head<br />by somebody once a day every day.
840917 843124 He's had a...<br />He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.
843209 846166 I... I just think we owe him a few words.<br />That's all.
846250 849791 I don't mind telling you this, mister.<br />We don't owe him a thing.
849875 852957 He got a fair trial, didn't he?<br />What do you think that trial cost?
853042 856124 - He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?<br />- You know it.
856209 858540 Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.
858625 860500 We heard the facts, didn't we?
860583 864375 You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed<br />to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
864459 866832 Listen, I've lived among them<br />all my life.
866917 870249 You can't believe a word they say.<br />You know that.
870334 872166 I mean, they're born liars.
872250 875582 - Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br />- Now listen...
875667 878500 Do you think you were born<br />with a monopoly on the truth?
878583 881166 I think certain things should be<br />pointed out to this man.
881250 883393 - Come on. This isn't Sunday.<br />- We don't need a sermon.
883417 885666 - Come on.<br />- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
886708 889749 Rice Pops.<br />It's a product I work on at the agency.
890583 893208 "The breakfast with the built-in bounce."
893292 894916 - I wrote that line.<br />- Very catchy.
895000 897166 - Yeah.<br />- Say, do you mind?
897250 898957 Oh, I'm sorry.
899042 901500 I have this habit of doodling.<br />Keeps me thinking clearly.
901583 903291 Yeah, we have all this work to do.
903376 905083 - There's no point staying here forever.<br />- Sorry.
905167 907375 Okay. Um...
907459 911249 perhaps if the gentleman down there<br />who's disagreeing with us...
911334 914624 Well, perhaps you could tell us why.<br />You know, let us know what you're thinking.
914708 917083 And we might be able to show you<br />where you're mixed up.
917167 918832 Well, look, maybe...<br />Maybe this is an idea.
918917 921333 Now, I haven't given it much thought,<br />but it seems to me...
921417 923504 that it's up to the<br />group of us to convince
923528 925832 this gentleman that he's<br />wrong and we're right.
925917 928458 Now, maybe if we each took<br />a couple of minutes just to...
929875 931291 Well, it was just a quick idea.
931376 932832 No, no, no. That's a good one.
932917 935999 Uh, suppose we go<br />once around the table.
936084 938957 - I guess you're first.<br />- Oh.
939042 941042 Well, uh...
941917 944333 Well, it-it's hard to put into words.
945376 947376 I just think he's guilty.
947459 949957 I thought it was obvious<br />from the word "go."
950042 951540 I mean, nobody proved otherwise.
951625 953166 Nobody has to prove otherwise.
953250 955500 The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
955583 958041 The defendant doesn't even<br />have to open his mouth.
958125 961249 - That's in the Constitution.<br />- Oh, well, sure, I know that.
961334 963334 Uh, what I meant was, is...
965084 967084 Well, I just think he's guilty.
967167 968874 I... I mean, somebody saw him do it.
968958 973999 Okay. Uh, here's what I think,<br />and I have no personal feelings about this.
974084 976249 I just want to talk about facts.
977250 979375 Number one.
979917 984041 The old man lived downstairs under the room<br />where the killing took place.
984125 986310 At 10 minutes after 12:00<br />on the night of the killing...
986334 989999 he heard loud noises,<br />said it sounded like a fight.
990084 992957 And he heard the kid yell out,<br />"I'm gonna kill ya."
993042 995333 A second later,<br />he heard a body hit the floor.
995417 997124 Ran to the door, opened it up...
997209 999624 saw the kid running down the stairs<br />and out of the house.
999708 1000999 Called the police.
1001084 1003749 They came in, found the old man<br />with a knife in his chest.
1003833 1007083 The coroner fixed the time of death<br />around midnight.
1007167 1010249 Now these are facts.<br />You can't refute facts.
1010334 1012500 The kid is guilty.
1012583 1014583 I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
1014667 1018540 I know he's only 18, but he's still<br />gotta pay for what he did.
1018625 1020083 I'm with you.
1020167 1022707 Okay. Are you finished?
1022792 1024249 - Yeah.<br />- Right. Next.
1024334 1027540 It is obvious, to me anyway,<br />that the boy's entire story was flimsy.
1027625 1029893 He claimed he was at the movies<br />during the time of the killing...
1029917 1032517 and yet, one hour later, he couldn't<br />remember the names of the films he saw...
1032541 1034375 - or who played in them.<br />- That's right.
1034459 1036749 And no one saw him going in<br />or out of the theater.
1036833 1038458 Listen, what about the woman<br />across the street?
1038541 1040832 If her testimony don't prove it,<br />nothing does.
1040917 1043249 That's right. She was the one<br />who actually saw the killing.
1043334 1045749 - Now, fellas, please.<br />- Let's go in order here, huh?
1045833 1049083 Just a minute. Here's a woman...
1049167 1051624 Here's a woman who was lying in bed.<br />She can't sleep.
1051708 1053624 She's dying with the heat.<br />You know what I mean?
1053708 1055540 Anyway, she looks out the window...
1055625 1059208 and right across the street she sees<br />the kid stick the knife into his father.
1059292 1062166 The time is 12:10 on the nose.
1062250 1064124 Everything fits.
1064209 1066041 Look, she's known the kid all his life.
1066125 1068310 His window is right opposite hers<br />across the El tracks...
1068334 1069999 and she swore she saw him do it.
1070084 1072749 - Through the windows of the passing El train.<br />- Right.
1072833 1076999 This El train had no passengers on it.<br />It was just being moved downtown.
1077084 1079999 The lights were out, remember?<br />And they proved in court that, at night...
1080084 1082559 you can look through the windows<br />of an El train when the lights are out...
1082583 1084916 and see what's happening<br />on the other side.
1085000 1087832 - They proved it.<br />- I'd like to ask you something.
1087917 1090597 You don't believe the boy's story.<br />How come you believe the woman's?
1090667 1092667 She's one of them too, isn't she?
1095084 1097084 You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?
1097167 1098582 - Okay, gentlemen.<br />- Now, now.
1098667 1100874 - Now, gentlemen.<br />- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
1100958 1103500 Oh, what's he so wise about?<br />I'm telling you.
1103583 1106832 - Okay, now come on.<br />- Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.
1106917 1108166 Whose turn is it next?
1108250 1111083 Oh, uh, his. Number five.
1113334 1116083 Okay, may I... Can I pass? It...
1116875 1118916 Well, uh, that's your privilege.
1119000 1122124 Uh, how about the next gentleman?
1122209 1124874 Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.
1124958 1129166 I started to be convinced, you know,<br />very early in the case.
1129750 1133874 You see, I was looking for a motive.<br />That's very important.
1133958 1138166 Because if you don't have a motive,<br />where's your case, right?
1138250 1141333 Anyway, that, uh, testimony<br />from those people...
1141417 1144458 in the apartment across the hall<br />from the kid's apartment...
1144541 1146791 that was very powerful.
1146875 1149666 Didn't they say something about a...<br />a fight and an argument...
1149750 1154166 between the old man and his son<br />around about, uh, 7:00 that night?
1154250 1156707 - I mean, I could be wrong, but I...<br />- It was 8:00.
1156792 1158832 It was 8:00. That's right.<br />They heard an argument.
1158917 1160666 They couldn't hear what it was about.
1160750 1162750 Then they heard<br />the father hit the boy twice.
1162792 1165749 Finally they saw the boy<br />run angrily out of the house.
1165833 1167416 What does that prove?
1167500 1171166 Well, it don't exactly prove anything.<br />It's just part of the picture.
1171250 1174226 Well, you said it provided a motive.<br />The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.
1174250 1176500 I don't think<br />that was a very strong motive.
1176583 1180166 This boy's been hit so many times in his<br />life that violence is practically a...
1180250 1182624 It's a normal state of affairs with him.
1182708 1186916 I just... I can't see two slaps in the face<br />provoking him into committing murder.
1187000 1190582 It may have been two too many.<br />Everyone has a breaking point.
1193125 1195208 Anything else?
1195292 1197749 - No.<br />- Okay.
1197833 1199833 Uh, how about you?
1201417 1203417 I don't know. It's all been said.
1204917 1207540 You can talk here forever.<br />It's still the same thing.
1208750 1211707 This kid is five for 0.
1211792 1213666 Well, look at his record.
1213750 1215957 When he was 10,<br />he was in children's court.
1216042 1217832 He threw a rock at a teacher.
1217917 1220208 When he was 15, he was in reform school.
1220292 1222124 He stole a car.
1222209 1224707 He's been arrested for mugging.
1224792 1226792 He was picked up twice for knife fighting.
1226875 1228957 Oh, yeah, they say<br />he's real handy with a knife.
1229042 1231832 Oh, this is a very fine boy.
1231917 1234916 Ever since he was five years old,<br />his father beat him up regularly.
1235000 1237416 - He used his fists.<br />- Well, so would I.
1237500 1238999 A kid like that?
1239084 1242249 It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.
1244750 1247916 When I was a kid,<br />I used to call my father "sir."
1248667 1249957 That's right. "Sir."
1250042 1252060 Do you ever hear a kid<br />call his father that any more?
1252084 1254582 Fathers don't seem to think<br />it's important any more.
1255376 1257416 - You got any kids?<br />- Three.
1258792 1260792 I got one.
1261625 1263625 Twenty-two years old.
1269500 1272249 When he was nine years old,<br />he ran away from a fight.
1273958 1277124 I saw it. I was so embarrassed<br />I almost threw up.
1278792 1283416 I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you<br />if I have to break you in two trying."
1285917 1287917 Well, I made a man out of him.
1288833 1290999 When he was 16, we had a fight.
1292583 1294957 Hit me in the jaw.<br />He was a big kid.
1298376 1300458 Haven't seen him for two years.
1302376 1304666 Kids.
1306376 1308376 Work your heart out.
1310917 1312166 Well, let's get going.
1312250 1314582 I think we're missing the point here.
1314667 1318083 This boy, let's say he's the product<br />of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.
1318167 1321749 We can't help that. We're here to decide<br />whether he's innocent or guilty...
1321833 1324749 not to go into the reasons<br />why he grew up the way he did.
1324833 1327540 He was born in a slum.<br />Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
1327625 1329500 I know it, and so do you.
1329583 1334291 It's no secret children from slum backgrounds<br />are potential menaces to society.
1334376 1336540 - Now I think...<br />- Brother, you can say that again.
1336625 1339166 The kids who crawl out of these places<br />are real trash.
1339250 1340745 I don't want any part<br />of them. I'm telling you.
1340769 1341559 Listen, mister. Listen.
1341583 1345291 - I, uh... I've lived in a slum all my life.<br />- Wait a minute.
1345376 1348791 Please, I... I played in backyards<br />that were filled with garbage.
1348875 1350916 I mean, maybe you can still<br />smell it on me.
1351000 1352333 Now, listen, sonny.
1352417 1353999 - Come on now.<br />- There's nothing personal about this.
1354084 1356684 - No, there was something personal.<br />- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
1356708 1358791 Let's not be so sensitive.
1358875 1360707 This sensitivity I can understand.
1360792 1365416 Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.<br />We're only wasting time, and...
1366583 1368707 Look, your turn down there.<br />Let's go.
1370042 1372934 Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br />you were all gonna try to convince me.
1372958 1374707 - Wasn't that the idea?<br />- Check. That was the idea.
1374792 1377060 - Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.<br />- What difference does it make?
1377084 1379476 He's the one who's keeping us in here.<br />Let's hear what he's got to say.
1379500 1382208 Oh, now wait a minute.<br />We decided to do this a certain way.
1382292 1383916 I think we ought to stick to that way.
1384000 1386000 Oh, stop being a kid, will you?
1386084 1388143 - What do you mean "a kid"?<br />- What do you think I mean?
1388167 1390167 K-I-D. Kid.
1392376 1396041 What? Listen, just because I'm trying<br />to keep this thing organized?
1396125 1398249 Here, you take it.<br />You take on the responsibility.
1398334 1400208 I'll just... I'll keep my mouth shut.<br />That's all.
1400292 1402352 What are you getting so hot about?<br />Calm down, will you?
1402376 1403707 Don't tell me to calm down.
1403792 1405976 Here. You wanna take the chair,<br />just take the chair. That's all.
1406000 1408517 - Did you ever see such a thing?<br />- See if you can keep it running.
1408541 1410559 - Listen, you think it's funny or something?<br />- Hey, forget it, fella.
1410583 1412166 The whole thing's unimportant.<br />Come on.
1412250 1415375 - Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.<br />- No, nobody wants to change.
1415459 1417208 You're doing a beautiful job.<br />Sit down.
1417292 1420124 Yeah, you're doing great.<br />Just great, fella.
1420209 1422209 You stay in there and pitch. You know?
1423042 1425249 All right. Let's hear from somebody.
1426750 1430832 Well, if you want me to tell you how I<br />feel about it, it's all right with me.
1430917 1433041 Boy, I don't care what you do.
1433125 1435999 All right, I don't have anything brilliant.
1436084 1438208 I only know as much as you do.
1438292 1442041 According to the testimony,<br />the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
1442125 1446291 I sat there in court for six days<br />listening while the evidence built up.
1446917 1448624 Everybody sounded so positive, you know?
1448708 1451166 I... I began to get a peculiar feeling<br />about this trial.
1451250 1453333 I mean, nothing is that positive.
1453417 1455540 There are a lot of questions<br />I'd have liked to ask.
1455625 1458333 I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't<br />have meant anything, but...
1458417 1460435 I began to get the feeling<br />that the defense counsel...
1460459 1462957 wasn't conducting a thorough-enough<br />cross-examination.
1463042 1466416 I mean, he... he let too many things go by,<br />little things that...
1466500 1469249 What little things? Listen,<br />when these fellas don't ask questions...
1469334 1471893 it's because they know the answers already<br />and they figure they'll be hurt.
1471917 1475832 Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer<br />to be just plain stupid, isn't it?
1475917 1477208 I mean it's possible.
1477292 1479292 You sound like you met<br />my brother-in-law once.
1482042 1484749 I... I kept putting myself<br />in the kid's place.
1486583 1488707 I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.
1488792 1491333 I mean, if I was on trial for my life...
1491417 1496208 I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br />witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
1496292 1500249 Look, there was one alleged eyewitness<br />to this killing.
1500792 1504166 Someone else claims he heard the killing,<br />saw the boy run out afterwards.
1504250 1506375 And there was a lot<br />of circumstantial evidence.
1506459 1509957 But actually, those two witnesses<br />were the entire case for the prosecution.
1510042 1511832 Supposing they're wrong.
1511917 1513707 What do you mean<br />supposing they're wrong?
1513792 1515666 What's the point<br />of having witnesses at all?
1515750 1518375 - Could they be wrong?<br />- What are you trying to say?
1518459 1519999 Those people sat on the stand under oath.
1520084 1521624 They're only people.<br />People make mistakes.
1521708 1523708 Could they be wrong?
1524209 1527124 - Well, no, I don't think so.<br />- Do you know so?
1527209 1529041 Oh, come on.<br />Nobody can know a thing like that.
1529125 1530832 This isn't an exact science.
1530917 1532917 That's right. It isn't.
1537417 1540166 Okay, let... Let's get to the point.
1540250 1542832 What about the switch knife<br />they found in the old man's chest?
1542917 1545393 Uh, wait-wait a minute.<br />There's some people who haven't talked yet.
1545417 1547476 - Shouldn't we go in order?<br />- They'll get a chance to talk.
1547500 1549832 Be quiet a second, will you?
1549917 1551208 What about it, this...
1551292 1554749 the knife this fine upright boy<br />admitted buying the night of the killing?
1554833 1556166 Let's talk about it.
1556250 1558559 All right, let's talk about it.<br />Let's get it in here and look at it.
1558583 1560333 I'd like to see it again.<br />Mr. Foreman?
1560417 1563500 - We all saw what it looks like.<br />- Why do we have to see it again?
1563583 1565704 The gentleman has a right<br />to see exhibits in evidence.
1567750 1569208 Say, could you bring us the knife?
1569292 1571292 - Knife?<br />- Yeah. Thank you.
1572750 1575999 The knife and the way it was bought<br />is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?
1576084 1577749 - I do.<br />- Good.
1577833 1580333 Now, suppose we take these facts<br />one at a time.
1580417 1583666 One. The boy admitted going out of the house<br />at 8:00 on the night of the murder...
1583750 1585666 after being slapped several times<br />by his father.
1585750 1588500 No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."<br />He said "punched."
1588583 1590999 There's a difference<br />between a slap and a punch.
1591084 1593666 After being hit several times<br />by his father.
1593750 1595999 Two. He went directly<br />to a neighborhood junk shop...
1596084 1598208 ...where he bought one of those...<br />- Switch knives.
1598292 1600292 Switchblade knives.
1600376 1602166 This wasn't what you'd call<br />an ordinary knife.
1602250 1604749 It had a very unusual carved handle<br />and blade.
1604833 1606333 The storekeeper who sold it to him...
1606417 1609540 said it was the only one of its kind<br />he had ever had in stock.
1609625 1613375 Three. He met some friends of his<br />in front of a tavern about 8:45.
1613459 1614957 Am I right so far?
1615042 1617166 - Yes, you are.<br />- You bet he is.
1617250 1620416 He talked with his friends for about<br />an hour, leaving them at 9:45.
1620500 1623458 During this time,<br />they saw the switch knife.
1623541 1625333 Four.
1625417 1627832 They identified the death weapon<br />in court...
1627917 1630416 as that very same knife.
1630500 1633291 Five. Ηe arrived home at about 10:00.
1633376 1635768 Now this is where the stories<br />offered by the State and the boy...
1635792 1637707 begin to diverge slightly.
1637792 1640375 He claims that he went to a movie<br />at about 11:30...
1640459 1644500 returning home at 3:10 to find his<br />father dead and himself arrested.
1644583 1646684 He also claims that<br />the two detectives who arrested him...
1646708 1648999 threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
1649084 1650916 Now, what happened to the switch knife?
1651000 1653684 He claims that it fell through a hole<br />in his pocket on the way to the movies...
1653708 1658375 sometime between 11:30 and 3:10<br />and that he never saw it again.
1658459 1660459 Now there's a tale, gentlemen.
1660500 1663999 I think it's quite clear that the boy<br />never went to the movies that night.
1664084 1666084 No one in the house<br />saw him go out at 11:30.
1666125 1667624 No one at the theater identified him.
1667708 1670029 He couldn't even remember<br />the names of the pictures he saw.
1672875 1674582 - What actually happened is this.<br />- Thank you.
1674667 1677874 The boy stayed home,<br />had another fight with his father...
1677958 1681666 stabbed him to death and left the<br />house at 10 minutes after 12:00.
1681750 1684500 He even remembered to wipe the knife<br />clean of fingerprints.
1684583 1687208 Now are you trying to tell me<br />that this knife...
1687292 1689208 really fell through a hole<br />in the boy's pocket...
1689292 1691726 someone picked it up off the street,<br />went to the boy's house...
1691750 1694416 and stabbed his father with it<br />just to test its sharpness?
1694500 1696559 No. I'm just saying it's possible<br />the boy lost his knife...
1696583 1698851 and that somebody else stabbed his father<br />with a similar knife.
1698875 1700083 It's just possible.
1700167 1702167 Take a look at this knife.
1703667 1705874 It's a very unusual knife.
1705958 1707500 I've never seen one like it.
1707583 1710375 Neither had the storekeeper<br />who sold it to the boy.
1710459 1713416 Aren't you asking us to accept<br />a pretty incredible coincidence?
1713500 1715832 I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
1715917 1717917 And I say it's not possible.
1724042 1725749 Where did that come from?
1725833 1727208 - Where'd you get that?<br />- It's the same knife.
1727292 1728791 What do you think you're doing?
1728875 1730500 Where did you get it?
1730583 1732832 I went out walking<br />for a couple of hours last night.
1732917 1734917 I walked through the boy's neighborhood.
1735000 1737999 I bought that at a little pawnshop<br />just two blocks from the boy's house.
1738084 1739540 It cost six dollars.
1739625 1742749 It's against the law<br />to buy or sell switchblade knives.
1742833 1745083 That's right. I broke the law.
1745167 1749166 Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.<br />Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.
1749250 1751333 Maybe there are 10 knives like that.<br />So what?
1751417 1754208 - Maybe there are.<br />- Well, what does it mean?
1754292 1757612 You found another knife like it. What's that,<br />the discovery of the age or something?
1757667 1760060 You mean you're asking us to believe<br />that somebody else did the stabbing...
1760084 1761874 with exactly the same kind of knife?
1761958 1763208 The odds are a million-to-one.
1763292 1765999 - It's possible.<br />- But not very probable.
1767209 1769209 Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
1769292 1771453 There's no point in standing around<br />all over the place.
1772958 1776375 You know, it's interesting that he'd find a<br />knife exactly like the one the boy bought.
1776459 1779208 What's interesting about it?<br />"Interesting."
1779292 1781166 Well, I don't know.<br />I just thought it was interesting.
1781250 1783041 There are still 11 of us here<br />who think he's guilty.
1783125 1785416 - Right.<br />- What do you think you're gonna accomplish?
1785500 1787333 You're not gonna change anybody's mind.
1787417 1789791 So if you wanna be stubborn<br />and hang this jury, go ahead.
1789875 1792916 The kid will be tried again<br />and found guilty sure as he's born.
1794459 1796333 That's probably right.
1796417 1799624 So what are you gonna do?<br />You know, we could be here all night.
1799708 1802957 It's only one night. A boy may die.
1803042 1805582 Well, why don't we just<br />set up house here, huh?
1805667 1808148 Someone send for Potsy the policeman<br />and get a pinochle deck...
1808209 1810707 and, uh, we'll just<br />sweat the whole thing out right here.
1812209 1815310 - I don't think he ought to joke about it.<br />- What do you want me to do about it?
1815334 1818999 Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff<br />about the knife's got to do with anything.
1819084 1821999 Somebody saw the kid stab his father.<br />What more do we need?
1822084 1824874 You guys can talk the ears right off my head.<br />You know what I mean?
1824958 1827666 I got three garages of mine goin' to pot<br />while you're talking.
1827750 1829416 So let's get done and get outta here.
1829500 1832916 The knife was very important to the<br />district attorney. He spent a whole day...
1833000 1835481 He's a 15th assistant or something.<br />What does he know about it?
1835541 1836999 Hey, let's hold it down.
1837084 1839416 These side arguments<br />are only slowing us up.
1842292 1843666 Well, what about it?
1843750 1845750 You're the only one.
1853167 1855208 I have a proposition<br />to make to all of you.
1856292 1858292 I'm gonna call for another vote.
1859500 1864707 I want you 11 men to vote<br />by secret written ballot.
1864792 1866832 I'll abstain.
1866917 1869707 If there are 11 votes for guilty,<br />I won't stand alone.
1869792 1873582 We'll take in a guilty verdict<br />to the judge right now.
1875042 1878749 But if anyone votes not guilty,<br />we stay here and talk it out.
1882084 1884999 Well, that's it.<br />If you want to try it, I'm ready.
1885084 1886540 All right. Let's do it the hard way.
1886625 1888540 Okay, that sounds fair.<br />Everyone agreed?
1888625 1890707 - Anyone doesn't agree?<br />- Fine, fine. Let's go.
1890792 1891832 Here, pass these along.
1891917 1893917 Is that the right time?
1925708 1933700 "Guilty."
1955583 1958208 "Not guilty."
1958292 1959707 "Guilty."
1959792 1961458 Boy, how do you like that?
1961541 1963999 Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.
1964084 1966832 All right, who was it?<br />Come on. I want to know.
1966917 1969166 Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
1969250 1970791 We all agreed on that, no?
1970875 1972999 If the gentleman wanted<br />to remain secret...
1973084 1974957 Secret? What do you mean secret?
1975042 1978249 There are no secrets in a jury room.<br />I know who it was.
1979000 1980916 Brother, you really are something.
1981000 1983000 You sit here, vote guilty<br />like the rest of us...
1983084 1986375 and then some golden-voiced preacher<br />starts tearin' your poor heart out...
1986459 1989749 about some underprivileged kid<br />just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...
1989833 1991333 and you change your vote.
1991417 1993540 If that isn't the most sick...
1993625 1997291 Why don't you drop a quarter<br />in his collection box?
1997376 1999376 Oh, now just wait a minute.
1999417 2000999 Listen, you can't talk to me like that.
2001084 2002916 - No. Who do you think you are?<br />- Calm down. Calm down.
2003000 2005333 No. Who does he think he is?<br />Did you hear him?
2005417 2007436 It doesn't matter. He's<br />very excitable. Sit down.
2007460 2008874 Excitable? You<br />bet I'm excitable!
2008958 2011791 We're trying to put a guilty man<br />in the chair where he belongs!
2011875 2014540 Someone starts telling us fairy tales,<br />and we're listenin'!
2014625 2016375 Hey, uh, come on, huh?
2016459 2018375 What made you change your vote?
2018459 2020083 He didn't change his vote.
2020167 2021333 I did.
2021417 2023417 - Oh, fine.<br />- I knew it.
2023459 2025459 Would you like me to tell you why?
2025500 2027375 No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.
2027459 2029999 I'd like to make it clear anyway,<br />if you don't mind.
2030084 2031582 Do we have to listen to this?
2031667 2033416 The man wants to talk.
2033500 2035083 Thank you.
2035167 2038500 This gentleman has been<br />standing alone against us.
2038583 2040832 Now, he doesn't say<br />the boy is not guilty.
2040917 2042917 He just isn't sure.
2042958 2045791 Well, it's not easy to stand alone<br />against the ridicule of others.
2045875 2048999 So he gambled for support,<br />and I gave it to him.
2049084 2050791 I respect his motives.
2050875 2055416 The boy on trial is probably guilty,<br />but, uh, I want to hear more.
2055500 2057291 Right now, the vote is 10 to two.
2057376 2059624 I'm talking here!<br />You have no right to leave this room!
2059708 2061582 He can't hear you. He never will.
2061667 2063667 Let's sit down.
2067417 2069624 Shall we continue?
2069708 2071916 Well, I... I think we ought<br />to take a break.
2072000 2076124 You know, one man's inside,<br />and I think we ought to wait for him.
2076209 2079166 Okay.
2079250 2081250 Looks like we're really<br />hung up here, huh?
2082376 2084736 And that thing with the old man,<br />that was pretty unexpected.
2086792 2089249 I wish I could figure out some way<br />we could break it up.
2092376 2095832 You know, in advertising...<br />I told you I worked in an agency.
2095917 2096916 Mm-hmm.
2097000 2099060 Well, there's some pretty strange people<br />working there.
2099084 2101166 Well, they're not strange really, I guess.
2101250 2103874 It's just that they have peculiar ways<br />of expressing themselves.
2103958 2105208 You know what I mean.
2105292 2107692 Of course, I suppose it's the same<br />in your business too, huh?
2108250 2109749 What do you do?
2109833 2111999 - I'm a watchmaker.<br />- Oh, really?
2112084 2115291 Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers<br />in the world come from Europe, huh?
2115376 2118435 Anyway, as I was telling you, in an<br />agency, when we reach a point like this...
2118459 2121979 I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when<br />a point like this is reached in a meeting...
2122042 2124666 there's always some character<br />ready with an idea, see.
2124750 2126750 And it kills me.
2126792 2128291 It's the weirdest thing in the world...
2128376 2131707 the way they sometimes precede their idea<br />with a little phrase, see, like...
2131792 2134707 Some account exec will get up,<br />and he'll say, uh...
2134792 2136624 "Okay, here's an idea.
2136708 2140333 Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole<br />and see if anyone salutes it."
2140417 2143540 I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?
2143625 2148124 I, uh<br />- I got a little excited back there. I...
2149125 2151125 didn't mean to get nasty.
2151750 2155540 I'm glad you're not one of those<br />lets these emotional appeals influence him.
2156708 2158957 Uh...
2172209 2175209 I don't know what's the matter with that fan.<br />Can't seem to get it to start.
2176292 2178832 ♪ Be, be, be ♪
2178917 2180999 ♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ♪♪
2181583 2183583 Eh!
2184625 2186832 Hey, you a salesman?
2186917 2188917 I'm an architect.
2189250 2190582 Hmm.
2190667 2192916 You know what the soft sell is?
2195833 2197833 Boy, you got it. Believe me.
2199417 2201417 I got a different technique.
2201917 2203707 Laughs, drinks, jokes.
2203792 2206041 Tricks. You know?
2206875 2208875 Yeah.
2209541 2211749 "Hit 'em where they live."<br />That's my motto.
2213167 2215916 I made 27 grand last year<br />sellin' marmalade.
2216750 2219249 That's not bad. I mean,<br />you know, considering marmalade.
2222459 2224459 Hey, what are you<br />gettin' outta this... kicks?
2226417 2229060 Or did somebody bump you on the head<br />one time and you haven't gotten over it?
2229084 2231084 Maybe.
2231792 2234333 You know, you do-gooders are all alike.
2234417 2237083 You're always blowing your stacks<br />over some guy that fanned.
2240167 2242167 But what are you wasting our time for?
2242750 2246791 Why don't you donate five dollars to the<br />cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.
2250084 2252333 This kid is guilty, pal.
2252417 2254832 It's as plain as the nose on your face.
2254917 2257166 So why don't we stop<br />wasting our time here?
2257250 2260166 We're gonna all get sore throats<br />if we keep it up, you know?
2260250 2262930 What difference does it make<br />if you get it here or at the ball game?
2263583 2266500 Oh, no difference, pal.
2266583 2268583 No difference at all.
2280292 2282166 Nice bunch of guys, huh?
2282250 2284540 Oh, they're about the same<br />as anyone else.
2284625 2287416 Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.
2288417 2290458 You think we'll be much longer?
2290541 2292166 I don't know.
2292250 2294166 Aw, he's guilty for sure.
2294250 2295791 Not a doubt in the whole world.
2295875 2298416 We should...<br />Should've been done already.
2300667 2301916 Oh, I don't mind, you know.
2302000 2304416 Hmm. Beats workin'.
2308084 2310084 Uh...
2311625 2313707 You think he's not guilty, huh?
2313792 2315792 I don't know. It's possible.
2316376 2320166 Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'<br />you never been wronger in your life.
2320250 2322666 You're wasting your time.<br />You ought to wrap it up.
2322750 2324916 Supposing you were the one<br />who was on trial.
2325750 2327624 Well, I'm not used to supposing.
2327708 2332208 I'm just a workingman.<br />My boss does the supposing. But...
2332292 2334292 Well, I'll try one.
2335000 2340666 Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,<br />uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?
2349583 2350874 Are you ready?
2350958 2352166 Hup.
2352250 2353166 That one.
2353250 2355250 Sorry, blue eyes.
2355833 2359249 - Well, where else...<br />- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.
2359334 2361249 Looks like we'll be here<br />for dinner, huh?
2361334 2363707 Okay, now let's...<br />Let's get down to business.
2363792 2365166 Now, who wants to start it off?
2365250 2366666 - I would.<br />- Okay, go.
2366750 2368832 You down there.
2368917 2372791 The old man who lived downstairs says he<br />heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."
2372875 2375500 A second later,<br />he heard the body hit the floor.
2375583 2379458 Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid<br />running down the stairs and out of the house.
2379541 2380916 What does that mean to you?
2381000 2382657 I was wondering how<br />clearly the old man could
2382681 2384435 have heard the boy's<br />voice through the ceiling.
2384459 2386559 He didn't hear it through the ceiling.<br />The window was open.
2386583 2388416 So was the one upstairs.<br />It was a hot night, remember?
2388500 2389832 Well, it was another apartment.
2389917 2392559 It's not that easy to identify a voice,<br />particularly a shouting voice.
2392583 2394166 - He identified it in court.<br />- That's right.
2394250 2395707 And don't forget the lady<br />across the street.
2395792 2398582 She looked right in the open window<br />and saw the boy stab his father.
2398667 2401124 - Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?<br />- No, it isn't.
2401209 2403209 Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?
2403250 2405083 It's like talking into a dead phone.
2405167 2408333 She said she saw the killing through the<br />windows of a moving elevated train.
2408417 2411916 There were six cars on the train.<br />She saw the killing through the last two cars.
2412000 2413832 She remembered<br />the most insignificant details.
2413917 2415957 I don't see how you can argue with that.
2416042 2420582 Has anybody here any idea<br />how long it would take an el...
2429250 2430832 Hey!
2430917 2432917 This isn't a game.
2436708 2438957 - Did you see him?<br />- Hey.
2439042 2440791 - The nerve.<br />- All right, listen...
2440875 2444124 - The absolute nerve.<br />- Forget it. It's not important.
2444209 2446209 - "This isn't a game"?<br />- Calm down.
2446250 2449582 - Who does he think he is?<br />- I'm telling you, forget it now.
2449667 2452999 Has anybody any idea how long<br />it takes an elevated train...
2453084 2454916 going at medium speed<br />to pass a given point?
2455000 2456874 - What has that to do with anything?<br />- How long? Take a guess.
2456958 2459624 - I wouldn't have the slightest idea.<br />- What do you think?
2459708 2461708 I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?
2462583 2464249 I think that's a pretty good guess.<br />Anyone else?
2464334 2467124 - That sounds right to me.<br />- Come on. What's the guessing game for?
2467209 2469041 - What do you say?<br />- Ten seconds is about right.
2469125 2471041 All right. Say 10 seconds.<br />What are you getting at?
2471125 2476166 This. It takes a six-car El train<br />10 seconds to pass a given point.
2476250 2478187 Now let's say the<br />given point is the open
2478211 2480500 window of the room<br />where the killing took place.
2480583 2483874 You can reach out of that window<br />and almost touch the El tracks, right?
2483958 2485458 Now let me ask you this.
2485541 2487791 Has anyone here<br />ever lived near the El tracks?
2487875 2491500 Well, uh, I just finished painting an<br />apartment that overlooked an El line.
2491583 2493249 - I was there for three days.<br />- What was it like?
2493334 2494500 - What do you mean?<br />- Noisy?
2494583 2497124 Oh, brother. Don't matter though.<br />We were all punchy.
2497209 2499791 I lived in a second-floor apartment<br />near the El line once.
2499875 2502996 When the window was open and the train<br />goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.
2503042 2505893 - You can hardly hear yourself think.<br />- All right, you can't hear yourself think.
2505917 2508333 - Will you get to the point?<br />- I will. Now just a minute.
2508417 2512041 Let's take two pieces of testimony<br />and try to put them together.
2512125 2516208 First. The old man in the<br />apartment downstairs.
2516292 2518874 He says he heard the boy say<br />"I'm gonna kill you"...
2518958 2521707 and a split second later<br />heard a body hit the floor.
2521792 2523375 - One second later, right?<br />- That's right.
2523459 2529458 Second. The woman across the street swore<br />positively she looked out of the window...
2529541 2532874 and saw the killing through the last two<br />cars of the passing elevated train, right?
2532958 2535291 - The last two cars.<br />- What are you giving us here?
2535376 2536707 Now, just a minute.
2536792 2541208 We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds<br />for a train to pass a given point.
2542042 2545375 Since the woman saw the killing<br />through the last two cars...
2545459 2550416 we can assume that the body<br />hit the floor just as the train went by.
2550500 2554957 Therefore, the train had been roaring<br />by the old man's window...
2555042 2558540 a full 10 seconds<br />before the body hit the floor.
2558625 2560832 The old man,<br />according to his own testimony...
2560917 2563832 "I'm gonna kill you," body hitting<br />the floor a split second later...
2563917 2566375 would have had to hear the boy<br />make this statement...
2566459 2568333 with the El roaring past his nose.
2568417 2569957 It's not possible he could've heard it.
2570042 2572268 - That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.<br />- Do you think he could've heard it?
2572292 2574726 He said he yelled at the top of his voice.<br />That's good enough for me.
2574750 2577060 Even if he heard something, he still<br />couldn't have identified the voice.
2577084 2578208 With the El roaring by?
2578292 2580726 You're talking about a matter of seconds!<br />Nobody can be that accurate.
2580750 2585375 I think testimony that could put a boy into<br />the electric chair should be that accurate.
2587583 2589500 You know something?<br />I don't think he could've heard it.
2589583 2591916 Maybe he didn't hear it.<br />I mean, with all that El noise.
2592000 2593874 Oh, what are you people talking about?
2593958 2595999 Well, it stands to reason<br />he couldn't have heard it.
2596084 2597999 Why should he lie?<br />What's he got to gain?
2598084 2600291 Attention maybe.
2600376 2602291 You keep coming in<br />with these bright sayings!
2602376 2605416 Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?<br />They pay three dollars apiece.
2605500 2607707 What are you talking to him<br />like that for?
2608667 2612083 Guy talks like that to an old man<br />really ought to get stepped on, you know?
2612167 2614167 You ought to have more respect, mister.
2615209 2619582 If you say stuff like that to him again,<br />I'm gonna lay you out.
2629541 2632500 Now you go ahead.<br />You... You say anything you like.
2632583 2636624 Why do you think<br />the old man might lie?
2636708 2640124 It was just that I looked at him<br />for a very long time.
2640750 2643999 The seams of his jacket was split,<br />under the shoulder.
2644084 2645666 Or did you notice that?
2645750 2648249 I mean, to come to court like that.
2648334 2650334 Why...
2651125 2654999 He was a very old man<br />in a torn jacket.
2655084 2657957 And he walked very slowly<br />to the stand.
2658708 2662749 He was dragging his left leg<br />and trying to hide it...
2662833 2664833 because he was ashamed.
2665625 2669041 I think I know this man<br />better than anyone here.
2669917 2675333 This is a quiet, frightened,<br />insignificant old man who...
2675417 2677791 who has been nothing all his life...
2677875 2680291 who has never had recognition...
2680376 2682458 or his name in the newspapers.
2683125 2685333 Nobody knows him.
2685417 2687458 Nobody quotes him.
2687541 2691500 Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
2692334 2696208 Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing...<br />to be nothing.
2696917 2701249 A man like this needs to be quoted,<br />to be listened to.
2701875 2703875 To be quoted just once.
2703917 2705917 Very important to him.
2706292 2708707 It would be so hard for him<br />to recede into the background...
2708792 2710500 - Wait a minute.<br />- When there was a chance...
2710583 2713517 What are you trying to do... tell us he'd<br />lie just so he could be important once?
2713541 2716166 No. He wouldn't really lie.
2716250 2719707 But perhaps he made himself believe<br />he heard those words...
2719792 2721999 and recognized the boy's face.
2722084 2724375 That's the most fantastic story<br />I've ever heard.
2724459 2727500 How can you make up a thing like that?<br />What do you know about it?
2736541 2738582 Oh, uh, does anybody<br />want a cough drop?
2738667 2740916 - No, thanks.<br />- I'll take one.
2741000 2744500 You can say what you like. I still don't<br />see how anybody can think he's not guilty.
2744583 2747083 There's something else<br />I'd like to talk about for a minute.
2747167 2748791 Thanks.
2748875 2750563 I think we've proved<br />that the old man couldn't
2750587 2752226 have heard the boy<br />say "I'm gonna kill you."
2752250 2753832 - But supposing...<br />- You didn't prove it at all.
2753917 2756707 - What are you talking about?<br />- Supposing he really did hear it.
2756792 2759208 This phrase, how many times<br />have all of us used it?
2759292 2760791 Probably thousands.
2760875 2762500 "I could kill you for that, darling."
2762583 2764500 "Junior, you do that once more,<br />and I'm gonna kill you."
2764583 2765874 "Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."
2765958 2767832 We say it every day. That doesn't mean<br />we're really gonna kill anybody.
2767917 2769707 Wait a minute.<br />What are you trying to give us here?
2769792 2773500 The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."<br />The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
2773583 2774916 Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
2775000 2777352 Anybody says a thing like that<br />the way he said it, they mean it.
2777376 2778832 Well, gee, now I don't know.
2778917 2783624 I remember I was arguing with a guy I work<br />next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.
2783708 2785458 He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.
2785541 2788500 Now listen! This guy's trying to make you<br />believe things that aren't so.
2788583 2790726 The kid said he was gonna kill him,<br />and he did kill him.
2790750 2793768 Let me ask you this. Do you really think the<br />boy would shout out a thing like that...
2793792 2795582 so the whole neighborhood could hear him?
2795667 2797500 I don't think so.<br />He's much too bright for that.
2797583 2802333 Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.<br />He don't even speak good English.
2802417 2805249 "He doesn't even speak good English."
2807708 2811500 Mr. Foreman, I'd like<br />to change my vote to not guilty.
2811583 2812999 You what?
2813084 2815500 - You heard me.<br />- Are you sure?
2816417 2817832 Yeah, I'm sure.
2817917 2820375 The vote is nine to three,<br />favor of guilty.
2820459 2823249 Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?
2827292 2830041 What are you basing it on<br />the stories this guy made up?
2830667 2833060 You ought to write for one of those<br />kooky detective magazines.
2833084 2834916 You'd make a fortune.
2835000 2838416 For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer<br />knew he didn't stand a chance.
2838917 2840500 Right from the beginning,<br />his own lawyer knew it.
2840583 2842375 You could see it.
2842459 2846041 Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,<br />this guy here is really something.
2846875 2848666 Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
2848750 2851582 He presented his case, not you.<br />How come you got so much to say?
2851667 2854500 - Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.<br />- Baltimore, please. Huh?
2854583 2856291 He was court-appointed.
2856376 2858208 - What's that supposed to mean?<br />- It could mean a lot of things.
2858292 2861540 It could mean he didn't want the case,<br />or he resented being appointed.
2861625 2863458 It's the kind of case<br />that brings him nothing...
2863541 2866500 no money, no glory,<br />not even much chance of winning.
2866583 2869500 That's not a very promising situation<br />for a young lawyer.
2869583 2872559 He'd really have to believe in his client<br />to put up any kind of a good case...
2872583 2874643 and, as you pointed out a minute ago,<br />obviously he didn't.
2874667 2877500 Of course he didn't. Huh.
2877583 2879874 Who the heck could?
2879958 2882874 Except maybe<br />some guy's mother or somebody. I...
2882958 2885208 Ah, look.<br />Will you look at the time, huh?
2885292 2887832 - Come on. For crying out...<br />- Pardon me.
2887917 2890249 - I have made some notes here...<br />- Notes.
2890334 2892957 And I would like to...<br />please, to say something.
2893042 2895291 - Yeah.<br />- I have been listening very carefully.
2895376 2899791 And, uh, it seems to me that this man<br />has some very good points to make.
2899875 2904500 From what was presented at the trial,<br />the boy looks guilty on the surface.
2904583 2908666 - But maybe if we go deeper?<br />- Oh, come on, will ya?
2908750 2911041 There is a question I would like to ask.
2911125 2914416 Let us assume that the boy<br />really did commit the murder.
2914500 2917832 Now, this happened<br />at 10 minutes after 12:00.
2917917 2920375 Now, how was he caught by the police?
2920459 2924957 He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...
2925042 2928791 and he was captured by two detectives<br />in the hallway of his house.
2928875 2933458 Now, my question is,<br />if he really had killed his father...
2933541 2936749 why would he come back home<br />three hours later?
2936833 2939707 Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
2939792 2941540 He came home to get his knife.
2941625 2944226 It's not nice to go around leaving knives<br />sticking in people's chests.
2944250 2946999 - Yeah, especially relatives.<br />- Yeah.
2947084 2949333 I don't see anything funny about it.
2949417 2952957 The boy knew the knife could be identified<br />as the one he had just bought.
2953042 2955208 He had to get it before the police did.
2955292 2957496 But if he knew the<br />knife could be identified,
2957520 2959749 why did he leave it<br />there in the first place?
2960292 2963166 Well, I think we can assume<br />the boy ran out in a state of panic...
2963250 2965624 after having just killed his father.
2965708 2968666 When he finally calmed down,<br />he realized he had left his knife there.
2968750 2971666 Ah. This then depends<br />on your definition of panic.
2971750 2974124 He would have had to be<br />calm enough to see to it...
2974209 2976791 that there were no fingerprints<br />left on the knife.
2976875 2980916 Now, where did this panic start<br />and where did it end?
2981000 2983375 Look, you voted guilty.<br />What side are ya on?
2983459 2986999 I don't believe I have to be loyal<br />to one side or the other.
2987084 2988874 I'm simply asking questions.
2988958 2991957 Well, this is just off the top of my head,<br />but, uh...
2992042 2994601 well, if I were the boy<br />and I'd done the stabbing and everything...
2994625 2996749 I'd take a chance<br />and go back for the knife.
2996833 2999333 I'll bet he figured that nobody<br />had seen him running out...
2999417 3001916 and that the body wouldn't be discovered<br />till the next day.
3002000 3004041 Well, after all,<br />it was the middle of the night.
3004125 3006684 I'll bet he'd figured nobody<br />would find the body till the next day.
3006708 3008708 Pardon. This is my whole point.
3008792 3012500 The woman across the street testified that<br />the moment after she saw the killing...
3012583 3015166 that is, a moment<br />after the train went by...
3015250 3018249 she screamed<br />and then went to telephone the police.
3018334 3021707 Now, the boy certainly<br />must have heard the scream...
3021792 3025291 so he knew<br />that somebody saw something.
3025376 3028166 I just don't think<br />that he would have gone back.
3028250 3031060 Two things. One, in his state of panic,<br />he may not have heard the scream.
3031084 3032749 Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
3032833 3036208 Two, if he did hear it, he may not<br />have connected it with his own act.
3036292 3039333 Remember, he lived in a neighborhood<br />where screams were fairly commonplace.
3039417 3041874 - There's your answer.<br />- Maybe.
3041958 3044832 Maybe the boy did kill his father,<br />didn't hear the scream...
3044917 3048624 did run out in a panic,<br />did calm down three hours later...
3048708 3051349 and come back to get the knife,<br />risking being caught by the police.
3051417 3054333 Maybe all of those things happened,<br />but maybe they didn't.
3054417 3057226 I think there's enough doubt that we can<br />wonder whether he was there at all...
3057250 3058916 during the time the killing took place.
3059000 3060749 What do you mean doubt?<br />What are you talking about?
3060833 3062540 Didn't the old man see him<br />running out of the house?
3062625 3064416 He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.
3064500 3067832 Did or didn't the old man see the kid<br />running out of the house at 12:10?
3067917 3069832 Well, did or didn't he?
3069917 3073124 - He says he did.<br />- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?
3073209 3076226 - Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.<br />- Sure, when you want them to, they do.
3076250 3078500 Or when he wants them to, they do.<br />You know what I mean?
3078583 3080416 - Keep the yelling down!<br />- Oh, you keep saying that.
3080500 3082208 Maybe what we need<br />is a little yelling in here.
3082292 3083999 These guys<br />keep going off every which way.
3084084 3085999 Did hear the scream.<br />Didn't hear the scream.
3086084 3089310 What difference does it make? You people<br />are talking only about the little details.
3089334 3091893 You're forgetting the important stuff.<br />I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...
3091917 3094291 - I want to call for another vote.<br />- I'm talking here!
3094376 3098041 There's another vote called for.<br />Now let's take our seats.
3101917 3104458 I never saw so much time<br />spent on nothing.
3104541 3106541 It only takes a second.
3107334 3110749 Okay. I guess the fastest way<br />is to find out who's voting not guilty.
3110833 3113582 Now, all those voting not guilty,<br />please raise your hands.
3114833 3118416 Still the same.<br />One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.
3118500 3120166 So, now where are we?
3120250 3123666 I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until<br />next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?
3123750 3126500 Pardon. I vote not guilty.
3126583 3129582 Oh!
3129667 3132957 What are ya talking about? I mean,<br />we're all going crazy in here or something.
3133042 3136832 The kid is guilty.<br />Why don't you listen to the facts?
3136917 3139166 Tell him, will ya?<br />Now this is getting to be a joke.
3139250 3142458 The vote is eight to four,<br />favor of guilty.
3142541 3146208 What is this, love your underprivileged<br />brother week or something?
3146292 3148791 I want you to get up and tell me<br />why you changed your vote.
3148875 3153166 - Come on. Give me your reasons.<br />- I don't have to defend my decision to you.
3153250 3154999 There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
3155084 3158083 What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.<br />Here, look at this.
3158167 3163083 The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br />was seen ramming this into his father.
3163167 3165167 Now, what about this,<br />Mr. Reasonable Doubt?
3165250 3167916 That's not the knife.<br />Don't you remember?
3168000 3170166 Oh, brilliant.
3170250 3172540 I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.
3172625 3174791 I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
3174875 3177768 I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling<br />stories out of thin air, you know?
3177792 3181500 A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting<br />ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...
3181583 3184041 he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...
3184125 3186500 Look. Now, what about the old man?
3186583 3189226 Are we supposed to believe that he<br />didn't get up and run to his door...
3189250 3192249 and see the kid tearing down the steps<br />15 seconds after the killing?
3192334 3194791 He's just saying so to be important, right?
3194875 3197726 - I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?<br />- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?
3197750 3199957 Oh, and the Baltimore rooter<br />is heard from again now...
3200042 3202060 and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits<br />wherever we look.
3202084 3205333 Hold it a second. Now, look...<br />Did the old man say he ran to the door?
3205417 3206951 Ran,<br />walked. What's the difference? He got on,
3206975 3208435 didn't he? I mean,<br />he got there, didn't he?
3208459 3211060 - No, now wait a second.<br />- He said he ran. At least I think he did.
3211084 3214524 Look, I don't remember what he said, but I<br />don't see how he could have run to the door.
3214583 3216957 Ηe said he went<br />from his bedroom to the front door.
3217042 3218666 - Now, isn't that enough?<br />- Where was the bedroom?
3218750 3221060 - It was down the hall somewhere.<br />- I thought you remembered everything.
3221084 3223333 - Don't you remember that?<br />- No.
3223417 3225624 Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see<br />a diagram of the apartment.
3225750 3228177 Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all<br />over again so you can get everything straight?
3228201 3229018 Mr. Foreman.
3229042 3231726 How come you're the only one in this room<br />wants to see exhibits all the time?
3231750 3234458 - I want to see this one too.<br />- And I'd like to stop wasting time.
3234541 3237435 If we're gonna start wading through all that<br />nonsense about where the body was found...
3237459 3239459 We're not,<br />not unless somebody else wants to.
3239500 3241208 But I'd like to find out if an old man...
3241292 3243726 who drags one foot when he walks<br />'cause he had a stroke last year...
3243750 3246166 can get from his bedroom<br />to his front door in 15 seconds.
3246250 3247916 - He said 20 seconds.<br />- Ηe said 15.
3248000 3250166 He said 20 seconds.<br />What are you trying to distort...
3250250 3253500 - He said 15.<br />- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?
3253583 3255249 You can't judge a thing like that.
3255334 3257707 - He said 15 seconds.<br />- He was very positive about it.
3257792 3259999 He was an old man.<br />Half the time he was confused.
3260084 3262375 How could he be positive about anything?
3270042 3274166 I don't see what you're going to prove here.<br />The man said he saw the boy running out.
3274250 3276416 Well, let's see<br />if the details bear him out.
3276500 3279381 As soon as the body hit the floor,<br />he said he heard footsteps upstairs...
3279459 3281124 running toward the front door...
3281209 3284291 heard the upstairs door open,<br />the footsteps start down the stairs.
3284376 3286559 He said he got to his own front door<br />as fast as he could...
3286583 3288726 and he swore it couldn't have been<br />more than 15 seconds.
3288750 3290416 Now, if the killer<br />began running immediately...
3290500 3292707 - Maybe he didn't.<br />- The old man said he did.
3292792 3295500 You ought to be at Atlantic City<br />at that hairsplitters convention.
3296792 3298976 Hey, why don't you stop makin'<br />smart remarks all the time, huh?
3299000 3302185 My friend, for your three dollars a day,<br />you have to listen to everything, you know?
3302209 3303916 Now that you've got that thing in here,<br />what about it?
3304000 3306226 All right. Here's the apartment<br />where the killing took place.
3306250 3309291 The old man's apartment<br />was directly beneath and exactly the same.
3309376 3312582 Here are the El tracks, the bedroom,<br />living room, kitchen, bathroom.
3312667 3314667 Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.
3314750 3316999 Now, the old man<br />was in this bedroom right here.
3317084 3319749 He says he crossed to the door<br />and walked down the hall...
3319833 3322791 opened the front door just in time<br />to see the boy running down the stairs.
3322875 3326208 - Am I right so far?<br />- That's the story, for the 19th time.
3326292 3329832 - Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.<br />- Correct.
3329917 3331957 Now, let's see. It was...
3332042 3336041 It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.<br />The hall is 43 feet.
3336125 3339333 He would have had to walk 12 feet,<br />open the bedroom door...
3339417 3343041 walk 43 feet down and open the front door<br />all in 15 seconds.
3343125 3345832 - Do you think he could have done it?<br />- Sure he could have done it.
3345917 3348559 He can walk only very slowly.<br />They had to help him into the witness chair.
3348583 3350249 You make it sound like a long walk.
3350334 3352666 For an old man who had a stroke,<br />it is a long walk.
3352750 3356166 - Oh! What are you doing?<br />- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.
3356292 3358058 What do you mean,<br />you want to try it? Why didn't
3358082 3359726 his lawyer bring it<br />up if it's so important?
3359750 3361003 Maybe he just didn't think about it,<br />huh?
3361027 3363435 What do you mean, didn't think of it?<br />You think the man's an idiot or something?
3363459 3364999 - It's an obvious thing.<br />- Did you think of it?
3365084 3366749 Listen, smart guy.<br />Don't matter whether I thought of it.
3366833 3369143 He didn't bring it up because he knew it would<br />hurt his case. What do you think of that?
3369167 3371102 Maybe he didn't bring it<br />up because it would have
3371126 3373047 meant bullying and<br />badgering a helpless old man.
3373084 3376416 You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.<br />Most lawyers avoid it if they can.
3376500 3379268 - So, what kind of a bum is he then?<br />- That's what I've been asking, buddy.
3379292 3382333 Pass me that chair, will you?<br />Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
3382417 3385291 I just paced off 12 feet across the room.<br />This will be the bedroom door.
3385376 3387999 Oh, that's crazy.<br />You can't recreate a thing like that.
3388084 3390291 - I'd like to see it.<br />- The hall was 43 feet.
3390376 3392376 I'll pace from that wall and back again.
3393667 3397500 Look, this is absolutely insane. What are<br />you wasting everybody's time in here for?
3397583 3400503 According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.<br />Now, we can spare that, see.
3404417 3406083 Come on. Knock it off.
3406167 3407666 Okay.
3407750 3409791 Okay. Okay, killer.
3409875 3411875 Yeah.
3413792 3415832 Will you stand right there<br />and mark the front door?
3415917 3418416 It was chain-locked according<br />to the testimony, remember?
3418500 3420666 - Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?<br />- I have.
3420750 3423226 When you want me to start, stamp your foot.<br />That'll be the body falling.
3423250 3425166 You can time me from there.
3425250 3427333 What are we gonna do, play charades now?
3427417 3429517 - Come on! What are we waiting for?<br />- Okay, I'm ready.
3429541 3431458 Well, I want to wait<br />till the second hand reaches 60.
3431541 3433541 Oh, come on.
3440167 3443166 Come on. Speed it up.<br />He could walk twice as fast as that.
3444625 3447083 You want me to walk faster than that,<br />I will.
3463958 3466416 Lock. Door. Stop.
3466500 3468500 - Right.<br />- What's the time?
3468583 3471832 Uh, exactly 41 seconds.
3471917 3474166 This is what I think happened.
3474250 3477143 The old man heard the fight between the boy<br />and his father a few hours earlier.
3477167 3480060 Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the<br />body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...
3480084 3481878 heard the woman scream<br />from across the street,
3481902 3483643 got to his front door<br />as fast as he could...
3483667 3486249 heard somebody racing down the stairs<br />and assumed it was the boy.
3486334 3488166 - I think that's possible.<br />- Assumed?
3488250 3490749 Oh.
3490833 3493725 Brother, I've seen all kinds<br />of dishonesty in my day,
3493749 3496791 but this little display<br />takes the cake.
3496875 3499132 You all come in here<br />with your hearts bleeding
3499156 3501582 all over the floor about<br />slum kids and injustice.
3501667 3503667 You listen to some fairy tales.
3503750 3506101 Suddenly you start getting through<br />to some of these old ladies.
3506125 3509083 Well, you're not getting through to me.<br />I've had enough.
3509167 3511208 What's the matter with you guys?
3511292 3513999 You all know he's guilty!<br />He's got to burn!
3514084 3515874 You're letting him slip<br />through our fingers.
3515958 3518166 "Slip through our fingers"?<br />Are you his executioner?
3518250 3520250 I'm one of 'em!
3521084 3522916 Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.
3523000 3525000 For this kid, you bet I would.
3525084 3528333 I feel sorry for you. What it must<br />feel like to want to pull the switch.
3529209 3531039 Ever since you walked<br />into this room, you've
3531063 3533124 been acting like a<br />self-appointed public avenger.
3533209 3537500 You want to see this boy die because you<br />personally want it, not because of the facts.
3537583 3539749 - You're a sadist.<br />- You...
3539833 3543666 Let me go!<br />I'll kill him. I'll kill him!
3543750 3546166 You don't really mean<br />you'll kill me, do you?
3553459 3555791 Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?<br />I heard some noise.
3555875 3559874 Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...<br />- You know, friendly little argument. It's...
3559958 3563249 Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.<br />You can take it if you want.
3564625 3566625 Here you are.<br />Thank you.
3571833 3573916 What are you lookin' at?
3594667 3596707 I suppose somebody<br />has to start it off again.
3596792 3600500 - I beg pardon.<br />- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?
3600583 3602666 For the same reason you're not.
3602750 3604750 It's the way I was brought up.
3606667 3608582 This fighting...
3608667 3610707 That's not why we are here, to fight.
3610792 3613166 We have a responsibility.
3614334 3618916 This, I have always thought,<br />is a remarkable thing about democracy...
3619000 3621000 that we are...
3622084 3624666 Uh, what is the word?
3624750 3627832 Notified.<br />That we are notified by mail...
3627917 3632249 to come down to this place<br />to decide on the guilt or innocence...
3632334 3636375 of a man we have never heard of before.
3636459 3640999 We have nothing to gain or lose<br />by... by our verdict.
3641917 3645041 This is one of the reasons<br />why we are strong.
3646334 3649166 We should not make it a personal thing.
3650500 3652500 Thank you.
3653376 3655666 If nobody else has an idea,<br />I may have a cutie here.
3655750 3658559 I mean, I haven't given it much thought,<br />but let's throw it out on the stoop...
3658583 3660208 and see if the cat licks it up.
3660292 3662624 - The cat licks it up?<br />- Yeah. If the boy...
3667125 3669249 Look how dark it's getting out there.
3669334 3671791 I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.
3673583 3676041 Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?
3677541 3680333 Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?
3681750 3683916 No, I don't.
3684000 3686000 Well, listen. I, uh...
3686084 3689249 I was wondering if, uh, maybe...
3689334 3691624 maybe we should take another vote.
3691708 3695999 Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up<br />with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?
3696084 3698084 - Hmm.<br />- Mr. Foreman?
3698667 3702208 Well, that's okay with me.<br />Anyone doesn't want to vote?
3702292 3705500 - Hey, come on. Come on.<br />- I'm sorry.
3705583 3709083 I think we ought to have an open ballot...<br />call out our votes, you know.
3709167 3711375 Let's see who stands where.
3711459 3713957 That sounds fair to me.<br />Anyone object?
3716708 3719416 Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.<br />One.
3720417 3723208 Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.
3723292 3725083 Two?
3725167 3727167 Not guilty.
3727209 3730041 - Number three?<br />- Guilty.
3731042 3733042 Number four?
3734084 3735874 Guilty.
3735958 3738707 - Number five?<br />- Not guilty.
3739792 3743083 - Number six?<br />- Not guilty.
3744084 3745749 Number seven?
3745833 3747540 Guilty.
3747625 3749666 Number eight?
3749750 3751750 Not guilty.
3752750 3755666 - Number nine?<br />- Not guilty.
3755750 3757916 - Number 10?<br />- Guilty.
3759708 3761749 Number 11?
3761833 3763666 Not guilty.
3763750 3765750 Number 12?
3766167 3768500 Number 12.
3768583 3770583 Guilty.
3776000 3778083 The vote is now six to six.
3778167 3781333 Yeah, right.<br />And we go into extra innings here, huh?
3783750 3788249 Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you<br />people in here must be out of your minds.
3788334 3790166 A kid like that.
3790250 3793500 I don't think the kind of boy he is<br />has anything to do with it.
3793583 3795666 The facts are supposed<br />to determine the case.
3795750 3797916 Don't give me that!<br />I'm sick and tired of facts!
3798000 3800060 You can twist them any way you like.<br />You know what I mean?
3800084 3802666 That's exactly the point<br />this gentleman has been making.
3802750 3803455 Oh!
3803479 3805666 I mean, you keep shouting<br />at the top of your lungs.
3807334 3809249 I'd like to be<br />a few years younger.
3809334 3811334 That man gets on my...
3814625 3817458 - My, it's hot in here, isn't it?<br />- Do you want a drink of water?
3817541 3821249 No. No, thanks. Thanks.
3829084 3830874 It's gonna rain.
3830958 3833208 Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
3834459 3836333 How come you changed your vote?
3836417 3838832 Well, it just seemed to me<br />there was room for doubt.
3838917 3841158 You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br />You know that, I hope.
3841209 3844208 I don't feel that way.<br />There were a lot of details that never came out.
3844292 3847832 - Yeah. Well, good luck.<br />- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.
3847917 3850124 You think too much.<br />You get mixed up.
3851376 3852565 You know what I mean?
3852589 3855333 Now, listen.<br />I don't think you have any right...
3855417 3857999 Loudmouth.
3910667 3913166 Look at that come down, will you?
3914334 3916208 You know...
3916292 3918791 this reminds me of a storm we had last...
3918875 3922333 Oh, when was that? November...
3922417 3925500 I don't know. Something.<br />It was quite a storm we had there.
3925583 3927957 It was right in the middle of a game.
3928042 3930666 Uh, we were behind 7-6...
3930750 3933333 but we just started to move the ball,<br />right off the tackle.
3933417 3936208 Started cutting right...<br />slash here and slash right in...
3936292 3938083 cut right through.
3938167 3940666 And, uh...
3940750 3942957 We had this kid Slattery, you know?
3944125 3947500 A real... He was an ox.<br />You know, a real ox.
3947583 3950083 I wish I had another one just like him.
3950167 3954666 I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head<br />coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.
3954750 3956832 - Oh, yeah?<br />- That's out in Queens.
3956917 3959666 And, uh, anyway...
3959750 3961832 we're starting to move along real nice.
3961917 3965083 Their whole line is just...<br />they're just coming apart.
3966376 3970124 And it starts to come down<br />cats and dogs, just like this.
3970209 3972832 Just whoosh... you know, right down.
3974125 3977500 Well, that was murder, you know?
3977583 3980166 I swear, I... I nearly bawled.
3980250 3982582 You just... You couldn't go nowhere.
3983833 3985833 Well.
4000792 4003291 Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br />How come...
4011042 4012791 Hey! Ηuh?
4012875 4016166 Must have been<br />on the same switch with the lights.
4017167 4020333 Well, things are looking up here, huh?
4021000 4023000 Yeah, huh?
4027334 4029334 Boy. That's better.
4036000 4037500 Hey!
4037583 4039583 Two points.
4043250 4045250 Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?
4047541 4050416 That's a damn stupid thing to do.
4050500 4052666 Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...
4053708 4055708 You know?
4056792 4058792 Pardon me.
4059376 4061707 Well, how do you like it?<br />Even Steven.
4061792 4064166 Pretty surprising, isn't it?
4064250 4066250 Yes.
4067541 4071041 Say, that business before,<br />when that tall guy... what's-his-name...
4071125 4073832 was trying to bait me...<br />That doesn't prove anything.
4073917 4076500 I'm a pretty excitable person.
4076583 4080416 I mean, where does he come off calling me<br />a public avenger, sadist and everything?
4080500 4083999 Anyone in his right mind<br />would blow his stack, huh?
4084084 4086375 He was just trying to bait me.
4086459 4088459 He did an excellent job.
4091250 4093458 I'll tell you what I think.<br />We're going nowhere here.
4093541 4096083 I'm ready to walk into court right now<br />and declare a hung jury.
4096167 4097999 There's no point in this thing<br />going on any more.
4098084 4099416 Yeah. I go for that too.
4099500 4100938 Listen,<br />let's take it in to the judge and let
4100962 4102393 the kid take his chances<br />with 12 other guys.
4102417 4105310 I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.<br />We haven't been in here very long.
4105334 4106999 Well, let's find out.
4107084 4108791 I'm not in favor of that.
4108875 4112083 Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance<br />with another jury, and you know it.
4112167 4115060 Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna<br />change his vote. Let's take it inside.
4115084 4117291 You still don't think there's room<br />for reasonable doubt?
4117376 4118666 No, I don't.
4118750 4120041 Pardon.
4120125 4123375 Maybe you don't fully understand<br />the term "reasonable doubt."
4123459 4125999 What do you mean I don't understand?
4127084 4129084 Boy, how do ya like this guy?
4129125 4130791 I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.
4130875 4133768 They come over here, running for their life,<br />and before they can take a deep breath...
4133792 4136166 they're telling us how<br />to run the show, huh?
4136250 4138041 Boy, the arrogance of this guy.
4138125 4142707 Hey, all right. Let's stop<br />the arguing for about two minutes in here.
4142792 4145166 Now, who's got something<br />constructive to say?
4145250 4148791 I'd like to go over something,<br />if you gentlemen don't mind.
4148875 4151540 An important point for the prosecution<br />was the fact...
4151625 4154375 that after the boy claimed<br />he'd been at the movies...
4154459 4156459 during the hours<br />that the killing took place...
4156541 4160416 couldn't remember the names of the movies<br />or the stars who appeared in them.
4160500 4163021 This gentleman here has put up that point<br />in here several times.
4163084 4164540 That's correct.
4164625 4166500 It was the only alibi the boy offered...
4166583 4169083 and he himself couldn't back it up<br />with any details at all.
4169167 4172416 Putting yourself in the boy's place,<br />do you think you could remember details...
4172500 4175957 after an upsetting experience such as<br />being slapped in the face by your father?
4176042 4179249 I think so, if there were<br />any special details to remember.
4179334 4180801 The boy couldn't<br />remember the names of the
4180825 4182559 movies he saw because<br />be wasn't there that night.
4182583 4184624 According to<br />the police testimony in court...
4184708 4187832 the boy was questioned by the detectives<br />in the kitchen of his apartment...
4187917 4190832 while the body of his father<br />was lying on the floor in the bedroom.
4190917 4193517 Do you think you could remember details<br />under those circumstances?
4193583 4195583 - I do.<br />- Under great emotional stress?
4195667 4198226 - Under great emotional stress.<br />- He remembered them correctly in court.
4198250 4200268 He named the pictures<br />and the stars who played in them.
4200292 4203458 Yes. His lawyer took great pains<br />to bring that out.
4203541 4206143 He had three months from the night<br />of the murder to the day of the trial...
4206167 4207791 in which to memorize them.
4207875 4210601 It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out<br />what played at a particular theater...
4210625 4212291 on a particular night.
4212376 4214124 I'll take the testimony<br />of the policemen who
4214148 4215999 interrogated the boy<br />right after the murder...
4216084 4218500 when he couldn't remember<br />a thing about the movies...
4218583 4220500 great emotional stress or not.
4220583 4223874 - I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br />- Go ahead.
4223958 4227208 - Where were you last night?<br />- I was home.
4227292 4229832 - How about the night before that?<br />- Come on! What is this?
4229917 4231249 No, it's all right.
4231334 4233874 I left the office at 8:30<br />and went straight home and to bed.
4233958 4235624 And the night before that?
4235708 4238124 That was, uh, Tuesday night?
4238209 4240250 The night of the bridge tournament.<br />I played bridge.
4240292 4241624 Monday night?
4241708 4244916 When you get down<br />to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?
4246917 4248917 Monday night?
4250125 4253124 Monday night, uh,<br />my wife and I went to the movies.
4253209 4254832 - What did you see?<br />- The Scarlet Circle.
4254917 4258166 - It was a clever whodunit.<br />- What was the second feature?
4258250 4260874 The, um...
4260958 4263624 I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...
4263708 4267874 Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...
4267958 4270416 The...
4270500 4273166 Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.
4273250 4275999 I saw that.<br />It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
4277292 4279666 Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.<br />I think that's right.
4279750 4282249 Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?
4282334 4285999 Barbara... Long, I think it was.
4286084 4288084 A dark, very pretty girl.
4289417 4291916 Ling or Long... something like that.
4292000 4295208 - Who else?<br />- I'd never heard of them before.
4295292 4299707 It was a very inexpensive second feature<br />with, uh, unknown...
4299792 4302916 And you weren't under<br />an emotional stress, were you?
4305833 4307957 No.
4308042 4310042 I wasn't.
4311583 4313333 I think the point is made.
4313417 4316166 Big point!
4316250 4318416 You can talk till your tongue<br />is draggin' on the floor.
4318500 4322582 The boy is guilty, period.<br />You know what I mean, my friend?
4322667 4325916 - Who's got those cough drops?<br />- They're all gone, my friend.
4327917 4330166 Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
4330250 4332624 There goes your ball game.
4332708 4335124 It's only a shower.
4335209 4337375 Besides, they got the infield covered.
4337459 4340624 Right. Say, could I see that knife<br />a second, please?
4343417 4345749 Well, we're still tied up six to six.
4345833 4347833 Who's got a suggestion?
4347917 4349917 It's five after 6:00.<br />Let's get some dinner.
4350000 4352458 Why don't we wait till 7:00,<br />give it another hour, huh?
4352541 4354666 Okay with me.
4354750 4356916 Uh, there's something I'd like to say.
4357000 4360540 I mean, it's been bothering me a little,<br />and as long as we're stuck.
4360625 4364500 Well, there was this whole business<br />about the stab wound and how it was made...
4364583 4366208 the downward angle of it, you know?
4366292 4368292 Don't tell me we're gonna<br />start with that again.
4368376 4369999 They've been over it and over it.
4370084 4372375 Well, I know they did,<br />but I don't go along with it.
4372459 4376458 Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.<br />His father was 6'2...
4376541 4378707 That's a difference of seven inches.
4378792 4381458 It's a very awkward thing to stab down<br />into the chest of someone...
4381541 4383541 who's more than half a foot<br />taller than you are.
4383625 4385749 Give me that.
4385833 4388624 I'll give you a demonstration.<br />Somebody get up.
4390000 4392000 You...
4396417 4399124 I want you to watch this 'cause<br />I don't want to have to do it again.
4399209 4401957 I'll make myself about six<br />or seven inches shorter, okay?
4402042 4405166 - It's about right. Maybe a little more.<br />- Okay. A little more.
4412958 4415375 That's not funny.
4417459 4421291 Now, nobody's hurt. Right?
4421958 4423958 Right. Nobody hurt.
4427209 4431999 Now, this is the way I'd stab a man<br />who was taller than I was.
4432084 4434540 Look at the angle... down and in.
4434625 4436707 And this is the way it was done.
4436792 4438957 Now tell me I'm wrong.
4441167 4444582 - Down and in. I guess there's no argument.<br />- Hold it a minute, will ya?
4444667 4446667 Can you give me that?
4447500 4449416 Boy, I hate these things.
4449500 4451166 - Did you ever see a knife fight?<br />- No.
4451250 4452832 - You?<br />- No.
4452917 4455707 Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
4455792 4458582 Well, I have.<br />You know, on my back stoop...
4458667 4460999 the lot across the street, backyard.
4461084 4463500 Switchblades came<br />with the neighborhood where I lived.
4463583 4466832 It's funny I never thought of it before.<br />I guess you try to forget those things.
4466917 4470291 - How do you use a switchblade?<br />- Well, you'd never use it like this.
4472042 4474333 See, you use too much time<br />switching hands.
4476084 4478582 Here's how... underhanded.
4481292 4484333 Anyone who's ever used a switch knife<br />wouldn't handle it any other way.
4484417 4487041 - Are you sure?<br />- I'm sure.
4487125 4488957 That's why they're made to open like that.
4489042 4490986 You'd say the boy was<br />pretty handy with a knife?
4491010 4491666 Mm-hmm.
4491750 4494916 You think he could have made<br />the kind of wound that killed his father?
4495000 4498916 No. Not with the experience he'd had<br />all his life handling these things.
4499000 4501000 I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.
4501084 4504124 How do you know? Were you<br />in the room when the father was killed?
4504209 4506209 No. Neither was anybody else.
4506292 4509500 So what are you giving us all this<br />mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.
4509583 4511196 I don't think you can<br />determine what type of
4511220 4512893 wound the boy might<br />or might not have made...
4512917 4515540 simply because he knew<br />how to handle a knife.
4515625 4517957 What do you think?
4518042 4520124 - I don't know.<br />- What do you mean you don't know?
4520209 4522209 I don't know.
4526250 4528250 How about you?
4528334 4530226 I don't know about the rest of them,<br />but I'm getting
4530250 4532143 a little tired of this<br />yackety-yackin' back and forth.
4532167 4535624 It's gettin' us nowhere.<br />So I guess I'll have to break it up.
4535708 4538249 I change my vote to not guilty.
4538334 4541666 - You what?<br />- You heard me. I've had enough.
4541750 4544208 What do you mean you've had enough?<br />That's no answer!
4544292 4548249 Hey, listen. You just take care<br />of yourself, huh? You know?
4548334 4552291 He's right. That's not an answer.
4552376 4555333 What kind of a man are you?
4555417 4558540 You have sat here and voted guilty<br />with everyone else...
4558625 4562874 because there are some baseball tickets<br />burning a hole in your pocket.
4562958 4567208 And now you've changed your vote because you<br />say you're sick of all the talking here?
4568209 4569666 Now listen, buddy!
4569750 4574416 Who tells you that you have the right<br />to play like this with a man's life?
4574500 4576999 - Don't you care...<br />- Now wait a minute!
4577084 4581083 - You can't talk like that to me!<br />- I can talk like that to you.
4581167 4583041 If you want to vote not guilty...
4583125 4585525 then do it because you are convinced<br />the man is not guilty...
4585583 4587375 not because you've had enough.
4587459 4590041 And if you think he is guilty,<br />then vote that way.
4590125 4593333 Or don't you have the guts<br />to do what you think is right?
4593417 4595666 - Now listen.<br />- Guilty or not guilty?
4596459 4600041 - I told you, not guilty.<br />- Why?
4601708 4603333 Look, I don't have to...
4603417 4606540 You do have to! Say it! Why?
4606625 4609083 All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.
4618583 4620208 I want another vote.
4620292 4622791 Okay. There's another vote called for.
4622875 4625749 I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.<br />Anyone object?
4625833 4628749 Okay. All those voting not guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4629667 4634832 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven...
4637667 4639667 eight.
4643250 4645375 Um, nine.
4646376 4651375 Um, all those voting guilty,<br />raise your hands.
4651459 4653832 One, two, three.
4653917 4656416 Well, the vote's nine to three<br />in favor of acquittal.
4657417 4659582 I don't understand you people!
4659667 4661893 I mean, all these picky little points<br />you keep bringing up.
4661917 4665249 They don't mean nothing!<br />You saw this kid just like I did.
4665334 4668832 You're not gonna tell me you believe<br />that phony story about losing the knife...
4668917 4670917 and that business<br />about being at the movies.
4671000 4673999 Look, you know how these people lie.<br />It's born in them.
4674084 4676124 I mean, what the heck.<br />I don't have to tell you.
4676209 4678209 They don't know what the truth is.
4678250 4681957 And let me tell you, they don't need<br />any real big reason to kill someone either.
4682042 4683791 No, sir.
4683875 4686916 They get drunk!<br />Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
4687000 4690166 You know that.<br />And bang... someone's lying in the gutter.
4690250 4693249 Well, nobody's blaming them for it.<br />That's the way they are, by nature.
4693334 4695416 You know what I mean? Violent!
4695500 4696999 Where are you going?
4697084 4700083 Ηuman life don't mean<br />as much to them as it does to us.
4701084 4704083 Look! They're lushing it up<br />and fighting all the time...
4704167 4706226 and if somebody gets killed,<br />so somebody gets killed!
4706250 4707624 They don't care!
4707708 4709916 Oh, sure, there's some good things<br />about 'em too.
4710000 4712000 Look, I'm the first one to say that.
4712042 4715333 I've known a couple who were okay, but<br />that's the exception, you know what I mean?
4715417 4719166 Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.<br />They can do anything.
4719250 4721832 What's going on here?
4721917 4723957 I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...
4724042 4726042 you're making a big mistake, you people.
4726125 4729124 This kid is a liar!<br />I know it. I know all about them.
4730833 4732999 Listen to me.<br />They're no good.
4733084 4735416 There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
4737459 4739916 I mean, what...<br />What's happening in here?
4740000 4742249 I'm speaking my piece, and you...
4743459 4745459 Listen to me.
4746209 4747666 I...
4747750 4750208 We're... This kid on trial here, his type...
4750292 4752292 Well, don't you know about them?
4754250 4757707 Th-There's... There's a danger here.
4757792 4759874 These people are dangerous.
4759958 4762999 They're... wild.
4763084 4764999 Listen to me.
4765084 4767416 - Listen.<br />- I have.
4767500 4770500 Now sit down<br />and don't open your mouth again.
4774417 4777166 I was only trying to... tell you.
4813625 4817916 It's always difficult to keep personal<br />prejudice out of a thing like this.
4819042 4823041 Wherever you run into it,<br />prejudice always obscures the truth.
4824625 4826999 I don't really know what the truth is.
4827084 4829999 I don't suppose anybody<br />will ever really know.
4831292 4835249 Nine of us now seem to feel<br />that the defendant is innocent.
4835334 4838333 But we're just gambling on probabilities.
4838417 4840417 We may be wrong.
4840459 4842832 We may be trying to let<br />a guilty man go free.
4842917 4844375 I don't know.
4844459 4846459 Nobody really can.
4846541 4848916 But we have a reasonable doubt...
4849000 4852500 and that's something<br />that's very valuable in our system.
4852583 4857124 No jury can declare a man guilty<br />unless it's sure.
4858583 4860957 We nine can't understand...
4861042 4863749 how you three are still so sure.
4864583 4866583 - Maybe you can tell us.<br />- I'll try.
4867958 4871458 You've made some excellent points, but I<br />still believe the boy is guilty of murder...
4871541 4873249 and I have two reasons.
4873334 4876458 One, the evidence<br />given by the woman across the street...
4876541 4879166 who actually saw the murder committed.
4879250 4881832 As far as I'm concerned,<br />that's the most important testimony.
4881917 4885166 And two, the fact that she<br />described the stabbing by saying...
4885250 4890874 she saw the boy raise his arm over his head<br />and stab down into the father's chest.
4890958 4892999 She saw him do it the wrong way.
4893084 4894999 That's absolutely right.
4895084 4897666 Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
4897750 4900832 She said she went to bed<br />about 11:00 that night.
4900917 4904500 Her bed was next to the window,<br />and she could look out while lying down...
4904583 4908666 and see directly into the boy's room<br />across the street.
4908750 4911375 She tossed and turned for over an hour,<br />unable to sleep.
4911459 4915624 Finally, she turned toward the window<br />at about 10 minutes after 12:00...
4915708 4920832 and, as she looked out, she saw the killing<br />through the windows of a passing El train.
4920917 4923624 She said the lights went out<br />immediately after the killing...
4923708 4928500 but that she got a good look at the boy<br />in the act of stabbing his father.
4929500 4933333 As far as I can see it,<br />this is unshakable testimony.
4934084 4936749 - Well, that's the whole case.<br />- What do you think?
4942125 4944125 How about you?
4945417 4947874 I... I don't know.
4947958 4949958 So much evidence to sift.
4950042 4952042 This is a pretty complicated business.
4952084 4955874 Frankly, I don't see<br />how you can vote for acquittal.
4955958 4958291 It's not so easy to arrange<br />all the evidence in order.
4958376 4960416 You can throw out<br />all the other evidence!
4960500 4964083 The woman saw him do it!<br />What else do you want?
4964167 4966041 - Yeah, well, maybe...<br />- Let's vote on it.
4966125 4968291 Okay. There's another vote called for.
4968376 4970208 Anybody object?
4970292 4973333 All right. I'm changing my vote.<br />He's guilty.
4973417 4975832 Anybody else?<br />The vote is eight to four.
4975917 4979500 Why is this such a personal triumph<br />for you... this one vote?
4979583 4983041 Okay. I say we're a hung jury.<br />I say we take it in to the judge.
4983125 4985832 Ηow about it?<br />I want to hear arguments.
4985917 4988416 You, you're the leader of the cause.<br />What about it?
4990667 4992500 Let's go over it again.
4992583 4994500 We've been over it again!
4994583 4997111 The boy in the gray<br />flannel suit here is bouncin
4997135 4999375 backwards and<br />forwards like a tennis ball.
4999459 5003291 No point in getting nasty<br />and trying to turn this into a contest.
5005250 5006707 Okay.
5006792 5009832 Maybe we can talk about<br />setting some kind of time limit.
5009917 5012041 Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?
5012750 5016500 It's a quarter after 6:00.
5016583 5018583 Someone before mentioned 7:00.
5018625 5020999 I think that's a point at which<br />we might begin to discuss...
5021084 5024333 the question of whether<br />we're a hung jury or not.
5024417 5026417 Don't you feel well?
5027417 5029417 I feel perfectly well, thank you.
5029459 5032166 I was saying that 7:00<br />would be a reasonable time.
5032250 5035166 Uh, the reason I asked about that<br />was because, uh...
5035250 5036832 you were rubbing your nose like...
5036917 5039582 Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...
5039667 5042874 but you made a gesture<br />that reminded me of something.
5042958 5044999 I'm trying to settle something here.<br />Do you mind?
5045084 5047084 Well, I think this is important.
5048167 5049957 Thank you.
5050042 5052666 Now then,<br />I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...
5052750 5055666 but I was wondering why<br />you were rubbing your nose like that.
5055750 5057416 Oh, come on, will ya?
5057500 5061666 At this point, I happen to be talking<br />to the gentleman sitting next to you!
5061750 5064999 Now, why were you rubbing<br />your nose like that?
5065084 5069166 Well, if it's any of your business, I was<br />rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
5069250 5070874 Oh. I'm sorry.
5070958 5074832 - Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?<br />- It is.
5074917 5076666 Now can we get on to something else?
5076750 5081333 Your eyeglasses made those two<br />deep impressions on the sides of your nose.
5081417 5083582 I hadn't noticed that before.
5083667 5087166 - That must be annoying.<br />- It is very annoying.
5087250 5089166 Well, I wouldn't know about that.
5089250 5092582 I've never worn eyeglasses.<br />Twenty-twenty.
5092667 5095208 Listen, will you come on already<br />with the optometrist bit?
5097125 5100666 The woman who testified<br />that she saw the killing...
5100750 5104291 had those same marks<br />on the sides of her nose.
5105292 5107500 Holy smokes! You know, he's right.
5107583 5109249 Please.
5109334 5113083 Just give me a minute,<br />and I'll be finished.
5113167 5115999 I don't know if anyone else<br />noticed that about her.
5116084 5119957 I didn't think of it then,<br />but I've been going over her face...
5121000 5123124 in my mind.
5123209 5125209 She had those same marks.
5126209 5130375 - She kept rubbing them in court.<br />- He's right. She did do that a lot.
5131417 5136083 This woman was about, uh...<br />about 45 years old.
5136167 5140124 She was making a tremendous effort<br />to look 35...
5140209 5142416 for her first public appearance.
5142500 5145749 Heavy makeup, dyed hair...
5145833 5149707 brand-new clothes that should have<br />been worn by a younger woman.
5149792 5151458 No glasses.
5151541 5153208 No, women do that.
5153292 5155707 See if you can get the<br />mental picture of it.
5155792 5157624 What do you mean, no glasses?
5157708 5160476 How do you know whether she wore glasses?<br />Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?
5160500 5162707 Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.
5162792 5164707 So what?<br />What do ya think that means?
5164792 5167059 Listen,<br />I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
5167083 5167999 Come on. Forget it.
5168084 5171083 Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.<br />I saw them too.
5171167 5174352 I was the closest one to her. She had these,<br />uh... these things on the side of her nose.
5174376 5177582 - What do you call those on the side?<br />- Well, what point are you making here?
5177667 5181540 She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br />Well, what does that mean?
5181625 5185916 Could those marks be made<br />by anything other than eyeglasses?
5189500 5191832 No, they couldn't.
5191917 5193917 I didn't see any marks!
5195541 5197249 I did.
5197334 5199874 Strange, but I didn't<br />think about it before.
5199958 5202143 Well, what about the lawyer?<br />Why didn't he say something?
5202167 5205083 There are 12 people in here<br />concentrating on this case.
5205167 5207249 Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
5207334 5210534 Well, what about the district attorney?<br />Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?
5210583 5212458 Have her testify without her glasses?
5212583 5214493 Did you ever see a woman<br />who had to wear glasses and
5214517 5216559 didn't want to because she<br />thinks they spoil her looks?
5216583 5220083 Okay. She had marks on her nose.
5220167 5223832 I'm giving you that.<br />From glasses, right?
5223917 5228083 She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house<br />so people would think she's gorgeous.
5228167 5232749 But when she saw this kid killing his<br />father, she was in the house alone.
5232833 5235041 That's all.
5235125 5239124 - Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?<br />- No, I don't.
5240833 5242749 No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
5242833 5245832 It's logical to assume that she wasn't<br />wearing them when she was in bed...
5245917 5247666 tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.
5247750 5250083 - How do you know?<br />- I don't know! I'm guessing.
5250167 5252684 I'm also guessing that she probably<br />didn't put her glasses on...
5252708 5254832 when she turned<br />to look casually out of the window.
5254917 5257726 And she herself testified the killing<br />took place just as she looked out.
5257750 5260851 The lights went off a split second later.<br />She couldn't have had time to put them on then.
5260875 5262500 - Wait a second.<br />- Here's another guess.
5262583 5266666 Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy<br />kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.
5266750 5270333 How do you know what she saw?<br />How does he know all that?
5270417 5273226 How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?<br />Maybe they were sunglasses.
5273250 5275874 Maybe she was farsighted.<br />What do you know about it?
5275958 5279208 I only know the woman's eyesight<br />is in question now.
5279292 5285416 She had to be able to identify a person<br />60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
5285500 5287874 You can't send someone off to die<br />on evidence like that.
5287958 5289958 Oh, don't give me that.
5290042 5292208 Don't you think the woman<br />might have made a mistake?
5292292 5294707 - No.<br />- It's not possible?
5294792 5296792 No, it's not possible.
5299376 5301376 Is it possible?
5302417 5304417 Not guilty.
5308250 5310916 Do you think he's guilty?
5311000 5313000 I think he's guilty.
5315750 5317750 Do you?
5320292 5323333 No. I'm convinced.
5323417 5324999 Not guilty.
5325084 5326874 What's the matter with you?
5326958 5328874 I have a reasonable doubt now.
5328958 5330500 Eleven to one.
5330583 5333500 Well, what about all the other evidence?<br />What about all that stuff?
5333583 5335666 The knife, the whole business!
5335750 5338666 Well, you said we could throw out<br />all the other evidence.
5344417 5346582 Well, what do we do now?
5349583 5351249 You're alone.
5351334 5355166 I don't care whether I'm alone or not!<br />It's my right.
5358334 5360500 It's your right.
5369625 5372041 Well, what do you want?<br />I say he's guilty.
5373667 5376999 - We want to hear your arguments.<br />- I gave you my arguments.
5378000 5380124 We're not convinced.
5380209 5382999 We want to hear them again.
5383084 5385084 We have as much time as it takes.
5390750 5395208 Everything... Every single thing<br />that took place in that courtroom...
5395292 5397208 but I mean everything...<br />says he's guilty.
5397292 5399749 What do you think,<br />I'm an idiot or something?
5401417 5403500 Why don't you take that stuff<br />about the old man?
5403583 5406749 The old man who lived there<br />and heard everything.
5408417 5410083 Or this business about the knife.
5410167 5412167 What? 'Cause he found another one<br />exactly like it?
5412250 5415582 The old man saw him<br />right there on the stairs!
5415667 5418500 What's the difference<br />how many seconds it was?
5419667 5421667 Every single thing.
5423084 5426249 The knife falling through<br />a hole in his pocket.
5426334 5429666 You can't prove he didn't get to the door.
5429750 5432166 Sure, you can take all the time,<br />hobble around the room.
5432250 5434832 But you can't prove it!
5436750 5440375 And what about this business<br />of the El and the movies?
5440459 5443500 There's a phony deal<br />if I ever heard one.
5443583 5447791 I'll bet ya $5,000<br />I'd remember the movies I saw.
5447875 5450124 I'm telling ya,<br />everything that's gone on...
5450209 5454041 has been twisted and turned!
5454125 5456208 This business with the glasses?
5456292 5461832 How do you know she didn't have them on?<br />This woman testified in open court!
5461917 5465874 And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?
5465958 5469208 I'm telling ya, I've got<br />all the facts here.
5470376 5472376 Here. Ah...
5474625 5477124 Well, that's it!<br />That's the whole case.
5484334 5486334 Well?
5488209 5490209 Say something!
5495334 5498916 You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.
5499583 5501500 You're not gonna intimidate me.
5501583 5504083 I'm entitled to my opinion.
5507459 5511749 Rotten kids.<br />You work your life out!
5516583 5518583 I can't keep...
5523209 5525209 No.
5528750 5530750 Not guilty.
5533958 5535958 Not guilty.
5538625 5540625 Not...
5550792 5552957 Um, we're ready now.
5666500 5668500 Hey!
5672500 5674166 What's your name?
5674250 5675749 Davis.
5675833 5677833 My name's McCardle.
5680084 5681749 Well, so long.
5681833 5683833 So long.
