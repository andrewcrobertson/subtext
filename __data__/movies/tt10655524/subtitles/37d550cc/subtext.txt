114116 115384 I'm so sorry.
115416 116651 Hey, you're<br />gonna be okay.
116684 119288 I'm so sorry you couldn't<br />be here, honey.
119321 120889 I don't know<br />what we're gonna do.
120923 123058 What are we gonna do?
128196 129597 Okay.
129630 131532 Oh, God,<br />we have to pick flowers.
131565 132868 -We do, yeah.<br />-I can't believe
132901 135337 we're picking flowers<br />for your father's funeral.
135370 136671 I know. I know.
136704 139408 I don't know why you moved.<br />I don't understand it.
139440 141642 I mean, if I had that job<br />that you had--
141676 143979 Oh, boy, I would've killed<br />for that job.
144012 146747 I appreciate your support<br />and enthusiasm, Mom.
146781 149684 I really do. I love you.<br />I'm gonna go set my stuff down.
149717 151652 -Okay.<br />-It's lilies.
151686 154022 -What?<br />-The flowers for a funeral.
154056 155857 -They're...<br />-Oh, lilies.
156691 159127 I'm so--<br />I'm so glad you're home.
159928 161063 Me, too.
209845 212180 He really loved you.
212214 213215 Who?
214249 215716 Your father.
218586 220188 I know. I, um--
220222 222090 Yeah, I know.
224226 226361 How's the eulogy coming, hon?
226395 227728 Mm, it is, um,
227762 230564 one of the most beautiful<br />things I've never written.
230598 233534 Just say five things<br />you loved about your father.
233567 235904 Mama, it's, uh--<br />it's not a grocery list.
235937 238974 Just fi-- five things.
239307 240708 Simple.
240741 243311 From the heart.<br />You're gonna be great.

437272 438440 Please?
442277 443411 Cherry on top?
446147 447282 I'm okay.
448850 450485 You gotta be...
469938 472040 I once read that<br />maraschino cherries
472073 474609 stay in your stomach<br />for like seven years.
474643 476811 Or cause cancer.<br />I forget which.
480148 482817 I didn't know that<br />about maraschino cherries.
483718 486121 Yeah, I may have<br />made that up, but...
486988 488556 they are pretty gross.
488590 490358 Yeah, they're<br />definitely gross.
490392 491926 So, what happened?
492694 494296 Sorry?
494329 497265 What was that over--<br />I didn't mean to, but...
499567 501202 Was it a woman?
501236 504539 Or man? I...
504572 506207 It was a chair, wasn't it?
508276 510045 Yes.
510078 512714 So, what floor you live on?
512747 514849 You first.
514883 518286 Top floor, right next to<br />my sister and her husband.
518320 519621 Wow.
519654 521623 What do you do for a living?
521656 522691 Neurosurgeon.
526394 527595 Is that funny?
528830 530999 -Jesus. You're serious.<br />-Yeah.
532267 533968 -Oh, really?<br />-Wow.
534002 535970 Oh, my God. Wait.<br />I'm so sorry.
536004 537505 No, I'm so sorry.<br />I'm so sorry.
537539 540675 You have spent way too--<br />I'm sorry.
540709 542444 You've spent<br />way too much time in school
542477 544814 to have me laughing like this.<br />I'm terrible.
544846 547682 I'm sorry. I-I thought<br />you were a crypto bro.
547716 549384 You thought I was<br />a cr-- a crypto bro?
549417 551219 N-No, no, no.<br />Yeah, no, well, I don't know,
551252 552954 or like<br />a really expensive prostitute.
552987 554889 -Well, I am expensive.<br />-Um--
554923 557759 You can forget about<br />kissing on the mouth.
559260 560462 Um...
561730 563998 Why haven't I seen you before?
565166 568370 Well, mostly because I've<br />never required brain surgery.
568403 570872 But also 'cause<br />I don't live here, so...
570905 572907 So, you just<br />broke into my building?
572941 575176 You have a really nice view.
575210 576644 I do.
582684 583952 What's your name?
584786 586388 Lily.
586721 587756 You?
587789 589457 -Ryle.<br />-Ryle what?
590225 591059 Kincaid.
591092 592627 You just made that up<br />just now.
592660 593829 Why would I make up<br />my last name?
593863 594996 I-- Well, I mean, fine.
595029 596598 What's your last name?
596631 598533 It's fine. We don't need to--<br />We don't need to do this.
598566 599401 I'm just asking your last name.
599434 600769 No, it was really nice<br />meeting you.
600803 602103 -You asked...<br />-Thank you. Just be careful.
602137 603338 Okay. It would be courteous<br />to give me back
603371 604840 -your last name.<br />-Oh.
604874 606207 I'm not gonna stalk you.
606241 608410 No, it's just really--<br />It's sort of embarrassing.
608443 609845 What is it?
609879 610912 Bloom.
610945 612914 -Your name is Lily Bloom?<br />-Yes.
612947 614449 It, um-- it actually<br />gets worse. Yeah.
614482 616819 -No way. Not possible.<br />-Yeah, no. It d--
616852 617952 -It does.<br />-Than Lily Bloom?
617986 619053 I don't really want<br />to talk about it,
619087 620555 'cause it's really kind of<br />embarrassing.
620588 622223 I'm obsessed with flowers. I--
622257 624092 Yeah. And I'm about<br />to open my first
624125 625193 -flower shop.<br />-Flower shop?
625226 627429 Yeah, it's a lifelong dream,<br />so...
631332 633635 It's not-- Stop.
633668 634969 I told you.
635003 636571 No, Lily Bloom the florist.
636604 640208 No, it doesn't<br />sound made-up at all.
640241 642210 Hey, you could always<br />use your middle name
642243 643511 if it doesn't work out.
645947 647615 -No, Violet.<br />-Trust me.
647649 648783 -Petunia.<br />-No, stop.
648818 650920 -Of the valley.<br />-Wor--
650985 652922 -Toadflax.<br />-Blossom.
652954 654522 Goddamn,<br />your parents hate you.
654556 656524 Well, I mean,<br />we may never know for sure,
656558 659294 'cause my dad died on Monday,<br />so, um...
659327 661329 Yeah, that's actually<br />why I came up here,
661362 663431 to, uh, have a good cry<br />and hopefully meet
663465 666034 a wealthy neurosurgeon.
666067 667735 So...
668938 670205 I'm sorry.
672740 674375 I could've made it back, um,
674409 677312 you know, to see him<br />before he died, but I...
681316 682350 I didn't.
684954 686154 Damn.
688590 689991 Yeah.
691259 694529 Well, you know, naked truths<br />aren't always pretty.
705139 707342 I watched a little boy<br />die tonight.
708343 710144 He was only six years old.
710178 712146 His brother found a gun<br />in his parents' bedroom,
712180 715016 and it went off by accident.
715818 717252 Tried everything.
721289 724158 No one should have to...
724192 726027 I can't imagine<br />what that's gonna do
726060 728062 to that little boy who lived.
729764 731934 Destroy him for life.
731967 733468 That's what it'll do.
738339 741175 All right,<br />give me another one.
741209 744279 Naked truth. I like that.
746581 747615 Go on.
747649 750051 Okay. I...
750084 752153 I don't know, uh...
755958 758894 The first guy<br />I had sex with was homeless.
758928 760695 -Stop it.<br />-Yeah, no, really.
760728 762096 In high school, yeah.
762130 763364 -Tell me more.<br />-I actually think
763398 764766 we're supposed to say<br />"temporarily un-homed,"
764799 767135 or-or, um, or "displaced."<br />I shouldn't have...
767168 768503 Now you're just<br />avoiding the question.
768536 769370 ...um, said--
769404 770505 I'm not.<br />There's nothing to tell.
770538 771840 Tell me--<br />I want the good stuff.
771874 773541 I-- Okay, I was friends<br />with this boy named Atlas.
773575 777412 And he was kind<br />and incredibly capable and,
777445 779949 you know,<br />he just got a shit hand.
779982 781649 You're making me jealous<br />of a homeless man.
781683 783418 Oh, my.
783451 785720 Okay, that's enough.<br />That's--
785753 787056 Your turn.
787088 788623 Oh, no,<br />I think I'm done.
788656 791060 Can't top that. That was<br />both sexy and disturbing.
791092 793394 Okay, just shock me.
793428 794930 Say-- I mean,<br />you can say anything.
794964 796698 I want to have<br />sex with you.
798867 800301 What? What?
800335 802805 -Well, you said to shock you.<br />-I mean...
802838 804238 What?
808276 810278 Uh, how many--<br />I'm sorry.
810311 812413 How many women<br />has this worked on?
812447 814182 I'm not<br />a relationship person.
814215 815683 -Yeah, I gathered that.<br />-Never been good at them.
815717 818286 Well, um, but how do you know<br />if you've never tried
818319 819587 having a relationship or carbs?<br />How do you--
819621 820722 How do you know<br />it doesn't work for you?
820755 822223 Carbs? I never said<br />I didn't eat carbs.
822256 823959 Come on, you don't look like<br />a reckless snacker.
823993 825793 Well, thank you.
825828 827362 Love isn't for me.
828396 829898 Lust is nice, though.
831967 833802 I feel like<br />you're missing out.
833836 834870 Am I?
836872 839108 You haven't answered<br />my question.
839140 841542 I forgot what<br />the question was.
841576 844212 How many women<br />has this worked on?
845848 846915 All of them.
849918 851219 Oh.
854689 856491 Well, I...
857659 859460 I can't-- I'm...
861429 862630 I'm gonna have to break<br />your record.
862664 865667 I'm the kind of girl<br />you take home to mama.
865700 867268 How far would you go?
871339 874342 I'm not sure.<br />I'm an unreliable narrator.

1220288 1221957 My mom kicked me out.
1222824 1223959 Why?
1226395 1228263 'Cause...
1228296 1231799 she likes dating guys<br />that beat the shit out of her.
1234635 1236570 What happened to your hand?
1236604 1239074 God, I can<br />smell him from here.
1241443 1243111 It got in the way.
1247516 1249650 Look, um, my parents<br />don't get home from work
1249683 1252454 till around 5:00, so if you...
1252487 1254189 want a shower or...
1254222 1257325 I don't know, wash clothes or--<br />I don't mind.
1257359 1258759 Yeah.
1258793 1259928 Sure.
1261430 1263398 Your enthusiasm's contagious.
1273241 1274476 Did you feel the earthquake
1274509 1275643 -this, uh, this weekend?<br />-Yeah!
1275676 1276845 You did?
1276878 1278814 -Yeah!<br />-Wow, a lot of...
1278847 1279848 Hey.
1280614 1282217 Thanks for the clothes.
1282716 1284453 Yeah, of course.
1284486 1285954 My dad won't even know<br />they're gone.
1285987 1288689 He doesn't usually<br />wear jeans much, so...
1292793 1296398 Um, my parents aren't gonna<br />be home for an hour or so,
1296431 1299434 if you want to watch TV<br />or something.
1299468 1301303 You know, it's--<br />it was a 7.2 earthquake,
1301336 1303071 and it was located in Mexicali,
1303105 1304539 which is just south<br />of the U.S. border.
1304573 1306241 Uh, and when something<br />like that happens,
1306274 1307943 everyone thinks the same thing,<br />"Oh, my God.
1307976 1310011 My Precious Moments."
1314883 1317352 So, uh, what do you<br />want to do after you graduate?
1318053 1319187 I'm, um...
1319221 1321755 signed up to go<br />to basic training in May.
1321789 1323225 Basic training? What is...
1324459 1325961 In the Marines.
1325994 1326995 Oh.
1327829 1329030 Wow.
1339474 1341309 I'm sorry.
1341343 1342643 I'm... I'm sorry.
1342676 1344446 It's just the-- the clothes,<br />my dad's clothes,
1344479 1348250 they make you kind of look like<br />Ned Flanders a little.
1350152 1352020 Your clothes kind of make you<br />look like a carrot.
1352053 1354256 -Oh, my God.<br />-Yeah.
1362998 1364166 Mom?
1364199 1365534 If it doesn't work out...
1365567 1367435 Mom, you do know<br />a challenge only excites me.
1367469 1368769 I-I-I said "if."
1368803 1370071 "A flower sales statistic
1370105 1371306 -that shocks many new floral..."<br />-Mom.
1371339 1373208 Mom, what makes you think<br />it's not gonna work out?
1373241 1375911 -"...a whopping 45% of all..."<br />-Mom.
1375944 1378180 Mom, are you reading this<br />from Google?
1378213 1379747 Of course I am.<br />How would I know that?
1379780 1381917 I'm worried about you.<br />Google is worried about you.
1381950 1383585 Well, you're both too late.<br />I'm picking up the keys now.
1383618 1384752 Okay. Okay.
1384785 1386154 -Okay, I love you.<br />-Wait. Sir! Sir!
1386188 1387788 You can do this.<br />Make it bold and brave.
1387822 1389191 Okay, Mom.<br />You sound crazy.
1389224 1391426 I'll talk to you later, bye.<br />Hi. I'm so sorry.
1391459 1392661 I'm so sorry.
1392693 1394529 -I, uh... I just moved here.<br />-Okay, sweetheart.
1394563 1395864 Good luck.
1398600 1399834 Thank you.
1461730 1463698 Hi.
1467335 1468536 Hello?
1468570 1470672 -Hi. Sorry.<br />-Oh! I'm so sorry.
1470705 1472107 No. Sorry. I can't...
1472140 1473774 -I can't...<br />-Oh, wait.
1473808 1475010 I can't hear you. Hi.
1475043 1477112 -I'm so sorry.<br />-Hi. Can I help you?
1477145 1479514 -Can I help you?<br />-Excuse me?
1479547 1481316 The "help wanted" sign<br />out front?
1481349 1482684 You have<br />a "help wanted" sign out front.
1482717 1483918 Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
1483952 1485120 Yeah, I didn't,<br />I didn't put that out there.
1485153 1486321 -I just-- Yeah.<br />-I figured.
1486354 1487656 -I just got this place.<br />-It's pretty old.
1487689 1489090 And I walk by this place<br />every day,
1489124 1490725 and I'm just obsessed with it.
1490759 1491960 I've always wanted<br />to see inside,
1491993 1493161 and I was wondering, like,
1493194 1494863 "Who's gonna come along?"<br />And...
1494896 1497032 -It's you, yeah?<br />-No, it's me. Yeah, hi.
1497065 1498733 -Are you the owner?<br />-Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm Lily.
1498767 1499868 -Allysa.<br />-Nice to meet you.
1499901 1501002 Sorry, ooh, disgusting.
1501036 1502304 Hi. Nice to meet you.
1502337 1503471 Yeah.
1504072 1504939 Well...
1504973 1507409 yeah, are you looking<br />for any help?
1507442 1509311 Well, I'm not hiring just yet.
1509344 1511179 I just, um, I just got the keys<br />a few days ago,
1511212 1512380 -and I'm still sort of...<br />-Yeah.
1512414 1514349 ...you know, figuring out<br />what I'm doing.
1514382 1516484 -So...<br />-Um, may I just ask:
1516518 1518386 What is this place<br />going to be?
1518420 1519487 A flower shop.
1522457 1524759 I'm so sorry, um...
1524793 1527529 I have an issue with--<br />My face says it all.
1527562 1529264 I just hate flowers.
1529297 1530365 You hate flowers?
1530398 1532200 -I do.<br />-Oh. Okay.
1532233 1534069 Like, why don't you just<br />give me something that's living
1534102 1536204 rather than something<br />that's on its way to dying?
1536237 1537305 And then it's gonna create<br />more work for me
1537339 1538808 and I'm gonna have<br />to deal with that.
1538840 1541609 But again,<br />it's a solo perspective.
1541643 1543645 It's-- I find<br />flower shops depressing.
1543678 1545580 It's just me.<br />I do wish you luck.
1545613 1546848 -I'm so sorry.<br />-I agree.
1546881 1548249 I find them depressing.
1548283 1550418 Uh, because I feel like...<br />uh...
1550452 1553288 I don't know, it's like the<br />beauty of what a flower is--
1553321 1554422 This is ridiculous.
1554456 1557192 The beauty of what a flower is<br />has been lost. Right?
1557225 1558560 It's-it's, um...
1558593 1560628 It's like we order them like<br />takeout now. It's-it's...
1560662 1561863 -Yes.<br />-Right?
1561896 1563131 You know? So it's what<br />you're talking about.
1563164 1565734 It's highlighting the pain<br />and the, the tension
1565767 1567135 and the...
1567168 1568903 You know.<br />The fact that it's fleeting,
1568937 1571239 and it's storytelling and...<br />I don't know.
1571272 1573108 That's actually what I find<br />beautiful about it and--
1573141 1574943 I don't know, that's what<br />I'm trying to do here, so...
1574976 1577278 Uh, that's<br />absolutely beautiful. I'm...
1577312 1578947 If that's what you're doing...
1578980 1581015 Yeah. Sign me up. Wonderful.
1581049 1582917 Oh, thanks. Thanks.
1582951 1584386 Well, um...
1584419 1586588 Yeah, I really do<br />wish you the best, and...
1586621 1588590 -Thank you.<br />-Um...
1588623 1590058 I'll just be lurking
1590091 1591292 -around in the neighborhood.<br />-Yeah.
1591326 1592761 Well, hopefully<br />I made my first customer.
1592794 1593995 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah. Yeah, great.
1594028 1595530 -Oh. It's so gorgeous.<br />-Hope to see you, um...
1595563 1597365 -Yeah. Bye.<br />-Okay.
1598868 1600402 Hey, I...
1601536 1603538 I don't know, this...
1603571 1605006 I do need help.
1605039 1607142 -Do you want a job?<br />-This is exactly
1607175 1609377 what I wanted to happen to me<br />when I walked in here.
1609411 1610445 Yes.
1610478 1611312 Oh, God. Okay.
1611346 1612647 Wonderful.
1612680 1614082 -Okay.<br />-Great. Um, I have to be out
1614115 1615818 by 5:00 p.m. tonight.<br />I do have a dinner.
1615851 1617318 -Tonight?<br />-Yeah.
1618686 1620054 I just started working here.
1620088 1622223 -Okay, perfect.<br />Okay. -Great! Um...
1622257 1623491 I'm gonna just need to wipe off
1623525 1624926 -a surface for this girl.<br />-Here. Here, here.
1624959 1626027 There you go. Right?
1626060 1627929 -That's, um...<br />-Thank you so much.
1627962 1630231 It's a real "Ghostbusters"<br />situation in here, huh?
1632902 1634936 -Hey.<br />-Aw.
1634969 1636638 Frame it.
1636671 1637807 Oh!
1637840 1638874 Did you see that?
1638908 1641242 Oh, my God,<br />it's still attached.
1641276 1643144 -Got it.<br />-God, I can't watch.
1643178 1644646 Oh.
1648049 1650151 Yeah. Yeah!

1693027 1694395 -You should be the boss.<br />-Babe.
1694429 1695663 Let's just buy the<br />place and make you the boss.
1695697 1696899 Honey, you're on speaker.
1696932 1698166 -Oh. Hi.<br />-Yeah. Um...
1698199 1699467 -Hi.<br />-Just-- just, uh...

1700435 1701603 that they're gonna be<br />wearing onesies...
1701636 1702905 -Oh, I can see you.<br />-...because the bar gives

1703939 1705139 -to the Bruins game.<br />-Okay.
1705173 1706407 -I'm across the street. Hey.<br />-But they don't
1706441 1707342 always wear that.
1707375 1709143 -Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />-Yeah. Oh, my God, babe,
1709177 1710345 you are stunning.
1710378 1711513 Can you bring<br />my brother in, too?
1711546 1713047 Great.<br />I can't take responsibility
1713081 1715250 for either of the people<br />who are about to come in here,
1715283 1716651 just so you know.
1717752 1719087 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
1720388 1722056 -Mwah. You look great.<br />-This is Lily.
1722090 1723191 -Hi. Lily. Hi.<br />-Oh, hey.

1741709 1743077 You guys know each other?
1743111 1744312 -No.<br />-A little bit.
1744345 1746916 -No, we...<br />-We met a few months ago.
1746949 1748783 We shared each other's<br />naked truths.
1748817 1750118 -Ew. Oh, that's...<br />-Oh.
1750151 1751686 -Uh, no, that's... That was...<br />-Okay. Got it.
1751719 1753388 -That was a bad choice of words.<br />-We're adults.
1753421 1756124 -That's what that was.<br />-You said "naked truths" first.
1756157 1757725 No. I mean, it was just,
1757759 1758726 -we just talked.<br />-You're lying.
1758760 1760094 Oh, that's what we're<br />calling it these days,
1760128 1761496 "we talked"?<br />'Cause we talk. All the time.
1761529 1762865 -Great. Wonderful.<br />-We talk, like, we talk,
1762898 1764232 like, three to five times<br />a week.
1764265 1766501 Can I show you<br />the work that I've done here?
1766534 1767735 -Oh, sh-- we should talk?<br />-No, no, no, you guys--
1767769 1769404 -We could hang this.<br />-We could talk tonight.
1769437 1771172 -No, let me take you over here.<br />-You guys don't need-- Okay.
1771205 1772808 If you could try<br />to take me seriously. Okay.

1779647 1780715 It's good to see you.
1782051 1783551 So, this is the flower shop
1783585 1785486 that my sister works at<br />'cause she's bored, huh?

1800903 1802136 Is that so?
1806107 1808844 Ah, you're even more terrifying<br />in the daytime.

1869437 1871572 -Hey.<br />-It's true.
1871606 1873142 So we'll just be friends, then?
1873174 1874442 -Yeah.<br />-I like it.
1874475 1877512 Hey.
1877545 1878881 Yeah, friends.
1882417 1884285 -To friendship.<br />-Yeah.
1887022 1888057 It's the weekend somewhere.
1888090 1889158 Let's go, let's go.
1889190 1890425 Oh, no, it--<br />Please don't leave, sir.
1890458 1891592 -Our Uber's about to leave.<br />-I love you.
1891626 1892995 -I'm gonna head home.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
1893028 1894195 It's brunch in Singapore.<br />Come on.
1894228 1895563 -I have to sleep.<br />-Let me walk you home.
1895596 1897398 No, it's fine. I--<br />I live right around the corner.
1897432 1898466 -I'm fine.<br />-It's on the way.
1898499 1899767 You live where we live.
1899801 1901703 -Semantics.<br />-Okay, fine, but only
1901736 1903404 'cause you'd feel really bad<br />if I got murdered.
1903438 1905473 Okay, don't fish<br />where I swim, Ryle.
1905506 1907241 I love you.<br />See you tomorrow, Lil.
1908743 1910344 I appreciate you walking me,<br />but you really...
1910378 1913082 I can't stop<br />thinking about you.
1913115 1914983 I'm right here.
1916751 1919220 Well, that's the problem.
1920722 1923058 I thought we agreed<br />to be friends.
1923092 1924492 We did.
1925393 1928362 But that was, like, hours ago.
1929865 1931232 Can I just kiss you?
1931265 1933202 -Oh, my God.<br />-Just once.
1933234 1934402 -You are pushy.<br />-Just once.
1934435 1935770 That's all I need<br />to get you out of my system.
1935804 1938107 -Oh, that's it. That'll do it?<br />-One kiss.
1938140 1939942 Okay, well,<br />good luck with that.
1939975 1941409 Is that a yes?
1942777 1943778 Just once?
1944813 1945981 Just once.

1988123 1989657 Bye, friend.
2002570 2003738 Is this enough over here?
2003771 2005207 Yeah. Maybe add, like,
2005240 2006607 -a little right there.<br />-Okay.
2006641 2007910 You're just<br />protecting the roots, you know,
2007943 2010645 from the snow or in case<br />it freezes over or anything.
2010678 2013248 I mean, the roots are the most<br />important part of the plant.
2013282 2014983 -Really?<br />-Yeah.
2015017 2016151 I didn't know that<br />about roots.
2016185 2017552 That's cool.
2017585 2019154 -Here, you want some?<br />-Oh.
2021589 2023524 Thank you.<br />Yeah, I'll take that.

2025928 2028563 When I take really good care<br />of these plants,
2028596 2031399 they reward me<br />with flowers and vegetables.
2031432 2034937 And when I don't,<br />they just shrivel up and die.
2035971 2037572 Kind of like us.

3782317 3783785 -I can't.<br />-Oh, well, good,
3783819 3785720 'cause I was starting to get<br />a little intimidated.
3785753 3787422 It was, you know,<br />a little too good to be true.
3787455 3789024 -That's for you. Yeah.<br />-Oh, that's mine. Thank you.
3789058 3790491 Mmm.
3790525 3792293 I like a little<br />hair of the dog.
3792327 3794228 Don't be shy.

3815550 3817452 You know, one of those<br />silly things you do.
3817485 3820688 No, it's not nothing.<br />Every tattoo means something.
3820722 3822091 Oh-- I know. No, no.
3822123 3823625 This is just like<br />one of those silly things
3823658 3826761 you do in high school, and I<br />don't know why I still have it.
3829597 3831900 No.

4127329 4128897 to allocate capital<br />in local Boston businesses,
4128931 4131666 and a place like this<br />would just be amazing.
4131699 4134502 Not to be too forward,<br />but what are margins right now?
4134535 4136204 I mean, the place is jumping.
4136238 4137705 13, 14, 15%?
4137738 4139740 I love the story<br />about your mom.
4139774 4142777 You could do a Series A<br />and scale this thing up...
4144445 4146447 -Honey.<br />-Did I offend him?
4147448 4150551 No, just keep saying<br />"allocating capital."
4150584 4151920 I have been holding it<br />for so long.

4453088 4456124 -Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.<br />-Hi.
4456157 4457993 -Thank you.<br />-You're welcome.
4458026 4459928 -Nice to see you.<br />-Yeah.
4462597 4463797 Hi.
4464699 4466001 Hi.
4466568 4468870 This is incredible.
4469271 4470138 Yeah, thanks.
4470171 4473041 Kind of exactly, uh,<br />how I imagined it.
4475277 4476878 Yeah, yours, too.
4477279 4478413 Thanks.
4479814 4481416 Look at us.
4484252 4486121 So, look, I, um...
4488123 4491693 I came by the next day<br />after the fight...
4491726 4494529 ...but he was here, and I-I<br />just didn't think that was a...
4494562 4495830 a good idea.
4497198 4499534 I just-- I just wanted to say<br />I'm really sorry.
4499567 4501236 -I was...<br />-Yeah.
4501269 4504039 ...out of my mind and-and<br />acted like a jackass, and...
4504072 4505907 I just feel really bad<br />and I'm s-- I'm sorry.
4505940 4508777 Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good.<br />It's, um...
4508810 4511046 Yeah, it's-- It was<br />a misunderstanding. So...
4511079 4512414 Well, I don't--<br />I don't know.
4512447 4513815 I mean, no, it wasn't.
4513848 4515383 I don't think it was, but...
4520422 4523024 Why are you here now? I gave<br />you my address months ago.
4523058 4524359 What are you--<br />what are you doing?
4524392 4525560 I came the next day.
4532767 4535937 And I drive this street a lot.
4543778 4545847 Yeah.
4550452 4551920 I'm sorry.
4556658 4558026 Are you happy?
4560729 4561930 Yeah.
4563798 4565200 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
4565800 4567335 I couldn't be happier.
4569604 4570605 Are you?
4574175 4575176 No.
4580315 4581349 Sorry.
4594629 4595764 That your phone?
4595797 4597098 Yeah.
4599835 4602036 What are you doing?
4605974 4607942 That's my number.
4607976 4609310 In case you need it.
4612714 4615150 Okay, well, I won't, so...
4615550 4616751 But thank you.
4616785 4618153 I hope you don't.
4627830 4630031 Hey, that, um... that thing
4630064 4632500 that he said about that--<br />you know, with us.
4632534 4633568 It wasn't...
4634369 4635937 It wasn't wasted.
4636872 4638106 I know.
4640308 4641409 I was there.
4657192 4658326 Hi.
4663565 4665166 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
4668069 4670038 Oh.
4670071 4671807 Mmm. That smells good.
4671841 4674008 Mmm. Thank you.
4677947 4679447 Are you happy?
4682584 4684118 Um...
4684986 4686387 are you okay?
4687155 4689023 Yeah. I'm just...
4689057 4690525 I'm just curious.
4695396 4696431 I wasn't.
4698834 4700401 But you... you make me happy.
4701904 4704038 Are you happy?
4704072 4705773 I mean,<br />I don't think anyone's happy
4705808 4708176 all the time, but, um...
4708209 4709979 I don't know if I like<br />the sound of that.
4710011 4711947 No, no. It's just, you know...
4711981 4713816 Of course, I deal with, um,
4713849 4717820 you know, my stuff and,<br />you know...
4717853 4719087 life and
4719120 4720388 -ticking clock and, you know...<br />-Right.
4720421 4723157 ...all those decisions<br />that-that women have to...
4723191 4724827 have to worry<br />about, but, um,
4724860 4726829 I think I'm<br />an innately happy person.
4726862 4729197 It's, um, probably just
4729230 4731199 a coping mechanism<br />I learned from my mom.
4731232 4733234 -So...<br />-Your mom?
4736738 4738273 My dad used to hit her.
4747248 4749684 Shit, I'm so sorry.
4751352 4752754 You never told me that.
4754455 4756424 It's not something<br />people talk about.
4757826 4759294 Did he ever hurt you?
4760395 4763097 No. He nearly<br />killed Atlas, though.
4768803 4771339 Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
4771639 4772774 Oh.
4775109 4776711 Oh, God. I...
4778981 4780548 I'm so embarrassed. I...
4781749 4783618 That mess at the restaurant.
4785687 4787622 I didn't know. That must<br />have been so hard on you.
4787655 4789657 Yeah.
4789691 4792061 Baby, all I want to do<br />in my life is protect you.
4792093 4793728 You know that, right?
4793761 4796297 When you hurt yourself<br />by accident, when you...
4797231 4799068 stub your toe, I blame myself.
4799100 4801870 It's like it's my fault<br />that the wall was there.
4801904 4803504 Oh, stop.
4803538 4806240 I am the luckiest goddamn man<br />on this planet.
4808610 4809644 And I could clean up.
4809677 4810578 Trust me.
4810612 4812313 Okay, I'm not trying<br />to hear about that.
4812347 4813481 You don't want to<br />hear about that?
4813514 4815017 -No.<br />-Just a little bit?
4815050 4816085 No.
4816117 4817385 You know,<br />I'm a ripped neurosurgeon,
4817418 4818486 for Christ's sake.
4818519 4819855 When was the last time<br />you saw someone
4819888 4822290 who looked like me<br />that wasn't on a daytime soap?
4822323 4824792 I mean, come to think of it,<br />yeah, no, I haven't.
4824827 4826996 -Yeah.<br />-And I'm rich.
4827029 4828696 Oh, and humble.
4830933 4832467 We can work on that.
4833534 4835436 God, I love you.
4835470 4838539 I know. I love you, too.<br />That's the problem.
4840042 4841142 It's a big problem.
4841175 4842343 Mm-hmm.
4842377 4843979 It's a really big problem.
4844013 4845480 Mmm.
4846949 4848616 Mmm.
4863798 4866501 Stop.
4874342 4877278 Look at her.<br />She's like a little alien.
4877311 4879580 Yeah, she's perfect.
4884385 4886287 Do you want to hold her?
4887388 4889825 -Yeah. Yeah.<br />-I knew it.
4889858 4891093 Here you go.
4891126 4893227 Look at you. Okay.
4893261 4894429 -There.<br />-Hi.
4894462 4896531 There we go. Right there.
4896564 4899168 -Oh, you're so beautiful. Hi.<br />-Oh, wow.
4899200 4900368 Oh.
4900401 4902470 -You're a mama.<br />-Yeah.
4902503 4904907 Oh, my sister's a mama.
4904940 4906842 And you're an uncle. Hmm.
4912081 4913548 Wow.
4913581 4914716 You did it.
4916051 4917086 This is just hormones.
4917119 4919088 Don't look at me.
4919121 4920321 Do you guys want kids?
4920354 4921622 -Oh, well...<br />-No pressure.
4921656 4923725 We're not... not putting you<br />on the spot right now.
4923758 4926862 I mean, it would be great for<br />childcare and stuff like that.
4927863 4929731 I'm not gonna make her<br />put on a white dress
4929764 4931599 and have my babies.
4933035 4934669 Unless she wants to.
4936237 4938006 Then I-I would marry her<br />tonight.
4943644 4945180 -Oh, shit. He's serious.<br />-Oh, my gosh.
4945214 4947782 Ryle, you are...<br />you are drunk on baby smell.
4947816 4949650 No, no, no.<br />I am serious as an aneurysm.
4949684 4951486 Oh, God. Please don't do<br />neurosurgeon humor
4951519 4953521 when you're propos... if...<br />I mean, if you are.
4953554 4955590 -Is that... Is this...<br />-He's going around.
4955623 4956758 -Oh, my God.<br />-I mean, if that's...
4956791 4958326 -No, are you actually...<br />-Give me the baby.
4958359 4959660 He's actually... Please stop.<br />Please stop. Please stop.
4959694 4961429 -Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.<br />-No, no. No, no, stop.
4961462 4962931 -Oh, he's doing it.<br />-Oh, my God.
4962965 4964532 Oh, my God.<br />Oh, my God. Okay.
4964565 4965934 Okay, what...
4967335 4969171 -Can we just-just...<br />-Can you get the baby?
4969204 4971240 -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can<br />take that. -We have a baby.
4971272 4973842 You gorgeous girl.<br />Here you go, baby.
4973876 4974810 You get back down there.
4974843 4976845 You get back down there<br />right this second.
4983484 4985386 Will you marry me,<br />Lily Blossom Bloom?
4988656 4990491 -Yeah?<br />-Okay.
4990525 4991759 This is just...
4991793 4993694 -Oh, he did it.<br />-I'm just...
4993728 4996165 This is a miracle.
4996198 4998000 Oh, thank God.
4998033 4999567 Oh, my God.
5001536 5003771 Oh, my...
5008576 5009845 But we'll do<br />a proper wedding one day...
5009878 5011379 You got married without me.
5011412 5013081 And I continue to be<br />very sorry,
5013115 5015683 but at some point, you're gonna<br />have to forgive me.
5015716 5018086 -I-I will wear you down.<br />-My wife will wear you down.
5018120 5019420 Not possible.
5019453 5021123 I don't think you should<br />ever forgive her. Just saying.
5021156 5022257 Oh, okay.<br />That's enough of that.
5022291 5023524 Hold on,<br />can you charge my phone?
5023558 5024692 I haven't been dreaming
5024725 5026694 about your wedding day<br />your whole life.
5026727 5028230 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life.
5028263 5029730 And I'm sorry,<br />I just feel cheated.
5029764 5031532 I... Yeah, okay.<br />Got it. Thanks, Mom.
5031566 5033501 Okay, we're gonna<br />find a way to move on.
5033534 5035636 If I don't get to<br />watch you walk down the aisle,
5035670 5038106 I will not be denied<br />watching you squirm.
5038140 5039473 You want to make it up to me?
5039507 5041709 -Yes, please.<br />-Make me a grandbaby.
5041742 5043611 No, three. Three.<br />Make it triplets.
5043644 5045613 All right, can you just...<br />can we move past
5045646 5048382 this conversation, please?
5049617 5050919 You okay?
5051920 5052921 What happened?
5052955 5054689 Mom, I'll-I'll call you<br />right back, okay?
5054722 5056325 -Okay. Okay.<br />-Yeah, no, hang up.
5059194 5060595 Hey, what happened?
5065499 5066935 Hey, you okay?
5073441 5077279 I dropped your phone...
5077312 5078914 and the case fell off.
5090192 5091592 And I found this.
5097933 5099500 I called the number.
5110279 5113115 -It wasn't...<br />-You promised me.
5113148 5115117 -I know.<br />-I would never lie to you.
5115150 5116484 I know. It's-it's nothing.
5116517 5119021 -It's nothing?<br />-Yeah.
5119054 5120521 -Yeah.<br />-It's nothing?
5120554 5122556 Yes. Yes, I promise.

5127428 5128629 Okay?
5137172 5138506 It's nothing.
5139174 5140409 Okay.
5140441 5141676 Yeah.

5151086 5152687 Wait, baby, I promise
5152720 5154323 I didn't mean to see him.
5154356 5155958 -No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br />-No, no, no, no.
5155991 5157692 -Lily, stop!<br />-I promise. Please. No, it's...
5157725 5159061 Please just listen to me.<br />Please.
5159094 5161029 -You promised me, Lily.<br />-I didn't know he was coming.
5161063 5161930 -Stop.<br />-Just talk to me.
5161964 5163231 -Stop. Stop.<br />-Baby, please just stop...
5163265 5164366 -You stop.<br />-Stop!
5164399 5166567 Please don't...
5170272 5172341 Shh. Hey.

5188190 5189925 You fell down the stairs.
5191659 5193128 No, no, no, d-d-don't-don't...
5193161 5194997 don't touch it.
5195030 5197332 Yeah, you tripped, and...
5197366 5199633 and I, um...<br />I-I tried to catch you.
5199667 5202204 -No, Ryle, no.<br />-Y-You're okay. You're okay.
5204139 5205941 -It hurts.<br />-Don't-don't-don't-don't...
5205974 5207675 I know it hurts. It hurts.<br />You're okay.
5207708 5209845 -Okay.<br />-You're okay.

5798399 5799500 Okay?
5800401 5802503 -Yeah.<br />-You're not.
5814148 5815884 Is that what I think it is?
5819420 5820488 Yeah.
5825393 5826761 I want to tell you something.
5826794 5828296 I don't know if<br />it's the right time, but I...
5828329 5829865 Sorry for the delay.
5830833 5832500 Been really busy tonight.
5833902 5835236 So, we have<br />a certain examination
5835269 5836804 for these situations.
5836839 5838473 It's called the SANE exam.
5838506 5839741 It's completely optional,<br />of course.
5839774 5841209 Oh, I, um, uh...
5841910 5843478 I w-- He didn't...
5844947 5846815 -No, I wasn't-- It's...<br />-Did he try?
5848349 5850752 I don't need the exam.<br />Thank you. Yeah.
5852553 5853922 May I?
5853956 5855657 Oh, yeah. Of course.
5860129 5862131 -Does this hurt?<br />-Mm-mm.
5862163 5864133 -This?<br />-Mm-mm.
5864165 5865834 No, it's just the skin. Yeah.
5866300 5868436 So, usually...
5868469 5870005 I'd give you an X-ray<br />on this collarbone
5870039 5871073 to make sure that
5871106 5872306 -it isn't fractured.<br />-Mm-hmm.
5872340 5875443 But given your situation,<br />we're gonna clean it up,
5875476 5879014 and the nurse is gonna come in<br />and give you a tetanus shot.
5879048 5881249 Uh, I-- I don't understand.
5881282 5883085 We don't give X-rays<br />to pregnant women
5883118 5884853 unless it's vital.
5884887 5885954 Okay?
5889158 5891093 -Yeah.<br />-All right. I'll be right back.
5891126 5892627 -Okay.<br />-Okay.
5913916 5915851 There's no Cassie, is there?
5916952 5918352 No.
5920254 5921957 No, there isn't.
5925027 5928262 It's, uh, it's the place.
5933936 5937538 Um... kitchen, living room.
5937572 5939975 Um, hey, let me grab you<br />some clothes.
5950318 5951486 Thank you.
5951519 5953254 My dad won't even notice<br />they're gone.
5955289 5958326 Um, bedroom's all yours.
5958359 5959727 No, I'm not gonna<br />take your bedroom.
5959761 5962831 No. Please. I have to get up<br />early for work anyway, so...
5962865 5965500 I love that couch.<br />It's-it's a good couch.
5966467 5969171 So, stay as long<br />as you want.
5969204 5970304 Thank you.
5970338 5971974 Okay. Now, get some rest.
5974308 5975610 See you tomorrow.
6042211 6043411 Hey.
6043912 6044980 Hi.
6051452 6052821 I wasn't sure<br />if you were hungry,
6052855 6055824 so I went with<br />a few fan favorites.
6062630 6064565 What song do you want<br />at your funeral?
6067468 6069670 If you had to pick one.
6069704 6071306 Have you not thought<br />about this?
6071340 6072640 What song you're gonna play<br />at my funeral?
6072673 6075844 Yeah. Oh, at my funeral,<br />I'm thinking
6075878 6078446 -Creed, "With Arms Wide Open."<br />-Mm-hmm.
6078479 6080414 -You know. ♪ With arms wide... ♪<br />-Yeah.
6080448 6082217 -As the casket's being lowered.<br />-Uh-huh.
6093061 6094495 You're gonna be okay.
6098166 6099935 It doesn't feel like it.
6100668 6101937 I know.
6102803 6103939 But you are.
6105040 6107876 I think it's a little different<br />this time.
6111412 6113382 If I can't even<br />take care of myself,
6113414 6115083 then how am I, um...
6116385 6119654 you know, supposed<br />to take care of a baby?
6134369 6135736 The night I went<br />to that old abandoned house,
6135770 6139007 I didn't go there because<br />I needed a place to stay.
6139041 6141043 I went there to kill myself.
6143511 6145479 And I was sitting<br />on the living room floor,
6145513 6147983 and I saw you<br />in your bedroom window.
6148016 6149818 The light came on,
6149851 6151652 and you poked your head<br />through that curtain,
6151686 6155523 and as soon as I saw your face,<br />I couldn't do it.
6156858 6158393 The next day,<br />you brought me food.
6158427 6159928 You fed me.
6166667 6168070 I mean, you saved...
6169537 6172540 You saved my life<br />is what I'm trying to say.
6174376 6176078 That's who you are.
6176111 6179915 And if you decide to keep it,<br />you are going to be...
6181283 6183051 ...an amazing mother.
6184453 6187189 And that baby is so lucky.
6192427 6193962 You've got this.
6220989 6222190 Uh, Lily.
6256992 6258659 If you ever find yourself<br />in the position
6258692 6261729 to love somebody again,<br />just fall in love with me.
6268303 6270238 Yeah. Okay.
6306374 6307843 I'm so sorry.
6310611 6314282 I've been watching him<br />my entire life,
6314316 6316184 and I've seen...
6317853 6320589 ...how afraid he is
6320621 6323892 of opening his heart<br />to anyone...
6325759 6327695 ...ever since he was a kid.
6329131 6333801 And I think I felt<br />that he was dying inside.
6335837 6338106 Just dying inside,<br />little by little...
6340175 6341877 ...until he met you.
6344479 6347648 And I'm not making<br />any excuses, uh...
6349117 6350986 I never...
6351019 6353889 I never thought<br />he was capable of this.
6357893 6359060 Um...
6360694 6362864 Would it-- Would it be okay
6362898 6364966 if I asked<br />what happened to Emerson?
6366201 6367369 Of course.
6370839 6373308 You deserve to know,<br />and it's our family.
6376178 6377678 Um...
6380515 6382384 My father had a gun.
6383717 6387688 Ryle and Emerson were playing<br />in the house,
6387721 6390325 you know,<br />pretending to be cowboys,
6391293 6392827 and they found it.
6394362 6396064 And Ryle was six years old.
6396965 6399034 He was a six-year-old boy.
6401970 6403939 He didn't even know<br />that it was a real gun.
6403972 6406441 He thought that<br />it was pretend...
6407542 6410879 ...until it was t-- too late.
6413515 6415884 -Emerson was our brother...<br />-I'm so sorry, Allysa.
6415917 6418019 -...h-his best friend.<br />-I'm sorry.
6420922 6422657 He's never been<br />the same since.
6422691 6423992 Yeah.
6426661 6428863 To be at that funeral...
6437939 6441076 I really did<br />used to love flowers.
6443345 6445213 Listen to me.
6445247 6448316 As his sister,<br />I wish more than anything
6448350 6451353 that you could find a way<br />to forgive him.
6453989 6456191 But as your best friend,
6457659 6459861 Lily, if you take him back,
6459894 6462297 I will never<br />speak to you again.
6464899 6468436 Come here.<br />Come here. Come here.
6468470 6470939 I'm so sorry.
6470972 6473275 You're the best friend<br />I ever had.
6474409 6476211 I'll be an even better auntie.
