3057324 3059326 No, no. No names, man.
3059359 3060862 I don't wanna know<br />anybody's name.
3060895 3062697 You're buying this shit from me.
3062730 3064431 There's a good chance<br />you're gonna be dead
3064464 3068302 or in prison next week.<br />Kind of a homecoming for you.

3093828 3095763 Shit.
3095797 3098332 You'll probably need<br />some grenades
3098365 3101168 and probably a sniper rifle<br />like this one here.
3102537 3105607 Even your odds up pretty good<br />from a quarter-mile away

3150618 3152252 (CLICKS TONGUE)
3152285 3153387 I see<br />you haven't eaten anything.
3153420 3157558 Can I get you something else?<br />You don't like the food?
3157592 3160494 I'll have 'em bring in<br />something... something new.
3161729 3162396 CHRISTINA:<br />Who are you?
3162429 3164331 TYE:<br />Well, my name is Tye.
3164364 3168703 And this is my home.<br />One of my homes.
3168736 3172907 And you are my very special<br />guest.
3175342 3177578 Why are you doing this?
3177612 3178913 I haven't done anything to you.
3178946 3181816 Oh Of course, you haven't,<br />sweetheart.
3181849 3186453 But you know the sins<br />of a father are passed on
3186486 3188690 to their child.
3188723 3190792 My dad?
3190825 3193193 You don't even know him.<br />You've got it all wrong.
3196931 3200635 Let me tell you a little<br />something about your dad.
3200668 3202937 He's probably told you<br />that he works for some
3202970 3205807 very high-profile clients,<br />right?
3205840 3208976 Explains the... the money,<br />the brand-new Beamer
3209010 3212747 you got for your birthday,<br />and the pretty little education
3212780 3214381 you got.
3214414 3216684 But I... I want you to listen<br />very closely
3216718 3218619 to what I'm about to tell you.
3219987 3224559 That high-profile client<br />that your dad works for
3224592 3226460 is... is me.
3227528 3229964 (SCOFFS)
3229997 3231566 That... that's not true.
3231599 3233735 Couldn't be more true.
3233768 3236403 You see, your dad's not being<br />very honest with you.
3239339 3242375 In my line of work,<br />your dad is what we call
3242409 3245813 a specialist, an accountant.<br />A...
3245847 3247380 (INHALES DEEPLY)
3247414 3249016 ...middleman of sorts.
3249050 3250417 (CHUCKLES)
3250450 3252285 He is in charge
3252319 3255623 of digital monetary transfers.
3257658 3260762 So, he takes dirty money,<br />and sends it across the ocean.
3260795 3263798 And then in return,<br />he collects cryptocurrency,
3263831 3266466 thus washing all the funds.
3266500 3268836 But make no mistake, sweetheart.
3272339 3274909 Your father, Alex James,
3274942 3277645 is a criminal.
3279046 3281314 You're lying.
3281348 3283584 No. No, no.
3283618 3286521 That's something I don't do.<br />I've never lied.
3286554 3290691 So, believe me when I say this,<br />if he doesn't pay back
3290725 3293661 what's owed to me,<br />what happens next
3293694 3295395 is out of my control.
3296998 3299000 We're gonna have to kill you.
3300367 3302637 He is going<br />to have to watch you...
3303771 3305338 die.
3306473 3307809 And your mom,
3309376 3312613 and that rat bastard<br />FBI uncle of yours.
3314682 3316717 That makes sense.
3320154 3322123 You know, that's how this<br />whole thing really started,
3322156 3325526 was the two brothers.
3325560 3328563 This whole Cain and Abel story.
3328596 3330363 No, no. They love each other.
3330397 3332900 It is nothing<br />like Cain and Abel.
3332934 3335603 They're gonna save me,<br />and they're gonna kill you.
3335636 3337872 (CHUCKLES)
3337905 3340440 Well, that's doubtful,<br />but I like it.
3340473 3341609 Very doubtful.
3342844 3343911 You know, I hope<br />the next time I see you
3343945 3346981 it's under better circumstances,<br />because if it's not,
