147100 148100 Excuse me.
149640 150640 Hello?
150860 152420 Hi, is anyone sitting here?
153300 154300 Uh, no.

156600 157600 Yeah.
160180 161461 You have anything on Wednesdays?
162780 165860 My friends, they started this new club and<br />are always looking for new members.
166210 169520 Even if it's not totally your thing,<br />it's a good way to meet new people.
170120 172960 Right now we're organizing a trip to DC<br />for this big human rights rally.
174320 175320 Thanks anyway.
175420 179700 Well, if you change your<br />mind... Hey, you're Julian, right?
180820 181820 I'm Dylan.
182040 183280 My mom plays tennis with yours.
183840 185121 She told me to look out for you.
185820 186820 Oh, okay.
187320 188780 Hitting used to go to Beecher Prep?
189280 190620 Yeah, long time ago.
190820 192536 I switched to Union Tech from middle<br />school.
192560 192920 Union?
193420 195300 Man, we used to crush you guys in the<br />regionals.
195530 200020 Well, we sucked, so... Anyway, if<br />your mom asks, I found you, okay?
201000 203520 And, uh, word of advice, this is the loser<br />table.
204500 206340 If you want, you can come sit with us<br />tomorrow.
207460 208080 Oh, okay.
208200 209840 Maybe I'll...
237310 241370 I never would have guessed it And if you<br />trying to throw out all them vibes I'mma
241371 244790 catch on The lifestyle we live is just too<br />dangerous Paranoid since I've been linking
244791 248570 my... Wonder if it'll come out on<br />the web And I can't help all these...
248571 251038 Taking a photo and posting<br />it Coming home late and I'm
251039 253690 crawling to bed She always be<br />asking me, where have you been?
254870 260530 The world is gonna shit and we all know<br />that People freaking out like it to cross
260531 266690 that They on the Chino Shorts got all the<br />blogs, man Fuck the internet and you can
266691 274430 quote that It's a love When they think the<br />rich is bliss Then they'll wake me up And

282671 287930 love When they think the rich is bliss<br />Then they'll wake me up And I'll probably
287931 294330 be less to know Cause I don't get on the<br />internet no more
310090 311870 Hey, how's the new school?
354140 355140 Hello?
359220 360980 Kramer, you scared the crap out of me.
361860 363620 Oh, je suis désolée mon cher.
363780 364840 I couldn't resist.
367020 368180 So, viens d'ici.
368600 369600 Allez, allez.
372530 374920 Come all the way from Paris and that's the<br />best you can do.
380250 381780 You weren't expecting me?
382180 383040 No, I knew you were coming.
383180 384220 I just forgot I was today.
385440 386500 I just saw your parents.
386620 390560 They had to go out for some fancy soirée<br />with your father's colleagues.
391240 392240 Yeah, what else is new?
395510 397800 Alors, c'est une table pour deux.
407400 409881 Dad said they're doing an exhibit of your<br />paintings at the Met.
410760 411760 A retrospective.
412610 414620 It's a polite way of saying I'm old.
419610 421420 Kramer, I'm only 15.
424190 426360 So, tell me about you.
426660 428200 What about this new school, of course?
431020 434240 Well, it's only been a week, so I don't<br />really know anyone yet.
437410 439530 Well, I met this kid today who seems okay.
439950 441210 He's into sports and stuff.
443030 445746 He said that I could hang out with him and<br />his friends if I wanted to.
445770 447290 Well, that's good, no?
449150 450070 I don't know.
450150 451150 I guess.
453200 455730 Right now, I'm just trying to fit in.
456170 458491 It's kind of been my motto ever since I<br />left my old school.
461930 462930 What?
464290 466430 Julia, you did not leave your old school.
466470 470990 You were expelled for being cruel to<br />another boy.
472850 473090 Whatever.
473150 474150 You know what I mean.
476370 480670 If I learn anything from back then,<br />it's to just mind my own business.
481710 482270 Don't be mean.
482271 482990 Don't be nice.
483110 485310 Just be normal.
489090 490371 And this is what you've learned?
491560 492560 To be normal?
494860 495860 What's wrong with normal?
497900 498900 Nothing.
501980 502980 And everything.
505520 511841 I, too, wanted to be normal when<br />I was your age, but... But what?
513760 515766 I'm sure your father<br />has told you stories about
515767 518421 what happened to me<br />when I was a young girl.
519720 520720 Some.
521140 522636 He says you don't really like to talk<br />about it.
522660 523660 I don't.
524960 528360 But now, I think, for your sake,<br />I must.
531910 534220 Do you see that glass paperweight over<br />there?
534490 535740 Will you fetch that for me?
539120 541720 Do you know the name of the village that I<br />grew up in, in France?
544500 545740 Aberdeen, something, something.
550620 552440 It's in the Marcherie des Mountains.
553240 557140 It's surrounded by this ancient forest<br />called the Mernui.
561410 564300 The Mernui was a dark and scary place.
565460 567768 People would tell legends<br />about the giant wolves
567769 570501 that roamed the woods<br />during the long winters.
572500 578080 But in the spring, the leaves filled the<br />trees, the birds returned, and the forest
578480 579640 came alive.
580980 584380 Then, in early May, the most wondrous<br />thing would happen.
585125 587520 The bluebells would come into bloom.
590270 591840 It was magical.
595300 599180 To see it was to feel like you had stepped<br />into a fairy tale.
604650 608050 It is perhaps my most beloved memory of my<br />childhood.
610145 614170 Picnics with my parents amongst the fairy<br />flowers.
614171 615171 So?
628100 629760 Make me a bird, Papa.
630820 631340 Again?
631640 632660 But faster this time.
632820 633820 Okay, okay.
636180 644180 Little bird, little bird, fly as high as<br />the sky, as the sky above.
644560 649040 Little bird, little bird, how fast will<br />you go?
649240 653180 As fast as a crow, as fast as a dove.
653181 658360 Little bird, little bird, how far will you<br />see?
659280 665600 As far as I wish, for now I am free.
666050 669480 We lived in a beautiful flat, in a lovely<br />part of town.
669940 673920 My father was a doctor, a surgeon,<br />and my mother taught mathematics.
675530 678320 We were not rich, but we were certainly<br />not poor.
680385 682320 I admit, I was a bit spoiled.
683320 686180 Although, of course, I did not see it that<br />way.
694810 700230 When life is as good as mine was,<br />there is much you do not see.
709960 712260 It has been two years since Paris fell to<br />Germany.
712680 714794 And to mark the occasion,<br />our beloved city was paid
714795 717261 a visit by none other<br />than Herr Hitler himself.
717510 718900 Okay, he just looked at you.
719310 720700 He didn't know what to say.
721160 722440 He just did it again.
726170 727170 Shh.
738900 740200 We will be in the cellar.
741780 744900 If anyone asks for me, I am on home secret<br />call.
745260 746260 Okay?
749180 750240 Sounds better now.
751400 752640 I replace the pressure roller.
805090 806310 Wait, your new jacket.
806670 807490 I love it.
807690 808770 It looks so expensive.
809070 810410 Here comes Gimp with a limp.
811010 812370 Take a stick.
813910 814910 That's it.
815570 816570 Popped like a bunny.
818070 819230 He ought to be in the circus.
820890 822350 At least he could scratch me.
823450 824250 Hey, Patel.
824470 825010 That's right.
825350 826350 Oh, Toto.
826690 827590 That's so mean.
827670 829710 It's not his fault his father gave him<br />polio.
829850 830990 That's not how he got it.
830991 832330 It was just bad luck.
832650 835810 Well, my mother says he got it because his<br />father works in the sewers.
836730 838330 That's definitely why he smells so bad.
840710 842490 I didn't even know his name.
843170 848650 We all just called him Toto, which means<br />crab, because of how he walked.
850030 852890 The truth is, I didn't think about him at<br />all.
854680 861670 I cared only about my clothes,<br />my social life, and my passion secrete.
863630 864690 My artwork.
879375 880630 Thank you, Claude.
880900 881900 That was very well read.
883870 886670 Lamartine is one of our romantic poets.
889330 893930 He was part of a new movement that created<br />a new tone and feeling to French poetry.
894265 896550 Let's try to pay attention, Zahra.
899530 900930 He has been a poet for a long time.
902740 905850 The poem is about man's frustration with<br />time.
906090 908830 We want to control it, but of course we<br />can't.
910660 912690 All right, see you all tomorrow.
917050 919070 Zahra, could you stay a moment?
928700 929920 Sorry about the note.
930440 931520 Your drawing of the bird.
933160 934160 May I see it again?
953685 954960 Have you shown these to anyone?
956780 957780 Just my parents.
960200 967840 When I was your age, I loved to write<br />poems, stories, but I kept them to myself.
969810 974980 I thought if my friends knew, or God<br />forbid boys, they'd tease me.
976050 978260 It wasn't what popular girls do,<br />you know.
981360 983900 The gift is to be treasured, Zahra.
985220 987560 Never stop drawing, okay?
989240 990680 You sound just like my father.
992390 993870 I consider that quite the compliment.
996280 998120 The world of reality has its limits.
999290 1002390 The world of imagination is boundless.
1004820 1005820 See you tomorrow.
1023010 1024700 Hi, Madame Ballou.
1025220 1026220 Hi, Pierre.
1029340 1031040 One pound of chocolate, please.
1038960 1039960 Here.
1040220 1041220 Thank you.
1043930 1045020 Just take it and go.
1064120 1065120 What?
1065860 1066860 When?
1069080 1070080 Today.
1071440 1072440 This morning.
1074120 1075120 Don't worry.
1076480 1077480 I'll find another job.
1077930 1080050 I was getting a little bored at the<br />university anyway.
1080210 1081210 How could they do that?
1082200 1083880 You're the best maths professor they have.
1085980 1087620 It's complicated, Zahra.
1088800 1089800 Not really.
1091370 1092370 Max, don't.
1094920 1095920 What?
1103705 1106145 I was just writing in the window of the<br />bakery this afternoon.
1107890 1108920 It said no Jews.
1110780 1113120 There's probably going to be more signs<br />like that.
1114920 1116460 You said that wouldn't happen here.
1117700 1119160 That this was the unoccupied zone.
1120080 1121080 The free zone.
1124230 1125230 I'm afraid I was wrong.
1126970 1128580 It's like a bad storm, Zahra.
1129230 1132880 We just have to weather it and eventually<br />it'll pass.
1135010 1141000 Last month in Paris, the police arrested<br />almost 13,000 Jews.
1141480 1142620 Many of them children.
1143320 1145160 Rounded them up in the velodrome.
1145580 1147420 Shipped them to Torsi to a labour camp.
1147421 1148421 Max, enough.
1150540 1151540 The French, please.
1152790 1153800 There is no France.
1155040 1156860 But she takes its orders from Germany now.
1157240 1158640 You're scaring her.
1159960 1161440 Of course there's a France.
1161990 1164320 We're French citizens with papers to prove<br />it.
1164360 1165360 I'm sorry.
1165940 1167540 But she needs to know what's happening.
1170180 1174200 In Lyon, Jews are made to wear yellow<br />stars like they do in the occupied zone.
1174201 1176020 Only foreign-born Jews, religious Jews.
1176080 1177480 No, Rose, listen to yourself.
1178910 1181600 Do you think these bastards care where we<br />were born?
1182340 1184760 Or whether we go to synagogue or not?
1186000 1187240 In their eyes we're not French.
1187280 1188856 We're vermin, a disease to be wiped out.
1188880 1189880 Enough!
1194800 1195800 No more.
1200860 1202080 It'll be okay, Sara.
1203840 1205960 This is our country and it always will be.
1208780 1209780 Tell her!
1210920 1212560 Tell her it's going to be okay.
1226550 1227790 It's going to be okay.
1239890 1243050 Wildlife in Africa is very different to<br />ours here in France.
1243470 1245870 They have gazelles, hyenas...
1248020 1251110 All right, make sure to memorize the<br />information on the border.
1251330 1252570 We'll continue next week.
1275820 1276820 Sara?
1278305 1279305 Excuse me.
1279480 1280660 Oh, God, what is he doing?
1281060 1282240 Is he coming over here?
1284100 1285480 I saw this under your desk.
1287300 1288720 I figured he must have dropped it.
1289860 1290860 Thanks.
1291580 1292580 You're welcome.
1300825 1302150 Somebody has a crush.
1302550 1303210 Is that a friend of yours?
1303211 1304211 Huh?
1306050 1309270 No, I left something in class.
1311170 1312170 What was it?
1313130 1314130 Nothing.
1316470 1317470 May I?
1317670 1318750 No, don't run.
1319250 1320710 Toto touched it with his crap laws.
1321170 1322170 You're terrible.
1324110 1325290 Can I?
1343500 1344500 What are you, jewelry?
1345410 1346600 Just when I'm bored.
1347220 1348220 Stupid stuff.
1349200 1350580 You shouldn't say that.
1357700 1358700 Is this me?
1360360 1361921 Um... I like it.
1363600 1365920 Shinbi Sashime, her talent is really good.
1368440 1369440 For a Jew.
1384430 1386090 There he is, officer.
1386690 1389230 The Jew who tricked us out of our money.
1389610 1390610 Jew?
1390670 1391070 What Jew?
1391250 1391910 I'm not a Jew.
1391911 1393770 I'm not a Jew.
1395490 1397330 Give them back their money, Jew.
1401790 1404850 This will teach you not to steal.
1405590 1407110 People have a guilty conscience.
1409790 1414270 France must be purged of every Jew,<br />every communist, every gaullist.
1414690 1417229 It's time we rebuild our<br />country so that we too
1417230 1420510 may know the pride they<br />feel in Berlin, in Munich.
1423630 1424630 For Marseille.
1425050 1426390 Aaron and Lucy were arrested.
1429590 1430730 But that's the free zone.
1431880 1432990 There was a roundup.
1433350 1435910 Apparently they were taken to a camp up<br />north near Compiègne.
1440020 1442980 Petain is putting Darno in charge of the<br />national police.
1444150 1446920 A fascist in league with Hitler's SS in<br />charge of the police.
1453730 1454990 It's time, Rose.
1458590 1460530 We need to get out what we can.
1461030 1462510 Like Rabbi Belstein and his wife.
1463990 1464430 So what?
1464490 1467350 We just abandon our home.
1468610 1471350 Everything we own, everything we worked<br />for.
1471710 1472890 No, I just... I know.
1473130 1475170 I just want to give it a little more time.
1476595 1479560 Get our things in order and say our<br />goodbyes.
1480870 1482470 There can be no goodbyes, Rose.
1483690 1484690 You know that.
1486190 1487530 No one must know.
1507800 1508860 It's beautiful, Sarah.
1511520 1513460 Why do people hate us so much?
1523390 1524810 Not all people.
1525670 1526770 You need to remember that.
1527090 1527710 But some do.
1528110 1528590 Some.
1528870 1529870 Some yes.
1535930 1541340 What I believe is that all people have a<br />light inside them.
1541630 1544580 And that light lets them see into other<br />people's hearts.
1545660 1547920 But some people have lost it.
1548710 1551960 They have darkness inside them,<br />so that's all they see in others.
1554020 1556560 They hate us because they can't see us.
1557900 1562100 As long as we shine our light,<br />we win.
1570920 1571940 We're sorry, Sarah.
1573070 1575680 We know this is going to be very hard for<br />you.
1576065 1577280 When do we need to leave?
1578160 1579160 Or soon?
1579560 1580560 Soon.
1581820 1583500 By next week, the latest.
1584950 1586080 It won't be forever.
1587080 1588080 Do you promise?
1589460 1590460 I promise.
1595390 1597590 Now, I need a promise from you.
1600040 1603510 I want you to keep wearing your winter<br />boots to school.
1604950 1605950 What?
1606960 1608920 I've been waiting to wear my new shoes all<br />winter.
1609570 1610810 Oh, please, little bird.
1611730 1612730 Why?
1614440 1616590 Because I want you to.
1617330 1618330 Okay?
1620050 1621050 Fine.
1621690 1622010 Promise?
1622650 1623650 Yes.
1626170 1627170 Thank you.
1631690 1632690 Good night, Sarah.
1633530 1634530 We love you.
1659400 1660440 Good morning, Pastor Luke.
1660480 1661480 Good morning, Miss Bloom.
1684650 1689580 So then, A squared plus B squared equals C<br />squared.
1690440 1691440 Come in.
1693660 1694320 Ma'am's operation.
1694680 1695680 May I have a word?
1696840 1697840 Of course.
1707750 1709650 Children, I have to leave for a few<br />minutes.
1709710 1711410 I want you all to behave until I'm back.
1711650 1714050 Sarah, Ruth, I need you to come with me<br />quickly.
1714550 1715730 Please bring your coats.
1718090 1719090 Come on.
1719810 1720810 Why?
1721260 1722870 I'll explain everything outside.
1723190 1724870 The rest of you, stay in your seats.
1727630 1730070 There's been a roundup of the Jews in<br />Aubert-Villiers-Au-Bois.
1730290 1732670 We believe German officers are on their<br />way here now.
1733050 1733590 Mark your side.
1733630 1736550 It's going to take you and the other<br />Jewish children to hide in the woods.
1739810 1740810 Sarah, where's your coat?
1741270 1742290 It's in the art room.
1742790 1743530 Take this.
1743531 1744531 Hey.
1753280 1753680 Scared?
1753780 1754200 Me too.
1754340 1756100 I know you are, but it's going to be<br />alright.
1761480 1762480 Quickly, children.
1762700 1763700 Come.
1768510 1770370 Children, this is Antoine.
1770870 1774230 He will keep you safe, but you must do<br />exactly as he says.
1774250 1775250 Do you understand?
1775630 1778630 I need you all to stay very quiet and to<br />run very fast.
1779010 1780010 Can you do that?
1837440 1838440 Now.
1843980 1844980 I'm sorry.
1845920 1847640 None of these children came to school<br />today.
1848900 1850260 Someone must have tipped them off.
1852720 1854200 They were taken away by the teachers.
1854880 1856400 They're still on the ground somewhere.
1858220 1859240 Thank you, young man.
1860900 1863100 Your teachers could learn from your<br />example.
1864380 1865380 Find them.
1900380 1901380 Let's go.
1934200 1935780 Right, now go back to your classrooms.
1936160 1937476 Come away from the windows right now.
1937500 1938540 Go back to your classroom.
1938640 1939640 Right now.
1957560 1958560 Leave humanity!
2005410 2006410 It's alright.
2007270 2008950 We're taking you to your parents.
2009550 2010850 Everybody in, please.
2053200 2055400 For the love of God, let them go,<br />I beg you.
2056080 2057080 Lying scum.
2057560 2058580 I should shoot you right now.
2058581 2059240 Don't.
2059340 2059740 Please.
2060260 2061000 Don't do this.
2061120 2062120 They're only children.
2062560 2063560 They're Jews.
2063820 2064820 We have our orders.
2065840 2068820 If you have any brains, you'll go back<br />inside and mind your own business.
2069260 2070820 These children are our business.
2071440 2073060 No, these are my students.
2073280 2074520 I'm staying with them.
2074800 2075800 Marie.
2140290 2141770 One of the children's missing.
2147260 2149180 There are 14 names on our list.
2150160 2152540 But only 13 children accounted for.
2154800 2155800 One's missing.
2173490 2173610 Sarah.
2174490 2176130 The soldiers are still searching for you.
2176330 2177770 You need to come with me right now.
2179110 2180110 I know where I am.
2234660 2235660 I'm sorry.
2235740 2236740 It's the safest way.
2237480 2238480 Where are we?
2239500 2240980 My father showed me this once.
2241740 2243260 He's worked in these sewers for years.
2252540 2254840 It only goes down about as deep as these.
2259840 2260840 I think.
2275880 2276880 Here.
2277280 2278280 I'm fine.
2279560 2280560 You're freezing.
2281860 2283740 And it's another six kilometers to Don<br />Villier.
2285020 2286220 What's in Don Villier?
2287680 2288680 My home.
2290980 2292120 What about my parents?
2292880 2294356 What if something bad happens to my<br />parents?
2294380 2295380 Sure, they're fine.
2296620 2298500 Please, we really need to keep moving.
2358030 2359310 I see that house past the barn.
2360210 2361210 That's ours.
2361930 2364330 Only I'm thinking it might not be safe for<br />you to stay there.
2365110 2367210 There's a nosy old couple who live right<br />above us.
2368310 2369970 My father thinks they're Nazi informants.
2371490 2372490 Don't worry.
2373340 2374421 You'll be safe in the barn.
2411470 2412470 I'm sorry.
2413470 2414470 What?
2415350 2417490 If it was safe to stay at my house,<br />you'd understand.
2418250 2419250 Really?
2420250 2421250 This is nice.
2429770 2430770 What was that?
2431670 2432670 That sound.
2435610 2436710 That would be the bat.
2438410 2439850 They nest in the rafters sometimes.
2440010 2441050 They're harmless, I swear.
2445510 2446250 That was Esther Hayloft.
2446350 2448030 I was thinking that's where you could<br />hide.
2469730 2470940 It's fine, really.
2472250 2473250 I'm stronger than I look.
2499375 2502220 The stacks and hay bales along the edge<br />and you'll be hidden completely.
2504340 2505340 All right?
2506130 2507130 I'll be right back.
2507720 2508000 You're leaving?
2508450 2511060 Just to tell my parents what's going on.
2513760 2514760 Tauté.
2516260 2517741 I... just wanted to...
2521890 2522890 wish you hadn't.
2523690 2524690 It's okay.
2526530 2527530 You're safe now.
2530140 2531470 There is one thing though.
2532170 2533170 Yeah?
2533810 2536050 Maybe call me by my real name instead of<br />Tauté.
2538710 2540231 I... Of course.
2540950 2545451 See, I know your last name is Mommier because<br />they always sit us next to each other.
2548540 2550061 But... It's Julian.
2552300 2553300 I'm sorry.
2554760 2555760 Thank you, Julian.
2571520 2571900 Julian?
2571901 2572901 Hmm?
2575180 2578460 Your father knew how special that name was<br />to me.
2580620 2581620 So what happened next?
2583290 2585060 Next, I met his parents.
2586620 2588380 Vivienne and Jean-Paul.
2590310 2592880 We'll do everything we can to find your<br />parents.
2594700 2596760 And until then, you stay with us,<br />okay?
2604740 2605760 It's not the rates.
2606320 2608740 But we can spiff it up a little.
2609300 2610300 Can't we, Julian?
2617160 2618400 Try to eat something.
2627000 2628481 I'll... fix you up a bit.
2673860 2676420 I was instructed not to leave the barn<br />under any circumstances.
2678940 2681740 For fear of being found out by the nosy<br />neighbours.
2682260 2683260 The La Fleur's.
2686190 2688460 No one could know of my existence.
2737340 2738340 Sarah?
2749810 2751891 I, um... I brought<br />you something.
2763120 2764440 I remember how you liked to draw.
2772250 2773250 Here.
2781380 2782380 Thanks, Julian.
2787410 2790500 I also brought some books.
2793710 2795840 And your schoolwork so you don't fall<br />behind.
2797720 2799481 I could teach you today's lesson if you<br />want.
2803630 2804630 Or not.
2807310 2808310 Being so nice to me...
2810100 2811830 I was never very nice to you.
2813130 2814531 At least my friends certainly were.
2817430 2821351 I guess I always felt<br />you were... I don't know.
2822510 2823510 Different.
2826430 2827430 Maybe you're wrong.
2829220 2830220 I doubt it.
2831370 2832460 I'm really smart.
2834600 2835240 Is that so?
2835410 2836840 I mean, I don't like to brag.
2837560 2838920 I know, of course not.
2839540 2840540 Yes.
2851270 2853570 Vivienne and Jean-Paul tried their best.
2854850 2858590 But as days became weeks, there was still<br />no word of my parents.
2865920 2868800 I could feel myself losing track of time.
2870380 2871820 Every day the same.
2872940 2875240 There was only one thing I could look<br />forward to.
2876660 2878120 My lessons with Julia.
2879110 2882360 So if A and B are distinct points...
2883440 2887340 and AC plus CB equals AB...
2888420 2890300 then C must lie on.
2891360 2892360 AB?
2893180 2894180 Not bad, though.
2895410 2897520 Okay, so what we can get from that<br />information is that...
2897521 2899340 CAB is a right angle triangle.
2899750 2902121 And that information<br />is that C... Oh.
2905820 2908341 I, um... I thought you<br />might like to hang it up.
2909040 2910960 Make the place feel a little more like a<br />bedroom.
2911680 2912680 I love it.
2913060 2914260 Charlie Chapman's my favorite.
2914720 2915720 I know.
2916060 2917060 You do?
2918120 2919921 Well, I mean, he's everyone's favorite,<br />right?
2920505 2921826 We should get back to the lesson.
2922020 2923020 In a minute.
2923100 2925000 You promised me a gossip report first,<br />remember?
2926240 2927240 So I did.
2927700 2928700 Let's see.
2930500 2931756 Well, you were right about Jean-Marc.
2931780 2933020 He does have a crush on Simone.
2933480 2934836 I heard him telling Luke in biology.
2934860 2935620 I knew it.
2935840 2936840 What else?
2937260 2938260 Let me think.
2938820 2941740 Yvette and Agnes are still fighting over<br />the solo in the Spring Ross Idol.
2941880 2942640 Of course.
2942780 2943380 Of course.
2943740 2946300 Christophe got in trouble for snoring in<br />Madame Lucienne's class.
2947020 2950060 And they finally figured out who hid that<br />sardine near Monsieur Jelot's desk.
2950500 2951941 It was... Eugene.
2953030 2953900 You told me last week.
2954000 2955280 It's like Jelot's surprise test.
2955980 2957420 Plus his father works in the Canada.
2959340 2960340 Impressive.
2960740 2961740 Simple maths.
2962280 2964761 Speaking of which... Fine.
2965350 2968460 Okay, so if angle A and angle B are<br />complementary...
2969980 2972841 And angle A is twice them...<br />Thank you again for this.
2976795 2977880 I'm glad you like it.
2983920 2986600 In town, the situation was only growing<br />worse.
2988200 2993481 Vincent and some other boys from the school<br />had been recruited to join the Milice.
2993850 2995220 The local Nazi militia.
2996080 2999780 They were given guns and areas of town to<br />patrol...
2999781 3003080 With instructions to report any suspicious<br />behaviour.
3017040 3021140 Julian... If anyone asks for<br />me... You know what to say.
3055640 3057270 No terrain, no best roads to Andouche.
3057450 3060190 My contact in Toulouse says their shipping<br />goes for ammunition.
3068630 3070070 But it will take a few more days.
3070965 3071965 No, it has to be soon.
3074270 3075630 The answer is no.
3078570 3081270 Down the ground is only for those willing<br />to die for freedom.
3083880 3085590 That's not why I need to see you.
3088350 3089350 Then what?
3093960 3094990 I need your help.
3096790 3098170 Are you sure you've been trusted?
3098670 3099670 I'm positive.
3101210 3103009 So he said it will take<br />a few weeks for the
3103010 3104870 woman he knows to<br />forge the identity papers.
3104990 3109931 But once we have those, George will arrange<br />to take you to an abbey in Le Moustier.
3110570 3113050 The nuns there have been organising<br />crossings into Switzerland.
3113530 3114530 Switzerland?
3116110 3117599 It's five days on foot<br />through the Alps, but
3117600 3120491 they've gotten a lot<br />of Jews out that way.
3120570 3121570 You wouldn't be alone.
3122760 3124470 Honestly, I feel safer here.
3125410 3126410 Oh, my sweet.
3127770 3129070 I'm not sure where you are.
3135630 3138932 After her victory in<br />Orleans, Joan was able to
3138933 3141910 convince Charles VII<br />to let her join the army.
3142070 3143910 Led by the Duke of Arenceau.
3143935 3145510 Led by the Duke of Arenceau.
3145511 3149830 The aim of recapturing the bridges along<br />the Loire.
3150230 3152511 Joan then led a small group...<br />Where have you ever been?
3153390 3154390 The Loire.
3155270 3156270 Switzerland?
3158250 3159650 I've never even been to Paris.
3165990 3168471 You know I'd go with you if I thought I<br />wouldn't slow you down.
3172610 3174051 Have you really never been to Paris?
3175410 3178090 I've never even left Anvillier except to<br />go to school.
3183010 3184010 What?
3189580 3190580 Where are you going?
3192300 3193300 Sarah?
3194700 3197220 Well, how do you like Paris so far?
3201600 3202600 It's...
3203300 3204300 It's great.
3204440 3206320 Up ahead is the Place de la Troyes.
3206900 3207900 Do you see it?
3209800 3210800 Yes.
3211980 3213920 Julian, here, take the wheel.
3221680 3222700 Use your imagination.
3223380 3225920 Just picture it in your mind's eye.
3227620 3228620 You're up to Trier.
3230010 3231010 It's a beautiful archway.
3231560 3232940 Over 50 meters tall.
3234280 3235400 And then...
3235500 3236500 The Place de la Conco.
3240150 3241511 Do you see all those lovely cafes?
3249170 3250170 The flower shops.
3256300 3257300 Julian?
3259635 3261480 You really want me to say yes,<br />don't you?
3263560 3264700 It's only fun if you try.
3265540 3267120 The world of reality has its limits.
3268050 3270100 The world of imagination is boundless.
3270680 3271680 Keep trying.
3273630 3276520 We're driving down a quite little street.
3277215 3278580 In the 6e arrondissement.
3281700 3282700 And now we're turning.
3284610 3286011 Along the banks of the River Seine.
3288780 3290060 That's the Saint-Michel Bridge.
3290320 3291320 Just up there.
3297630 3298930 Oh, wait, I can't see it now.
3299190 3300190 You do?
3300610 3300950 Really?
3301110 3302110 Really.
3306470 3308770 And then to the left, there's Notre Dame.
3314440 3315440 Isn't it incredible?
3316540 3317540 It really is.
3325260 3326690 Can I admit something embarrassing?
3327505 3329370 I do this at least three times a week.
3330830 3332910 You try spending every single day alone in<br />a bar.
3333410 3334410 Watch out for that lady!
3339070 3340911 Just for that, we're skipping the Eiffel<br />Tower.
3341660 3342740 No, please.
3342880 3344040 Not the Eiffel Tower.
3358880 3361520 The next three weeks passed very<br />strangely.
3363120 3364880 Time seemed to crawl.
3368425 3372380 And yet, it also seemed to move very,<br />very fast.
3373800 3375220 Almost too fast.
3381670 3383010 See that leopard over there?
3383570 3384970 See how its spots are all circular?
3385630 3385990 Yeah.
3386310 3387750 That's because we're in East Africa.
3388350 3389910 In the south, the spots will be square.
3392780 3393890 Oh, you're making that up.
3393891 3395110 I am not.
3395630 3396630 Dare you.
3397350 3397950 Wait, Sarah.
3397951 3398830 Sarah, see over there?
3398930 3399330 See them?
3399810 3400810 They're zebras.
3401090 3402550 Oh, they're beautiful.
3463010 3465550 I was anxious about leaving for<br />Switzerland.
3467030 3469530 I knew I would miss those evenings with<br />Julian.
3470550 3474590 It was as if we had created our own little<br />world.
3476190 3479710 Even as the world outside grew darker and<br />darker.
3483070 3484350 George, it's me.
3485110 3486110 I'm here for the papers.
3500590 3502350 We're up to something.
3502730 3504230 What have we here?
3508270 3509270 Look at this.
3528980 3529980 Get us in a message.
3530220 3532260 This is what happens to traitors.
3538470 3539470 What?
3610440 3611440 I hate them.
3612560 3613560 I hate them so much.
3614575 3618240 I'm so sorry, Julian.
3620170 3621811 I just... I just can't believe he's gone.
3625870 3627430 Remember the bird I told you about?
3629970 3631410 I drew her for you.
3631670 3632910 So you could meet her too.
3643510 3645450 She always comes when I need her.
3646220 3647330 She brings me hope.
3654710 3657050 Little bird, little bird.
3657940 3659290 How high will you climb?
3659890 3660890 How high will you fly?
3661800 3663970 As high as the sky.
3664900 3666630 As the sky above.
3668350 3670750 Little bird, little bird.
3671710 3674610 How far will you see?
3676400 3678990 As far as I wish.
3681080 3685310 For now, I am free.
3685311 3688070 My plans
3699420 3702480 for being smuggled out disappeared with<br />George.
3703280 3706133 The attack on the cinema<br />was only the beginning
3706134 3709061 of a much darker<br />phase of the occupation.
3709460 3710920 The killing had begun.
3712880 3716660 The Germans set up new headquarters,<br />right in Don Villier.
3719780 3723660 Now we had far more to worry about than<br />just the nosy Lafleurs.
3726910 3730950 Nazis were everywhere, on every road in<br />and out of the village.
3731910 3734310 There was no way I could reach Switzerland<br />now.
3736710 3740310 The Bomiers tried to make my life as<br />bearable as possible.
3741030 3745335 Vivienne continued to keep<br />me fed, bring clean clothes,
3745336 3748330 and of course keep me<br />company for an hour or two.
3749655 3755650 But as summer came and went, it was<br />Julia's nightly visits that sustained me.
3758870 3764150 The barn had become my whole world,<br />and Julia its center.
3770500 3773220 We had in common one crucial thing.
3776330 3780900 We had both seen how much hate people are<br />capable of.
3784140 3787500 And how much courage it took to be kind.
3789560 3796860 Because when kindness can cost you your<br />life, it becomes like a miracle.
3802590 3806610 It is the light in the darkness that Papa<br />talked about.
3810020 3814630 I began to see Julia as more than my<br />rescuer, or even my friend.
3816650 3817750 He was my light.
3826920 3829080 Special trip tonight, Mademoiselle Blum.
3829200 3830200 How lovely.
3830580 3831580 Where are you this time?
3834620 3835620 You will see.
3840970 3841970 Close your eyes, okay?
3854870 3856631 How would you like to visit New York<br />tonight?
3857490 3858490 Hard.
3858930 3859930 Sure.
3860850 3861850 Okay then.
3863070 3864070 Open your eyes.
3878590 3879590 Oh, Julia.
3880770 3881790 So beautiful.
3909520 3910680 Oh, look at the theaters.
3947490 3948490 Torteur.
3949670 3952150 Don't you ever bathe in the crab's light<br />water?
3952870 3957210 Monsieur Beaumier, may I have a word in my<br />office?
3958470 3961221 The teachers and I have<br />been talking, and we've
3961222 3964251 decided to place you in<br />advanced mathematics.
3965330 3967245 You'll be with the<br />older children, but I
3967246 3970171 suspect they'll be the<br />ones trying to keep up.
3971030 3972030 Thank you, sir.
3973510 3974510 Thank you, Julia.
3976130 3978390 There's not much brings me joy these days.
3984080 3985700 You can go back to class now.
3996590 4003630 I'll wait for the day and the night.
4004070 4010810 I'll always wait for your return.
4015470 4023470 I'll wait for the bird that is looking for<br />its nest.
4028970 4032360 The time passes quickly.
4033920 4040840 I'm struggling, sadly, in my softest<br />heart.
4042200 4047840 And yet, I'll wait for your return.
4069030 4070030 It's so early.
4070340 4071340 Is everything okay?
4073510 4074560 My sketchbook!
4075560 4076940 I was in Pastor Luke's and I saw it.
4076941 4078320 Thank you.
4092510 4094050 I was so stupid back then.
4127010 4128010 Toto?
4131640 4132640 Hey, Toto.
4136020 4137120 What's going on, Toto?
4140580 4141880 What are you doing here?
4150535 4152510 I was just working on my father's car.
4153875 4156510 I saw you sneaking out of Pastor Luke's<br />office with something.
4161000 4162400 Don't play dumb without a scribble.
4162980 4164000 I left my book there.
4164220 4164420 So what?
4164720 4165160 Bullshit.
4165660 4166760 Please, it's in my house.
4166860 4167860 I can show you right now.
4167980 4168980 You're a bad liar.
4183110 4184810 What did you steal from Pastor Luke?
4185130 4185370 Nothing.
4185390 4186390 I just left my book.
4188410 4190370 You think you're smarter than everyone,<br />don't you?
4191030 4191410 No.
4191850 4192850 Pathetic, you know that?
4194210 4195250 We deformed useless.
4195430 4197190 Do you know what Nazis do to people like<br />you?
4198170 4199170 Do you?
4202490 4204130 They exterminate them like Jews.
4207230 4208690 I should do the human race a favor.
4209790 4211470 I'll cut you out of your misery right now.
4217590 4217990 Shut your mouth!
4217991 4219126 Alright, it's only a lesson, Vincent.
4219150 4219710 Shut your mouth!
4219870 4220870 He hasn't!
4224890 4226290 The hell are you looking at, freak?
4233210 4234210 Feeble manatee.
4237620 4238620 What did you say?
4249960 4250960 The hell is that?
4251600 4252600 Look out!
4252680 4253680 Let's get out of here!
4273150 4274430 It's ok, you're ok.
4274910 4275910 Come back to the loft.
4276370 4277370 They could come back.
4277690 4279730 I said go to the loft!
4280570 4281870 What are you stupid?
4282310 4283310 Go!
4283470 4285830 I just wanted to... I<br />don't care what you want.
4286580 4288070 It's not always about you.
4289190 4290910 You know what happens if they find you<br />here?
4291650 4292650 Do you?
4292770 4294010 They'll arrest my parents.
4294750 4296630 They'll execute them, do you understand?
4297150 4299050 I didn't think that...<br />Of course you didn't.
4299590 4301170 All you think about is yourself.
4302340 4304835 You're still the same<br />spoiled brat that sat next
4304836 4307950 to me for five years and<br />didn't even know my name.
4309090 4310090 Please.
4310790 4311790 Please.
4312150 4313150 I'm sorry.
4313830 4314830 Please.
4317750 4318750 Please.
4326730 4328011 Just go back to the loft, Sarah.
4328690 4329690 Please.
4387220 4388581 It's been days since he's gone by.
4391950 4393990 He just needs more time to heal.
4394910 4396250 He got so mad at me.
4397310 4399130 He was just as mad at himself.
4400170 4402850 The truth is he should never have taken<br />your sketchbook.
4403450 4405430 It was too risky for all of us.
4407040 4408270 He did it for me.
4411490 4417730 When in dark times, those small things<br />remind us of our humanity.
4419900 4420900 For you, humanity.
4426160 4427200 For you, humanity.
4431840 4434100 Another week passed, then another.
4435180 4437460 And still, Julian stayed away.
4446420 4448260 Swrew up and off.
4476460 4477460 You?
4482790 4483350 Can we talk?
4483470 4484470 No, no.
4485290 4486290 Okay.
4492950 4493950 I hate it.
4495560 4497001 I hate that you showed me that time.
4498490 4498990 Like what?
4499050 4500050 Like some weakling.
4502090 4503390 A helpless, pathetic weakling.
4503410 4504070 Did you hear that?
4504090 4506091 I know it's hard to believe, but he's<br />strong first.
4510110 4512511 Before he got poly, he was the fastest kid<br />in my whole class.
4515930 4518170 I just don't remember what it felt like to<br />run like that.
4519050 4520050 To be strong.
4520090 4521090 You are strong.
4521910 4522910 You are.
4523630 4524630 And brave.
4526360 4527530 The bravest person I've ever met.
4527550 4527790 Why?
4527791 4528951 Because I walk with a crutch.
4531620 4533581 My crutch doesn't make me brave,<br />it makes me walk.
4533950 4534950 That's not what I meant.
4535910 4537210 Could you stop talking, please?
4546900 4548101 I thought about what you said.
4549620 4550220 Now I'm selfish.
4550221 4551000 I was just upset.
4551160 4552661 I didn't mean... It's true.
4556090 4557550 The truth is, had you<br />been the one that needed
4557551 4560001 saving, I probably<br />wouldn't have done it.
4561160 4562160 You don't know that?
4562280 4563280 No, I
4566470 4566730 do.
4567270 4568270 And I'm sorry.
4574470 4575910 You did try to save me, though.
4576870 4578630 I would have gone, let's both kill them.
4578690 4579690 Probably.
4582430 4583770 Still, it was brave of you.
4586690 4587690 Take a compliment.
4589530 4590530 Thank you.
4590890 4591890 There we go.
4592375 4593736 Shall we get back to the game now?
4599230 4600431 Can I just say one more thing?
4601520 4602520 What?
4606930 4607930 I loved...
4608110 4609530 Look who finally won.
4611000 4612950 I've been too used to it.
4615770 4618890 Winter came, and with it many changes.
4619730 4621490 More and more soldiers arrived.
4622730 4624750 The main roads became more dangerous.
4626370 4629330 So Julien started taking the long way to<br />school.
4633940 4636020 There were other changes, too.
4670150 4672990 Before I knew it, it was spring again.
4674455 4679930 Impossible as it seemed, I'd been in<br />hiding for over a year.
4698820 4702540 Happy birthday to you.
4705605 4709600 Happy birthday dear Sara.
4711980 4715780 Happy birthday to you.
4716310 4718100 I didn't even realize it was today.
4720895 4722140 Happy birthday, my sweet.
4722640 4723640 Is it really chocolate?
4724080 4726640 Vivienne has been saving Russian cards for<br />months.
4728580 4729940 Make a wish, Blum.
4737330 4738330 Thank you.
4746570 4747570 It's beautiful.
4749590 4751210 Right, let's eat some cake.
4755810 4757531 Now, how did you get it past the<br />Laplanders?
4757910 4759440 I did something a bit naughty.
4760650 4761820 God forgive us.
4762800 4764120 Last week I had a tooth pulled.
4765280 4767100 A doctor gave me sleeping powder for the<br />pain.
4769040 4770060 I had a little extra.
4770560 4773100 I assume a mum put it in their milk this<br />afternoon.
4773820 4775740 We could hear them snoring through the<br />wall.
4779860 4783000 Now, I was told they'd be dancing.
4785400 4786400 But of course.
4817520 4818060 Thank you.
4818061 4819061 Thank
4826090 4856190 you for my present.
4856510 4857510 It's a turn.
4857570 4858570 I can see that.
4858810 4862330 Radio London interrupts this broadcast to<br />bring you developing news.
4862930 4865450 Monte Cassino has been liberated by the<br />Allies.
4866180 4868249 The first German<br />parachute division has been
4868250 4871111 destroyed, clearing the<br />path to Rome for the Allies.
4871730 4872750 France will be next.
4874615 4880250 Laughter That means the war will be over<br />soon.
4903090 4904090 Sara.
4909690 4910920 What are you doing here?
4911605 4912605 Must be after midnight.
4913810 4915171 I've got one more present for you.
4948870 4949870 Are you okay?
4952210 4953210 Yeah.
4953990 4955230 I just haven't been outside in.
4957390 4958390 Come on.
4960840 4962710 I'd never been there at night before.
4964110 4967470 All those stories of giant wolves would<br />have scared me away.
4971130 4975150 But that night, I felt no fear.
4988870 4989870 Manoey.
4994480 4995480 Happy birthday.
5015980 5016980 There's...
5017200 5018666 There's something I<br />want to say, and I feel like
5018690 5020520 if I don't do it now,<br />then I'll never be here.
5026460 5027540 Here's the thing.
5029570 5035609 If the war is really going to<br />end soon, well, when it does,
5035610 5038682 I want you to know that in<br />the future that I see for myself,
5043990 5047231 I... was you a part of it, and<br />I'm wondering if maybe... Yes.
5050390 5052031 I haven't even answered the question yet.
5053130 5054130 I nearly answered.
5056210 5057210 Yes.
5102450 5103450 You should be home.
5104710 5105750 The sun will be up soon.
5107130 5108130 Yeah.
5113570 5115130 Wait, I have something for you too.
5124770 5125770 Really?
5126750 5127750 Yeah.
5128770 5130390 I left something for you.
5130890 5131890 It's in the middle.
5149160 5150240 See you tomorrow.
5155950 5156950 Beautiful humanity.
5165100 5166580 I used to be afraid of the night.
5167960 5170792 But now I see it as my time<br />for listening to the soul of the
5170793 5175600 world telling me its secrets,<br />over and over, like a song.
5176700 5177700 You love Julian.
5178720 5179740 You love Julian.
5180760 5182080 Yes, I answer.
5182460 5183460 I know.
5183930 5184930 I love Julian.
5186460 5187460 I did.
5188280 5189280 I loved him.
5190820 5193180 I wasn't brave enough to say it that<br />night.
5194120 5196840 But I decided the next night I would.
5198500 5201900 And maybe he would say he loved me too.
5202480 5203480 I love you, Sarah.
5216550 5219540 Julian, you'll be late for school.
5223370 5224480 Good morning, Mama.
5225280 5226440 Someone's in a good mood.
5226600 5227360 Why not?
5227520 5228520 The sun is shining.
5228620 5229700 The bluebells are blooming.
5230970 5231970 The bluebells?
5232810 5233810 See you tonight, Mama.
5236905 5240580 I'm not sure what made Julian take the<br />main road to school that morning.
5241980 5243600 Perhaps he was feeling brave.
5245400 5247520 Perhaps he had other things on his mind.
5247521 5249540 Am I
5267420 5268420 short on the,
5278520 5280300 um... You there!
5280560 5281560 Cripple!
5282640 5283640 Papers!
5291200 5292720 I'm just on my way to school.
5292860 5293860 The Accol Lafayette.
5294780 5295780 We can take you.
5297060 5298060 Wait, my bag!
5299120 5299960 Come on, move!
5300060 5301060 Let's get in!
5308720 5309580 Up, come on!
5309581 5310581 Ah!
5352650 5353650 Jean-Paul!
5355650 5356830 It's your son, Julian.
5357870 5358010 What?
5358210 5358530 What happened?
5359090 5360470 The police took him away.
5413000 5414000 Sarah, right?
5417180 5418180 A little missing dress.
5538560 5540820 Where were you this whole time,<br />honey, in Toto's barn?
5542100 5543100 His name is Julian.
5546220 5547240 Put your hands up.
5547500 5548500 Put them up!
5550260 5551260 Please.
5552740 5553740 Turn around.
5555220 5556220 Turn around!
5561120 5562120 Coward.
5589250 5590250 No!
5662930 5663930 Why are you stopping?
5677770 5678770 Vivienne!
5678890 5679890 Jean-Paul!
5691480 5692000 Vivienne?
5692380 5693380 Jean-Paul?
5695440 5696620 Stay where you are.
5697020 5698500 Not another step or I'll shoot.
5699540 5700040 Please.
5700170 5701170 What are you doing here?
5701620 5702740 My friend is shooting at me.
5703420 5704680 What do you want with us?
5705480 5706000 Nothing.
5706060 5707320 I just need to find Vivienne.
5708800 5709800 Please.
5710030 5711240 Don't make me shoot you.
5711420 5712420 Stay there.
5714580 5715580 Sarah.
5718770 5719770 We're by Bernstein.
5719900 5720380 Bernstein.
5720760 5721280 You know this girl?
5721560 5722660 This is Sarah Bloom.
5723020 5724820 Her family lived down the street from us.
5725620 5726620 I don't understand.
5728215 5730440 Lefler, please put the gun away.
5732440 5733440 Sarah.
5733920 5734940 What are you doing here?
5735280 5736760 Romeo's were hiding me in their barn.
5737500 5739341 They thought you were informants for the<br />Nazis.
5740180 5740700 Sarah.
5741080 5745180 The Lefler's have been hiding us in their<br />attic for almost two years now.
5746580 5749540 Today we're being smuggled out by the<br />Amash Weaver.
5749700 5751260 You should come with us.
5753140 5754580 I have to find Vivienne.
5755280 5756280 Julian's been arrested.
5756620 5758200 I just told you.
5758650 5760240 There have been no arrests today.
5760340 5761580 You are lying.
5763220 5764440 He's just upset.
5765500 5767061 He's... I'm sorry.
5772470 5773470 Madame.
5773870 5774870 Madame.
5776670 5777670 I know your son.
5778890 5779990 He was taken this morning.
5781450 5784410 They put him in a truck along with some<br />patients from the hospital.
5786090 5788050 They're heading to a prison camp in the<br />mountains.
5788250 5789830 He can still be saved.
5789831 5791830 For the right money.
5792970 5794130 That poor boy.
5795670 5796670 Bernstein.
5796785 5797850 We haven't got much time.
5798170 5799210 He's waiting downstairs.
5799710 5801990 We'll look after the girl till the<br />Bonmiers return.
5803530 5804530 Good luck, old friend.
5807970 5809780 You write to us when you get to Jerusalem.
5811040 5813420 God will remember your kindness.
5840530 5841530 It's Vivienne.
5842050 5843050 Vivienne!
5845010 5846010 Sarah!
5846390 5847390 Vivienne!
5847520 5852570 How much money do you need?
5853590 5855630 So much more than we have.
5872780 5874120 We'll take my car.
5874520 5874840 Sarah.
5875540 5876960 You should go up to Aramatic.
5877920 5878920 Let's go.
5902970 5903730 Everybody out!
5903790 5904790 Come on!
5904870 5905870 Everybody out!
5906210 5907210 Get out!
5907250 5908250 Let's go!
5910430 5911490 What's going on?
5912150 5914210 This road is closed so you're being<br />diverted.
5914450 5915990 Better take a little break now.
5916770 5917210 Come on!
5917490 5917730 Out!
5917950 5918330 Let's go!
5918650 5919250 All out!
5919430 5920130 Move out!
5920150 5922250 Come on!
5922251 5923251 Let's go!
5993200 5994200 Please.
5994760 5996400 My son is on that truck.
5997420 5998420 Please.
5998540 5999540 Not anymore.
5999660 6000880 They continued on third.
6009330 6010330 Please.
6010535 6011610 Please, I have money.
6014110 6015390 Money for his release.
6025290 6026990 Come on.
6057490 6058490 Move.
6066430 6067480 Little bird.
6068400 6069400 Little bird.
6071420 6074240 How fast will you go?
6076780 6079220 As fast as a dove.
6080060 6081700 As fast as a crow.
6089530 6090530 Run!
6091070 6092130 They're getting away!
6097760 6099110 No!
6133950 6134950 Julien!
6149570 6151830 Get her back in the car now!
6152090 6153830 Get her back or I'll shoot!
6153950 6155050 No, no, no, no!
6155070 6156830 Please, no, no.
6157750 6158750 Please.
6160510 6161550 Get back to the car.
6163070 6164070 Please.
6164290 6165290 Julien.
6234580 6236510 The Beaumiers returned to the woods.
6236770 6237270 Julien!
6237510 6242190 Once the soldiers had moved on,<br />they searched for Julien all through the
6242890 6244630 night and for many days that followed.
6245590 6246590 Julien!
6246700 6250770 They continued to cling to the hope that<br />perhaps Julien had gotten away.
6250790 6251790 Julien!
6252840 6254550 But deep down they knew better.
6263830 6269730 Still somehow they put aside their<br />immeasurable sorrow to take care of me.
6271980 6274410 I stayed with them through the end of the<br />war.
6274650 6275890 Hidden, of course.
6279940 6281130 But not in the barn.
6284020 6286750 I could never set foot in there again.
6291990 6294370 The final capitulation of the Nazi state.
6295170 6299090 In August, the Nazi occupation finally<br />ended.
6300090 6302170 The Germans were driven out of France.
6302770 6305292 And when the allied troops<br />gathered at the Arc de
6305293 6308310 Triomphe, you could<br />hear the whole world cheer.
6316460 6318700 I continued to live with the Beaumiers.
6319640 6321060 Who had become like family.
6323200 6325120 I was glad to be back at school.
6327390 6328800 But nothing was the same.
6331360 6333100 The weeks passed in a fog.
6334340 6338280 I couldn't stop thinking about all that<br />had happened to me.
6339920 6341240 And to Julien.
6352700 6360000 Then, one day, in early<br />November, it was Papa.
6360805 6361900 He was back.
6379820 6381760 He said he was still looking for Maman.
6382520 6386700 That he and another doctor had evaded the<br />Roundup by hiding in the morgue.
6388885 6393640 I introduced him to the Beaumiers,<br />who he could not stop thanking.
6396160 6398000 That night, Papa took me aside.
6399940 6401900 Somehow I knew it was about Maman.
6404580 6408180 He had tried to keep the truth from me,<br />but he realized he could not.
6409530 6414400 He explained that on the day of the<br />Roundup, Maman had been arrested.
6416020 6418580 She was put on a train to Drancy.
6421340 6424400 And from there sent to the concentration<br />camp in Auschwitz.
6425800 6428080 He didn't know how long she was kept<br />there.
6429140 6432320 Only that this is where she was put to<br />death.
6433900 6436780 I think a part of me knew she hadn't<br />survived.
6437840 6444160 In the White Bird, I had always felt her<br />spirit gifting me hope when I had none.
6446320 6450620 Papa and I stayed with the Beaumiers for a<br />short while until he found work at a
6450720 6454760 hospital in Paris, the city that would<br />become my new home.
6455860 6458460 We will always have a mother in me.
6491020 6495880 I came back to visit the Beaumiers often,<br />throughout my life.
6497600 6501976 And when I married<br />your grandfather, they,
6501977 6506461 along with my papa,<br />walked me down the aisle.
6537360 6539300 You forget many things in life.
6541620 6543680 But you never forget kindness.
6545860 6547540 Like love.
6549200 6550760 It stays with you forever.
6563030 6566770 And I suppose that, mon cher, is the end<br />of my story.
6573120 6574320 Did I upset you?
6577910 6579300 Yeah, but in a good way.
6582470 6587250 And do you understand why I needed to tell<br />you this story now, Julian?
6615580 6616580 It's okay, I've got it.
6616720 6617120 Ah!
6617460 6618460 Merci, mon cher.
6668410 6670130 You know her.
6670131 6676130 For her incredibly influential body of<br />work, found in museums all over the world.
6695300 6701420 But today, it is our great honor to<br />celebrate her life's work as part of our
6701845 6703660 series devoted to activism and the arts.
6704490 6709360 Will you please join me in welcoming the<br />one and only, Sarah Brown.
6717120 6718120 Bonjour.
6718220 6719220 Merci.
6723200 6723680 Bonjour.
6723820 6724820 Bonjour, mes amis.
6725170 6727000 It is my privilege to be with you today.
6728880 6733440 You know, I have made speeches like this<br />before I've told versions of my story.
6734240 6738820 But for most of my life, I have much<br />preferred to let my art speak for me.
6739710 6741440 I think that is why I became an artist.
6744005 6746120 To fly away from the pain that I have<br />known.
6747620 6751940 But I was talking with my young grandson<br />last night and I realized something.
6752900 6757760 I realized I do not want to fly away<br />anymore.
6760180 6762120 You see, my life was not normal.
6764660 6765700 Hatred is not normal.
6767460 6769020 Cruelty is not normal.
6769220 6770220 My bad.
6771260 6772720 Love is normal.
6773540 6774940 Kindness is normal.
6777060 6779200 But simply knowing this is not enough.
6780420 6781600 It must be shared.
6782820 6784280 It must be practiced.
6795160 6796160 Excuse me.
6797500 6798500 Hi.
6800080 6801921 I just wanted to say I'm sorry about<br />yesterday.
6803100 6804560 It was kind of a jerk to you.
6805360 6806360 Kind of.
6806480 6806740 Whatever.
6806880 6807880 It's cool.
6809550 6810751 My name is Julian, by the way.
6811060 6811480 I'm Ramya.
6811555 6816620 Sometimes the smallest gestures can lead<br />to the greatest change.
6817020 6819520 So, do you want to come to DC with our<br />club?
6820160 6821160 Uh, yeah.
6821680 6822680 Yeah.
6822980 6829041 A very wise man, Martin Luther King, once<br />said darkness cannot drive out darkness.
6829340 6831420 Only the light can do that.
6832660 6834420 Now this is what my father believed.
6835520 6842840 We must, all of us, use the light within<br />ourselves to stop the injustices of today.
6843700 6850161 For only then can we be certain that the<br />darkness of the past will never be repeated.
6851300 6852300 And that those
6857850 6865850 and that those who gave their lives to<br />defy it did so for a brighter tomorrow.
6867970 6869070 Vive l'humanité!
6869071 6872530 Vive l'humanité!
6925540 6929540 CAN53     26 April 2024
