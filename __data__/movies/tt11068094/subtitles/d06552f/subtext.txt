384217 385317 Mm.
385384 386584 I just saw your parents.
386651 389317 They had to go out<br />for some fancy soiree

430917 432950 Well, it's only been a week.
433017 434783 So I don't really know<br />anyone yet.
437384 439584 Well, I met this kid today<br />who seems okay.
439651 441517 Like, he's into sports<br />and stuff.
442984 444117 He said that I could<br />hang out with him

445584 447584 Mm, well, that's good, no?
449417 451117 I don't know. I guess.
453184 455850 Right now,<br />I'm just trying to fit in.
455917 456950 It's kind of been my motto
457017 458783 ever since I left<br />my old school.
458850 459850 GRAND-MERE: Mm.
461883 463017 What?
464184 466351 Julian, you did not leave<br />your old school.
466417 468684 You were expelled.
468750 471117 For being cruel<br />to another boy.
472750 474384 Whatever.<br />You know what I mean.
476351 477584 If I learned anything<br />from back then,
477651 481517 it's to just mind<br />my own business.
481584 482984 Don't be mean, don't be nice.
483050 485451 Just... be normal.
489084 491417 And this is what<br />you've learned?

497917 499251 Nothing.

505484 508850 I, too, wanted to be normal<br />when I was your age, but...
511084 512184 But what?
513718 515584 I'm sure your father<br />has told you stories
515651 518451 about what happened to me<br />when I was a young girl.
519551 520984 Some.
521050 522517 He says you don't really like<br />to talk about it.
522584 523618 I don't.
524917 528850 But now, I think,<br />for your sake, I must.
531850 534150 Do you see that glass<br />paperweight over there?
534217 535850 Will you fetch that for me?
539050 540417 Do you know the name<br />of the village
