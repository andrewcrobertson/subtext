146317 147284 Excuse me.
149417 150484 Hello?
150551 152251 Hi. Is anyone sitting here?
153251 155184 Uh, no.
155251 157351 -You're new here, aren't you?<br />-Yeah.
160150 161217 You have anything<br />on Wednesdays?
162584 163750 My friends and I started<br />this new club
163817 166017 and we're always looking<br />for new members.
166084 167783 Even if it's not<br />totally your thing,
167850 169984 it's a good way<br />to meet new people.
170050 171417 Right now, we're organizing<br />a trip to D.C.
171484 172783 for this big<br />human rights rally.
174317 175351 Thanks anyway.
175417 176917 Well, if you change<br />your mind...
176984 178351 Hey.
178417 180651 You're Julian, right?
180718 181817 I'm Dillon.
181883 183584 My mom plays tennis<br />with yours.
183651 185117 She told me<br />to look out for you.
185551 187117 Oh. Okay.
187184 189117 Hey, didn't you used<br />to go to Beecher Prep?
189184 190484 Yeah. Long time ago.
190551 192451 I switched to Union Tech<br />for middle school.
192517 194950 Union? Man, we used to crush<br />you guys in the regionals.
195017 196651 Well, we sucked, so...
196718 198084 Anyway, um,
198150 200651 if your mom asks,<br />I found you, okay?
200718 204317 And, word of advice,<br />this is the loser table.
204384 206417 If you want, you can come<br />sit with us tomorrow.
207417 209384 Oh, okay. Maybe I...
310050 311883 Hey, how's the new school?
354017 355084 Hello?
355150 356351 Boo!
359050 360950 <i>Grand-mere,</i> you scared<br />the crap out of me.
361017 362251 Aw.
362317 363618 <i>Je suis desolee, mon cher.</i>
363684 365718 I couldn't resist.
366984 369584 So, <i>viens ici! Allez, allez!</i>
372484 373618 I come all the way from Paris
373684 375050 and that's the best<br />you can do?
380217 382017 You weren't expecting me?
382084 384150 No. I knew you were coming,<br />I just forgot it was today.
384217 385317 Mm.
385384 386584 I just saw your parents.
386651 389317 They had to go out<br />for some fancy soiree
389384 391117 with your father's colleagues.
391184 393184 Yeah. What else is new?
395517 397684 <i>Alors, c'est une table</i><br /><i>pour deux.</i>
406750 408417 Uh, Dad said<br />they're doing an exhibit
408484 410150 -of your paintings at the Met?<br />-Mm.
410217 412451 "Retrospective."
412517 416084 It's a polite way<br />of saying I'm old.
419783 423084 <i>-Grand-mere,</i> I'm only 15.<br />-Mm? Mm-hmm.
424150 426484 So, tell me about you.
426551 428517 What about this new school<br />of yours?
430917 432950 Well, it's only been a week.
433017 434783 So I don't really know<br />anyone yet.
437384 439584 Well, I met this kid today<br />who seems okay.
439651 441517 Like, he's into sports<br />and stuff.
442984 444117 He said that I could<br />hang out with him
444184 445517 and his friends<br />if I wanted to.
445584 447584 Mm, well, that's good, no?
449417 451117 I don't know. I guess.
453184 455850 Right now,<br />I'm just trying to fit in.
455917 456950 It's kind of been my motto
457017 458783 ever since I left<br />my old school.
458850 459850 Mm.
461883 463017 What?
464184 466351 Julian, you did not leave<br />your old school.
466417 468684 You were expelled.
468750 471117 For being cruel<br />to another boy.
472750 474384 Whatever.<br />You know what I mean.
476351 477584 If I learned anything<br />from back then,
477651 481517 it's to just mind<br />my own business.
481584 482984 Don't be mean, don't be nice.
483050 485451 Just... be normal.
489084 491417 And this is what<br />you've learned?
491484 493217 To be normal?
494850 496184 What's wrong with normal?
497917 499251 Nothing.
501984 503417 And everything.
505484 508850 I, too, wanted to be normal<br />when I was your age, but...
511084 512184 But what?
513718 515584 I'm sure your father<br />has told you stories
515651 518451 about what happened to me<br />when I was a young girl.
519551 520984 Some.
521050 522517 He says you don't really like<br />to talk about it.
522584 523618 I don't.
524917 528850 But now, I think,<br />for your sake, I must.
531850 534150 Do you see that glass<br />paperweight over there?
534217 535850 Will you fetch that for me?
539050 540417 Do you know the name<br />of the village
540484 541684 that I grew up in, in France?
543184 545651 Uh,<br />Auberdeen-something-something?
545718 548451 Aubervilliers-aux-Bois.
550484 553117 It's in<br />the Margeride mountains
553184 557351 surrounded by this ancient<br />forest called the Mernuit.
561184 565251 <i>The Mernuit was a dark</i><br /><i>and scary place.</i>
565317 567817 <i>People would tell legends</i><br /><i>about the giant wolves</i>
567883 570251 <i>that roamed the woods</i><br /><i>during the long winters.</i>
572351 575684 <i>But in the spring,</i><br /><i>the leaves filled the trees,</i>
575750 579883 <i>the birds returned,</i><br /><i>and the forest came alive.</i>
580917 582117 <i>Then, in early May,</i>
582184 584651 <i>the most wondrous thing</i><br /><i>would happen.</i>
584718 587783 The bluebells would<br />come into bloom.
589251 590351 Oh,
590417 592384 <i>it was magical.</i>
592451 594917 <i>Magique.</i>
594984 596817 <i>To see it was to feel like</i>
596883 599284 <i>you had stepped</i><br /><i>into a fairy tale.</i>
604750 607783 It is perhaps my most beloved<br />memory of my childhood.
609917 614351 Picnics with my parents<br />amongst the fairy flowers.
628551 629883 <i>Make me a bird, Papa.</i>
630684 631883 Again?

717184 718984 Okay, he just looked at you.
719050 720551 He did not!
721484 722950 He just did it again.
738750 741584 We'll be in the cellar.
741651 744684 If anyone asks for me,<br />I went home, sick with cold.
744750 746251 Okay?
749084 751251 Sounds better now.
751317 753117 I... I replaced<br />the pressure roller.
754883 756618 Oh.
802384 803417 Hey.
803883 805084 Well?
805150 807451 Wait. Your new jacket?<br />I love it.
807517 808984 It looks so expensive.
809050 811117 Here comes gimp with a limp.
811184 813651 Take his stick.
813718 815150 That's it.
815217 816417 Hop like a bunny.
818017 820451 He ought to be in the circus.<br />Boy, fetch.
820517 822684 Ugh! Even his crutch reeks.
823484 825150 Hey, Tourteau, let's race.
825217 826684 Poor Tourteau.
826750 827984 They're so mean.
828050 829451 It's not his fault his father<br />gave him polio.
829517 832517 That's not how he got it.<br />It was just bad luck.
832584 834150 Well, my mother says he got it
834217 836584 because his father works<br />in the sewers.
836651 838950 It's definitely why<br />he smells so bad.
840584 843017 <i>I didn't</i><br /><i>even know his name.</i>
843084 845618 <i>We all just</i><br /><i>called him Tourteau,</i>
845684 849917 <i>which means "crab,"</i><br /><i>because of how he walked.</i>
849984 853184 <i>The truth is, I didn't</i><br /><i>think about him at all.</i>
855050 857351 <i>I cared only about my clothes,</i>
857417 858850 <i>my social life,</i>
859684 862384 <i>and my passion</i> secrete.
863484 864984 <i>My artwork.</i>
865050 867017 "Let us enjoy<br />the transient delight
867084 869117 "That fills our fairest day.
869184 872184 "Unhappy crowds cry out<br />to you in prayers.
872251 874317 "Flow, Time,<br />and set them free.

877217 879417 "But leave<br />the happy be."
879484 880618 Thank you, Claude.
880684 882517 That was very well read.
883718 886217 Lamartine is one<br />of our Romantic poets.
889251 892150 He was part of a new movement<br />that created a new tone
892217 893950 and feeling to French poetry.
894017 896117 Let's try<br />to pay attention, Sara.
899917 901584 Yes, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Petitjean.
903017 905750 The poem is about man's<br />frustration with time.
905817 908651 We want to control it,<br />but of course we can't.
910850 912551 All right,<br />see you all tomorrow.
916850 919384 Sara, could you stay a moment?
928718 930351 Sorry about the note.
930417 932351 The drawing of the bird...
933050 934184 May I see it again?
953484 955351 Have you shown these<br />to anyone?
956718 958684 Just my parents.
960050 961551 When I was your age,
962484 964251 I loved to write.
964317 965684 Poems, stories...
966817 969117 but I kept them to myself.
969184 971417 I thought if my friends knew,
971484 973651 or, God forbid, boys,
973718 975950 they'd tease me.
976017 978384 It wasn't what<br />popular girls do, you know?
981217 984084 A gift is<br />to be treasured, Sara.
985050 987184 Never stop drawing.
987251 988817 Okay?
988883 991017 You sound just like my father.
992150 993783 I consider that<br />quite the compliment.
996217 998517 The world of reality<br />has its limits.
999251 1001484 The world of imagination
1001551 1003050 is boundless.
1004917 1006251 See you tomorrow.
1023551 1024850 Hi, <i>Madame</i> Ballou.
1025551 1026618 Hi, Pierre.
1029251 1031050 One pain au chocolat, please.
1038651 1039618 Here.
1040184 1041684 Thank you.
1043684 1045718 Just take it and go.
1063984 1064950 <i>What?</i>
1065750 1066750 When?
1069317 1070284 Today.
1071351 1072351 This morning.
1074384 1075517 Don't worry.
1076417 1077783 I'll find another job.
1077850 1079817 I was getting a little bored<br />of the university anyway.
1079883 1081917 How could they do that?
1081984 1084451 You're the best math professor<br />they have.
1085750 1087750 It's complicated, Sara.
1088850 1090184 Not really.
1090917 1092451 Max, don't.
1095017 1096084 What?
1103217 1106117 There's a sign in the window<br />of the bakery this afternoon.
1107651 1110451 It said "No Jews."
1110517 1113517 There's probably going to be<br />more signs like that.
1114684 1117284 You said that wouldn't<br />happen here.
1117351 1119783 That this was<br />the unoccupied zone.
1119850 1121417 The free zone.
1123984 1126517 I'm afraid I was wrong.
1126584 1129150 It's like<br />a bad storm, Sara.
1129217 1130718 We just have to weather it,
1131584 1133284 and eventually, it'll pass.
1135017 1136184 Last month in Paris,
1136251 1141317 the police arrested<br />almost 13,000 Jews.
1141384 1143117 Many of them children.
1143184 1145351 Rounded them up<br />in the velodrome,
1145417 1147284 shipped them to Drancy,<br />to a labor camp.
1147351 1148584 Max, enough!
1150317 1151850 The French police?
1152551 1154817 There is no France.
1154883 1157017 Vichy takes its orders<br />from Germany now.
1157084 1158551 You're scaring her.
1159984 1161950 Of course there's a France.
1162017 1164150 We're French citizens<br />with papers to prove it.
1164217 1165817 I'm sorry,
1165883 1167950 but she needs to know<br />what's happening.
1169917 1172284 In Lyon, Jews are made<br />to wear yellow stars
1172351 1174451 like they do<br />in the occupied zone.
1174517 1175984 Only foreign-born Jews.<br />Religious Jews.
1176050 1177384 No, Rose,<br />listen to yourself!
1178850 1181750 Do you think these bastards<br />care where we were born?
1181817 1184883 Or... Or... Or whether we go<br />to synagogue or not?
1185817 1187251 In their eyes,<br />we're not French.
1187317 1188850 We're vermin,<br />a disease to be wiped out.
1188917 1190084 Enough!
1195050 1196584 <i>Maman?</i>
1200850 1203750 It'll be okay, Sara.
1203817 1206351 This is our country,<br />and it always will be.
1208551 1209551 Tell her!
1210883 1213050 Tell her it's going<br />to be okay.
1226651 1228184 It's going to be okay.
1239917 1241284 The wildlife in Africa
1241351 1243084 is very different<br />to ours here in France.
1243150 1246184 They have gazelles, hyenas...
1248017 1249783 All right, make sure<br />to memorize
1249850 1251284 the information on the board
1251351 1252517 and we'll continue next week.
1275517 1276517 Sara?
1278184 1279484 Excuse me.
1279551 1281117 Oh, God, what is he doing?
1281184 1282684 Is he coming over here?
1284050 1286050 I saw this under your desk.
1287251 1288917 I figured you must<br />have dropped it.
1289417 1290417 Thanks.
1291517 1292718 You're welcome.
1300750 1302584 Somebody has a crush.
1302651 1303651 Is that<br />a friend of yours?
1303718 1306517 Huh? Um, no.
1306584 1309783 I... I...<br />I left something in class.
1310984 1312517 What was it?
1313317 1314783 Nothing.
1316384 1317451 May I?
1317517 1318984 Uh, no, don't, man.
1319050 1320684 Tourteau touched it<br />with his crab claws.
1320750 1323050 Jerome, you're terrible.
1323684 1324850 Can I?
1343551 1345150 You drew all of these?
1345217 1347017 Uh, just when I'm bored.
1347084 1348817 It's stupid stuff.
1348883 1350217 You shouldn't say that.
1357417 1358417 Is this me?
1359251 1360684 Um...
1361084 1363317 I like it.
1363384 1364684 You shouldn't be so shy<br />about your talent.
1364750 1365750 These are really good.
1368517 1369517 For a Jew.
1384317 1386251 There!<br />There he is, Officer.
1386317 1389251 The Jew who tricked us<br />out of our money.
1389317 1392017 Jew?<br />What Jew? I'm no Jew.
1395750 1397251 Give them back<br />their money, Jew.
1402718 1404084 This will teach you not
1404150 1406084 to steal from honest people.
1406150 1407351 Filthy Jew!
1410150 1412251 <i>France must</i><br /><i>be purged of every Jew,</i>
1412317 1414584 <i>every communist,</i><br /><i>every Gaullist.</i>
1414651 1416750 <i>It's time we rebuild</i><br /><i>our country,</i>
1416817 1419850 <i>so that we too may know</i><br /><i>the pride they feel in Berlin.</i>
1419917 1421517 <i>In Munich...</i>
1423184 1424484 It's from Marseilles.
1424551 1426351 Aaron and Lucie were arrested.
1427718 1428718 What?
1429551 1431084 But that's the free zone.
1432084 1433184 There was a roundup.
1433251 1434284 Apparently, they were taken
1434351 1436584 to a camp up north<br />near Compiegne.
1439883 1441317 Petain is putting Darnand
1441384 1443950 in charge<br />of the National Police.
1444017 1445783 A fascist in league<br />with Hitler's SS,
1445850 1447217 in charge of the police.
1453551 1455384 It's time, Rose.
1458651 1460750 We need to get out<br />while we can.
1460817 1462883 Like Rabbi Bernstein<br />and his wife.
1463984 1466084 So, what, we just...
1466150 1468451 abandon our home?
1468517 1471484 Everything we own,<br />everything we worked for?
1471551 1472950 -No, I just... I know.<br />-Rose.
1473017 1475351 I just want to give it<br />a little more time.
1476651 1478750 Get our things in order...
1478817 1480750 and say our goodbyes.
1480817 1482883 There can be no goodbyes,<br />Rose.
1483718 1484917 You know that.
1486217 1487618 No one must know.
1507584 1509217 That's beautiful, Sara.
1511384 1513783 Why do people hate us so much?
1523150 1524618 Not all people.
1525551 1526850 You need to remember that.
1526917 1528184 But some do.
1528251 1530050 Some. Some, yes.
1535950 1537984 What I believe
1538050 1541150 is that all people<br />have a light inside them.
1541217 1544750 And that light lets them see<br />into other people's hearts.
1545984 1548517 But some people have lost it.
1548584 1550484 They have darkness<br />inside them,
1550551 1552584 so that's all they see<br />in others.
1554017 1556451 They hate us<br />because they can't see us.
1557850 1560184 As long as we shine our light,
1561484 1562783 we win.
1570850 1573017 We're sorry, Sara.
1573084 1575850 We know this is going<br />to be very hard for you.
1575917 1577917 When do we need to leave?
1577984 1578950 How soon?
1579517 1580684 Soon.
1581850 1583684 By next week, the latest.
1584817 1586850 It won't be forever.
1586917 1588017 Do you promise?
1589750 1590750 Promise.
1595384 1597417 Now I need a promise from you.
1600050 1603917 I want you to keep wearing<br />your winter boots to school.
1604817 1606750 What?
1606817 1608850 I've been waiting to wear<br />my new shoes all winter.
1609517 1611117 Oh, please, little bird.
1611850 1612850 Why?
1614351 1616284 Because I want you to.
1617517 1619050 Okay?
1619883 1621317 Fine.
1621384 1623584 -Promise?<br />-Yes.
1626050 1627184 Thank you.
1631651 1632850 Good night, Sara.
1633517 1634750 We love you.
1659584 1661584 -Morning, Pastor Luc.<br />-Morning, Ms. Blum.
1684817 1686117 <i>So then, A squared</i>
1686184 1688117 plus B squared
1688184 1690084 equals C squared.
1690150 1691117 Come in.
1693618 1696050 <i>Mademoiselle</i> Petitjean,<br />may I have a word?
1696917 1698017 Of course.
1705584 1707651 Yeah.
1707718 1709584 Children, I have to leave<br />for a few minutes.
1709651 1711284 So I want you all to behave<br />until I'm back.
1711351 1712484 Sara, Ruth,
1712551 1714917 I need you to come with me.<br />Quickly, please.
1714984 1716684 And bring your coats.
1717718 1718718 Come on.
1719850 1720850 Why?
1720917 1722950 I'll explain<br />everything outside.
1723017 1725017 To the rest of you,<br />stay in your seats.
1727651 1728817 There's been a roundup<br />of the Jews
1728883 1730084 in Aubervilliers-aux-Bois.
1730150 1731317 We believe German officers
1731384 1732817 -are on their way here now.<br />-Here?
1732883 1734084 A <i>maquisard</i> is going
1734150 1735017 to take you<br />and the other Jewish children
1735084 1736150 to hide in the woods.
1739484 1741150 Sara, where's your coat?
1741217 1742584 I left it in the art room.
1742651 1744050 Here, take this.
1745684 1746684 Okay.
1753184 1754351 -I'm scared.<br />-Me too.
1754417 1756017 I know you are,<br />but it's gonna be all right.
1761551 1762850 Quickly, you two. Come.
1768417 1770451 Children, this is Antoine.
1770517 1772484 He will keep you safe.
1772551 1774284 But you must do exactly<br />as he says.
1774351 1775484 Do you understand?
1775551 1777284 I need you all<br />to stay very quiet
1777351 1778750 and to run very fast.
1778817 1780217 Can you do that?
1802150 1804017 Move<br />into the next courtyard!
1804917 1806251 Hurry! Hurry!
1836284 1838050 Now!
1844050 1845351 Oh, I'm sorry.
1845417 1848750 None of these children<br />came to school today.
1848817 1850551 Someone must have<br />tipped them off.
1852718 1854850 They were taken away<br />by the teachers.
1854917 1856417 They're still<br />on the ground somewhere.
1858150 1860917 Thank you, young man.
1860984 1863783 Your teachers could learn<br />from your example.
1863850 1865950 Find them.
1894251 1896117 Get off her!
1899050 1900084 Behind you!
1900150 1901284 There goes<br />another one!
1903050 1904351 I got one here!
1930584 1931684 Little girl!
1933217 1934517 Did you see one come this way?
1934584 1936050 Right, now go back<br />to your classrooms.
1936117 1937451 Come away<br />from the windows right now.
1937517 1938850 Go back to your classroom<br />right now.
1957351 1958417 <i>Vive I'humanite!</i>
2005517 2007351 -It's all right.<br />-Absolutely.
2007417 2009351 We're taking you<br />to your parents.
2009417 2011317 Everybody in, please.
2053184 2055251 For the love of God,<br />let them go, I beg you.
2055883 2057117 Lying scum.
2057184 2058651 I should shoot you right now.
2058718 2060317 Don't, please!
2060384 2062184 Don't do this.<br />They're only children.
2062251 2063783 They're Jews.
2063850 2065750 We have our orders.
2065817 2067618 If you have any brains,<br />you'll go back inside
2067684 2069251 and mind your own business.
2069317 2071317 These children<br />are our business.
2071384 2074584 No, these are my students.<br />I'm staying with them.
2074651 2075618 Marie...
2140684 2142584 One of the children<br />is missing.
2147217 2149750 There are 14 names<br />on our list,
2149817 2153084 but only 13 children<br />accounted for.
2154050 2155451 One's missing.
2173050 2174084 Sara.
2174150 2176150 The soldiers are<br />still searching for you.
2176217 2178284 You need to come<br />with me right now.
2178984 2180284 I know a way out.
2234850 2236883 I'm sorry.<br />It's the safest way.
2237517 2239651 Where are we?
2239718 2241651 My father showed me this once.
2241718 2243917 He's worked in these sewers<br />for years.
2252551 2255050 It... It only goes down<br />about as deep as your knees.
2259917 2261084 I think.
2275850 2277150 Here.
2277217 2278750 I'm... I'm fine.
2279384 2281417 You're freezing.
2281484 2283718 And it's another six<br />kilometers to Dannevilliers.
2285084 2286950 What's in Dannevilliers?
2287850 2289284 My home.
2291084 2292651 What about my parents?
2292718 2294017 What if something bad happened<br />to my parents?
2294084 2295984 I'm sure they're fine. Okay?
2296050 2298584 Sara, please,<br />we really need to keep moving.
2357917 2361684 See that house past the barn?<br />That's ours.
2361750 2364984 Only I'm thinking it might not<br />be safe for you to stay there.
2365050 2368184 There's a nosy old couple<br />who live right above us.
2368251 2369950 My father thinks<br />they're Nazi informants.
2371517 2373251 Don't worry.
2373317 2374551 You'll be safe in the barn.
2410517 2412551 Sorry.
2413150 2415284 A mouse.
2415351 2416917 If it was safe to stay<br />at my house, you...
2416984 2419251 It's fine. Really.
2420217 2421417 This is nice.
2429551 2430783 What is that?
2431484 2432551 That... That sound?
2434750 2437384 Um, that would be the bats.
2438651 2439817 They nest in the rafters<br />sometimes.
2439883 2441551 They're harmless, I swear.
2444984 2446117 Oh, there's the hayloft.
2446184 2447750 I was thinking<br />that's where you could hide.
2449150 2450217 Um...
2469251 2472017 Oh, it's fine, really.
2472084 2473750 I'm stronger than I look.
2499184 2500651 We'll stack some hay bales<br />along the edge
2500718 2502017 and you'll be<br />hidden completely.
2504150 2505184 All right?
2506017 2507451 I'll be right back.
2507517 2508584 You're leaving?
2508651 2510718 Just to tell my parents<br />what's going on.
2513584 2515084 Tourteau?
2515551 2516850 I...
2516917 2518551 I just wanted to...
2521750 2522750 Well, if you hadn't...
2523750 2525117 It's okay.
2526517 2528050 You're safe now.
2530150 2531783 There is one thing, though.
2531850 2533584 Yeah?
2533651 2536684 Maybe call me by my real name<br />instead of Tourteau?
2538150 2540750 I... Of course.
2540817 2542950 See, I know your last name<br />is Beaumier
2543017 2546117 'cause they always sit us<br />next to each other, but...
2549017 2550351 It's Julien.
2552584 2553584 Sorry.
2554718 2556050 Thank you, Julien.
2571384 2573117 -Julien?<br />-Mm.
2575184 2578351 Your father knew how special<br />that name was to me.
2580684 2582050 So what happened next?
2583351 2584917 Next, I met his parents.
2586417 2590084 <i>Vivienne and Jean-Paul.</i>
2590150 2593217 We'll do everything<br />we can to find your parents.
2594684 2596850 And until then,<br />you stay with us, okay?
2605017 2606117 It's not the Ritz,
2606184 2608384 but, uh, we can<br />spiff it up a little.
2609217 2610718 Can't we, Julien?
2613917 2615050 Here.
2617184 2618883 Try to eat something.
2625850 2629618 I'll, um... fix you up a bed.
2647517 2649384 <i>Maman, Papa,</i> where are you?
2673883 2676150 <i>I was instructed</i><br /><i>not to leave the barn</i>
2676217 2678850 <i>under any circumstances.</i>
2678917 2682084 <i>For fear of being found out</i><br /><i>by the nosy neighbors.</i>
2682150 2683451 <i>The Lafleurs.</i>
2686050 2689017 <i>No one could know</i><br /><i>of my existence.</i>
2737217 2738384 Sara?
2748883 2749950 I, um...
2750917 2752117 I brought you something.
2763150 2764917 I remember how<br />you like to draw.
2771917 2772917 Here.
2781551 2782950 Thanks, Julien.
2787417 2792150 I also brought,<br />um, some books.
2792217 2796184 And your schoolwork<br />so you don't fall behind.
2797384 2799950 I could teach today's lesson<br />if you want.
2803684 2804783 Or not.
2807050 2808618 You're being so nice to me.
2809917 2812750 I was never very nice to you.
2812817 2814718 At least my friends<br />certainly weren't.
2817351 2818750 I guess<br />I always felt you were...
2820217 2821517 I don't know...
2822551 2823750 different.
2826384 2827783 Maybe you're wrong.
2829184 2830451 I doubt it.
2831217 2832251 I'm really smart.
2834417 2835517 Is that so?
2835584 2837317 I mean, I don't like<br />to brag, but...
2837384 2839017 Oh, no, of course not.
2851150 2853750 <i>Vivienne and</i><br /><i>Jean-Paul tried their best.</i>
2854750 2856317 <i>But as days became weeks,</i>
2856384 2858950 <i>there was still no word</i><br /><i>of my parents.</i>
2865883 2868783 <i>I could feel myself</i><br /><i>losing track of time.</i>
2870284 2872817 <i>Every day, the same.</i>
2872883 2875417 <i>There was only one thing</i><br /><i>I could look forward to.</i>
2876251 2878917 <i>My lessons with Julien.</i>
2878984 2882750 <i>So if A and B</i><br /><i>are distinct points,</i>
2882817 2888284 and AC plus CB equals AB,
2888351 2890417 then C must lie on...
2891150 2892217 AB.
2892718 2894150 Not bad, Blum.
2895484 2897084 Okay, so what we can get<br />from that information
2897150 2899184 is that CAB is<br />a right-angled triangle.
2899251 2900351 -And that information...<br />-Hey, what's this?
2900417 2901883 ...means that C... Oh.
2904651 2906618 I, um...
2906684 2908850 I thought you might<br />like to hang it up.
2908917 2910684 Make the place feel<br />a little more like a bedroom.
2911684 2912917 I love it.
2912984 2914484 Charlie Chaplin's my favorite.
2914551 2915618 I know.
2916050 2918017 You do?
2918084 2920184 Well, I mean, he's everyone's<br />favorite, right?
2920251 2921850 We should get back<br />to the lesson.
2921917 2922984 In a minute.
2923050 2924484 You promised me<br />a gossip report first.
2924551 2925783 Remember?
2926351 2927484 So I did.
2927551 2930251 Ah, let's see. Uh...
2930317 2931618 Well, you were right<br />about Jean-Marc.
2931684 2933251 He does have<br />a crush on Simone.
2933317 2934750 I heard him telling Luc<br />in biology.
2934817 2936850 I knew it. What else?
2936917 2938584 Let me think.
2938651 2940084 Yvette and Agnes<br />are still fighting
2940150 2941517 over the solo<br />in the spring recital.
2941584 2943517 -Of course.<br />-Of course.
2943584 2944917 Christophe got in trouble<br />for snoring
2944984 2946451 in <i>Madame</i> Lucienne's class.
2946517 2948217 Oh! And they finally<br />figured out who hid
2948284 2950251 that sardine<br />in <i>Monsieur</i> Gillot's desk.
2950317 2951417 -It was...<br />-Eugene.
2952718 2953850 You told me last week
2953917 2955750 he flunked Gillot's<br />surprise test.
2955817 2957417 Plus, his father works<br />in the cannery.
2958850 2959917 Impressive.
2959984 2961917 Simple maths.
2961984 2963351 Speaking of which...
2963417 2965117 Fine.
2965184 2967417 Okay, so if angle A<br />and angle B
2967484 2969517 are complementary
2969584 2971817 -and angle A is twice...<br />-Julien...
2971883 2973117 Thank you again for this.
2976517 2978284 I'm glad you like it.
2983718 2985251 <i>In town, the situation</i>
2985317 2987984 <i>was only growing worse.</i>
2988050 2990517 <i>Vincent and some other boys</i><br /><i>from the school</i>

2993817 2995984 <i>a local Nazi militia.</i>
2996050 2999651 <i>They were given guns</i><br /><i>and areas of town to patrol,</i>
2999718 3003084 <i>with instructions to report</i><br /><i>any suspicious behavior.</i>
3007184 3008317 <i>As resistance groups</i>
3008384 3009950 <i>continue to grow</i><br /><i>across France,</i>
3010017 3011484 <i>Germany warns</i><br /><i>that it will crush</i>
3011551 3013750 <i>any efforts to undermine</i><br /><i>the occupation.</i>
3016050 3017351 Julien,
3017417 3019251 if anyone asks for me,
3019984 3021284 you know what to say.
3052750 3054917 In the countryside,<br />we have the advantage.
3054984 3057284 We know the terrain,<br />the best roads to ambush.
3057351 3058684 My contact<br />in Toulouse says
3058750 3060451 they're shipping us<br />more ammunition.
3068551 3070817 But it'll take<br />a few more days.
3070883 3072517 No,<br />it has to be sooner.
3074251 3075817 The answer is no.
3078484 3079783 The underground<br />is only for those
3079850 3081451 willing to die for freedom.
3083850 3085684 That's not why<br />I need to see you.
3088317 3089684 Then what?
3093984 3095217 I need your help.
3096718 3098618 <i>Are you sure</i><br /><i>you can trust him?</i>
3098684 3099883 I'm positive.
3101150 3102651 So he said<br />it'll take a few weeks
3102718 3104817 for the woman he knows<br />to forge the identity papers.
3104883 3105950 But once we have those,
3106017 3107584 Georges will arrange<br />to take you
3107651 3110084 to an abbey in Le Moustier.
3110150 3111584 The nuns there<br />have been organizing
3111651 3112883 crossings into Switzerland.
3113417 3114451 Switzerland?
3116251 3118084 It's five days on foot<br />through the Alps,
3118150 3120618 but they've gotten a lot<br />of Jews out that way.
3120684 3122417 You wouldn't be alone.
3122484 3124517 Honestly, I feel safer here.
3125150 3126551 Oh, my sweet.
3127384 3129117 I'm not sure you are.
3135817 3137984 After her victory in Orleans,
3138050 3139618 Joan was able<br />to convince Charles VII...
3139684 3140684 <i>Managed</i><br /><i>to convince Charles VII</i>
3140750 3141783 to let her join the Army.
3141850 3144017 ...led by the Duke of Alencon.
3144084 3145684 ...led by the Duke of Alencon.
3145750 3146783 ...with the aim of recapturing
3146850 3147917 bridges along the Loire.
3147984 3148950 ...with the aim<br />of recapturing
3149017 3150117 the bridges along the Loire.
3150184 3151351 Joan then led a small...
3151417 3152883 Have you ever been there?
3153351 3154384 The Loire?
3155050 3156217 Switzerland.
3158217 3160084 I've never even been to Paris.
3166017 3167317 You know I'd go with you<br />if I thought
3167384 3168883 I wouldn't slow you down.
3172651 3174084 You've really never<br />been to Paris?
3175317 3176684 I've never even<br />left Dannevilliers
3176750 3178050 except to go to school.
3182417 3183417 What?
3187850 3189618 What?
3189684 3191217 Where are you going?
3192251 3193384 Sara?
3194417 3195484 Well?
3195551 3197417 How do you like Paris so far?
3200484 3201451 It's, um...
3203251 3204850 It's great.
3204917 3206517 Up ahead is<br />the Place de l'Etoile.
3206584 3207783 Do you see it?
3209050 3210584 Yes?
3211917 3214251 Julien. Here, take the wheel.
3217317 3218351 Come on.
3220651 3223251 Just use your imagination.
3223317 3225551 Just picture it<br />in your mind's eye...
3227384 3229517 the Arc de Triomphe.
3229584 3231251 It's a beautiful archway,
3231317 3232783 over 50 meters tall.
3233750 3235284 And there,
3235351 3236718 the Place de la Concorde.
3239750 3241084 Do you see<br />all those lovely cafes?
3249150 3250251 The flower shops?
3256184 3257217 Julien?
3259718 3261618 You really want me to say yes,<br />don't you?
3263517 3265150 It's only fun if you try.
3265217 3268150 The world of reality<br />has its limits.
3268217 3270484 The world of imagination<br />is boundless.
3270551 3273484 Keep trying.
3273551 3276783 We're driving down<br />a quaint little street
3276850 3278917 in the <i>sixieme arrondissement.</i>
3281551 3283850 And now we're turning...
3283917 3286351 ...along the banks<br />of the River Seine.
3288817 3290117 That's<br />the Saint-Michel bridge.
3290184 3291384 Just up there.
3297417 3299451 -Wait, I kind of see it now.<br />-You do?
3300551 3302017 -Really?<br />-Really.
3306384 3309017 And there, to the left,<br />there's Notre-Dame.
3314150 3315517 Isn't it incredible?
3316584 3317684 It really is.
3325317 3327317 Can I admit<br />something embarrassing?
3327384 3329451 I do this at least<br />three times a week.
3330883 3332783 You try spending every<br />single day alone in a barn.
3332850 3334184 Watch out for that lady!
3339050 3340917 Just for that, we're skipping<br />the Eiffel Tower.
3340984 3341984 No.
3342050 3344284 Please. Not the Eiffel Tower.
3345917 3347050 Fine.
3358883 3360117 <i>The next three weeks</i>
3360184 3361950 <i>passed very strangely.</i>
3363017 3364883 <i>Time seemed to crawl.</i>
3368417 3372584 <i>And yet, it also seemed</i><br /><i>to move very, very fast.</i>
3373718 3375584 <i>Almost too fast.</i>
3381750 3383451 See that leopard over there?
3383517 3385017 See how its spots<br />are all circular?
3385084 3386251 Yeah.
3386317 3388251 That's because<br />we're in East Africa.
3388317 3390017 In the south,<br />the spots would be square.
3392850 3395150 -You're making that up.<br />-I am not.
3395217 3397351 Dang.
3397417 3398783 Wait, Sara, Sara,<br />see over there?
3398850 3400618 See them? They're zebras.
3401484 3402783 Oh, they're beautiful.
3407883 3409117 What's up there?
3463017 3466950 I was anxious<br />about leaving for Switzerland.
3467017 3469718 I knew I would miss<br />those evenings with Julien.
3470584 3472351 <i>It was as if</i>
3472417 3476017 we had created<br />our own little world,
3476084 3479850 <i>even as the world outside</i><br /><i>grew darker and darker.</i>
3482984 3484284 Georges, it's me.
3485050 3486484 I'm here for the papers.
3500351 3501484 They were up to something.
3501551 3504184 What have we here?
3508251 3509551 Look at this.
3528684 3530317 We're gonna send a message.
3530384 3532684 This is what happens<br />to traitors.
3538584 3540017 Come on.
3544484 3545517 Hurry up!
3546850 3547950 Let's go. Let's go.
3564817 3566783 Whoo!
3573584 3575718 Whoo!
3595883 3597084 Look out!
3610584 3612517 I hate them.
3612584 3613850 I hate them so much.
3616384 3617883 I'm so sorry, Julien.
3618984 3619984 I just...
3620050 3621451 I just can't believe<br />he's gone.
3625684 3627417 Remember the bird<br />I told you about?
3629750 3632917 I drew her for you,<br />so you can meet her too.
3643484 3645217 She always comes<br />when I need her.
3646184 3647684 She brings me hope.

3698817 3700984 <i>My plan</i><br /><i>for being smuggled out</i>
3701050 3703184 <i>disappeared with Georges.</i>
3703251 3705783 <i>The attack on the cinema</i><br /><i>was only the beginning</i>
3705850 3708584 <i>of a much darker phase</i><br /><i>of the occupation.</i>

3710750 3712684 Attention!
3712750 3714750 <i>The Germans</i><br /><i>set up new headquarters</i>

3727184 3728484 <i>Nazis were everywhere,</i>

3731750 3734950 <i>There was no way I could</i><br /><i>reach Switzerland now.</i>

3749384 3752317 <i>But as summer came and went,</i>
3752384 3755883 <i>it was Julien's nightly visits</i><br /><i>that sustained me.</i>

3767150 3768384 Damn. Here.
3770551 3772817 <i>We had in common</i><br /><i>one crucial thing.</i>
3776750 3780451 We had both seen how much hate<br />people are capable of.
3784084 3787584 And how much courage<br />it took to be kind.
3789551 3792551 <i>Because when kindness</i><br /><i>can cost you your life,</i>

3826984 3829117 Special trip tonight,<br /><i>Mademoiselle</i> Blum.
3829184 3830451 How lovely.
3830517 3831883 Where to this time?
3834651 3835750 You'll see.
3840883 3842317 Close your eyes, okay?
3854917 3856783 How would you like<br />to visit New York tonight?
3857551 3858917 What?
3858984 3859950 Sure.
3860817 3861783 Okay, then.
3862750 3864451 Open your eyes.
3878584 3879618 Oh, Julien.
3880718 3882217 It's so beautiful.
3909551 3910950 Oh, look at the theaters.
3929184 3930517 What's that?
3930584 3932117 That's the<br />Empire State Building.
3946850 3947850 Tourteau.
3949551 3950584 Don't you ever bathe?
3950651 3952750 I thought crabs liked water.
3952817 3954050 <i>Monsieur</i> Beaumier...
3955651 3958017 May I have a word<br />in my office?
3958084 3960284 The teachers and I<br />have been talking,
3960351 3964217 and we've decided to place you<br />in advanced mathematics.
3965251 3967484 You will be<br />with the older children.
3967551 3969783 But I suspect they'll be<br />the ones trying to keep up.
3971017 3972050 Thank you, sir.
3973750 3975917 Thank you, Julien.
3975984 3978384 There's not much<br />brings me joy these days.
3984084 3985684 You can go back to class now.
4006750 4007850 Bye.
4007917 4008950 Bye.
4068883 4069917 It's early.
4069984 4071417 Is everything okay?
4073150 4075417 My sketchbook!
4075484 4077084 I was in Pastor Luc's<br />and I saw it on the shelf.
4077150 4078150 Thank you!
4092484 4093917 I was so stupid back then.
4100251 4101451 I'm just telling you.
4102651 4104017 -What...<br />-Shh!
4106150 4107317 Go back up and hide.
4107384 4109217 And don't come out<br />no matter what. Go, quick.
4121817 4122883 He's in there.
4126984 4128084 Tourteau?
4131584 4132950 Hey, Tourteau.
4136017 4137351 What's going on, Tourteau?
4140651 4142184 What are you...<br />What are you doing here?
4150684 4152184 Uh, I was just working<br />on my father's car.
4153817 4155584 I saw you sneaking out<br />of Pastor Luc's office
4155651 4157050 with something.
4158684 4160584 What?
4160651 4162684 Don't play dumb<br />with us, cripple.
4162750 4164417 I left my book there. So what?
4164484 4165783 -Yeah, bullshit.<br />-I swear.
4165850 4167451 Please, it's in my house.<br />I can show you right now.
4167517 4168651 -They asked me to fix it.<br />-You're a bad liar.
4168718 4170084 Please. No.
4183551 4184850 What'd you steal<br />from Pastor Luc?
4184917 4187184 Nothing. I just left my book.
4188417 4190084 You think you're smarter<br />than everyone, don't you?
4190817 4191817 No.
4191883 4192950 You're pathetic,<br />you know that?
4194217 4195451 Weak, deformed, useless.
4195517 4197017 Do you know what Nazis do<br />with people like you?
4197817 4198917 Do you?
4202251 4204517 They exterminate them<br />like Jews.
4207150 4209684 I should do<br />the human race a favor...
4209750 4211050 and put you out<br />of your misery right now.
4217517 4218817 All right, he's learned<br />his lesson, Vincent.
4218883 4220084 Shut your mouth! He hasn't!

4237584 4238850 What did you say?

4250050 4251417 The hell is that?
4251484 4253584 They're bats!<br />Let's get out of here!
4273484 4274517 It's okay, you're okay.
4274584 4276084 Go back to the loft.
4276150 4277351 -They could come back soon.<br />-It's okay.
4277417 4280417 -They've gone. It's okay.<br />-I said, go to the loft!
4280484 4283484 -What?<br />-What are you, stupid? Go!
4283551 4285950 -I just wanted...<br />-I don't care what you want.
4286017 4289117 It's not always about you.
4289184 4291351 You know what happens<br />if they find you here?
4291417 4294684 Do you?<br />They'll arrest my parents.
4294750 4297117 They'll execute them!<br />Do you understand?
4297184 4299417 -I didn't think...<br />-Yeah, of course you didn't.
4299484 4302184 All you think about<br />is yourself.
4302251 4304184 You're still<br />the same spoiled brat
4304251 4306117 that sat next to me<br />for five years
4306184 4307783 and didn't even know my name.
4308917 4310050 Please.
4310750 4313184 Please. I'm sorry.
4313651 4314718 Please.
4317084 4318084 Julien.
4325484 4329451 Just... Just go back<br />to the loft, Sara. Please.
4387050 4388551 It's been days<br />since he's come by.
4392017 4394050 He just needs<br />more time to heal.
4394917 4396284 He got so mad at me.
4397251 4399850 He was just as mad at himself.
4399917 4403084 The truth is, he should never<br />have taken your sketchbook.
4403150 4405117 It was too risky<br />for all of us.
4407017 4408251 He did it for me.
4411417 4412750 Well, in dark times,
4414551 4417917 those small things<br />remind us of our humanity.

4443484 4445217 Go around<br />the middle,
4446017 4448618 through, up, and over.
4449484 4451017 Through, around...
4476317 4477351 You.
4482551 4484417 -Can we talk about...<br />-I'd rather not.
4485150 4486384 Okay.
4492551 4493783 I hate...
4495551 4497184 I hate that<br />you saw me like that.
4498050 4499084 Like what?
4499150 4500351 Like some weakling.
4501817 4503317 A helpless, pathetic weakling.
4503384 4504883 -Julien...<br />-I know it's hard to believe,
4504950 4506417 but I used to run fast.
4508517 4509984 Before I got polio,<br />I was the fastest kid
4510050 4511084 in my whole class.
4515651 4516950 And I still remember<br />what it felt like
4517017 4518117 to run like that.
4519317 4521017 -To be strong.<br />-You are strong.
4521084 4522684 You are.
4523517 4524684 And brave.
4526050 4527651 You're the bravest person<br />I've ever met.
4527718 4529251 Why? 'Cause I walk<br />with a crutch?
4531317 4532618 A crutch doesn't<br />make me brave,
4532684 4533984 it makes me walk.
4534050 4535684 That's not what I meant.
4535750 4537417 Could you stop talking,<br />please?
4546584 4548050 I thought about what you said.
4549517 4550950 -How I'm selfish.<br />-I was just upset.
4551017 4552551 -I didn't mean it.<br />-It's true.
4555917 4557950 The truth is, had you been<br />the one that needed saving,
4558017 4559584 I probably wouldn't<br />have done it.
4561517 4563384 -You don't know that.<br />-No, I do.
4567351 4568517 And I'm sorry.
4574417 4576651 But you did try<br />to save me, though.
4576718 4578584 I would have<br />gotten us both killed.
4578651 4579750 Probably.
4582317 4583750 Still, it was brave of you.
4586718 4589684 -Take a compliment.<br />-Fine.
4589750 4591584 -Thank you.<br />-There we go.
4591651 4593551 Um, should we get back<br />to the game now?
4594184 4595184 Okay.
4598850 4600850 Can I just say one more thing?
4601584 4602684 What?
4604917 4605950 Belote.
4608150 4610517 Look who finally won a hand.
4610584 4612584 I wouldn't get too used to it.

5735217 5737284 The Beaumiers were<br />hiding me in their barn.
5737351 5740117 They thought you were<br />informants for the Nazis.
5740184 5742684 Sara, the Lafleurs<br />have been hiding us

5781483 5782917 They put him in a truck
5782984 5784618 along with some patients<br />from the hospital.
5785883 5786950 They're heading<br />to a prison camp
5787017 5788618 -in the mountains.<br />-Oh!
5788684 5789917 He can still be saved...
5790651 5791750 for the right money.
5792917 5794351 That poor boy.
5795551 5797917 Bernstein,<br />we haven't got much time.
5797984 5799484 He's waiting downstairs.
5799551 5802618 We'll look after the girl<br />till the Beaumiers return.
5803351 5804584 Good luck, old friend.

5851351 5853150 How much money do you need?
5853217 5855417 So much more than we have.

6236584 6237917 Julien!
6237984 6239850 <i>...once</i><br /><i>the soldiers had moved on.</i>
6239917 6242850 <i>They searched for Julien</i><br /><i>all through the night</i>
6242917 6244783 <i>and for many days</i><br /><i>that followed.</i>
6245251 6246750 Julien!
6246817 6248451 <i>They continued</i><br /><i>to cling to the hope</i>
6248517 6250750 <i>that perhaps</i><br /><i>Julien had gotten away.</i>
6250817 6252084 Julien?
6252150 6254551 <i>But deep down,</i><br /><i>they knew better.</i>
6263718 6267384 <i>Still, somehow, they put aside</i><br /><i>their immeasurable sorrow</i>
6268217 6269783 <i>to take care of me.</i>
6272017 6274618 <i>I stayed with them</i><br /><i>through the end of the war.</i>
6274684 6275917 <i>Hidden, of course.</i>
6279917 6281284 <i>But not in the barn.</i>
6284050 6286783 <i>I could never set foot</i><br /><i>in there again.</i>
6292017 6293351 <i>The final capitulation</i>
6293417 6295150 <i>of the Nazi state...</i>
6295217 6296417 <i>In August,</i>
6296484 6299850 <i>the Nazi occupation</i><br /><i>finally ended.</i>
6299917 6302783 <i>The Germans were</i><br /><i>driven out of France.</i>
6302850 6304351 <i>And when</i><br /><i>the Allied troops gathered</i>
6304417 6305651 <i>at the Arc de Triomphe,</i>
6305718 6308584 <i>you could hear</i><br /><i>the whole world cheer.</i>
6316817 6319484 <i>I continued to live</i><br /><i>with the Beaumiers,</i>
6319551 6321217 <i>who'd become like family.</i>
6323251 6325251 <i>I was glad</i><br /><i>to be back at school.</i>
6326517 6328950 <i>But nothing was the same.</i>
6331217 6334351 <i>The weeks passed in a fog.</i>
6334417 6337783 <i>I couldn't stop thinking about</i><br /><i>all that had happened to me.</i>
6339883 6341883 <i>And to Julien.</i>
6352718 6355618 <i>Then one day</i><br /><i>in early November...</i>
6359017 6360050 <i>It was Papa.</i>
6361050 6362251 <i>He was back.</i>
6379817 6382351 <i>He said he was</i><br /><i>still looking for</i> maman.
6382417 6385117 <i>That he and another doctor</i><br /><i>had evaded the roundup</i>
6385184 6386451 <i>by hiding in the morgue.</i>
6388917 6391451 <i>I introduced him</i><br /><i>to the Beaumiers,</i>
6391517 6393883 <i>who he could not</i><br /><i>stop thanking.</i>
6396050 6398084 <i>That night,</i><br /><i>Papa took me aside.</i>
6399817 6402451 <i>Somehow, I knew</i><br /><i>it was about</i> maman.
6403484 6404817 Sara...
6404883 6406317 <i>He had tried</i><br /><i>to keep the truth from me,</i>
6406384 6407917 <i>but he realized he could not.</i>
6409684 6411783 <i>He explained that on the day</i><br /><i>of the roundup...</i>
6411849 6412950 You!
6413017 6414150 ...maman<br /><i>had been arrested.</i>
6414217 6416084 <i>Stop!</i><br /><i>Stop right there!</i>
6416150 6418584 <i>She was put</i><br /><i>on a train to Drancy.</i>
6420917 6422150 <i>And from there,</i>
6422217 6425684 <i>sent to the concentration camp</i><br /><i>in Auschwitz.</i>
6425750 6429084 <i>He didn't know how long</i><br /><i>she was kept there.</i>
6429150 6432551 <i>Only that this is where</i><br /><i>she was put to death.</i>
6433883 6437750 <i>I think a part of me knew</i><br /><i>she hadn't survived.</i>
6437817 6441484 <i>In the white bird, I had</i><br /><i>always felt her spirit,</i>
6441551 6444084 <i>gifting me hope</i><br /><i>when I had none.</i>
6446184 6448150 <i>Papa and I stayed</i><br /><i>with the Beaumiers</i>
6448217 6449451 <i>for a short while,</i>
6449517 6452417 <i>until he found work</i><br /><i>at a hospital in Paris,</i>
6452484 6454783 <i>the city that would become</i><br /><i>my new home.</i>
6455850 6458017 You will always have<br />a mother in me.
6468684 6469883 I love you.
6491017 6493451 <i>I came back</i><br /><i>to visit the Beaumiers often.</i>
6494317 6495551 <i>Throughout my life.</i>
6497684 6499684 <i>And when I married</i><br /><i>your grandfather,</i>
6500684 6503050 <i>they, along with my papa,</i>
6504517 6506084 <i>walked me down the aisle.</i>
6526551 6527984 Mazel tov!
6537251 6539251 <i>You forget</i><br /><i>many things in life.</i>
6541651 6543917 <i>But you never forget kindness.</i>
6545817 6547584 <i>Like love...</i>
6549317 6551117 <i>it stays with you forever.</i>
6563050 6566718 And I suppose that, <i>mon cher,</i><br />is the end of my story.
6573050 6574384 Did I upset you?
6577551 6579451 Yeah, but in a good way.
6582384 6585184 And do you understand<br />why I needed to tell you
6585251 6587284 this story now, Julian?
6613517 6614517 Oh.
6615417 6616917 -It's okay, I've got it.<br />-Ah!
6616984 6618517 <i>Merci, mon cher.</i>
6668883 6670684 <i>You know her</i>
6670750 6674017 <i>for her incredibly influential</i><br /><i>body of work</i>
6674084 6676284 <i>found in museums</i><br /><i>all over the world.</i>
6695317 6696850 <i>But today,</i>
6696917 6700451 <i>it is our great honor</i><br /><i>to celebrate her life's work,</i>
6700517 6704284 <i>as part of our series devoted</i><br /><i>to activism in the arts.</i>
6704351 6705917 <i>Will you please join me</i><br /><i>in welcoming</i>
6706584 6707718 <i>the one and only</i>
6708517 6709684 <i>Sara Blum.</i>
6712850 6714384 Have a nice day.<br />Thank you for coming.
6717351 6718917 <i>Bonjour. Merci.</i>
6723184 6724684 <i>Bonjour, mes amis.</i>
6724750 6728783 <i>It is my privilege</i><br /><i>to be with you today.</i>
6728850 6731351 <i>You know, I have made</i><br /><i>speeches like this before.</i>
6731417 6733417 <i>I've told versions</i><br /><i>of my story.</i>
6734217 6735618 <i>But for most of my life,</i>
6735684 6739618 <i>I have much preferred</i><br /><i>to let my art speak for me.</i>
6739684 6741551 <i>I think that is why</i><br /><i>I became an artist.</i>
6743850 6746117 <i>To fly away from the pain</i><br /><i>that I have known.</i>
6747584 6748618 <i>But I was talking</i>
6748684 6750517 <i>with my young grandson</i><br /><i>last night,</i>
6750584 6752017 <i>and I realized something.</i>
6752917 6753950 <i>I realized</i>
6755050 6757917 <i>I do not want</i><br /><i>to fly away anymore.</i>
6760050 6761451 <i>You see,</i><br /><i>my life was not normal.</i>
6764484 6765917 <i>Hatred is not normal.</i>
6767184 6768984 <i>Cruelty is not normal.</i>
6769050 6770050 My bad.
6771217 6773317 <i>Love is normal.</i>
6773384 6774950 <i>Kindness is normal.</i>
6777384 6779351 <i>But simply knowing this</i><br /><i>is not enough.</i>
6780251 6781850 <i>It must be shared.</i>
6782718 6784384 <i>It must be practiced.</i>
6794917 6795950 Excuse me.
6797584 6798618 Hi. Uh...
6800050 6802017 I just wanted to say<br />I'm sorry about yesterday.
6802883 6805084 I was kind of a jerk to you.
6805150 6807451 Kind of. Whatever. It's cool.
6809584 6811750 -My name's Julian, by the way.<br />-I'm Rahmiya.
6811817 6813150 <i>Sometimes</i><br /><i>the smallest gestures...</i>
6813217 6814517 Join our club.
6814584 6816850 <i>...can lead</i><br /><i>to the greatest change.</i>
6816917 6819984 So, you wanna come<br />to D.C. with our club?
6820050 6821117 Uh, yeah.
6821584 6823084 Yeah.
6823150 6826251 <i>A very wise man,</i><br /><i>Martin Luther King, once said,</i>
6826317 6829117 <i>"Darkness cannot drive out</i><br /><i>darkness.</i>
6829184 6831417 <i>"Only the light can do that."</i>
6832718 6835517 <i>Now, this is</i><br /><i>what my father believed.</i>
6835584 6840150 <i>We must, all of us, use</i><br /><i>the light within ourselves</i>
6840217 6843584 <i>to stop the injustices</i><br /><i>of today.</i>
6843651 6845451 <i>For only then</i><br /><i>can we be certain</i>
6845517 6849883 <i>that the darkness of the past</i><br /><i>will never be repeated.</i>
6851184 6852417 <i>And that those...</i>
6858351 6862117 <i>And that those who gave</i><br /><i>their lives to defy it</i>
6863384 6865584 <i>did so</i><br /><i>for a brighter tomorrow.</i>
