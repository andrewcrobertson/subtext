182249 184986 It's a talent.<br />You have to be born with it.
185019 187421 You have to have<br />a certain gene.

321088 322123 You're my attorney.
322156 323490 ROY: But you don't call him<br />Fat Tony
323524 324892 because you might end up

341576 343978 What is your business, Donald?

351819 354822 It sounds like your father<br />is a little tangled up.
354856 356991 It looks like he could use<br />a good lawyer.
357024 358626 -(ALL LAUGHING)<br />-Well...
358659 359961 ROY: But tell us about it.
359994 363496 Right now, the government<br />and the NAACP are suing us.
363531 365600 They're saying<br />our apartments are segregated.
365633 366868 This is America. You can rent
366901 368536 to whoever the hell<br />you goddamn want.
368569 370805 But our lawyer wants us to pay<br />a huge fine to settle. We can't.
370838 372640 It's gonna bankrupt us<br />and ruin the company.
372673 374342 ROY: So, you tell the feds<br />to fuck themselves!
374374 376577 -MAN: Damn straight!<br />-File a lawsuit.
376611 379247 Always file a lawsuit.<br />Fight 'em in court.

381148 383784 (CHUCKLES) Wow, I guess...
384952 387321 might have to get us<br />a new lawyer.
387355 388923 Of course, it helps if Nixon
388956 391424 and the Attorney General<br />are your pals.
392392 394795 Well, are you available?<br />I mean...

471471 472707 Yeah.
473341 474375 Yeah.
474408 475977 And if I count it<br />and it's not there,
476010 477477 what am I supposed to do?

480014 481749 That's all. And I had to go<br />to hospital.

579413 580648 He's a crook.
580681 582116 He's been indicted three times.
582149 584018 He's never been convicted,<br />by the way.
584051 585786 The man's a genius.<br />He ran McCarthy's show
585820 586987 when he was basically<br />a teenager,
587021 588589 and he's pals with Nixon<br />himself. He's vicious.

596897 599600 Just meet with him to discuss,<br />that's all.

663430 665466 I would spend the whole time<br />counting the planes,
665499 668269 taking off from Iowa.<br />I was like that the whole time.
669837 672173 He used to make me<br />pick the nails off the floor
672206 674408 -to save money.<br />-He still does that, Freddy.
675409 676578 Even now.
676611 677912 He would say to me,<br />"You keep an eye,
677945 680214 "anybody takes too long<br />on their smoke break,
680247 682551 "you tell me about it,"<br />and he would give me a quarter
682584 685219 for every guy that I tattled on.

2454588 2458225 Well, gentlemen, this is<br />a monumental opportunity.
2458259 2459527 The Grand Central Area
2459560 2461729 is one of the most important<br />locations in the city.
2461762 2464665 The Chrysler Building is there.<br />The Pan Am Building is there.
2464699 2466100 The whole area is monumental,
2466133 2469003 and the key to the whole area<br />is the old Commodore Hotel,
2469036 2470671 which is just sitting there,<br />boarded up,
2470705 2472640 and waiting to be transformed.
2472673 2474208 I wanna make it something<br />very special.
2474241 2477678 I wanna build an incredible,<br />glorious, glamorous hotel
2477712 2479647 that's gonna put people to work<br />in the construction trades,
2479680 2480881 it's gonna save hotel jobs.
2480915 2482550 It's been a brutal year<br />for New York.
2482583 2485453 We're one step away<br />from depression.
2485485 2487755 And we have to bring it back.
2487788 2489123 Thank you.
2489156 2491525 Commodore Hotel is a great idea,
2491559 2494328 but not only is it in shambles,
2494362 2496664 but everything around it,<br />as well.
2496697 2499767 Everything on that city block
2499800 2503804 -is going to need to be rebuilt.<br />-DONALD: I'd love to do that.
2503838 2506207 I think "destination"<br />is a great word.
2506240 2508309 You know, it brings<br />people to... to Manhattan.
2508342 2510878 A lot of Europeans are waiting<br />to come back to the city.
2511679 2514682 Mr. Pritzker, any questions?
2517018 2517852 Just one.
2517885 2519787 Between the unions and taxes,
2521122 2522490 how will you make money?
2523958 2525226 Um...
2525259 2528229 Well, that's a... That's<br />a really interesting question.
2528262 2529764 Um...
2529797 2531265 Well, there won't be<br />any taxes, Jay,
2531298 2535736 because we're gonna get<br />a tax abatement from the mayor,
2535770 2538839 who is begging developers<br />to build, okay?
2538873 2540908 And if I tell him that the CEO<br />of Hyatt is committing,
2540941 2543277 then I can get him<br />to waive the property taxes.
2544712 2545813 The city's broke,<br />and you're saying
2545846 2548182 they're gonna forego taxes?
2548215 2550551 I'm saying I got<br />the city planning commission

2675976 2678012 Now, my client, Mr. Trump,
2678045 2681849 is trying to give this city<br />a much-needed blood infusion
2681882 2684653 and resuscitate the corpse<br />of New York City,

2703538 2706006 Mayor Beame<br />and the rest of City Hall

2825025 2826093 <i>Now, they're going through</i><br /><i>the books.</i>

2848315 2850918 There's a lot of strong<br />feelings on both sides.
2852019 2853287 ROY: You have to be willing
2853320 2856524 to exploit your enemies<br />and instill fear.
2858025 2861929 Our responsibility is to do<br />what's best for New York.
2861962 2864365 The truth is,<br />the city needs investment.
2864398 2867769 Therefore, we grant approval<br />for Mr. Trump's tax abatement.
2867802 2871305 -(CROWD CLAMORING)<br />-WOMAN: Outrageous!
2871338 2872873 MICHAEL: This is<br />a final decision!
2872906 2874542 This is corruption!
2876210 2879113 I will ask you to maintain<br />order in this house!

2892727 2894194 Donald, wake up!
2895429 2897131 You know, when I tried<br />the Rosenbergs,
2898533 2900401 I wanted so badly
2900434 2904606 to see those pinko kikes fry<br />for what they did.
2904639 2907241 Now, Judge Kaufman<br />had no trouble
2907274 2908942 sending Julius to the chair,
2908976 2912379 but Ethel was a mother<br />with young kids.
2912413 2913981 They wanted her to live,
2914014 2917484 as if that's some sort of<br />special immunity
2917519 2919286 for betraying your country.
2919888 2921221 So, during the trial,
2921255 2923457 I'd slip out at lunch<br />to a phone booth
2923490 2925325 and call Kaufman.
2925359 2927762 You know, technically,<br />ex parte conversations,

3391993 3393094 We're gonna get married.
3394562 3395963 You're gonna get married?
3396664 3398299 You're gonna get married?

3401335 3402536 Are you out of<br />your goddamn mind?
3402570 3403838 Well, I'm in love...
3403871 3405539 Donald, let me put it<br />to you this way.
3405573 3409442 Would you sign a contract<br />giving away half your assets?
3409476 3411812 -What? A contract?<br />-That's what a marriage is,
3411846 3413714 it's a contract<br />between two parties.
3413748 3416449 My parents have been married<br />in 40 years, Roy,
3416483 3418586 I don't know what...<br />nobody had a contract.
3418619 3422489 Listen, the matrimonial game<br />is a zero sum game.
3422523 3425059 Trust me, I almost married<br />Barbara Walters,
3425092 3426527 and then I wised up.
3429830 3430665 Right.

3483751 3485920 Ah, we... we don't<br />have to do that.
3485953 3489523 Well, legally, a gift doesn't<br />constitute marital property.

3500067 3501635 Well, we don't have to...<br />just keep the gifts.
3501669 3502903 -IVANA: Forget it.<br />-It's fine.

3513781 3515649 Look, forget the gift clause,<br />all right?

3545112 3546580 -I have a great family.<br />-Oh, my God!
3546614 3548182 I'm gonna be the number one<br />builder in New York.

3970872 3972039 You'll never forget me<br />after this
3972072 3974174 because I won't forget<br />what you just did.
3974208 3976210 Trump Tower will be built<br />with or without you.
3976243 3977978 -(DOOR OPENS)<br />-Okay.
3978011 3979814 You're about to be<br />sued, Mr. Mayor.
3979848 3981148 (SIGHS)
3986788 3987988 (IVANA CHUCKLES)
3989156 3992794 I think we should attend<br />the Park Ball next month.
3992827 3994495 The tables are $10,000
3994529 3996764 and we get<br />to the House Committee.
3996798 3998533 I don't know. Why would I<br />give money to those snobs?
3998566 4000200 It's gonna make<br />the park more beautiful.
4000234 4001703 It's ridiculous, okay?
4001736 4003136 Trees don't need money<br />to grow.
4003170 4005205 The city really should let<br />developers build over the park
4005239 4006741 because it's prime real estate.
4006774 4009577 It's like, trying to be friends<br />with these Park Avenue phonies.
4009611 4010578 They don't care about you.
4010612 4012079 I mean, the way you're posing<br />for the cameras,
4012112 4014181 it's like you're...<br />you're begging for attention.
4014214 4016149 Donald, I'm posing<br />because they want to shoot me.
4016183 4017719 Don't get jealous.<br />Don't get jealous.
4017752 4018953 I'm not jealous, okay?
4018987 4020120 -You're getting jealous.<br />-They're jealous of me.
4020153 4022055 -Getting a little jealous.<br />-No, no, no.
4022089 4024191 They're jealous of me, Ivana,<br />because nobody
4024224 4025560 -has tried on any scale...<br />-Because you're with me.
4025593 4026995 ...of what I'm trying<br />to do in the city.
4027027 4029096 No one's built<br />what I've built at my age.
4029129 4031298 -All right?<br />-I cannot sit.
4032032 4033400 It's just... it's Koch, okay?
4033433 4035837 He's being a piece of work,<br />and that's the problem.
4035870 4037070 He's not gonna budge.
4037104 4038640 All right, here, let me<br />help you with the shoes.
4039473 4041208 He just wants<br />a bit more money.
4041241 4043110 I gave him $50,000.
4043143 4045580 -(BABY CRYING)<br />-What does Roy say?
4045613 4047481 Roy is useless.<br />What do you mean,<br />"what did he say?"
4047515 4050685 By the way, the FBI<br />raided his house this morning.
4050718 4052554 He owes them seven million<br />dollars in taxes.
4052587 4054087 But it doesn't matter.<br />I don't need Roy.
4054121 4055657 I don't need anybody.<br />I'm gonna go on television
4055690 4058091 and tell the people<br />what a loser Koch is, okay?
4058125 4059426 And that he's a one line artist
4059459 4061729 that doesn't care about<br />anything but looking good.
4061763 4062730 What's the matter with him?
4062764 4064566 What's the matter with him?<br />Why you crying?
4064599 4065833 Don Junior, Come here.
4065867 4067301 Come here. Come here.
4067334 4069102 Come here. Look at me.<br />Look at me.
4069136 4071204 Look at me.<br />You see, everything's okay.
4071238 4072574 Don Junior, everything's okay.
4072607 4074509 Look over there.<br />You see New York City?
4074542 4075375 That's your city.
4075409 4077377 Listen, you're<br />a New York City kid.
4077411 4079614 Do you see right there?<br />Yes, that one. That one.
4079647 4081415 Is that one you're favorite?<br />Which one's your favorite?
4081448 4083751 -I think he's just tired.<br />-(BABY CRYING)
4083785 4086020 Don... It's okay.
4086054 4087387 I guess<br />I'm terrible with babies.
4087421 4089122 I don't know<br />what you want me to say.
4089156 4091391 Who is that? Freddy?
4091425 4093427 FREDDY: Hey, will you<br />tell this guy who I am?
4093460 4095128 -He knows.<br />-I'm his brother.
4095162 4097230 When? When, uh...<br />When did you get into town?
4098198 4099534 Just a couple of days ago.
4099567 4101435 I've been calling you,<br />but you didn't return my calls.
4101468 4103303 Hmm. You don't look too good.
4103337 4105673 -Yeah.<br />-Are you sick?
4105707 4107976 I brought this for Don Jr.
4108009 4109109 Maybe I can go give it to him.
4109142 4110578 That's okay. That's okay.
4110612 4113548 Listen, I'll give it to him,<br />all right? I'll give it to him.
4113581 4115449 What's going on?<br />I didn't know you're in town.
4115482 4117552 Look, Donald, I know...<br />I know...
4117585 4121623 You know, I know I'm a loser<br />and all that, but...
4121656 4124592 You know, my...<br />my grip's kind of...
4124626 4128395 kind of slipping a little bit,<br />you know, and...
4128428 4130932 It... it's getting kind of...
4130965 4134301 you know, things are getting<br />a little bit scary and...
4134334 4137005 -DONALD: Hmm.<br />-Ah... You know I want to...
4137038 4139107 I want to...<br />I want to change...
4139139 4140975 DONALD: Mm-hmm.
4141009 4143210 Just... just take it<br />easy, okay?
4143243 4144946 It's gonna be all right.<br />We're gonna figure this out.
4144979 4146179 I'll help you, all right?
4146213 4148616 -FREDDY: Yeah.<br />-Okay.
4148650 4150785 That's all right, buddy.<br />We're gonna figure this out.
4152053 4153955 -All right? Don't worry.<br />-IVANA: Freddy?
4153988 4156591 -How are you?<br />-Ivana. Hi.
4156624 4157558 He got a toy for...
4157592 4159027 I didn't know<br />you were in the city.
4159060 4160828 Should I make up<br />the guest room?
4160862 4161829 Yeah.
4161863 4165232 Uh, well, I mean, you know,<br />we also have...
4165265 4167200 didn't you say your family's<br />coming in town, right?
4167234 4169403 You know, why don't you stay<br />at a hotel tonight?
4169436 4170972 Here. Get a hotel<br />for the one night,
4171005 4172674 for... for tonight.
4172707 4174609 And then, uh,<br />let's talk tomorrow.
4174642 4176176 You know,<br />we'll sort something out.
4176209 4177411 All right?
4179013 4181616 Just... just for tonight.<br />All right?
4181649 4183483 Come on, Freddy, don't<br />put this on me, all right?
4183518 4184919 I mean, you think<br />it's easy for me
4184952 4186420 to watch you waste your life?
4195195 4196396 Poor Freddy
4201268 4203403 WOMAN: <i>Donald Trump's biggest</i><br /><i>accomplishment to date</i>
4203437 4205439 <i>is the Grand Hyatt.</i>
4205472 4208042 <i>Now an even more ambitious</i><br /><i>plan is in the works.</i>
4208076 4209577 <i>A bold new skyscraper</i>
4209610 4211713 <i>at prime</i><br /><i>Fifth Avenue location,</i>
4211746 4214347 <i>neighboring the famous</i><br /><i>Tiffany's store.</i>
4214381 4215616 Taller what...<br />it could have been taller.
4215650 4217350 It could have been<br />a lot taller actually.
4217384 4220253 I wanted to build<br />taller than the Twin Towers.
4220287 4221923 I may still do that<br />I don't know.
4221956 4223825 -We're still building, so.<br />-We're gonna build...
4223858 4224859 We're gonna do taller,
4224892 4226561 but it's not gonna be<br />as beautiful as this one.
4226594 4228563 It's most important<br />what is it inside
4228596 4229931 and not what's<br />gonna be outside.
4229964 4232265 WOMAN: <i>Trump's vision</i><br /><i>is shared by his wife, Ivana,</i>
4232299 4234869 <i>a former fashion model</i><br /><i>turned interior designer</i>
4234902 4236738 Like come over here.
4236771 4238740 The floor... the floor is<br />gonna be pink marble.
4238773 4239741 Gonna be pink marble,
4239774 4242110 I'm gonna bring<br />a whole mountain from Italy.
4242143 4243845 Ivana's gonna<br />design the floors.
4243878 4245046 I'm gonna design the ceilings.
4245079 4248348 WOMAN: <i>But it's his feud</i><br /><i>with outspoken Mayor Ed Koch,</i>
4248381 4250985 <i>that may make him</i><br /><i>best known to New Yorkers.</i>
4251018 4252452 Well, he's an one line artist.
4252486 4254188 Uh, I mean, you know...
4254222 4255656 Uh, when it comes<br />to running the city,
4255690 4257091 <i>he's about as bad</i><br /><i>as anybody I've seen.</i>
4257125 4260528 <i>I would say he's got no talent</i><br /><i>and only moderate intelligence.</i>
4262362 4264198 Is this an appropriate way
4264232 4265733 to talk about<br />an elected official?
4265767 4268435 Ed Koch has been<br />a disaster for New York,
4268468 4270638 and he's... he's done<br />a lousy job as the mayor.
4270671 4272707 Anybody that<br />lives in New York knows it,
4272740 4274509 and people understand that<br />in order to be successful,
4274542 4276177 you have to have<br />a certain instinct to win.
4276210 4278411 Donald, you're a mover.
4278445 4280214 You are a doer.
4280248 4282216 If you could make<br />America perfect,
4282250 4283684 how would you do it?
4283718 4286486 Well, I think that<br />America is a country that
4286521 4289157 has tremendous,<br />tremendous potential.
4289190 4290357 I think that much<br />like the mind,
4290390 4291491 I think America is using
4291526 4293227 very, very little<br />of its potential.
4293261 4295096 I really feel that.<br />But I also feel that
4295129 4296664 it's a country that gets
4296697 4299200 no respect<br />from other countries.
4299233 4301401 None, zero.
4301434 4305173 And... and that's a shame,<br />isn't it?
4305206 4307241 Tell me this.<br />What if you lost
4307275 4309342 your fortune today,<br />what would you do?
4309376 4310711 Well, then maybe<br />I'll run for president.
4310745 4313346 -I don't know.<br />-Well, you'd do very well.
4313380 4314882 Well, I'm only kidding,<br />obviously,
4314916 4317084 when I say that.<br />I'm just being facetious.
4317118 4318619 No, it's a good answer.

4369436 4371404 Atlantic City<br />has peaked, Donald.
4371438 4373274 Once other states<br />legalize gaming,
4373307 4374742 you'll have competition<br />lining up.
4374775 4376210 Plus, you don't know<br />the first thing

4381282 4383217 It's done. Basically finished.
4383251 4384518 I think<br />your balls are swelling
4384552 4386453 -a little too much.<br />-It's gonna be fine, Roy.
4386486 4389422 You gotta... You gotta think<br />about the future.

4473574 4477311 I don't think very much<br />about midget boxing, Donald.
4477345 4478879 When I do Trump Tower,<br />people love it.
4478913 4481115 Everything I do<br />is turning to gold, all right?
4481148 4482083 Everything's gonna work out.
4482116 4484185 ROY: But this is...<br />this is not a gold mine.

4504438 4506240 like my attorney<br />and less like my dad

4522189 4523758 Send me the bill.

5385353 5387255 DONALD: The budget,<br />$1 billion.
5387288 5389023 -ROGER: Wow!<br />-You gotta come stay.
5389056 5390324 Very Eastern flair, huh?
5390358 5392260 -This is something.<br />-Well, it is. It is.
5392293 5393694 -(KNOCK AT DOOR)<br />-Yes.
5393728 5395462 I've got Roy on the phone.
5395495 5396898 Tell him I'll call him back.
5396931 5398465 Hey, listen. Reagan's making<br />this country so fucking rich,
5398498 5399533 you can't lose.
5399567 5400902 -Well...<br />-I'm telling you, Donald.
5400935 5402637 He stands for all the things<br />you care about.
5402670 5404906 Lower taxes,<br />cutting regulations.
5405907 5406908 A powerful military.
5406941 5408643 -Oh, I like that.<br />-Like it used to be, right?
5408676 5410111 -Yes. We need that.<br />-We do.
5410144 5411879 -We need that.<br />-Hey. In fact,
5411913 5413480 we have a brand new<br />campaign slogan.
5413514 5414615 Listen to this.
5414649 5418686 "Let's make America<br />great again."
5419320 5420588 Wow.
5422123 5423124 Hmm.
5423791 5425492 Well, I like the "again" part,
5425526 5426794 you know,<br />points to a great past.
5426827 5429096 It does.<br />Not many people see that?
5429130 5431532 Well, I do, okay?<br />Because I love this country.
5431565 5434268 And I'm tired of seeing<br />this country getting ripped off
5434302 5435403 like you wouldn't believe.
5435435 5437204 It's losing<br />$200 billion a year, Roger.
5437238 5438372 -ROGER: Yeah.<br />-200 billion.
5438406 5439674 Does Reagan know that?
5439707 5441275 Because all of these<br />oil sheikhs,
5441309 5442576 and the Japs,<br />and the welfare queens,
5442610 5444211 and the union thugs<br />are sucking us dry.
5444245 5445478 -You're right.<br />-It's time to get smart.
5445513 5446747 And it's time to get tough,
5446781 5447782 because otherwise<br />there's not gonna be a country,
5447815 5448783 and there's<br />not gonna be a world.
5448816 5450418 -And you know who's tough?<br />-You.
5450450 5452353 The Soviets, they get it,<br />believe me.
5452386 5453955 You're talking about tough<br />and strong.
5453988 5456324 Listen, you want me<br />to read about the missiles,
5456357 5457425 it's gonna take me<br />an hour and a half.
5457457 5458759 I probably know<br />most about it anyway.
5458793 5461629 Donald, I'm telling you,<br />I love how passionate you are.
5461662 5462863 Have you thought about<br />running for office?
5462897 5464565 Well, look,<br />I'd run very well, right?
5464598 5466867 -I mean, but, no, no.<br />-No?
5466901 5468602 Come on, Roger,<br />let me tell you something.
5468636 5469971 Government is for losers.
5470004 5471238 Come on, you'd do great.
5471272 5473708 Hey, I know politicians,<br />Roger, okay?
5473741 5475576 I know politicians<br />better than anyone.
5475609 5477311 And some of them are smart.<br />Very few.
5477345 5478746 But most are dumber than a rock.
5478779 5480281 -(LAUGHS) Yeah.<br />-Let's be honest, okay?
5480314 5482550 I give money to politicians,<br />so they do what I want.
5482583 5484118 They're all very corrupt<br />and stupid.
5484151 5486454 Okay? And you know that, Roger.<br />But you know what?
5486486 5488456 I'd love a blow job<br />on Air Force One.
5488488 5489991 I think that'd be<br />pretty fabulous. All right?
5490024 5491759 (LAUGHS) Hey, I'm sure<br />it's happened before.
5491792 5493094 Can you make that happen?
5493127 5495229 Yeah, well, hey, hey.<br />Call me if you change your mind.
5495262 5497531 Listen, you get me on that<br />Air Force One, we'll talk.
5497565 5498766 -(LAUGHS) Okay.<br />-All right.
5498799 5500067 Tell Ronnie he's got my support.
5500101 5501602 -ROGER: You got it.<br />-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
5501635 5503270 -Hang on one second. Yes?<br />-Roy is on the phone again.
5503304 5504372 I'll call him later.
5504405 5505740 Anyway.
5505773 5509543 Hey, uh, Donald, before I go,<br />have you seen Roy lately?
5509577 5512880 Uh, no. I'm gonna call him back,<br />and we're gonna talk.
5512913 5513748 Why?
5513781 5517351 -You haven't heard?<br />-Heard what?
5517385 5520855 Well, uh, Russell has AIDS.
5520888 5522656 -He's sick as a dog.<br />-Mmm.
5523691 5526327 -That's... Wow, that's terrible.<br />-Yeah.
5526360 5527962 Hey, he's still your lawyer?
5527995 5529430 Well, he's not my lawyer,<br />per se.
5529463 5530798 I mean, I have a number<br />of attorneys, right?
5530831 5532133 Different lawyers,<br />different things.
5532166 5533834 -But...<br />-Mmm.
5533868 5535503 That's really terrible, Roger.<br />(CLEARS THROAT)
5535536 5536670 -Yeah. Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
5536704 5538873 -Well, the world's a mess.<br />-Goodbye, Donald.
5538906 5539940 Yep.
5544879 5545980 Fiona!
5550618 5551819 Come over here.
5553454 5554655 Uh...
5555256 5557058 What did Roy say?
5557091 5559160 Not too much,<br />but he's called three times.
5560461 5562363 Does he sound sick?
5562396 5564131 A little bit.<br />Yeah, he's got a cough.
5565199 5566901 All right. If he calls again,<br />just tell him
5566934 5568235 I'm out of the office,<br />all right?
5568269 5570371 And if he shows up,<br />put him in the conference room,
5570404 5573074 by himself. Okay?
5573107 5575443 -Will that be all?<br />-That's it. Thank you.
5575476 5578879 (HELICOPTER HOVERING)
5592793 5595329 DONALD: Thank you.<br />Thank you, thank you.
5595362 5596931 Thank you, thank you.<br />All right.
5596964 5600000 -ROY: Donald.<br />-Thank you very much. Roy!
5600034 5601068 Long time no see.
5601102 5603637 Is this some<br />kind of a goddamn joke?
5603671 5605439 What is that?
5605473 5606941 This...<br />This is how you thank me?
5606974 5610111 The manager at the Hyatt<br />kicked Russell out.
5610144 5612213 All right,<br />that's probably a mistake.
5612246 5614348 Oh, fuck you, Donald!
5615316 5616851 Fuck you.
5616884 5619787 Oh, your office<br />sent me the bill.
5619820 5622591 -It's a mistake, Roy.<br />-Don't you try me.
5622623 5624358 Remember who taught you<br />this stuff.
5624391 5626827 I'll call them, all right?<br />I'll just... I'll fix it.
5626861 5631332 You ungrateful,<br />fucking cocksucking nobody.
5632800 5635469 -Roy...<br />-I made you.
5635503 5637404 Don't you forget that.<br />I made you.
5637438 5638806 -Pretty sure I made myself.<br />-Uh, no.
5638839 5640542 -You were a loser then.<br />-Hey, listen...
5640575 5641876 -And you're still a loser.<br />-Listen, uh...
5641909 5644145 Okay, Roy, listen, I'm running<br />a business here, okay?
5644178 5646247 Guests complained<br />about Russell's condition.
5646280 5647516 What you lied about, by the way.
5647549 5649216 All right?<br />So that's what happened.
5650651 5651852 It's not my fault.
5653921 5655557 Really? What are you<br />trying to say?
5655590 5657526 I hear that he's sick.
5657559 5659561 -Really sick.<br />-Yeah, he's got pneumonia.
5659594 5661061 -He's got pneumonia?<br />-That's right.
5661095 5662897 Is that the name for it now<br />on the street?
5662930 5664365 Watch out.<br />Maybe you'll get it.
5664398 5665766 You know? You don't want that.
5667735 5669638 What, are you scared of me?
5669670 5671672 No. It's a little cold out.
5671705 5672973 -You know?<br />-Right.
5678746 5681282 Good to see<br />that you've, uh...
5681315 5685620 lost the last traces of decency<br />you once had.
5685654 5687154 Well, I learned<br />from the best, Roy,
5687188 5688389 what can I say?
5688422 5689423 I love you, too.
5698667 5700434 You've got some<br />feelings now, suddenly?
5700467 5701869 You're the fucking devil.
5701902 5703672 -I don't recognize you anymore.<br />-You're the fucking devil.
5703704 5704972 Get the fuck out of here!
5705005 5706974 -You scare me.<br />-You fucking old man.
5707007 5709210 You're no saint.<br />You're not God.
5712980 5714448 Why don't you go save him?
5715684 5717251 Save him over there.
5718419 5719954 Don't get sick, Roy
5719987 5723123 (SOLEMN INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5736937 5738939 Dad! There's the big man.
5738973 5739974 Oh!

5742076 5743612 -Looks great.<br />-Look a this guy.
5743645 5744713 You look good, Dad.
5744745 5746180 -You look great.<br />-Ah. Good.
5746213 5747616 -Irwin Mishkin.<br />-This is Irwin.

5752753 5754355 -Oh, boy.<br />-He's a New Yorker.
5754388 5755523 You're a smarty pants, huh?
5755557 5757024 He's my new Roy Cohn.
5757057 5759126 -Oh!<br />-All right. Go ahead.
5759159 5762597 Listen, Dad, I bought some land<br />under the Empire State Building.
5762631 5763897 FRED: Oh, boy.
5763931 5764798 DONALD: Irwin, you love<br />the Empire State Building?
5764832 5765966 The best building.
5766000 5768068 FRED: How many units<br />can you put in there?
5768102 5770639 Don't worry about it.<br />Listen, take a look at that.
5770672 5772139 Irwin's got<br />a couple of things to say.
5772172 5774341 IRWIN: Yeah, Mr. Trump,<br />my office had a request
5774375 5775909 relating to the trust.
5775943 5778479 This will allow us<br />to avail ourselves
5778513 5780515 of some new tax breaks
5780548 5782584 -and reduce the overall...<br />-Oh-kay.
5782617 5783718 ...the taxation on the trust.
5783752 5785185 So with your signature here,
5785219 5788255 we'll be putting Donald<br />in as the trustee for the trust.
5788289 5790090 And that will allow you<br />to not have to...
5790124 5791492 Save you a lot of taxes, Dad.
5791526 5792960 -Okay.<br />-IRWIN: Absolutely.
5792993 5794562 -For the trust.<br />-That's right.
5794596 5795963 FRED: And you want me<br />to sign here?
5795996 5796997 DONALD: Yes, I do.
5797031 5798700 -Oh, really? Uh, they...<br />-(CHUCKLING)
5798733 5800568 Mom, what are you doing?<br />We don't have time.
5800602 5801802 I gotta get back in the city.
5801835 5802936 Listen, Mom,<br />we don't have time.
5802970 5804138 -Dad, go ahead.<br />-FRED: Is that the tea?
5804171 5805339 -Please sign right there.<br />-Donald.
5805372 5807308 -What is this?<br />-This is for the trust, Mary.
5807341 5809977 -Oh, let me take a look.<br />-Look at the, uh...
5810010 5812112 -It's just a formality for you.<br />-And who are you?
5812146 5814214 This is...<br />This is my attorney.
5814248 5816450 But this is<br />your siblings' trust.
5816483 5817418 I understand. Listen...
5817451 5819253 You're jeopardizing<br />your siblings' trust.
5819286 5821455 DONALD: No,<br />I'm not jeopardizing anything.
5821488 5823023 I have some loans
5823057 5824258 that need to be guaranteed,
5824291 5826894 and I gotta just get<br />these bankers off my back.
5826927 5828162 -What...<br />-Okay?
5828195 5830732 I just need to show the bankers<br />that I'm good.
5830765 5833500 Your father<br />is a little confused.
5833535 5837672 He's not the right person<br />to be signing this document.
5837706 5839641 That's why we should have,
5839674 5840974 as you should know<br />as a lawyer...
5841008 5842876 -DONALD: Mom.<br />-...sound mind.
5842910 5844779 Who's going to look after<br />this family, okay?
5844813 5846280 Who's going to look after<br />this family

5855356 5856791 I'm looking out for the family,<br />all right?
5856825 5858325 -MARY ANNE: Language, Donald.<br />-I'm looking out for the family.
5858359 5860795 I'm pretty much sure<br />that nobody else is doing that.
5860829 5862329 Not Elizabeth, not Mary.
5862363 5863631 Not fucking Freddy.
5863665 5867000 No, you do not speak his name!
5867702 5868936 You have no right.

5903605 5905740 Okay. You need to stop<br />consuming these immediately.
5905774 5907040 I thought<br />they were like vitamins.
5907074 5909343 It's amphetamines.<br />It's cheap speed.
5909376 5911345 Erectile dysfunction<br />is one of the many side effects.

5915115 5916283 -Right? You know.<br />-Mm-hmm.

5925159 5927995 First of all,<br />the body is like a battery.
5928028 5929363 It has finite energy<br />and it runs out.
5929396 5932867 -Okay, that's not true.<br />-That is totally the truth.
5932901 5934334 -Totally the truth.<br />-Donald...
5934368 5936838 The problem that I'm having<br />is I'm just...
5936871 5939139 I need to stop growing,<br />that's all.

5949116 5951952 we're going to get<br />rid of the ab fat,
5951985 5953954 and we're going to get<br />the love-handles gone too.
5953987 5955590 Well, I hate the love handles.

6003103 6004873 They can...<br />They can breathe on you.

6008442 6011144 The legal establishment<br />in the state of New York
6011178 6014549 wants to take away Roy Cohn's<br />license to practice law.

6023591 6026426 I'm terrific, Mike.<br />It's great to see you.
6026460 6028095 This is what<br />the disciplinary committee

6071873 6074776 Categorically,<br />I do not have AIDS.
6074809 6078211 I'm sure you know why people<br />ask about AIDS, Roy Cohn.
6078245 6080682 Because they believe<br />you're a homosexual.

6410443 6411712 Roy Cohn.
6412747 6414515 Roy is tough. (LAUGHS SOFTLY)

6421622 6423958 to your mother.<br />Am I right?
6423991 6428229 But, um, you know, with Roy,<br />it's about friendship, right?
6428262 6429363 He has to like you.
6429397 6430598 And if he doesn't?<br />Forget it.
6430631 6433000 -He has to like you, right?<br />-(MAN CHUCKLES)
6433034 6434467 Thank God he liked me.
6435036 6436170 And I mean, I don't know,
6436203 6438139 I mean, he must have thought<br />I was a baby or something,
6438172 6439573 because, you know,<br />I don't drink,
6439607 6442043 I don't smoke,<br />I don't take drugs.
6442076 6442977 I have other problems
6443010 6444245 which I don't want<br />to tell you about.
6444278 6445313 -But, uh...<br />-(ALL LAUGHING)
6445346 6447048 For whatever reason,<br />he liked me.
6448416 6452853 But the truth is<br />as tough as Roy is,
6452887 6454522 and he is brutal,
6454555 6457825 he, uh, truly is a loyal guy.
6461329 6462797 It's a matter of honor with him.
6463831 6466867 And, um, frankly,<br />he's a hero.

6724191 6725326 Let's see if this is gonna be<br />a negative book.
6725359 6727995 Well, honestly, I'm amazed<br />that you asked me
6728028 6729531 to write this book, Mr. Trump,
6729564 6730898 considering the article<br />I wrote on you
6730931 6732099 -wasn't exactly flattering.<br />-Yeah, well...
6732132 6733834 You put me on the cover<br />of <i>New York Magazine</i>
6733867 6735169 and you can write,<br />that's the most important thing.
6735202 6736437 Now you just have to be<br />nice to me
6736470 6737738 because I'm paying you.
6738372 6740007 Sure you are.
6740040 6742677 So I was looking through<br />some of your interviews,
6742711 6745112 and I'm finding it hard<br />to settle
6745145 6747014 on a grand narrative<br />for the book.
6747047 6748849 Yes, you like making deals.
6748882 6750251 Oh, I'm gonna stop you<br />right there, Tony.
6750284 6753555 I don't...<br />I don't like making deals.
6753588 6754788 Do you understand?
6754822 6756691 I love making deals.
6756725 6758727 I love making deals.<br />The bigger the better.
6758759 6760861 -But to what end?<br />-To what end?
6760894 6761962 Deals are the end.<br />I mean,
6761996 6763397 that's like asking Da Vinci,
6763430 6765799 why he painted the Mona Lisa.
6765833 6767201 You consider yourself an artist?
6767234 6769704 Well, I am an artist, Tony,<br />and deals are my art form.
6769738 6771573 Look, making deals<br />is an art form,
6771606 6772741 and I want to put this<br />in the book.
6772773 6773974 It's something<br />that you're born with.
6774008 6775342 You either have it<br />or you don't have it, okay?
6775376 6776910 And if you don't have it,<br />don't do deals.
6776944 6779880 Just get a beautiful job,<br />have a nice family and relax.
6781716 6783450 "The Art of the Deal."
6783484 6785452 That sounds good.
6785486 6786887 You know, I like that.<br />That's...
6786920 6788055 I think people<br />will buy into that.
6788088 6790090 Well, let's see, Tony,<br />I'd buy that book.
6790124 6792993 (LAUGHS) Okay,<br />let's go back to your childhood.
6793027 6795029 Uh, living in Queens.<br />What was that like?
6795062 6796997 Well, I had a great child,<br />very normal.
6797031 6799133 Uh, wonderful parents,<br />supportive parents.
6799166 6800735 And, you know,<br />my dad was tough,
6800769 6803170 and he helped me develop<br />a killer instinct.
6804071 6805707 -And?<br />-And yeah...
6805740 6807575 Frankly, you know,<br />I don't want to...
6807609 6809977 I don't like to talk<br />too much about the past, Tony.
6810010 6812012 You dwell on the past,<br />you go right down the tubes.
6812046 6814214 This is just to give<br />the reader some context.
6814248 6815249 Tony.
6817217 6819320 (STUTTERS) Don't come here<br />busting my balls,
6819353 6822122 looking for some deep shit.<br />All right?
6822156 6823991 I hear when everybody<br />tries to dig around your life
6824024 6825326 looking for some deep shit.
6825359 6826761 We're all animals.
6826795 6827895 Everybody wants to get rich
6827928 6828996 and have other people<br />suck their cock.
6829029 6830864 Everybody wants to win, Tony.
6830898 6832634 And that's the truth of it.
6832667 6835436 -But that won't read well.<br />-Well, that's the truth of it.
6835469 6837639 But it's not the truth<br />we're looking for right now.
6837672 6839006 Right now,<br />people need to think
6839039 6840742 there's some<br />sort of special sauce.
6840775 6842744 Principles, set of rules<br />that make you different.
6842777 6844445 Well. that's easy<br />because I have my rules.
6844478 6845846 I got three rules, okay?
6845879 6847147 They're my three rules<br />of winning.
6847181 6851018 Rule One.<br />The world is a mess, okay?
6851051 6852620 The world is a mess, Tony.
6853788 6854823 You have to fight back.
6854855 6856558 You have to have<br />a tough skin.
6856591 6858225 Attack, attack, attack.
6858258 6861261 If somebody comes after you<br />with a knife,
6861295 6864431 you shoot him back<br />with a bazooka. Okay?
6864465 6865533 Rule two.
6865567 6867301 What is truth, Tony?
6867334 6868770 What is truth?
6868803 6870070 You know what's truth?
6870104 6871238 What you say is truth.
6871271 6873608 What I say is truth.<br />What he says is truth.
6873641 6874942 What is the truth in life?
6874975 6877378 Deny everything.<br />Admit nothing.
6877411 6879279 You know what's true?<br />What I say is true.
6879313 6881783 And third of all,<br />the most important.
6881816 6884719 No matter how fucked you are,
6884753 6888455 you never, ever, ever<br />admit defeat,
6888489 6890357 you always claim victory.
6890391 6891458 Always.
6892560 6894995 You know, that sounds like<br />the US foreign policy
6895028 6896964 for the past quarter century.
6896997 6899299 Well, unlike that,<br />this actually works.
6900968 6902202 And I won a lot, Tony.
6902236 6903738 I won a lot. And even when<br />they said I didn't,
6903772 6904972 I still turned it into a win.
6905005 6907141 And that was the difference.
6907174 6909577 So how do you combine<br />these set of rules?
6911345 6913947 Well, I have an instinct, Tony.<br />I have a killer instinct.
6914682 6915817 I always have.

6918919 6922423 Listen, Tony, you have to have<br />a natural ability.
6922456 6924291 I'm a big believer<br />in natural ability,
6924324 6925459 and a lot of that is genetics.
6925492 6926927 You have to be born with it,<br />you know?
6926960 6929029 And some people aren't,<br />and some people are.
6929062 6930497 And that's the difference.
6933701 6935135 You have to have it.
