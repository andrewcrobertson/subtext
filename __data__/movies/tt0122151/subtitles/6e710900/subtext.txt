31824 33743 Riggs, you sure we're on<br />the right street?
33909 35161 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah?
35327 36996 We must be getting warm.
37163 40082 - You see anything?<br />- Where? I don't see anything.
40249 41584 This must be the place.
41751 43044 Holy shit!
44503 46005 What the hell is that?
50092 51635 Jesus.
51802 52845 Who's this joker?
53054 54930 I don't know.<br />A spokesman for the NRA.
56015 58476 Regular asshole.<br />What do we do now?
59769 61145 Run him over.
61312 63314 What if he shoots us with that rifle?
63481 66358 - He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.<br />- What if he does?
66734 69612 Don't be a Don't-Bee.<br />Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.
69779 71697 Positive?
71906 74366 - Let's run him over.<br />- Glad you see things my way.
74533 76202 I hope he doesn't turn around.
76368 79163 He won't. We'll creep up on him<br />slow so he won't notice.
79330 80498 Yeah. Okay.
80664 83959 Will him not to turn.<br />Power of positive thinking.
84126 86003 Don't turn.<br />Come on, will him with me.
86170 88047 - Will him?<br />- Don't turn around.
88214 91467 - I need you, man. Don't turn around.<br />- Don't turn around.
91634 93636 - Just believe.<br />- Don't turn around!
93803 95888 We're better than him.
96055 97098 We're better!
99016 100059 He's turning.
103354 106107 I was wrong, I was wrong.<br />Get down, get down.
113197 115032 They just bounce right off him!
115199 116575 I saw. We're in trouble, man!
117493 120996 Shit. I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
121163 123749 No, I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
123916 127586 Are you out of your mind?<br />You got a wife, kids. I got less to lose!
132007 134677 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Get going, Rog. Get out of here!
136887 139849 Riggs, I wasn't supposed to tell you this,<br />but Lorna's pregnant.
140015 142351 - You're gonna be a father.<br />- Get going. Get...
143477 144937 What'd you say?
145104 147523 You're gonna be a father!<br />Riggs...
152069 155614 She was afraid to tell you.<br />She was afraid you'd get angry.
155781 157408 You never talked about children?
157575 160327 - Shit.<br />- A baby.
168294 170588 There's something I'm not<br />supposed to tell you too.
170754 171797 What?
171964 174758 Rianne's pregnant.<br />You're gonna be a grandfather.
174925 176051 Rianne's what?
181765 185060 But Rianne can't be pregnant.
185227 186353 She's not married.
186520 189064 Well, I don't think she intended<br />to get that way.
201202 203495 They asking me to be a granddaddy?
203954 206290 Yeah.
224141 225684 Son of a...
232399 234568 Here's what we'll do.<br />Take your clothes off.
234735 236362 - What the hell for?<br />- What for?
236528 238072 - Yeah.<br />- Okay, you run.
238239 240407 Flame-O here turns,<br />sees you in your undies.
240574 242660 It distracts him,<br />and that's when I shoot.
242826 245120 - Shoot what?<br />- The valve on that napalm tank!
245287 246872 Before he shoots me?
247039 248707 - Maybe.<br />- Maybe?
259051 260094 Is he black?
260261 262638 Too much armor on.<br />I can't tell!
262805 266225 No! Not him!<br />The father of the baby!
266392 268936 - Okay.<br />- Please let him be black!
275567 277027 Get going! Here he comes!
278237 279363 Are those little hearts?
279530 281615 Not now, Riggs.<br />Just hit the damn valve!
281782 284576 Okay. Also, flap your arms<br />and make noises like a bird.
284743 286578 Flap my arms? Why?
286745 287913 It'll distract him more.
288080 290082 - I need him to turn.<br />- All right, all right.
290249 292751 - On two!<br />- We always go on three.
292918 294503 No time for three. Go. Two!
294670 296922 - What about one?<br />- Okay. One, two, get going!
297172 299049 I don't want to die in my underwear!
301010 303137 Why are you waiting for?<br />Shoot the bastard!
303304 304888 Shoot him, shoot him!
332624 334293 Incoming!
339214 343010 Riggs, you think that bird thing helped?<br />You think it helped?
343177 346138 No, no,<br />I just wanted to see if you'd do it.
348807 350225 Cute shorts.
353145 354438 Go spit, Riggs!
356023 357608 Come on, I'll buy you a doughnut.
357775 360069 Don't put your arms around me<br />when I'm naked.
360235 362321 Well, surely you're ashamed of your butt.
371288 372748 He's a lively one.
375959 378754 That shark damages my new boat,<br />I'll take it out on you, Leo.
378921 381799 - I didn't mean to catch it.<br />- What do you want to keep it for?
381965 383717 Yeah, why keep a shark anyway?
383884 385761 The teeth'll look great on a wall.
385928 389223 - They gotta stop snapping first.<br />- Maybe he'll fall asleep.
389390 391392 Go down, converse with him.<br />He'll nod off.
391558 394895 - He don't look tired.<br />- Maybe chewing on Leo will wear him out.
395062 397356 You think sharks eat their own kind?
399358 401110 Oh, stop it.<br />You guys got me in stitches.
403153 404696 Okay, where's my bag?
404863 406657 Starboard side aft.
406824 408409 Starboard, that's left, right?
408575 410369 No, port's left. Starboard's right.
410536 412162 - Yeah, right.<br />- Yeah, right.
412329 415416 Right, yeah. Right side aft.<br />Got it!
415666 417751 - Whatever.<br />- Check both sides. You'll find it.
417918 420129 Careful!<br />He's behind you, shark!
423257 425008 Maybe we should throw him overboard.
425175 428095 Throw them both overboard. Boy.
428262 431473 No witnesses out here tonight.<br />We'd probably get away with it.
434393 435686 You too?
439314 441608 I kept my nose out of it...
443235 445112 but you and Lorna.
446655 450117 You're having a baby,<br />you're living together.
451285 452578 You're not getting married.
454037 457624 Why, does that violate<br />your family values system or something?
457791 460419 No, I'm just trying to understand.
462463 464173 Rianne's not married either.
464339 466633 Okay, okay.<br />That's hitting below the belt.
470804 473432 You know, when I was married...
473599 475684 It was good. You know.
475851 478479 You put the ring on.<br />You make the commitment.
479438 481190 You do all the...
483609 485194 She's dead because I'm a cop.
486320 488822 She's dead because I'm a cop<br />and I...
488989 491408 I don't wear the ring anymore...
492284 494369 but I look down, it's still there.
494536 496205 I still feel it.
496371 501418 And, I don't know, it's like<br />I'm not finished with that yet.
501585 504254 I don't know how to explain it.<br />Is that bullshit?
504421 507341 No. It's not finished.
507508 510052 It's not finished. Yeah.
513388 515682 Okay, you did say aft?
515849 517851 A-F-T. Aft!
518018 519811 That's a fucking word?
519978 522606 In the back of the cabin<br />on the right side, Leo!
522773 525943 Why didn't you say that<br />to begin with, Roger?!
526109 530447 People get around boats and water,<br />everything becomes fucking nautical!
530614 532908 Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!
533534 535285 Man the bilge pump!
535536 537329 Pump your fucking ass!
537579 539456 All right, all right, all right.
539623 541458 Okay, okay, okay.
541625 543585 No problem, no problem!
547047 548674 What's Lorna say about this?
548924 550801 She doesn't like nautical terms either.
550968 554054 We haven't discussed it.
554221 555264 That's pretty messed up.
555514 559142 The baby's due in days and you guys<br />haven't talked about getting married?
559309 560936 No.
561103 563146 I haven't done it at all.
565440 567192 Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
567359 570112 Do we want Leo to shoot...?<br />Hey, hey! No, Leo!
570279 572864 What? Hey, hey.
573031 575784 - What's the big deal?<br />- You're shooting a gun on my boat!
575993 578203 I'm not shooting your boat,<br />I'm shooting Jaws.
578370 582249 Nobody's killing it. I'm not letting a good<br />animal die so you can have its teeth.
582416 585794 Sure getting grumpy since you<br />found out you're gonna be a grandpa.
585961 587462 Get off of me, will you?
587713 589089 Don't fool around!
590465 592801 This is some piece of hardware.<br />You got a permit?
593010 595095 - I'm a P.I. now. Of course I do.<br />- A P what?
595262 598974 A P.I., a gumshoe! You get<br />in ugly situations. I got guns, everything.
599141 600726 You are an ugly situation.
600934 604062 Permit or no permit, you don't deserve this.<br />You're not safe.
605439 607399 Smart move, Riggs.
607566 609234 Shit!
611111 612863 Hard right, Rog.
613655 615490 - They're gonna hit us.<br />- You hear shots?
615657 617743 Coast Guard, this is Code 7.
626001 628378 We're in L.A. Harbor. Over.
628545 631048 - We gotta go. Come on, Rog.<br />- Code 7.
633550 634968 They're getting away!
635218 637179 Who was it? Do we know?
638263 640390 No, no, I'll drive!
643393 645979 - Want me to help?<br />- Get out of here!
646396 647522 This your gun?
647689 649483 Yeah, you want some laser surgery?
649650 651443 Hey, hey! You could blind somebody!
654780 657699 Coast Guard, this is Code 7,<br />in pursuit of freighter.
657866 658992 Heading north.
659159 660911 Awaiting instructions. Over.
661078 664998 Code 7, this is U.S. Coast Guard.<br />Maintain your present course.
665165 668001 - We have a cutter en route.<br />- Why you slowing down?
668251 671338 We'll hang here.<br />Coast Guard'll be here soon.
671588 673924 - What do we do now?<br />- Show them our badges.
674091 676718 LAPD! LAPD!
676885 678637 Los Angeles Police Department!
678804 680847 We heard gunfire!<br />The Coast Guard's on the...
708500 711169 Coast Guard!<br />Freighter's on fire!
711336 713964 - Let's board them.<br />- What are you talking about?
714172 716216 Fire on the freighter!
721263 724266 Okay, I'm upside.<br />Now what do you do?
724433 726351 They're getting away.<br />Get me up there!
732357 733900 Hell of a fishing trip!
734067 736486 Shut up and keep your head down!
736653 738405 LAPD! LAPD!
738572 741533 Stop where you are!<br />Hold it right there!
744244 746496 He's got it! He's got it!
750500 752419 - What'd he say?<br />- He said watch his back.
755088 757382 Why didn't you tell me you<br />were gonna shoot?
758592 760218 Tie it up!
760552 761762 What?
761928 763138 Pull it up!
770437 772230 That was great, wasn't it?
772397 774441 I told you to keep the boat closer!
775984 777611 What are you listening to Leo for?
786828 788038 Oh, shit.
797964 799549 You all right, Riggs?
802344 804221 Look at that.
805931 807182 Oh, shit.
807390 809059 Jump! Jump!
815190 816733 Where are you?
817400 819903 My boat! My new boat!
836795 837838 - Hey, Rog.<br />- What?
838004 840382 - The shark.<br />- What about the shark?
840715 841967 Oh, shark!
844719 846471 Don't leave me!
860151 861194 Come on, Leo!
872247 873999 - Hurry up!<br />- I'm coming!
893852 895478 You can make it, Leo.
903028 904696 This is all I got left.
904863 906990 And since I met Riggs,<br />I've had my house destroyed...
908700 911036 my car wrecked<br />and now my boat sunk.
911202 912996 What's left?
913163 914623 I think that's about it.
932515 935226 Four sets of papers, totally genuine.
935393 938396 They'll get in the country<br />and they'll be able to stay forever.
938730 940440 U.S. citizens.
941733 944527 Ask them to vote the incumbent party<br />next election.
944694 946613 Help me keep my State Department job.
946905 948323 Bloody marvelous!
948490 953036 They've red-flagged the Asian visas lately.<br />Those weren't so easy to slip through.
967133 968510 Something wrong?
970762 973598 A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.
978561 980563 Goodbye.
980772 982524 Leave!
1056306 1058892 Coast Guard interdicts<br />about one of these a month.
1059059 1060769 Pretty raggedy-looking.
1060935 1063438 Six weeks locked in a hole<br />with one toilet.
1063605 1067025 Rice and a little fish to eat.<br />Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.
1067192 1069736 Thirty-five grand.<br />Where'd they get that kind of money?
1069903 1074657 Didn't. Got to work it off from<br />the snakeheads, the smugglers.
1074824 1076910 - They sell them as cheap labor.<br />- Sell them?
1077118 1078828 Like slaves.
1080747 1082665 I guess these must be the lucky ones.
1082832 1086920 They'll claim asylum. Say they were<br />persecuted, like everybody else.
1087087 1090882 We'll send them packing.<br />Cost you and me a goddamn fortune.
1091049 1093510 What happened to,<br />bring me your tired, your poor...
1093676 1096179 your wretched masses,<br />yearning to be free?
1096763 1098598 Now it reads, no vacancies.
1099349 1102435 I guess your parents<br />were Native Americans.
1107023 1109317 They pop one every boatload.
1109484 1112487 Shows the rest what'll happen<br />if they run off or don't pay.
1114739 1116449 At least he's nobody's slave now.
1118201 1120036 Come on.<br />Don't coddle them, move them!
1120203 1122622 We're on the boat and<br />I see this barrel coming down.
1122789 1125375 Murtaugh didn't see it,<br />so I push him out of the way.
1125542 1128336 Big guy. I knock him over.<br />We're in the water.
1128503 1131256 I pull him because he doesn't swim good.<br />I gotta save him.
1131840 1135218 There's that kid.<br />What's his name? Bissel?
1135385 1138012 - It's a food.<br />- Burger!
1138179 1139722 No, Biscuits or something.
1139889 1142684 He's always kissing my ass,<br />giving me coffee and shit.
1142934 1146187 Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />What are you doing here?
1146354 1149482 - Hell, that's a long story.<br />- Hey, man, you're all wet.
1149649 1151276 - You need a blanket?<br />- No, I'm fine.
1151442 1154237 - Somebody get this man a blanket now!<br />- Yes, sir!
1154404 1155697 All right.
1155864 1159200 - Get this body out of here.<br />- Hold up. What do we got here?
1159367 1161202 Step back, step back.
1162871 1164497 Shit.
1164664 1166958 He's dead, man.<br />He's fucking dead, man!
1167125 1168418 - Shit!<br />- What?
1168585 1171337 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1171504 1173298 Was he in the killing section?
1173464 1176467 - This guy's been shot four times!<br />- Well, yeah.
1176634 1179179 At close range, like he was executed!
1179387 1181639 - He was executed.<br />- Yeah, by the crew.
1182599 1187729 What the fuck, man? People get killed<br />left, right and center in this town!
1187896 1189731 Now we're importing victims?
1189898 1192942 Gangbangers wanna kill each other,<br />no problem.
1193109 1196112 You and me, one of us gets shot,<br />hey, occupational hazard.
1196279 1200617 But just a normal guy, this fucking guy?<br />What the fuck did he ever do to anybody?
1200783 1202577 - That ain't right.<br />- Easy, Biscuits.
1202744 1205079 You'll get an ulcer like this, kid.<br />Settle down.
1205246 1207123 Blanket!
1207832 1209876 - Sorry, Blankets.<br />- Here's your blanket.
1210043 1211836 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1212003 1214631 I just hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1214797 1219552 We'd like to stick around and shoot<br />the breeze, Butler, but you're in charge so...
1219719 1222680 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1222847 1226851 - Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />- All right, Boogers.
1227018 1229812 - Sir, over here!<br />- Hey, get them out of here!
1230647 1232190 Get them out of here!
1233066 1235735 Yeah, yeah.<br />He takes the job kind of personally.
1235944 1239614 Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious,<br />I'd say. Overzealous.
1239781 1241199 - Emotionally...<br />- Jealous of who?
1241407 1244327 - I don't know. Who?<br />- You just said he was jealous.
1244494 1245870 - I didn't...<br />- You just said...
1246037 1248915 No, I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1249082 1250416 - He's loud too.<br />- What?
1250583 1252126 - He's loud!<br />- What?
1252585 1254462 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1254671 1256297 I got something in the lifeboat.
1256464 1260093 That's okay, see you tomorrow.<br />I'll catch a squad ride. Hey, Rog.
1262136 1263972 I'm sorry about your boat.
1265014 1266516 Riggs.
1267183 1269560 - I'm sorry.<br />- Shit.
1269727 1273523 All of a sudden, this big<br />fucking shark comes... Can I say that?
1273815 1276067 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1276234 1279070 So this big darn shark comes along...
1290290 1292917 My Code 7.
1335918 1339297 - Hey! Hey.<br />- Hey.
1339464 1342508 - You were coming home last night.<br />- I know, I'm sorry.
1342675 1344010 I had some bad Chinese.
1345636 1347472 You look a little banged up.
1347805 1349265 You look a little knocked up.
1352310 1353770 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah.
1353936 1355438 - You sure?<br />- Yeah.
1355605 1357774 Easy, tiger!<br />There he goes again.
1357940 1360026 She. There she goes again.
1361527 1362570 You okay?
1362737 1364989 I'm good. I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1365156 1368743 - No. Boat sank?<br />- I had something to do with it.
1368993 1370370 No! No grease!
1371245 1373122 - Have some cookies.<br />- What happened?
1373289 1374916 What happened?
1375083 1377585 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1377752 1378961 Here, boy.
1379629 1381881 Thanks.
1382048 1386135 You were out fishing. I mean,<br />does trouble just go looking for you?
1386386 1390473 Well, it seems to know pretty much<br />where I am most of the time.
1391265 1393267 You finished the nursery.
1393434 1394936 Yeah, I did.
1395103 1397688 I figured it was good for a girl or a boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1397897 1400441 It's a dogfest.<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1400691 1403611 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1403778 1405696 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1409492 1414038 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1425883 1428136 Well, I sort of figured<br />you didn't want that.
1431889 1433641 You want to get married?
1436519 1437854 Well, no.
1440398 1441649 Me neither.
1443025 1444193 You want some breakfast?
1445695 1447321 Yeah. Yeah.
1460585 1463045 Serve and Protect.
1463379 1466174 Since when do you read this smut?
1467675 1469969 - It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />- Ebony Clark.
1470136 1471220 Trish gave it to me.
1471429 1474599 Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1474765 1476726 He devoured her with his eyes.
1477143 1481189 Hey. Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1483983 1486569 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1486819 1490072 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1491073 1494952 Have I ever<br />made your womanhood reach peaks...
1495119 1497413 that would rival<br />the highest Himalayas?
1497580 1501375 - Foothills of Malibu maybe.<br />- Not even a Teton?
1501542 1503461 - I don't think so.<br />- Thanks.
1503628 1505796 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1505963 1507673 Well, you know I'm kidding.
1508799 1510968 You're just saying that<br />to make me feel better.
1511135 1512929 No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
1513095 1514388 You know I'm playing.
1514555 1517266 I've been to plenty of<br />mountain tops with you, Riggs.
1517433 1519477 It's just that I'm hungry.
1521437 1524065 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helene.
1524232 1526651 - I brought you a doughnut.<br />- A doughnut. Police food.
1526817 1527860 How did you know?
1530279 1532490 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1532657 1534075 Really? How's the rat squad?
1534242 1536452 - I picked something up, good one.<br />- Some cheese?
1536619 1539997 Oh, yeah.<br />I.A. got an anonymous tip.
1540248 1542500 The person said Roger's on the take.
1543125 1544961 No, he's not.
1545127 1548798 I know he's not. It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1548965 1551801 But with the new boats<br />and putting two kids through college...
1551968 1553970 I thought you ought to know.
1554178 1556472 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1556639 1560810 Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1560977 1563145 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1563312 1565481 - That's awful.<br />- I'm kidding.
1565648 1568234 Don't tell him I said it.<br />He's got enough problems...
1568401 1571779 He'll blow his top, it'll be awful.<br />Just don't say anything.
1573614 1575032 What do you mean?
1577660 1578995 Like what?
1579161 1582039 - In general, problems.<br />- You mean something specific.
1582206 1585001 I got a nose for these things.<br />Come on, tell me. What?
1585167 1589255 No, you know, you're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1589422 1591799 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better. Tell me.
1591966 1593843 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1594010 1595886 - Son of a bitch.<br />- Tell me.
1596053 1600600 I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed<br />my brain cells! I can't believe I said that!
1600766 1602602 What? What?
1602768 1605271 - I'm drooling. What?<br />- Oh, Riggs.
1605438 1610234 Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll<br />never say a word about this ever.
1610484 1612278 - I swear, I swear.<br />- Right hand!
1612445 1613946 I swear I won't, ever.
1614113 1616365 I promise. What?
1616824 1619577 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1619744 1621495 He'd kill them. So?
1621662 1625708 Rianne married one, he's her baby's father.<br />She's too afraid to tell Roger.
1626042 1629378 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1629545 1631505 And nobody's telling Roger about this?
1631672 1633299 After the baby's born, Riggs.
1633466 1637261 You mean it's a package deal?<br />Here it is, take it or leave it?
1637428 1639513 - Does Trish know about this?<br />- Yeah, she knows.
1639680 1641932 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1642183 1644560 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1644727 1645853 Riggs.
1646020 1647563 - Who?<br />- Sergeant Lee Butters.
1647730 1651442 This just gets better and better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1651609 1653611 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee...
1653778 1656781 Okay, okay. Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing.
1656947 1661077 You kidding? I won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1661243 1665581 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I promise. I won't.
1667958 1669251 Promise.
1671629 1676133 We don't have to discuss boys' names,<br />period, because we're having a girl.
1676300 1678052 Okay. Piadora.
1678219 1681889 - I like Piadora. That's sweet.<br />- Yeah?
1683265 1685559 - Can't live with that.<br />- I love that name.
1688062 1691607 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1691774 1694568 Need all the help we can get.<br />We don't want to double up.
1694735 1697071 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1697238 1700074 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! I like it better.
1700241 1702535 - Don't get me started.<br />- I like those names.
1702702 1704328 Captain wants to see us downtown.
1704495 1707373 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1707540 1709083 - Bye-bye, honey.<br />- Yeah.
1709250 1711252 Who had the sleepover?
1711419 1712753 Just airing out camping gear.
1712920 1714797 - We're out of here.<br />- Something smells good.
1714964 1716215 Really good!
1716382 1719301 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1719468 1721178 That smells like Chinese food.
1721345 1723264 Chinese food?
1723431 1725391 She's into Chinese cooking.
1725558 1727768 I gotta see this. Can I taste?
1728561 1730896 - I love Chinese food.<br />- Hold it! Please, Lorna.
1731063 1732231 Please.
1733190 1735109 There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
1735276 1736402 I saw him.
1737445 1739530 A couple of Chinese people.
1739697 1741449 Actually a whole family.
1743826 1744869 Large family.
1748748 1750958 - Hey, guys! What's up?<br />- Hey.
1752293 1754420 - Hello.<br />- Yeah.
1754587 1756797 - It does smell good.<br />- Great.
1756964 1759091 - They were hiding in the lifeboat.<br />- They were?
1759258 1761635 With what the INS guy said,<br />I had to do something.
1761802 1764972 - So you brought them home.<br />- It took two trips.
1765264 1767767 - Really?<br />- They fit in the station wagon?
1768058 1770144 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1770311 1772730 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks pretty good English.
1772897 1776442 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1776984 1778027 Wife?
1778611 1779904 No.
1781071 1782448 Rog, can I speak to you?
1782615 1785034 Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
1785284 1786994 I'm hungry. I'd love some.
1788037 1791874 Are you out of your mind? This is illegal.<br />As in, against the law.
1792041 1793834 You'll bring a shitstorm<br />down on you.
1794001 1796879 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1797671 1801133 The way I see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1801300 1804887 And I'm freeing slaves,<br />I'm freeing slaves...
1805054 1808057 Like no one did<br />for my ancestors. Okay?
1809266 1813020 Riggs, it's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1816023 1818734 Why didn't you say so?<br />This is not gonna be boring.
1818901 1820528 Need any help?
1820694 1821821 Okay.
1822279 1823614 Where is he?
1824949 1826826 Hey, Daddy.
1826992 1828911 What is it this time,<br />food or money?
1829078 1830329 - Food and money.<br />- Money.
1830496 1832414 I see you more<br />than when you lived here.
1832581 1833999 We're independent now.
1834166 1835876 Okay, okay.<br />What's the money for?
1836043 1838254 - Hookers, drugs...<br />- Contraceptives.
1838420 1840464 Can you believe they talk to<br />their father like this?
1840631 1844510 - Better than their parole officer.<br />- It costs more to go to school now.
1845177 1846929 Me first, me first.
1847096 1849306 I get the tuition bills.<br />And the grades too.
1849473 1852518 Consider this a down payment<br />on a future ass-chewing.
1852685 1855396 Get out of here and go to school.<br />I wanna see some grades.
1855563 1857147 I see the tuition.
1857314 1861068 I want to see some grades!<br />I want more cluck for my buck.
1861235 1862653 Thanks for the money.
1864822 1866574 - Oh, boy.<br />- I'm tired.
1866740 1868534 Me, I can't win.
1868701 1869869 Boy!
1871245 1873998 Did we get a raise<br />and nobody told me about it?
1876625 1878419 I got to get to the bank.
1878752 1881630 How can you when you're taken<br />to the cleaners all the time?
1881797 1883215 Yeah.
1884174 1885593 Hey, guys.
1885759 1888053 - Hey, Trish.<br />- Hey, babe.
1888220 1891015 - Those the kids leaving?<br />- Yes. And we're broke.
1891265 1892308 Is Lorna here?
1892474 1895311 Yeah. She's in the kitchen,<br />probably on her third breakfast.
1895561 1897438 I remember those days.
1898063 1901233 - Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.<br />- I love it when you do that.
1902902 1904737 - You look terrific.<br />- Thank you.
1904904 1907573 Wait till she starts trying to raise<br />that baby by herself.
1907740 1909283 Daddy, I'll be fine.
1909450 1912703 Move back in and Grandpa Rog<br />will be up all night with the baby.
1912995 1915080 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1917416 1919585 Well, you know, a cop or something.
1919752 1920836 True.
1921003 1922713 Come on, guys. See you.
1922880 1925174 - I should say goodbye.<br />- Hey, Lorna.
1925341 1926842 Hurry up.
1927009 1928802 Oh, yeah. Stuffing your face.
1928969 1931305 Stop kissing me. Try that.
1931472 1933599 You stay away from my girl.
1933766 1936226 I'm not joking.<br />Stay away from my girl.
1936393 1939021 - Joking.<br />- Bye! Got the baby beeper?
1939188 1940230 Yeah.
1945569 1947655 - I know.<br />- It's your fault.
1947905 1950366 It's your fault.<br />All the chicken shit.
1950699 1952618 Flapping all over the place.
1954870 1955996 All right, everybody!
1956163 1960250 It's been a year almost already, okay?<br />This shit ain't funny no more!
1961210 1964713 - All right? Enough is enough!<br />- Please! Enough.
1965005 1968926 I'm the one that gets it in the neck. Can we<br />exercise a little maturity around here?
1969093 1971595 If I find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1972554 1974139 What asshole is doing this?
1974306 1977226 Riggs, I catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1977393 1978394 That's it.
1978560 1980229 - Cut their balls off.<br />- Captain.
1980396 1982272 Hey, captain.
1982439 1985275 I look out expecting<br />to see all the old faces.
1985526 1988988 Instead, I see a bunch of kids<br />whose names I barely remember.
1989154 1993158 Will you sit down?<br />We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
1993325 1994660 Speak for yourself.
1994827 1996704 We're making way for the new police.
1996912 2001583 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
2006255 2009383 - Biter has a psychology degree?<br />- More like a psycho degree.
2009550 2012136 Hell, I got nothing against it.<br />Times have got to change.
2012428 2015180 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
2015347 2017057 That's how far back I go.
2018517 2020227 You wanted to see us<br />about something?
2020394 2022146 Some things don't change.
2022312 2025274 - Here we go.<br />- The department lost its insurance.
2025441 2028444 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one...
2028610 2030988 while you two guys<br />are still running around.
2032448 2034742 They can't fire you either.
2034908 2037703 So they're promoting you.
2040080 2043125 - Lieutenant.<br />- There's no open lieutenant spots.
2043292 2047129 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />he's making you captains.
2048547 2050299 - Better.<br />- Captain.
2050549 2054511 Time was when this would send me<br />over the falls. I'm getting old.
2055846 2057431 So, what the hell we do now?
2057598 2058849 I don't know, captain shit.
2059016 2061477 - Hang out.<br />- Take long lunches.
2061643 2064980 Yell, Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain.
2065147 2068400 - Chief's shitting bricks, man.<br />- You finished? You finished?
2068567 2071320 Think you can stay off the streets<br />and out of trouble?
2071487 2072988 Absolutely.
2073155 2075157 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2079411 2082331 - All right, hey.<br />- Hey, this is...
2082498 2083749 Hey.
2084249 2087586 You want your badges? Let me see<br />those sergeant badges. Give me those.
2087753 2090047 - Throw them over here.<br />- Never liked it.
2090214 2091882 - Here.<br />- Give me those.
2092049 2095052 This is one of the most painful<br />fucking experiences of my life.
2095219 2097179 - Now get out of here.<br />- Thank you, captain.
2097346 2099181 - Thank you, captain.<br />- Thank you, captain.
2099348 2100974 - Captain, after you.<br />- After you, captain.
2101141 2103352 Enough with the captain shit.<br />Get out of here.
2103519 2107481 After you, captain, I insist!<br />O Captain! My Captain!
2107773 2110150 - Captains outrageous!<br />- News travels fast.
2110442 2113570 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis...
2113862 2115072 <i>They got brown rings</i>
2115239 2116865 <i>Around their noses...</i>
2118200 2120994 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper for a ride.
2121161 2123330 - Not for me.<br />- I'll take a rain check.
2123497 2126125 - If you change your mind, call us.<br />- He's down-to-earth kind of guy.
2128293 2129545 I'm sorry.
2131463 2135384 Can we knock this shit off, please?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2135551 2138846 - Can we knock it off, please? Okay?<br />- Jesus.
2139012 2141640 The man's got feelings, you know?
2148897 2150649 Hey, congratulations. Look at you.
2150816 2152651 Captain Murtaugh.
2152818 2156947 I don't really know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2158824 2160242 Keep it up.
2160409 2161743 How's it going, Burton?
2161910 2164663 - It's Butters, captain.<br />- Yeah. I'll remember that.
2164830 2167624 - Kid really likes you.<br />- I wish he'd cut that shit out.
2167791 2169334 He likes me?
2171503 2174256 - Likes me?<br />- What?
2175883 2181430 No. You don't think he likes me,<br />likes me, likes me...
2181597 2183974 Likes me like that?
2186852 2189062 This is not the military,<br />it's the police force.
2189229 2191440 The millennium's creeping up on us.
2191607 2195235 The captain said,<br />new people, new department.
2202993 2205746 - Dr. Woods?<br />- Yes.
2205913 2207831 Captain Riggs.
2207998 2209875 - Don't run.<br />- I'm in a rush.
2210042 2213295 - I need to talk to you.<br />- Do you? What is it this time?
2213462 2215964 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2216131 2219718 - Or did you cook up something new?<br />- I'm sorry about all that.
2219885 2222221 I wanted your advice.<br />I was thinking of...
2222387 2224473 - Thinking?<br />- Marriage.
2225849 2228143 Marriage? The M word?
2228310 2230854 Does confidentiality mean<br />anything to you?
2231021 2232481 That's funny.
2232648 2235400 You know what would happen?<br />We'd go in my office...
2235567 2237778 - And you know what you'd tell me?<br />- What?
2237945 2241073 You'd tell me something like, Doc...
2241240 2243450 I want to marry Murtaugh.
2243617 2246620 Or your mother maybe.<br />Or how about Nelson Mandela?
2246787 2247829 Nelson Mandela?
2247996 2250540 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2250791 2253377 Something to get a rise out of me.
2253877 2255170 Listen carefully.
2255337 2258006 I'm not stupid.
2258507 2260676 And my time is reserved...
2260842 2265055 for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2265222 2266682 Have you got that?
2267683 2269268 - Have you?<br />- Run it by me again?
2269518 2271895 No. And you know what?
2272062 2273355 I don't like you.
2277651 2278902 Stephanie?
2279569 2282614 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship. I'm very happy.
2282781 2285075 I think you need to see someone.
2285242 2287661 You'll find someone someday<br />who'll love you.
2287911 2290998 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2291164 2293083 You're disgusting!
2293250 2295002 What's the matter with you people?
2300424 2301591 What's shaking?
2301758 2303802 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2303969 2306805 You're supposed to turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2306972 2308932 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2309099 2311310 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2311476 2314896 They were short, but big enough<br />to kick your ass. What can I do for you?
2315063 2318567 One of the ship's crew shot one of<br />the illegals, apparently under orders...
2318734 2322654 and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese these days.
2322863 2326700 We got no hard evidence, but we're<br />pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan.
2326867 2328076 Uncle Benny?
2328243 2329953 - You know him?<br />- Yeah.
2330120 2332998 - Back when he was running smack.<br />- We never nailed him either.
2333165 2334416 Benny's slippery.
2334583 2336501 Where's he hanging out these days?
2336668 2338920 He's got a nightclub,<br />couple restaurants.
2339087 2342341 He operates mainly out on North Broadway.<br />Here's the address.
2344134 2346428 - Hi, fellas.<br />- Riggs.
2346720 2348764 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Summers.
2348930 2350515 Butters.
2350682 2352726 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2352893 2356688 I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2356855 2358190 Checked out the boat.
2358357 2362027 Turns out the boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2362277 2365155 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2365405 2366990 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2367240 2369785 Benny Chan.<br />No. What kind of bad man is he?
2369951 2372037 Real bad.<br />Big crime boss in Chinatown.
2372204 2374831 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2374998 2376792 Where do I find him?
2376958 2378126 At this restaurant.
2378293 2380837 I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.<br />How about you?
2381004 2383298 Since we're going there anyway,<br />we'll drive you.
2383465 2385550 Chinese? Let me get my jacket.
2386093 2388637 - Riggs, not with him.<br />- The kid's doing a good job.
2388887 2390389 We might need backup.
2390555 2393809 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2393975 2395310 Like a son.
2395477 2397020 - A son?<br />- In law...
2397229 2399564 enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2399731 2401817 He might have to back you up<br />one day.
2406488 2410158 Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor<br />to share some egg rolls with you.
2410575 2413161 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2413370 2414788 Share?
2416581 2420168 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2420335 2423422 - If you don't mind me saying so.<br />- Why do you say that, sir?
2423588 2427092 It's just last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2427259 2429219 - Wasn't he, Roger?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2429386 2431388 Any particular reason?
2431555 2433932 About 150,000 of them.
2434099 2437436 That's how many bullets zinged around<br />my neighborhood growing up.
2437602 2440689 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2440856 2445026 Lived on the floor, ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2445527 2448196 I didn't learn how to walk<br />till I was 10 years old.
2448363 2452409 Spent most of my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2452576 2455912 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2456079 2459374 I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor,<br />and it pisses me off.
2460709 2462127 Hey.
2463253 2466840 - We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />- No, why?
2467048 2469718 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look too hard.
2469885 2472554 - Who's Leo?<br />- Maybe it's a coincidence.
2472721 2476057 - What does he want?<br />- I don't know. Let's find out.
2476224 2477851 Yeah.
2485400 2488069 - Fucking asshole!<br />- Bite me! Bite me, okay?
2488236 2491448 Whatever! Whatever! Jerk.
2492532 2493825 You looking for us, Leo?
2493992 2496578 - You saw me?<br />- Yeah, we saw you.
2496745 2498205 What you doing, Leo?
2498371 2502083 I've been perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I. and all.
2502250 2506505 He's a private eyesore.<br />Nice inconspicuous vehicle. I like it.
2507547 2509007 Riggs, who's the perp?
2509216 2511551 - What'd you bust him for?<br />- I'm a perp?
2511718 2515138 A young brother in back of a police car,<br />automatically I'm a perp?
2515305 2519267 Look at my suit! Look at my tie!<br />Do I look like the fucking Crips' accountant?
2519434 2521228 Look at this badge, bitch.
2521394 2523188 - Check out the gun.<br />- Okay, okay.
2523355 2525106 Put the gun down.<br />Put the gun down.
2525273 2528026 License. Registration.<br />Urine sample.
2528193 2529486 I got a badge too, okay?
2529653 2532239 German Jews didn't have it<br />any easier when we were kids.
2532405 2534366 So don't think you're the only one.<br />Okay?
2534533 2536243 Besides, I knew you were a cop.
2536409 2539371 I was kidding with you.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.
2539538 2541623 Oh, I smell bad?<br />What you trying to say?
2541790 2544459 Stop turning everything around!<br />You're so damn touchy.
2544626 2547045 These guys'll tell you.<br />We got a history together.
2547212 2550799 Maybe we'll work together someday!<br />I'm the bomb! They'll tell you.
2550966 2554970 We'll work together when I open<br />a cereal shop, you leprechaun!
2555136 2557597 I didn't call you names, fuckface!<br />Don't start!
2557764 2559808 Okay? Don't fool around!
2559975 2563103 - These guys'll tell you everything.<br />- Sir, you're double-parked.
2563436 2566231 Officer, I'm just talking<br />with the detectives.
2566565 2568942 - We don't know this guy.<br />- Yeah.
2569109 2570569 Think he might've been drinking.
2570735 2572279 They're kidding. Come back!
2572445 2575031 I wasn't drinking.<br />They just said that.
2575198 2578577 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.
2578743 2581162 Blow in my fucking ear!
2581329 2583873 - Okay, okay, okay.<br />- You're all mine. You're mine!
2611067 2612360 Where's Uncle Benny?
2612527 2614571 - He's not here.<br />- Is he in there?
2614738 2616323 - I'm sure he is.<br />- This way.
2616489 2618033 Yes, it's a two-way.
2618199 2620160 We have three people.
2620327 2623538 The restaurant's over there.<br />Go this way, please.
2623705 2625749 They see us,<br />but we can't see them.
2625957 2628627 - Where's your green card?<br />- That's a racist remark.
2628793 2631630 I'm a policeman who asked for<br />your green card!
2631838 2632922 This is not the way.
2633089 2635550 You're the boss<br />till we get up in his ass.
2638261 2640972 It'll be fine.<br />Hey, they've refurbished.
2641139 2643224 - I couldn't stop them.<br />- Hey, fellas.
2643391 2645602 - Out, out!<br />- Can I get drink or food?
2645769 2648480 Uncle Benny!<br />I hope this is a bad time.
2648688 2651816 - He still hasn't clipped his eyebrows.<br />- What'd we tell you?
2651983 2655945 - We hate not disturbing you.<br />- This is Detective Buckles.
2656154 2660325 Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?<br />How's the front...? Restaurant?
2660492 2664162 Have something to eat.<br />Give you the police discount.
2664329 2666206 - Flied lice?<br />- Flied lice?
2666373 2668458 It is fried rice, you plick!
2672003 2674798 I'm very busy.<br />What is it this time?
2674964 2676257 Tell him, Buttkiss.
2676424 2680011 Know about a boatload of illegals<br />that went aground last night?
2680762 2682430 Just what I saw on the news.
2682681 2684474 Some snakehead lost big money.
2684641 2687560 Four hundred people at 35 grand.<br />Fourteen million, Uncle Benny.
2688937 2690939 And missed out on making slaves<br />out of them.
2691231 2695610 You are cops. I thought<br />smuggling Chinese was an INS problem.
2695777 2699114 We found three bodies full of holes,<br />so now it's a cop problem.
2699280 2700657 Three dead Chinese?
2701116 2704411 - Billion more where they came from.<br />- That's right, life's cheap.
2704577 2707288 Problem is, he shot at me and Rog too.<br />That pisses us off.
2707455 2711960 Heh, heh, heh. Too bad they missed.<br />But still I don't know anything about it.
2713920 2716089 Hey. Who's he?
2717382 2720218 Hey. He doesn't look too happy.<br />What's his name?
2720427 2723847 Who is he? Who's this guy?<br />Is he just appraising your furniture?
2724055 2725807 He doesn't speak English.
2725974 2729978 Yeah? Then he doesn't understand<br />words like scumbag...
2730729 2732147 Eat shit?
2733273 2735525 I think he understands good.
2739320 2741030 - Riggs.<br />- Enter the drag queen.
2741197 2743241 The insurance, remember?
2743408 2746119 I'm busy. If you have nothing on me,<br />get out.
2746286 2747996 Just know that we're still around.
2748455 2750582 - I'm on your ass too.<br />- Yeah.
2750749 2752333 But the door is this way!
2752834 2755295 This is quicker.<br />This is quicker, really.
2758965 2760300 See? It's quicker!
2762260 2765305 Don't forget my 10 percent<br />policeman's discount.
2767807 2771352 In Hong Kong, you'd be dead.
2773396 2776232 - No, not that! Riggs, don't!<br />- No, no, no!
2777525 2779110 The insurance...<br />What the hell?
2786367 2787702 Hurry up!
2787994 2791706 Try it sometime. Give it a whirl.<br />Not only is it satisfying, it's therapeutic.
2791873 2795210 - Saves the cost of shrinks.<br />- Bad guys can't call the cops.
2795376 2797837 - Why not? We're already here!<br />- El Niño.
2798963 2800131 I know this guy.
2800340 2801758 That's the captain. Hold it!
2806554 2808765 Hey, Riggs!<br />Remember, no damage!
2819567 2821069 Hold it!
2823738 2825031 Shit.
2827367 2831621 LAPD. I'm commandeering your bike.<br />Shit. Here, $200.
2832455 2833706 Riggs, I'm coming!
2834707 2836334 Somebody stole your bike!
2838002 2839087 Stop!
2840046 2841756 Police!
2842465 2843842 Out of the way!
2844259 2846261 Butler! Chase the fast one!
2846427 2848137 What, do you have Alzheimer's?
2862360 2863611 Stop! Freeze!
2876624 2880211 Stop! Stop in Chinese, motherfucker!<br />Halt!
2894100 2895727 Out the way! Police!
2895977 2897395 He's getting away!
2904527 2906029 Excuse me. Out of the way.
2916205 2917415 Get down! LAPD!
2917624 2919208 Stop, you little shit!
2932764 2935224 Get down! Get the fuck down!
2940605 2942857 My arm!<br />I didn't do anything!
2951157 2952659 I got you covered down here!
2955078 2958289 You got the right to remain silent.<br />So shut the fuck up.
2958456 2962210 You got the right to an attorney.<br />If you can't afford one...
2962377 2965797 we'll provide you with<br />the dumbest fucking lawyer on earth.
2965964 2968257 If you get Johnnie Cochran,<br />I'll kill you!
2980144 2982605 Riggs, don't jump!<br />You're going to be a father!
2982772 2984107 Don't jump!
2988736 2990822 Oh, shit. Hold on!
2991447 2993366 Hold on! I'll get you!
2993741 2997328 - Riggs, don't move!<br />- Oh, okay. I won't move.
2997495 2998705 Hold on! I get you!
2998871 3000206 You'll catch me?
3000373 3003543 No, I'm not gonna catch you.<br />Wait. I got a dumpster here.
3003835 3005837 You didn't do nothing,<br />why you running?
3006045 3007046 Butters!
3007213 3008840 - Get over here!<br />- Shit!
3009007 3011592 - Hurry up!<br />- Come on!
3012552 3013594 Hold on, Riggs!
3014971 3017098 A bit more to the left!
3017265 3018850 Move this there. Now.
3019142 3020977 No, the other left!
3021144 3022895 Make up your mind!
3023062 3026441 - Couldn't you find something smaller?<br />- It's the only one I could find!
3026607 3029277 I got it here. Now, jump on three.
3029444 3032488 - Okay. Ready?<br />- Ass first! It breaks the fall!
3032655 3034615 Ready. One...
3034782 3036701 Two, three. Son of a bitch.
3038953 3040538 Hey, Riggs, you all right?
3040705 3042081 I should've had him.
3042248 3043791 Damn right, you should've.<br />Shit.
3043958 3046085 Hey. Who's your partner?
3046252 3048129 - Son of a bitch.<br />- I don't have a partner.
3048296 3049714 The guy you were running with.
3049881 3051424 I'm a waiter at a restaurant.
3051883 3054010 You guys pull a gun,<br />try to kill me.
3054302 3056846 You physically abuse me.<br />I want my lawyer.
3058014 3062977 You ain't no waiter. If you're a waiter,<br />what's today's special?

3219425 3221427 In America...
3221594 3224388 my children have chance<br />to make good life.
3224889 3227600 We want the best for our children.
3227767 3229685 And our grandchildren.
3230728 3233147 You believe<br />I'm a grandfather?
3233314 3235733 - That's right. Little Ping.<br />- Oh, yes.
3235900 3238236 You're a grandpa.
3238736 3240279 Where's the time go?
3242281 3243366 Don't know.

3245159 3246619 You have no watch?
3247078 3248454 Here.
3248621 3250873 This is my pop's. Take it.
3251040 3253834 He got it when he retired<br />from the force.
3254001 3256003 No, no. No, I cannot.
3256170 3257630 No, no. I want you to have it.
3257838 3261676 It belonged to a good man.<br />It ought to belong to another good man.
3263803 3266514 Thank you so much, Roger.
3355478 3356771 Shit!
3358564 3360441 No, no, Riggs.
3361359 3363027 Hold him, hold him.
3363194 3365112 Push him off.
3367365 3370868 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Good, good.
3371660 3372703 Get him!
3376165 3377708 What's wrong?
3378000 3380294 It's the shoulder.<br />It's the shoulder.
3380461 3384006 It's an old shoulder injury.<br />I'll have to toss in the towel.
3384173 3387051 - No problem. Sorry, man.<br />- It happens periodically.
3387218 3390763 I was just getting going too.<br />You're lucky, kid.
3390930 3394266 - You're lucky he didn't kill you.<br />- You owe me a rematch!
3394433 3397144 - Anytime you want.<br />- I might even train for it.
3397311 3399313 Better bring your own paramedic too.
3401399 3404652 - I'll get ice for that shoulder.<br />- Shoulder's okay, Rog.
3404902 3407071 There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.
3409907 3411992 I was faking it, Rog.
3412159 3413619 Faking it?
3414620 3418499 Gomez was killing me out there.<br />I didn't have anything left.
3418666 3420584 I told you that kid was good.
3420751 3423546 He's good, but it's not all him.
3424964 3429051 I've been feeling it lately.<br />You know the other...
3435057 3437977 Like, the other night on the ship<br />when that guy nailed me.
3438185 3440521 And yesterday I couldn't catch him.
3440688 3444066 Other stuff too. I just thought,<br />I'm out of shape or something.
3444233 3446902 You know.<br />But it's more than that.
3447069 3450739 It's like,<br />I hate to say this but...
3450948 3453159 You're getting too old for this shit.
3456036 3457163 Yeah.
3458497 3460374 How about that?
3460541 3461625 Finally.
3462668 3465129 No, but I can't be.<br />I mean, I'm only...
3466881 3469717 - Jesus.<br />- Yeah, you're only.
3470885 3472803 Can't beat the clock, Riggs.
3475389 3478684 Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.<br />What'll I do?
3479393 3481020 Accept it.
3483397 3484648 Like I do.
3487109 3489028 - No. Bullshit.<br />- Yeah.
3489195 3490488 Bullshit. I won't accept it.
3490738 3492239 I'll will it not to happen.
3492406 3493449 - Will it?<br />- Yeah.
3493616 3496327 - Will it?<br />- I'm not too old for this shit.
3496535 3500456 I'm not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for this shit.
3500831 3503834 We're not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for...
3504001 3505252 Say it like you believe it.
3505419 3508047 We're not too old for this shit.
3508214 3509465 We're not too old for this shit.
3509632 3511467 I'm not gonna buy<br />a hemorrhoid cushion.
3511634 3514094 - I won't get corns!<br />- I got corns!
3514261 3515721 I'm not wearing a suit!
3515888 3517765 What's wrong with wearing a suit?
3517932 3519600 Hey. How's it going, captain?
3530194 3531946 Thanks a lot, you guys.<br />Very funny.
3532112 3534990 That cop had me here for an hour<br />and tried to strip-search me.
3535157 3536951 - You get his phone number?<br />- Funny.
3537117 3539286 Sugar-glazed with jelly.<br />Thanks, Leo.
3539453 3541539 - What happened? The scratches.<br />- A dog.
3541705 3543123 - A dog?<br />- Dog cut you like that?
3543290 3544917 Catch you drinking out of his bowl?
3545084 3547336 Very funny. I'm working on<br />an important P.I. case.
3547503 3548837 Did the dog hire you?
3549004 3551966 No. The people that lost the dog<br />hired me.
3552132 3553259 Sounds like a big case.
3553425 3557972 It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot,<br />for all you know. It's a very expensive dog.
3558138 3560140 - A Bolshoi.<br />- Borzoi.
3560307 3561725 Whatever, whatever.
3562268 3563811 And you found it?
3563978 3566647 Sort of. Okay.<br />Listen to what happens.
3567314 3571443 Instead of going around town looking for a dog,<br />spending money, I went to the pound.
3571610 3575489 I take the dog home, I dye the dog.<br />It looks exactly like their dog.
3575656 3577157 Dog was a real rat though.
3577324 3579827 He scratched me.<br />But I got the job done.
3579994 3583831 - Some kind of P.I. business you got.<br />- Douche Ventura, pet infective.
3583998 3586000 - It's grand theft.<br />- What's grand theft?
3586166 3587876 - With trickery, it's a felony.<br />- Yeah.
3588043 3590796 It is?<br />You guys are always kidding.
3590963 3594550 Whatever. I get it. Here comes<br />that touchy kid. I'm not here.
3594717 3597678 - Captain Riggs, Captain Murtaugh.<br />- What you got, Putter?
3597845 3600055 - The guy you chased in Chinatown?<br />- Yeah?
3600306 3603851 His gun matched slugs on the bodies<br />on the boat. That's your shooter.
3605853 3607563 Son of a bitch<br />that got away from me.
3607730 3610649 He didn't get too far.<br />They found him on a rooftop nearby.
3610816 3614069 Strangled. And get this.<br />Pigeons ate his eyeballs.
3615321 3616655 Cool.
3618032 3620784 Excuse me.<br />Hello? Hello?
3620951 3624580 Shit! I hate these fucking phones, man.<br />You get a call, they cut you off.
3624830 3627458 You make a call, they cut you off.<br />What's the point?
3627625 3630961 You know what they're doing?<br />They fuck you with cell phones.
3631128 3634632 They're fucking you with the phone.<br />They love when you get out off. You know why?
3634798 3637801 Because when you call back,<br />which they know you'll do...
3637968 3640888 they charge you for the first<br />minute again at that high rate.
3641055 3642806 If you're able to call back...
3642973 3646477 because the 3-hour battery<br />you got only lasts for 20 fucking minutes.
3646644 3648562 What if you're behind a hill,<br />and it's going...
3649897 3652775 Or you go through a tunnel or some shit.<br />And they keep making it smaller.
3652941 3655694 You know why they make them this small?<br />So you can lose it.
3655861 3659615 Why? So you have to buy more phones.<br />I never lost my mother's phone.
3659782 3662076 Take you two hours to make<br />a damn long-distance call.
3662242 3665329 Da-da-da, four. Da-da-da, five.<br />Da-da-da...
3665496 3669750 I messed up. Hang up. Gotta do it again.<br />Da-da-da, four. Da-da-da, five.
3669917 3673087 I never lost my<br />Sports Illustrated swimsuit phone.
3673337 3677049 How about the scanners? They get your<br />number and call all over the world!
3677216 3681428 Somebody took my number<br />and called Afghanistan. Afghanistan!
3681595 3685182 I don't know what<br />fucking Afghanistan look like.
3685474 3689395 Even if I did, I would not talk<br />to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!
3689561 3691855 I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours.
3692022 3694858 They fuck you,<br />they fuck you with the cell phones.
3695025 3696610 You know when you go to a drive-through?
3697986 3699738 - Hold on.<br />- Why am I talking...?
3700906 3702282 Leo Getz, private investigator.
3702449 3704034 Private investigator?
3704243 3708163 I wondered if you'd<br />investigate my privates.
3708330 3709623 Investigate what?
3709790 3711500 My privates, you stupid shit.
3711667 3713544 Shut the fuck up.
3713711 3716463 Very funny, Riggs.<br />You're costing me a lot of money.
3716714 3719717 Three dollars to answer a fucking call.<br />They fuck me, now you!
3719925 3721552 You're tough when on the phone.
3721760 3723512 Right. Telephone tough guy.
3723721 3725222 Why are we talking on the phone?
3725389 3727641 Get the fuck out of here. Go home.
3727933 3729393 What happened to your face?
3730018 3731937 No means no!
3734815 3736734 This kid's gonna like me, I can tell.
3736900 3738152 He'd be the first one.
3738318 3742823 Okay, okay, okay.<br />Whatever. Whatever.
3747661 3750622 You know, we should hire Leo.
3751165 3752249 Hire Leo?
3752416 3754418 Hire him.<br />He can follow Uncle Benny around.
3754585 3756336 - Benny'll see him.<br />- Yeah.
3756503 3759298 - He'll drive him nuts.<br />- Benny'll shoot him.
3761175 3762342 Let's hire him.
3763218 3765387 I smell like stale coffee.
3768724 3771393 Why do you care if I go home<br />and change shirts?
3771685 3774897 A coffee stain's not something<br />that'd bother me.
3775147 3776398 Look at the way you dress.
3777357 3778692 What's that supposed to mean?
3781028 3784072 Just because I don't have nifty suits<br />like you. Not many cops do.
3784364 3786074 What's that supposed to mean?
3787618 3791413 I've been wondering,<br />where's the money coming from?
3792664 3794541 Where do you think it's coming from?
3794792 3796794 - Where do you think?<br />- I don't know.
3796960 3800172 - It's none of my business.<br />- You don't know. Okay?
3800339 3802508 Okay?<br />Trish gave me some money.
3802674 3806261 - It's none of my damn business.<br />- Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.
3806428 3808597 - Okay?<br />- All right. Sorry.
3811558 3812810 Whose car is that?
3813852 3815062 I don't know.
3815771 3818649 It looks like a full house<br />for Lamaze class.
3818816 3821944 - You know who belongs to that car?<br />- Here you go, captains.
3823570 3824863 No charge for the ride.
3825739 3827616 Rianne's here and Lorna's here.
3827783 3829076 I'll put it on your account, captain.
3829243 3830911 All right then.
3834832 3836416 Hey, honey. Hey, Lorna.
3836583 3838961 What's going on?<br />I came home to change my shirt...
3844675 3847302 - What the hell are you doing here?<br />- They took the Hongs.
3855519 3856562 Shit.
3857938 3859189 Drop it.
3873453 3875247 Girls, get out of here!
3879960 3881879 Look who we got here.
3882045 3884590 - Uncle Benny's friend.<br />- Hey, Bruce.
3884756 3886633 Nice pajamas.
3888051 3889845 What did you do with the Hongs?
3898061 3899479 Drop your guns.
3899980 3902316 - Drop them!<br />- Okay, take it easy.
3902482 3905068 You're not gonna stand for that,<br />are you, honey?
3912534 3914077 Son of a bitch!
4006586 4008213 Let the women go.
4017389 4019266 Don't panic.
4028275 4029943 I can't breathe!
4050756 4052174 Riggs!
4053300 4054468 Trish!
4058764 4060474 Trying to get my...
4060974 4062100 Son of a bitch!
4067314 4068815 Trish!
4075530 4077491 Riggs!
4084915 4087834 - I'll be damned. Thanks, kid.<br />- Ping.
4089878 4091963 Ping. Get Ping.
4092130 4093715 Ping, cut us loose!
4100430 4101473 Cut me loose!
4103850 4105268 Go ahead, out me.
4147644 4149146 It's all right.
4150188 4151731 - You okay, honey?<br />- Yeah.
4151898 4153692 I owe you one, kid.
4154234 4157654 - Rianne, the keys to your car?<br />- They're in the car.
4157821 4159823 - I got a car.<br />- We need a radio.
4164619 4165912 We have to go, baby.
4167622 4171084 How we gonna find them?<br />We got to catch them assholes.
4177632 4180051 3-William-56, this is Air 12.
4180218 4181511 We need your eyes, guys.
4181678 4185056 Looking for a black Mercedes<br />and a black Lincoln Continental.
4185223 4188143 Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.
4188310 4190562 Black Mercedes and black Continental, eh?
4190729 4193732 Well, that shouldn't be too hard<br />to find in this town.
4193982 4196234 Just give it a shot, will you?
4196401 4198570 - Be cooperative.<br />- That's a roger.
4209122 4210790 Will wonders never cease?
4210999 4214878 We've got two black Mercedes,<br />one heading east, one west.
4215587 4217881 Eastbound one just got on<br />the Valley View ramp.
4219424 4221718 We'll take that one.<br />Try locating the Continental.
4222761 4225013 - How do we know it's the right one?<br />- I don't know.
4225263 4227432 We're going east and China's east.
4227599 4229309 - China's west too.<br />- We can't divide.
4229476 4230685 Okay. Think positive!
4235565 4238068 - You crossed two lanes!<br />- You see him?
4245533 4247244 Watch the road!
4247702 4249704 I'd give my right arm for a siren<br />right now.
4254000 4255961 Why'd they take the Hongs anyway?
4256127 4258255 Maybe they're shaking them down<br />for more money.
4258421 4260340 You know what smugglers are like.
4262175 4265679 Hong said his uncle paid already.<br />He got in touch with his uncle.
4266054 4268181 He left him a message.<br />It's how they know where I live.
4268348 4269891 - Shit.<br />- That's exactly how.
4270058 4273186 Get out of the way!<br />Get out of the way!
4275814 4276982 Go, go, go!
4279067 4281861 - There's the son of a bitch right there!<br />- That's them.
4282028 4285282 Bastards left us to burn.<br />I wanna have a chat with them.
4285448 4286908 - How? You don't have any guns!<br />- Yeah?
4287075 4289160 Well, get me right up<br />behind this trailer.
4289327 4290912 - But you're driving.<br />- No, you're driving.
4291079 4292622 - Shit.<br />- There's cruise control.
4292789 4293873 All you gotta do is steer!
4294207 4297252 Riggs, why you always<br />making shit complicated?
4304634 4307220 Closer. Don't be shy.<br />Get up there!
4309139 4310890 Closer! Closer!
4311141 4312267 That's it!
4327198 4328908 Thanks.
4346134 4347510 Here, asshole. Come on in.
4350972 4353933 I need to ask you something.<br />Where's the Hongs?

4822318 4824987 - Sorry, Rog, about your loss.<br />- Thank you, man.
4826656 4827949 How's my hero?
4828282 4831702 He's a little sad,<br />talking about his mom and dad.
4835998 4837250 Here's Butters.
4841879 4843297 - How's it going, Riggs?<br />- Hi.
4843464 4844966 What the hell you doing here?

4863192 4865111 You get a make on the guys<br />that did this?

4867989 4869532 - Leo.<br />- Leo.
4869699 4872702 - You got a phone?<br />- The little Fonzie guy?
4872869 4874412 Yeah. That's him.
4875037 4877790 - You be okay, baby?<br />- We'll be all right.
4878374 4879458 Call me.

4889594 4892305 Leo's got him at the dentist.<br />Let's go.
4896309 4897602 - What?<br />- There. Sit down.
4904150 4905735 Captain Murtaugh...
4905902 4909113 I know this is a bad time...
4909280 4912241 but I think there's something<br />you need to know about me.
4912408 4915578 - Now, this is hard for me...<br />- I think maybe I know what it is.
4915828 4917079 You do?
4917705 4919916 Yeah. And it's okay.
4920750 4922084 It is?
4922251 4924795 People have the right to do<br />whatever makes them happy.
4924962 4927673 Just don't expect me to like it too.
4927840 4929800 I know this must be hard for you.
4929967 4932303 It's impossible for me.
4932720 4936599 I was just hoping we'd get together<br />for the holidays, say Christmas.
4936766 4940895 Why should we get together<br />and see each other on Christmas?
4941520 4944231 - I was just trying to reach out.<br />- Reach somewhere else.
4944398 4946984 Do what you want,<br />but leave me out of it. Got it?
4947151 4949695 - I got it.<br />- I don't want to hear about it.
4949862 4951238 Not a word.
4951405 4956077 What you grinning about?<br />Think about how we can talk to Benny.
4956243 4957787 I got it all worked out.
4958579 4960081 What's the matter?
4960247 4961666 My ass hurts.
4961832 4964669 My tooth!<br />Is this a dentist or proctologist?
4964835 4967505 - Please be quiet.<br />- I'm trying! I'm in pain!
4967672 4970216 Why don't you go see<br />your own dentist?
4970383 4973052 My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!
4973219 4975846 - Oh, brother.<br />- Oh, brother? Get the dentist!
4976931 4979600 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />It's an emergency.
4979767 4982061 A man has just<br />walked in off the street.
4982228 4984897 He's in a lot of pain.<br />You better come with me. Thank you.
4989235 4991862 Okay, you can come in now!
4999829 5003666 - You sure Leo can pull this off?<br />- Leo's got a B.S. in B.S.
5005710 5007211 Coast is clear.
5009005 5011007 Talk to the hand, okay?<br />Just one second.
5011716 5015261 - Okay, okay. Wait a minute.<br />- Let me do my job!
5015428 5018180 You hurt me, I'll stick<br />an egg roll up your ass.
5024645 5025771 What is this?
5025938 5028190 Don't be alarmed, Uncle Benny.<br />It's only a drill.
5028357 5029775 Don't say a word.
5029942 5031277 Shut up.
5031444 5035614 Now, where are the Hongs?<br />Open wide and tell me.
5035781 5037241 I don't know any Hongs.
5037408 5040286 You know them. Their uncle paid you<br />to get them out of China.
5040453 5042788 More about smuggling?<br />We went through that.
5042955 5044540 We're going through it again.
5044707 5046125 I have nothing to say.
5046292 5048669 These look very interesting.
5048836 5050463 You're not going to use it.
5050629 5051964 You won't shoot me.
5052131 5054383 - You're lousy cops.<br />- We're good cops.
5057053 5058304 This will settle him down.
5058471 5060931 Breathe, Uncle Benny. Breathe.
5061932 5063100 Crank up the nitrous.
5063809 5065102 Crank that baby up.
5065269 5067104 You said it wouldn't hurt!
5067271 5068898 I'm holding this. Go ahead.
5069565 5071650 Deep. Right down to your toes.
5073402 5076072 Benny?
5078365 5081243 - Aw, man. He's wasted.<br />- Have some more.
5081410 5082453 He'll talk.
5084205 5085748 Good, breathe.
5086040 5088417 Uncle Benny, Uncle Benny, Uncle Benny.
5089502 5091253 - That's me.<br />- That's you.
5093631 5095966 Now, where are the Hongs?
5099303 5101680 - What's renminbi mean?<br />- Renminbi means...
5101847 5103099 renminbi.
5103265 5106310 - You're a funny guy.<br />- This guy's wasting our time.
5106477 5108062 Time!
5108229 5110189 Time for Four Fathers!
5110356 5112149 Washington, Jefferson?<br />Those guys?
5112316 5113859 Roosevelt?
5114527 5116779 I'm sleeping with my wife's two sisters.
5116946 5118447 You lucky son of a bitch!
5118614 5120699 That's a good one, Uncle Benny.
5120866 5122284 Not so good...
5122451 5124286 when my wife finds out.
5126539 5129458 I don't need needles!<br />I don't need needles!
5131544 5133712 Let's shoot his legs with Novocain...
5133963 5136507 and watch him<br />try to get out of here.
5139135 5141387 What you got in your hands there?
5141554 5142972 A nut cup.
5144265 5145975 I got some big nuts.
5148978 5150312 That's nitrous...
5151063 5152398 oxide.
5153399 5154859 Laughing gas.
5155025 5156944 We're stoned!
5161240 5162867 Murtaugh! Hurry up!
5163284 5166412 That's one funny son-in-law<br />you got there, Rog.
5167079 5168581 After tonight it be too late.
5168747 5170624 Too late for what?
5171542 5174920 Hey, Riggs.<br />Why'd you call him my son-in-law?
5175087 5176881 Uncle Benny? He's too old.
5179175 5182136 Buy Four Fathers back<br />at Four Fathers' store.
5183053 5185264 Why's he talking about his ancestors?
5185431 5186807 I don't know.
5187516 5189685 Why you call him my son-in-law?
5190186 5192146 Because I am.
5197026 5199445 I thought he was...<br />I thought he was...
5201363 5202698 No, I'm...
5205242 5206285 Bloody marvelous!
5206994 5210497 Your baby is having my baby.
5210873 5213709 My baby is having his baby.
5214126 5216545 And your baby? Whoa, baby!
5216879 5218380 Whoa, baby! My baby!
5219465 5221342 What's going on? What are you doing?
5221550 5223802 I couldn't stall anymore.
5224762 5226388 What happened?
5227598 5229767 Rog, look at this.<br />Does that hurt?
5237816 5241320 Uncle Benny,<br />anything happens to the Hongs...
5241528 5243572 we'll come back<br />and rip you a new one.
5243781 5247034 - A new one. That's two for Benny.<br />- Bloody marvelous. Bloody marvelous.
5251163 5253707 - Are you crazy?<br />- Why did you do that?
5253874 5255960 For keeping it from me<br />and letting me think...
5256126 5258087 Hit him, not me.
5258337 5261757 As soon as we find the Hongs,<br />me, you and Rianne is getting into this.
5369782 5371408 Rimminy?
5371575 5374745 Young bimbo? Jumping jiminy?<br />I don't know.
5375954 5377247 I can't remember.
5377790 5379458 No, Riggs. Renminbi.
5379625 5381251 - What? Say that again.<br />- Renminbi.
5381418 5382461 That's it.
5382628 5384421 - You got it.<br />- Means people's money.
5384588 5386840 - Currency in mainland China.<br />- People's money?
5387216 5388384 What else did Benny say?
5388550 5389927 Might lead somewhere.
5390094 5392805 He was talking about his ancestors,<br />buying them back.
5392971 5394848 Something about how tonight...
5395015 5396809 would be too late.<br />Mean anything to you?
5396975 5398477 No, nothing at all.
5398644 5400479 What about<br />the guy who torched my house?
5400646 5402773 In the restaurant,<br />Benny was afraid of him.
5402940 5405859 If Benny's scared of this guy,<br />he's gotta be a Chinese Triad.
5406026 5408821 Those guys will kill anyone<br />who gets in their way.
5408987 5412908 That includes cops and their families.<br />So watch your asses, all right?
5413075 5414743 - Thanks.<br />- Keep me posted.
5414910 5417079 Yeah.<br />You pick up your wife, my daughter.
5417246 5418747 - Make sure she's safe.<br />- Yes, sir.
5418914 5421125 - I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.<br />- Her and Ping.
5484897 5486565 What?
5487149 5488859 You wanna get married, don't you?
5490736 5491778 No.
5496617 5498660 Yes. Yes, I do.
5499578 5501788 But if you don't want to, it's okay.
5502748 5504416 Why didn't you tell me?
5504583 5507211 Because I didn't want to put<br />any pressure on you, Riggs.
5507377 5509796 If you want to someday,<br />that'd be great.
5511590 5513383 If you don't...
5513550 5515260 I love you.
5518931 5521808 I'll take you<br />any way I can get you, Riggs.
5527606 5528857 Feel that.
5529233 5531902 - Ping, feel the baby.<br />- He's really dancing.
5532069 5533779 He's kicking. You feel him?
5551630 5552965 Hang on!
5583495 5584621 You're okay.
5584788 5586498 Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.
5586665 5588375 Riggs, it's Murtaugh.
5589418 5592921 I'm sick of these fuckers, Rog.<br />I say we just find them and shoot them.
5593088 5596049 - What do you think?<br />- Meet me and Butters on South Spring then.
5596216 5597301 What's going on?
5599845 5601763 They found my watch.
5605350 5609062 They killed Hong, his uncle,<br />Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.
5609229 5611773 - Where's the rest of the family?<br />- They're okay.
5612524 5616111 INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.
5616820 5621199 Hong's family was being held there<br />and they led them back here.
5621366 5622576 - Murtaugh, Riggs.<br />- Hey.
5622743 5626288 Looks like they were making<br />funny money. Ink's still wet.
5627039 5629791 - Where are the faces?<br />- That's why I call it funny.
5630375 5632377 Why in hell<br />are they making Chinese money?
5632544 5634463 Can they even exchange this stuff here?
5634671 5635964 - Only in China.<br />- Renminbi.
5636131 5637674 - I remember.<br />- Hey, Riggs.
5637841 5639426 Yeah?
5639593 5643180 Hong's uncle was an artist.<br />Maybe an engraver.
5643347 5646892 Bringing over his family could've been<br />how he was paid to do the job.
5647059 5648143 That's kind of thin.
5648310 5650771 No, that's not thin.<br />You keep talking. What?
5650937 5653982 Benny said something about paying...
5654149 5656234 - Buying back his forefathers.<br />- That's right.
5656401 5658236 Murtaugh, what'd you say?
5658403 5661615 Benny said something about<br />buying back his forefathers.
5661782 5663408 Wait, wait. You said ancestors.
5663575 5665869 - Ancestors, forefathers.<br />- What's the difference?
5666036 5669039 No, no, no. The number four.<br />Four Fathers.
5669206 5671792 These guys were the top guys<br />of the Hong Kong Triad.
5672000 5673669 These guys disappeared from prison.
5673877 5676046 Reds jailed them<br />when they took over Hong Kong.
5676213 5678173 - I bet they're here.<br />- Damn, we're good.
5678340 5681718 Lorna, grab Ping.<br />I don't want him to see the bodies.
5682761 5684638 - Come on, sweetie. Come here.<br />- Hey, hey.
5684805 5687057 Ten to one,<br />I know where the money is.
5687224 5690519 Twenty to one, I know where<br />the Four Fathers are. Let me make a call.
5690686 5692396 Don't leave without us.
5692562 5694773 That was good work.<br />You must be a detective.
5695023 5696692 I have my moments.
5703031 5704157 Uncle Benny.
5704783 5707327 I was actually starting<br />to like the old goat.
5707577 5709121 Bloody marvelous.
5709454 5712040 And it's fried rice, you plick.
5712958 5714960 Oh, here.
5719965 5722759 - Which one is Hong?<br />- Hong is right in front of you.
5723176 5725595 I want a complete set<br />of forensics on all three.
5725762 5727806 Yes, sir.
5730183 5732227 Dads and their kids.
5735063 5736898 I'll take care of yours, buddy.
5737649 5739067 We gotta go, Rog.
5739234 5741319 - Take care of yourself.<br />- Where're we going?
5741486 5743238 - L.A. Harbor.<br />- What's there?
5743405 5745323 It's what they call<br />a foreign trade zone.
5745490 5748618 There are a lot of shady deals<br />going down with the Chinese military.
5748785 5750954 It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.
5751288 5756084 I got it. Some corrupt Chinese<br />general brought the Four Fathers here...
5756251 5758336 and the Triad's<br />buying their release.
5758503 5761173 That's what Uncle Benny meant<br />by buying them back.
5761339 5764801 That general's gonna shit kittens<br />when he sees the money's counterfeit.
5764968 5766511 Yeah. Let's tell him.
5809179 5810597 Hi, gang...
5810764 5812057 LAPD.
5816228 5818021 I saw Hong.
5818188 5821024 This is what Benny meant<br />by buying the Four Fathers back.
5821191 5825237 Look, it's Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.<br />How are you, boys?
5825403 5826738 Who's the naughty general?
5826905 5828990 Who's been lining his pockets?
5829157 5832035 Naughty. Speaky English?
5833745 5834955 What do you want?
5835956 5837457 See all this?
5837791 5840335 I hope you need a lot of<br />toilet paper back home.
5840502 5842796 That's about all it's good for,<br />wiping your ass.
5842963 5846091 Take the Four Pops back to China.<br />We don't give a shit.
5846258 5848301 The Four Pops.
5848468 5850762 We don't want them no more.<br />It's counterfeit. See?
5850929 5853515 Triads never prosper<br />when they try cheating a general.
5855559 5856977 See for yourself.
5868780 5871741 There you go. Money losing face.<br />General losing face.
5872033 5874619 Hard when Triad try to sit on it.
5877747 5880208 I fucked you. I fucked you.
5880375 5883795 - We fucked you. It's beautiful.<br />- It's beautiful.
5886381 5887632 Don't we get a hand?
5888008 5889134 Here we go.
5898435 5900604 Keep your head down.<br />Let them shoot each other!
5900770 5902230 Riggs, watch out!
5904357 5905400 Thanks!
5917287 5918330 Was this a good idea?
5918538 5919664 It was an idea!
5926630 5928506 Eleven in the mag, one in the pipe.<br />You?
5928673 5930634 A real gun. Six shots.
5932552 5934137 Four!
5938850 5940769 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
5940936 5942979 What's going on?<br />Why are you lying to me?
5944689 5946524 L.A. says you're on the take.
5946733 5947943 I'm on the take?
5948151 5951529 I think it's crazy too.<br />But you're spending lots of money.
5951696 5953323 You ever hear of Ebony Clark?
5954491 5957160 Yeah. She writes those<br />cheesy sex novels!
5957327 5959746 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />- Are you boinking her?
5959996 5963041 No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark.
5963208 5967212 - Trish is Ebony Clark.<br />- Trish is Ebony...
5967879 5969547 You are boinking her.
5970674 5972717 Yeah, I'm boinking her.
5987148 5989901 - Too embarrassing to tell anybody.<br />- Yeah, I don't blame you.
5990068 5992570 - She's making a shitload of money.<br />- How many you got?
5992737 5996116 - Two.<br />- All right. I'll look for more ammo.
6026938 6028648 Who's the guy with<br />the white pajamas?
6028815 6031901 That's Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father<br />with him is his older brother.
6032068 6033361 No kidding?
6037657 6039367 Get down!
6043079 6045040 - Hey, Butters.<br />- Shit! Shit!
6045457 6047292 Now you got my name right.
6047542 6049502 I'm out.<br />I got to find some rounds.
6050295 6051838 I'll help you.
6052380 6054424 Never been shot before.
6055800 6057385 Hey, hey...
6058511 6060263 Take care of my son-in-law here.
6101679 6103348 Hey, Riggs!
6107143 6109938 - You all right?<br />- No, I got my ass kicked again.
6110188 6112023 Shit, I'm out. I'm out.
6112315 6115693 I hit the son of a bitch. I thought<br />I missed him. Where'd they go?
6128081 6129999 Come on, come on.
6131084 6134170 We got door number one,<br />number two, or number three.
6136840 6139175 - Looks like number two, Monty.<br />- Let's go.
6144347 6147142 What do we got behind<br />door number two? Bingo.
6155233 6156776 Now you've done it.
6157193 6158653 Now he's really pissed.
6163658 6166161 Son of a bitch gonna be a handful.
6170748 6175170 Since I met you, I've done some<br />hairy shit. But this is not gonna happen.
6176254 6178089 I'm gonna be a grandfather...
6178423 6180592 and you and Lorna gonna have a baby.
6184429 6187348 He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.<br />He ain't worth it.
6190143 6191769 Yeah, you're right.
6193688 6196482 If he gets away<br />we can track him down later on...
6196733 6198276 with a howitzer or something.
6198443 6202447 Your son-in-law's in there, bleeding.<br />We should get him, get the hell out of here.
6202614 6205491 - Shit, it's raining.<br />- I'm too old for this shit too.
6206534 6208077 Guy's too damn good.
6208244 6211706 Yeah, he's damn good.<br />How'd he do that thing with the gun?
6212123 6216002 He took my gun apart with one deft move.<br />How'd he do that?
6217921 6219505 How?
6228139 6229933 Yeah, okay.
6230099 6231309 Let's go ask him.
6290201 6291327 You mother...
6461330 6464125 Rog! Are you up there?
6464292 6466085 Are you all right?
6466669 6468379 Rog!
6483436 6484562 Riggs!
6488900 6490610 Riggs!
6493488 6495448 Riggs!
6496991 6498826 Hey, Riggs!
6500453 6502079 Riggs!
6502914 6504540 Where are you, Riggs?
6504957 6507752 Will it to me, Riggs! Riggs!
6508628 6509921 Where are you, Riggs?
6510087 6512006 Will it to me, Riggs!
6513841 6515593 Will me, Riggs. Will me.
6515760 6518054 Riggs, you going to have a baby.<br />Will me.
6518221 6522058 You son of a bitch.<br />God. Will me. Riggs. Riggs.
6526771 6529315 I hear you, Riggs. I hear you.
6529482 6531776 I got you! I'm coming!
6582660 6584745 I heard you, Riggs! I heard you!
6586122 6588332 You willed me to it, man.<br />You willed me, baby.
6588499 6590418 What took you so long?
6590710 6593671 What took me so long?<br />What the hell do you mean?
6593838 6597300 I was knocked down over here.<br />I couldn't even get up.
6599427 6601304 Hey, hey! Come back here.
6604599 6606309 Let's go home, man.
6606892 6608644 Let's get out of here.
6614692 6618112 I haven't been here enough<br />lately, Vicky. I'm sorry.
6619697 6622742 I need to talk to you about Lorna.<br />Me and Lorna.
6625786 6628789 It's like this.<br />She wants to get married...
6630416 6634045 and I love her.<br />I won't lie to you. I do.
6634211 6636839 And I want to make her happy.
6639091 6641302 I'm looking for help here, honey.
6643262 6644722 I don't know what to do.
6646182 6647683 Funny talking to you about<br />this stuff...
6650895 6653272 - Oh, Leo.<br />- Hey, Riggs.
6653439 6655691 You want to get yourself shot,<br />is that it?
6658361 6660404 What the hell are you doing here?
6660988 6662156 I was tailing you.
6663574 6664617 Sorry.
6667870 6670331 I'll leave you alone.<br />I guess you want to be alone.
6670498 6673417 - Yeah. I'd appreciate it.<br />- Okay.
6677713 6680174 When I was a kid I had a pet frog.
6680591 6682301 What?
6682468 6685513 Just give me a second.<br />Let me tell you this, okay?
6685680 6688683 I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.
6688849 6690685 He was my best friend in the world.
6691560 6694605 I didn't have a lot of friends.<br />Matter of fact...
6694772 6696774 I had no friends.
6699652 6701946 I used to kiss the frog too.
6702196 6704115 I thought maybe...
6704615 6708119 it would turn into a princess<br />since I was a boy.
6708285 6710037 And it could be...
6710204 6711455 my mother.
6712373 6715418 They told me that<br />she left or something.
6716419 6718963 And my father was no bargain.
6719130 6720798 And so, just the frog...
6720965 6722967 Froggy, was my friend.
6723134 6726387 I really loved him and took him<br />everywhere with me.
6726554 6728472 I was riding my bike one day...
6728639 6731142 and he jumped out of the box...
6731308 6733853 and I ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6734019 6735855 I killed him.
6736021 6738691 I was really heartbroken.<br />Really.
6739692 6743446 He was my best friend in the whole world,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6743612 6745698 And then I met you...
6745865 6747450 and Roger.
6747616 6751245 You guys really looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6751871 6753706 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6753873 6755374 No, it's okay.
6755541 6757251 It's okay.
6757418 6759336 You're my family...
6759503 6761213 and my friends.
6763382 6766594 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />you're just different.
6773392 6776228 And I just thought that maybe<br />that might be relevant.
6780858 6782902 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6783861 6785696 Leo...
6786363 6788491 I got a funny f...
6788657 6791035 - What's the matter?<br />- I'm having a baby.
6791202 6793621 - What?<br />- It's Lorna. She beeped me.
6793788 6795873 Yep, it's Lorna.<br />She's having the baby.
6796040 6799335 - Holy shit. I'll get the car.<br />- I'll be two steps behind you.
6806300 6808677 You sure picked a strange angel, honey.
6810846 6812556 But I got the message.
6813849 6815434 I got the message.
6821690 6823609 I'll always have this.
6824193 6825611 Always have you.
6826278 6827947 In here and here.
6829281 6830616 Thanks, honey.
6830783 6832743 I gotta go. Bye.
6833410 6835412 I am not ready to have this baby!
6835579 6838249 You're as ready as you're going to be.
6838415 6840084 Fine! Just wheel me in.
6840251 6842920 My legs are staying closed!
6843087 6844463 Give me this!
6844630 6846048 Ma'am, let go.
6846465 6849426 I am a police officer.<br />And I am not ready.
6851220 6854765 I am LAPD and I can arrest you<br />for interfering...
6855724 6857476 Lorna, are you all right?
6857643 6859103 - Are you the husband?<br />- Yes.
6859270 6860563 Honey, are you all right?
6860771 6861814 No, I'm not, Riggs.
6861981 6864233 I said I didn't wanna get married,<br />but I do.
6864400 6867111 I want to be a wife before<br />I'm a mother. And I lied.
6867278 6869321 - I know you don't want to.<br />- Okay.
6870573 6872741 - You said okay?<br />- Yes, I did. Okay.
6872908 6874243 Let's do it. Okay.
6875202 6876912 - He said okay.<br />- Yes.
6877079 6879456 - Congratulations.<br />- He said okay, Leo.
6879623 6881375 Oh, my God.
6881542 6883419 What's that smell?
6883586 6886589 I was on my way to the toilet<br />and she grabbed me.
6886797 6889592 - I'm so sorry.<br />- Have a nice baby.
6891427 6892803 I'm so sorry.
6895764 6897600 Will you many me?
6899268 6900853 Oh, Riggs...
6901020 6903063 - You bet I will, Riggs.<br />- Okay.
6905399 6906650 Let's go.
6906817 6910446 I'm not going. Wait, no, no, no.<br />Wait, wait. Please, Riggs.
6910613 6911989 - Get a minister.<br />- Now?
6912197 6915159 Now. Because we're getting married.<br />Here comes another one.
6915326 6917995 - We need a license, blood test...<br />- I wanna hear the words...
6918162 6920164 - before the baby comes.<br />- It's coming now.
6920331 6923000 Listen, I am getting married<br />or there is no baby.
6923167 6925753 This could be an aspect<br />of a transition phase.
6925920 6929131 This is no goddamn aspect<br />of a goddamn transition phase!
6929298 6931175 Honey, everybody, calm down.
6931342 6933010 Calm down. Okay?
6933177 6935679 - Get a priest, minister, anything.<br />- Where?
6935846 6938807 Go get a priest!<br />Goddamn it, Leo!
6938974 6940476 I got it, I got it. Okay.
6940809 6942770 Pant, pant, blow.<br />Remember Lamaze class?
6942937 6944772 Pant, blow. Pant, pant, blow.
6947524 6950527 - But I want to say I do.<br />- Hey, look. Here he is.
6950694 6952363 This is Rabbi Gelb.
6952529 6955199 - A rabbi?<br />- You said anything.
6955366 6956784 No, no, no. He'll do.
6956951 6958494 For what I'll do?<br />What's going on?
6958661 6961038 We'd like you to marry us.<br />Please.
6961205 6963040 - You're Jewish?<br />- Not necessarily.
6963207 6964291 - You got a license?<br />- No.
6964458 6967044 - Well...<br />- Please don't go.
6967211 6969922 She needs to hear the words<br />before the baby comes.
6970089 6972591 Are you both serious?<br />I don't have time for hijinks.
6972758 6975302 Real serious, rabbi.<br />We're very serious.
6975636 6977554 I could do it.<br />It wouldn't be official.
6977721 6979807 It's all right.<br />I just want to hear the words.
6979974 6981892 What the hell.<br />What are your names?
6982059 6983727 I'm Martin and this is Lorna.
6983894 6985229 Martin and Lorna.
6986605 6989233 What am I doing?<br />How do the goyim do this?
6990359 6992361 - Dearly beloved.<br />- That's it. Dearly beloved...
6992528 6997324 Dearly beloved,<br />marriage is a spiritual union...
6997491 6998701 Oh, Rabbi.
6998867 7001495 Faster, faster.<br />She's heading for the home stretch.
7001870 7004123 Martin, will you take<br />Lorna to be your wife?
7004289 7007793 Will you honor, love, et cetera...
7007960 7010087 - Till death do you part?<br />- I will.
7010254 7014258 Lorna, will you take Martin<br />to be your husband, et cetera?
7014425 7015926 - Yes, I do.<br />- The same thing.
7016093 7017928 All right.<br />I pronounce you man and wife.
7018095 7019930 You may kiss the bride.<br />You already did.
7020097 7022099 - Let's go.<br />- No, wait, wait, wait.
7022266 7024101 - What? What?<br />- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
7024268 7026395 - What is it?<br />- Let me have this glass.
7026562 7028105 I need this!
7028272 7031775 No, goddamn it!<br />What the hell are you doing?
7031942 7034403 Talk to the hand, okay?<br />I'll be right back. Wait, wait.
7034695 7037781 You know how long it took me<br />to fill that thing? All day!
7037948 7041076 This is unsanitary.<br />What is this?
7041243 7043620 - Break the glass.<br />- I'll get piss on my shoes.
7043787 7045664 - You gotta do this!<br />- Okay.
7045914 7047207 Mazeltov.
7048459 7049752 Hey! What the hell?
7049918 7051795 Come back here,<br />you little son of a bitch!
7051962 7053505 Pant, pant, blow.
7053672 7055340 Leo, please.
7056633 7059261 Your work is over here.<br />I think someone else needs you.
7059428 7061138 - Okay<br />- Okay?
7065184 7067644 Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.
7067811 7069563 - Leo?<br />- Yeah.
7070856 7072816 - Thanks a lot.<br />- Oh, okay.
7076945 7078572 Stick around. Meet the kid.
7078822 7081492 Good luck, Lorna! Okay, okay.
7085746 7086789 Riggs.
7086955 7088999 Here it comes, here it comes.
7091126 7092377 Here he is.
7092961 7096131 He's looking right at you.<br />He knows it's you.
7100969 7102679 Rog, look what I found.
7103305 7105766 - Look at that.<br />- Oh, boy. What a beauty.
7106475 7108268 Look at those eyes.
7108894 7111355 - He looks like his mother.<br />- Yes, he does.
7111522 7113857 Murtaugh, Murtaugh, Murtaugh!
7115567 7116860 No, Butters!
7117402 7119321 Butters' baby.<br />Better not be Murtaugh.
7119488 7121156 It's Butters.
7122699 7124284 Look at that baby.
7125035 7126578 Look at the hair.
7127579 7129581 Oh, that's my baby.
7129748 7132501 Look at her. You're so cute.<br />Look at you.
7132668 7135462 Twenty-seven people, nobody thought<br />of bringing a camera?
7135629 7137840 Leo, your plastic's flaccid.<br />Face it.
7138006 7141009 These machines wreck your plastic,<br />then give you the camera.
7141176 7143679 The camera doesn't work.<br />They're trying to...
7143846 7145013 - No, no, no.<br />- Leo.
7145180 7147015 Okay.
7148225 7150185 Hey, captain,<br />what are you doing here?
7150352 7151937 Look at these two babies.
7152187 7154314 A little something from<br />everybody at the squad.
7154481 7156191 - All right.<br />- Thank you.
7157025 7159444 - Those captain badges, give them back.<br />- What for?
7159695 7162948 Congratulations, you're sergeants again.<br />The city's self-insured.
7163115 7165284 I thought they were gonna<br />make us president.
