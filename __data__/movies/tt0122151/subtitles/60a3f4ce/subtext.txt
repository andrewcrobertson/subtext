1162869 1164495 Shit.
1164663 1166956 He's dead, man.<br />He's fucking dead, man!
1167123 1168415 -Shit!<br />-What?
1168583 1171335 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1171503 1173296 Was he in the killing section?
1173463 1176466 -This guy's been shot four times!<br />-Well, yeah.
1176633 1179177 At close range, like he was executed!
1179386 1181638 -He was executed.<br />-Yeah, by the crew.
1182597 1187097 What the fuck, man? People get killed<br />left, right and center in this town!
1187894 1189729 Now we're importing victims?
1189896 1192940 Gangbangers wanna kill each other,<br />no problem.
1193108 1196111 You and me, one of us gets shot,<br />hey, occupational hazard.
1196277 1200614 But just a normal guy, this fucking guy?<br />What the fuck did he ever do to anybody?
1200782 1202575 -That ain't right.<br />-Easy, Biscuits.
1202742 1205077 You'll get an ulcer like this, kid.<br />Settle down.
1205245 1207121 BUTTERS:<br />Blanket!
1207831 1209874 -Sorry, Blankets.<br />-Here's your blanket.
1210041 1211834 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1212001 1214628 I just hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1214796 1219296 We'd like to stick around and shoot<br />the breeze, Butler, but you're in charge so--
1219718 1222679 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1222846 1226850 -Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />MURTAUGH: All right, Boogers.
1227016 1229810 REPORTER: Sir, over here!<br />-Hey, get them out of here!
1230645 1232188 Get them out of here!
1233064 1235733 Yeah, yeah.<br />He takes the job kind of personally.
1235942 1239612 Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious,<br />I'd say. Overzealous.
1239779 1241197 -Emotionally--<br />-Jealous of who?
1241406 1244325 - I don't know. Who?<br />-You just said he was jealous.
1244492 1245868 - I didn't--<br />-You just said--
1246035 1248912 No, I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1249080 1250414 -He's loud too.<br />-What?
1250582 1252125 -He's loud!<br />-What?
1252584 1254460 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1254669 1256295 I got something in the lifeboat.
1256463 1260091 That's okay, see you tomorrow.<br />I'll catch a squad ride. Hey, Rog.
1262135 1263970 I'm sorry about your boat.
1265013 1266514 Riggs.
1267182 1269559 -I'm sorry.<br />-Shit.
1269726 1273521 All of a sudden, this big<br />fucking shark comes-- Can I say that?
1273813 1276065 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1276232 1279068 So this big darn shark comes along...
1290288 1292915 Shit. My Code 7.
1293625 1295627 [PERSON COUGHING]
1335917 1339295 -Hey! Hey.<br />WOMAN: Hey.
1339462 1342506 -You were coming home last night.<br />- I know, I'm sorry.
1342674 1344008 I had some bad Chinese.
1345635 1347470 You look a little banged up.
1347804 1349263 You look a little knocked up.
1349430 1350931 [LORNA LAUGHS]
1352308 1353767 -Are you okay?<br />-Yeah.
1353935 1355436 -You sure?<br />-Yeah.
1355603 1357771 Whoa. Easy, tiger!<br />There he goes again.
1357939 1360024 She. There she goes again.
1361526 1362568 You okay?
1362735 1364987 I'm good. I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1365154 1368740 LORNA: No. Boat sank?<br />- I had something to do with it.
1368992 1370368 No! No grease!
1371244 1373120 RIGGS: Have some cookies.<br />-What happened?
1373288 1374914 RIGGS:<br />What happened?
1375081 1377583 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1377750 1378959 Here, boy.
1379627 1381879 Oh. Thanks.
1382046 1386133 You were out fishing. I mean,<br />does trouble just go looking for you?
1386384 1390471 Well, it seems to know pretty much<br />where I am most of the time.
1391264 1393266 You finished the nursery.
1393433 1394934 Yeah, I did.
1395101 1397686 I figured it was good for a girl or a boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1397896 1400440 RIGGS: It's a dogfest.<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1400690 1403609 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1403776 1405694 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1409490 1413990 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1425882 1428134 Well, I sort of figured<br />you didn't want that.
1431888 1433639 You want to get married?
1436517 1437851 Well, no.
1440396 1441647 Me neither.
1443024 1444191 You want some breakfast?
1445693 1447319 Yeah. Yeah.
1460583 1463043 Serve and Protect.
1463378 1466172 Since when do you read this smut?
1467674 1469967 -It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />-Ebony Clark.
1470134 1471218 Trish gave it to me.
1471427 1474596 "Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1474764 1476724 He devoured her with his eyes."
1477141 1481186 Hey. Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1482730 1483814 Whew.
1483982 1486567 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1486818 1490071 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1491072 1494950 Have I ever<br />"made your womanhood reach peaks...
1495118 1497411 ...that would rival<br />the highest Himalayas"?
1497578 1501373 -Foothills of Malibu, maybe.<br />-Not even a Teton?
1501541 1503459 - I don't think so.<br />-Thanks.
1503626 1505794 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1505962 1507672 Well, you know I'm kidding.
1508798 1510966 You're just saying that<br />to make me feel better.
1511134 1512927 No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
1513094 1514386 You know I'm playing.
1514554 1517265 I've been to plenty of<br />mountaintops with you, Riggs.
1517432 1519475 It's just that I'm hungry.
1521436 1524063 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.
1524230 1526649 - I brought you a doughnut.<br />-A doughnut. Police food.
1526816 1527858 How did you know?
1530278 1532488 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1532655 1534073 Really? How's the rat squad?
1534240 1536450 - I picked something up, good one.<br />-Some cheese?
1536617 1539995 Oh, yeah. I.A. got an anonymous tip.
1540246 1542498 The person said Roger's on the take.
1543124 1544959 No, he's not.
1545126 1548796 I know he's not. It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1548963 1551799 But with the new boats<br />and putting two kids through college...
1551966 1553968 ...thought you ought to know.
1554177 1556470 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1556637 1560807 Oh! Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1560975 1563143 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1563311 1565479 -That's awful.<br />-I'm kidding.
1565646 1568231 Don't tell him I said it.<br />He's got enough problems...
1568399 1571777 ...he'll blow his top, it'll be awful.<br />Just don't say anything.
1573613 1575031 What do you mean?
1577658 1578992 Like what?
1579160 1582037 -In general, problems.<br />-You mean something specific.
1582205 1584999 I got a nose for these things.<br />Come on, tell me. What?
1585166 1589253 No, you know, you're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1589420 1591797 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better. Tell me.
1591964 1593840 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1594008 1595884 LORNA: Son of a bitch.<br />-Tell me.
1596052 1600552 I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed<br />my brain cells! I can't believe I said that!
1600765 1602600 What? What?
1602767 1605269 -I'm drooling. What?<br />-Oh, Riggs.
1605436 1609936 Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll<br />never say a word about this ever.
1610483 1612276 - I swear, I swear.<br />-Right hand!
1612443 1613944 I swear I won't, ever.
1614112 1616364 I promise. What?
1616823 1619575 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1619742 1621493 He'd kill them. So?
1621661 1625706 Rianne married one, he's her baby's father.<br />She's too afraid to tell Roger.
1626040 1629376 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1629544 1631504 And nobody's telling Roger about this?
1631671 1633297 After the baby's born, Riggs.
1633464 1637259 You mean it's a package deal?<br />Here it is, take it or leave it? Ha, ha, ha.
1637426 1639511 -Does Trish know about this?<br />-Yeah, she knows.
1639679 1641931 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1642181 1644558 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1644725 1645851 Riggs.
1646018 1647561 -Who?<br />-Sergeant Lee Butters.
1647728 1651440 Oh. Oh. This just gets better and better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1651607 1653609 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee...
1653776 1656779 Okay, okay. Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing.
1656946 1661075 You kidding? I won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1661242 1665579 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I promise. I won't.
1667957 1669249 Promise.
1671627 1676127 LORNA: We don't have to discuss boys'<br />names, period, because we're having a girl.
1676299 1678050 Okay. Piadora.
1678217 1681887 - I like Piadora. That's sweet.<br />-Yeah?
1682054 1683096 [KNOCKING]
1683264 1685557 -Can't live with that.<br />-I love that name.
1688060 1691605 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1691772 1694566 Need all the help we can get.<br />We don't want to double up.
1694734 1697069 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1697236 1700072 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! I like it better.
1700239 1702532 -Don't get me started.<br />LORNA: I like those names.
1702700 1704326 MURTAUGH:<br />Captain wants to see us downtown.
1704493 1707370 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1707538 1709081 RIGGS: Bye-bye, honey.<br />-Yeah.
1709248 1711250 Who had the sleepover?
1711417 1712751 Just airing out camping gear.
1712919 1714795 -We're out of here.<br />-Wow. Something smells good.
1714962 1716213 LORNA:<br />Really good!
1716380 1719299 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1719467 1721177 That smells like Chinese food.
1721344 1723262 MURTAUGH:<br />Chinese food?
1723429 1725389 She's into Chinese cooking.
1725556 1727766 RIGGS:<br />I gotta see this. Can I taste?
1728559 1730894 -I love Chinese food.<br />MURTAUGH: Hold it! Please, Lorna.
1731062 1732229 Please.
1733189 1735107 There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
1735274 1736400 I saw him.
1737443 1739528 A couple of Chinese people.
1739695 1741446 Actually a whole family.
1743824 1744866 Large family.
1748746 1750956 -Oh. Hey, guys! What's up?<br />-Hey.
1752291 1754418 -Hello.<br />MURTAUGH: Yeah.
1754585 1756795 - It does smell good.<br />-Great.
1756963 1759090 -They were hiding in the lifeboat.<br />-They were?
1759257 1761634 MURTAUGH: With what the INS guy said,<br />I had to do something.
1761801 1764970 -So you brought them home.<br />- It took two trips.
1765263 1767765 -Really?<br />-They fit in the station wagon?
1768057 1770142 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1770309 1772728 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks pretty good English.
1772895 1776440 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1776983 1778025 Wife?
1778609 1779901 No.
1781070 1782446 Rog, can I speak to you?
1782613 1785032 CARRIE:<br />Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
1785283 1786993 I'm hungry. I'd love some.
1788035 1791872 Are you out of your mind? This is illegal.<br />As in, "against the law."
1792039 1793832 You'll bring a shitstorm<br />down on you.
1794000 1796877 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1797670 1801131 The way I see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1801299 1804885 And I'm freeing slaves,<br />I'm freeing slaves...
1805052 1808055 ...like no one did<br />for my ancestors. Okay?
1809265 1813018 Riggs, it's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1816022 1818733 Why didn't you say so?<br />This is not gonna be boring.
1818899 1820525 Need any help?
1820693 1821819 Okay.
1822278 1823612 Where is he?
1824947 1826823 Hey, Daddy.
1826991 1828909 What is it this time,<br />food or money?
1829076 1830327 -Food and money.<br />-Money.
1830494 1832412 I see you more<br />than when you lived here.
1832580 1833998 We're independent now.
1834165 1835875 Okay, okay. What's the money for?
1836042 1838252 -Hookers, drugs--<br />-Contraceptives.
1838419 1840462 Can you believe they talk to<br />their father like this?
1840629 1844507 -Better than their parole officer.<br />CARRIE: It costs more to go to school now.
1845176 1846927 Me first, me first.
1847094 1849304 I get the tuition bills.<br />And the grades too.
1849472 1852516 Consider this a down payment<br />on a future ass-chewing.
1852683 1855394 Get out of here and go to school.<br />I wanna see some grades.
1855561 1857145 I see the tuition.
1857313 1861066 I want to see some grades!<br />I want more cluck for my buck.
1861233 1862651 NICK:<br />Thanks for the money.
1864820 1866571 -Oh, boy.<br />-I'm tired.
1866739 1868532 Me, I can't win.
1868699 1869866 Boy!
1871243 1873995 Did we get a raise<br />and nobody told me about it?
1876624 1878417 Heh, heh. I got to get to the bank.
1878751 1881628 How can you when you're taken<br />to the cleaners all the time?
1881796 1883214 Yeah.
1884173 1885591 Hey, guys.
1885758 1888051 -Hey, Trish.<br />-Hey, babe.
1888219 1891013 -Those the kids leaving?<br />-Yes. And we're broke.
1891263 1892305 Is Lorna here?
1892473 1895309 Yeah. She's in the kitchen,<br />probably on her third breakfast.
1895559 1897435 I remember those days.
1898062 1901231 -Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.<br />-I love it when you do that.
1902900 1904735 -You look terrific.<br />-Thank you.
1904902 1907571 Wait till she starts trying to raise<br />that baby by herself.
1907738 1909281 Daddy, I'll be fine.
1909448 1912701 Move back in and Grandpa Rog<br />will be up all night with the baby.
1912993 1915078 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1917415 1919583 Well, you know, a cop or something.
1919750 1920834 True.
1921001 1922711 Come on, guys. See you.
1922878 1925171 - I should say goodbye.<br />TRISH: Hey, Lorna.
1925339 1926840 MURTAUGH:<br />Hurry up.
1927007 1928800 RIGGS:<br />Oh, yeah. Stuffing your face.
1928968 1931303 Stop kissing me. Try that.
1931470 1933597 You stay away from my girl.
1933764 1936224 I'm not joking.<br />Stay away from my girl.
1936392 1939019 -Joking.<br />-Bye! Got the baby beeper?
1939186 1940228 RIGGS:<br />Yeah.
1945568 1947653 - I know.<br />-It's your fault.
1947903 1950363 It's your fault.<br />All the chicken shit.
1950698 1952616 Flapping all over the place.
1954869 1955995 All right, everybody!
1956162 1960249 It's been a year almost already, okay?<br />This shit ain't funny no more!
1961208 1964711 -All right? Enough is enough!<br />-Please! Enough.
1965004 1968924 I'm the one that gets it in the neck. Can we<br />exercise a little maturity around here?
1969091 1971593 If I find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1972553 1974137 What asshole is doing this?
1974305 1977224 Riggs, I catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1977391 1978392 That's it.
1978559 1980227 RIGGS: Cut their balls off.<br />-Captain.
1980394 1982270 Hey, captain.
1982438 1985274 MURPHY: I look out expecting<br />to see all the old faces.
1985524 1988985 Instead, I see a bunch of kids<br />whose names I barely remember.
1989153 1993157 Will you sit down?<br />We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
1993324 1994658 Speak for yourself.
1994825 1996701 We're making way for the new police:
1996911 2001411 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
2006253 2009381 -Biter has a psychology degree?<br />-More like a psycho degree.
2009548 2012133 Hell, I got nothing against it.<br />Times have got to change.
2012426 2015178 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
2015346 2017056 That's how far back I go.
2018516 2020226 You wanted to see us<br />about something?
2020392 2022143 Some things don't change.
2022311 2025272 -Here we go.<br />MURPHY: The department lost its insurance.
2025439 2028442 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one...
2028609 2030986 ...while you two guys<br />are still running around.
2032446 2034739 They can't fire you either.
2034907 2037701 So they're promoting you.
2038786 2039912 -Heh.<br />-Eh.
2040079 2043123 -Lieutenant.<br />MURPHY: There's no open lieutenant spots.
2043290 2047127 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />he's making you captains.
2048546 2050297 -Better.<br />-Captain.
2050548 2054510 Time was when this would send me<br />over the falls. I'm getting old.
2055844 2057428 So, what the hell we do now?
2057596 2058847 I don't know, captain shit.
2059014 2061474 -Hang out.<br />MURTAUGH: Take long lunches.
2061642 2064978 Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain.‚Äù
2065145 2068398 MURTAUGH: "Chief's shitting bricks, man."<br />-You finished? You finished?
2068566 2071318 Think you can stay off the streets<br />and out of trouble?
2071485 2072986 Absolutely.
2073153 2075155 -Captain Riggs.<br />-Captain Murtaugh.
2075322 2077324 [LAUGHING]
2079410 2082329 RIGGS: All right, hey.<br />-Hey, this is--
2082496 2083747 MURPHY:<br />Hey.
2084248 2087584 You want your badges? Let me see<br />those sergeant badges. Give me those.
2087751 2090044 -Throw them over here.<br />RIGGS: Never liked it.
2090212 2091880 -Here.<br />-Give me those.
2092047 2095050 This is one of the most painful<br />fucking experiences of my life.
2095217 2097177 -Now get out of here.<br />-Thank you, captain.
2097344 2099179 -Thank you, captain.<br />-Thank you, captain.
2099346 2100972 -Captain, after you.<br />-After you, captain.
2101140 2103350 Enough with the "captain‚Äù shit.<br />Get out of here.
2103517 2107479 After you, captain, I insist!<br />"O Captain! My Captain!"
2107771 2110148 -Captains outrageous!<br />-News travels fast.
2110441 2113569 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis...
2113861 2115070 [SINGING]<br />They got brown rings
2115237 2116863 ALL:<br />Around their noses
2118198 2120992 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper for a ride.
2121160 2123328 -Not for me.<br />RIGGS: I'll take a rain check.
2123495 2126122 -If you change your mind, call us.<br />-He's down-to-earth kind of guy.
2126290 2127708 Aw.
2128292 2129543 I'm sorry.
2131462 2135382 Can we knock this shit off, please?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2135549 2138843 -Can we knock it off, please? Okay?<br />-Jesus.
2139011 2141638 The man's got feelings, you know?
2142598 2144266 [PEOPLE LAUGHING]
2148896 2150647 BUTTERS:<br />Hey, congratulations. Look at you.
2150814 2152649 Captain Murtaugh.
2152816 2156945 I don't really know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2158822 2160240 Keep it up.
2160407 2161741 RIGGS:<br />How's it going, Burton?
2161909 2164661 -It's Butters, captain.<br />-Yeah. I'll remember that.
2164828 2167622 -Kid really likes you.<br />- I wish he'd cut that shit out.
2167790 2169333 He likes me?
2171502 2174254 -Likes me?<br />-What?
2175881 2180381 No. You don't think he likes me,<br />likes me, likes me...
2181595 2183972 -...likes me like that?<br />-Oh.
2186850 2189060 This is not the military,<br />it's the police force.
2189228 2191438 The millennium's creeping up on us.
2191605 2195233 The captain said,<br />"New people, new department.‚Äù
2202991 2205743 -Dr. Woods?<br />WOODS: Yes.
2205911 2207829 Oh. Captain Riggs.
2207996 2209872 -Don't run.<br />-I'm in a rush.
2210040 2213293 -I need to talk to you.<br />-Do you? Ah. What is it this time?
2213460 2215962 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2216130 2219716 -Or did you cook up something new?<br />-I'm sorry about all that.
2219883 2222218 I wanted your advice.<br />I was thinking of--
2222386 2224471 -Thinking?<br />-Marriage.
2224638 2225680 [LAUGHS]
2225848 2228141 Marriage? The "M" word?
2228308 2230852 Does "confidentiality"<br />mean anything to you?
2231019 2232478 That's funny.
2232646 2235398 You know what would happen?<br />We'd go in my office...
2235566 2237776 -...and you know what you'd tell me?<br />-What?
2237943 2241071 You'd tell me something like, "Doc...
2241238 2243448 ...I want to marry Murtaugh."
2243615 2246618 Or your mother maybe.<br />Or how about Nelson Mandela?
2246785 2247827 Nelson Mandela?
2247995 2250539 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2250789 2253374 Something to get a rise out of me.
2253876 2255168 Listen carefully.
2255335 2258004 I'm not stupid.
2258505 2260673 And my time is reserved...
2260841 2265053 ...for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2265220 2266679 Have you got that?
2267681 2269265 -Have you?<br />-Run it by me again?
2269516 2271893 No. And you know what?
2272060 2273352 I don't like you.
2277649 2278900 RIGGS:<br />Stephanie?
2279568 2282612 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship. I'm very happy.
2282780 2285073 I think you need to see someone.
2285240 2287659 You'll find someone someday<br />who'll love you.
2287910 2290996 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2291163 2293081 WOODS:<br />You're disgusting!
2293248 2294999 What's the matter with you people?
2300422 2301589 What's shaking?
2301757 2303800 -Captain Riggs.<br />-Captain Murtaugh.
2303967 2306803 You're supposed to turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2306970 2308930 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2309097 2311307 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2311475 2314895 They were short, but big enough<br />to kick your ass. What can I do for you?
2315062 2318565 One of the ship's crew shot one of<br />the illegals, apparently under orders...
2318732 2322652 ...and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese these days.
2322861 2326698 We got no hard evidence, but we're<br />pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan.
2326865 2328074 MURTAUGH:<br />Uncle Benny?
2328242 2329952 -You know him?<br />RIGGS: Yeah.
2330118 2332995 -Back when he was running smack.<br />-We never nailed him either.
2333163 2334414 Benny's slippery.
2334581 2336499 Where's he hanging out these days?
2336667 2338919 He's got a nightclub,<br />couple restaurants.
2339086 2342339 He operates mainly out on North Broadway.<br />Here's the address.
2344132 2346425 -Hi, fellas.<br />MAN: Riggs.
2346718 2348761 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers.
2348929 2350513 BUTTERS:<br />Butters.
2350681 2352724 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2352891 2356686 I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2356854 2358188 Checked out the boat.
2358355 2362025 Turns out the boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2362276 2365153 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2365404 2366988 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2367239 2369783 Benny Chan.<br />No. What kind of bad man is he?
2369950 2372035 Real bad.<br />Big crime boss in Chinatown.
2372202 2374829 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2374997 2376790 Where do I find him?
2376957 2378124 At this restaurant.
2378292 2380836 I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.<br />How about you?
2381003 2383296 Since we're going there anyway,<br />we'll drive you.
2383463 2385548 Chinese? Let me get my jacket.
2386091 2388635 -Riggs, not with him.<br />-The kid's doing a good job.
2388886 2390387 We might need backup.
2390554 2393807 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2393974 2395308 Like a son.
2395475 2397018 -A son?<br />-In law...
2397227 2399562 ...enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2399730 2401815 He might have to back you up<br />one day.
2404109 2405443 [MURTAUGH CLEARS THROAT]
2406486 2410156 Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor<br />to share some egg rolls with you.
2410574 2413159 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2413368 2414786 Share?
2416580 2420166 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2420334 2423420 -If you don't mind me saying so.<br />-Why do you say that, sir?
2423587 2427090 It's just last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2427257 2429217 -Wasn't he, Roger?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
2429384 2431386 Any particular reason?
2431553 2433930 About 150,000 of them.
2434097 2437433 That's how many bullets zinged around<br />my neighborhood growing up.
2437601 2440687 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2440854 2445024 Lived on the floor, ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2445525 2448194 I didn't learn how to walk<br />till I was 10 years old.
2448362 2452407 Spent most of my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2452574 2455910 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2456078 2459372 I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor,<br />and it pisses me off.
2460707 2462125 Hey.
2463251 2466837 -We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />-No, why?
2467047 2469716 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look too hard.
2469883 2472552 BUTTERS: Who's Leo?<br />-Maybe it's a coincidence.
2472719 2476055 BUTTERS: What does he want?<br />-I don't know. Let's find out.
2476223 2477849 Yeah. Heh, heh, heh.
2478475 2479809 [SIREN CHIRPS]
2485399 2488068 DRIVER: Fucking asshole!<br />LEO: Bite me! Bite me, okay?
2488235 2491446 Whatever! Whatever! Jerk.
2492531 2493823 You looking for us, Leo?
2493991 2496576 -You saw me?<br />MURTAUGH: Yeah, we saw you.
2496743 2498202 What you doing, Leo?
2498370 2502082 I've been perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I. and all.
2502249 2506503 He's a private eyesore.<br />Nice inconspicuous vehicle. I like it.
2507546 2509005 Riggs, who's the perp?
2509214 2511549 -What'd you bust him for?<br />-I'm a perp?
2511717 2515137 A young brother in back of a police car,<br />automatically I'm a perp?
2515303 2519265 Look at my suit! Look at my tie!<br />Do I look like the fucking Crips' accountant?
2519433 2521226 Look at this badge, bitch.
2521393 2523186 -Check out the gun.<br />-Okay, okay.
2523353 2525104 Put the gun down. Put the gun down.
2525272 2528024 License. Registration.<br />Urine sample.
2528191 2529483 I got a badge too, okay?
2529651 2532236 German Jews didn't have it<br />any easier when we were kids.
2532404 2534364 So don't think you're the only one.<br />Okay?
2534531 2536241 Besides, I knew you were a cop.
2536408 2539369 I was kidding with you.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.
2539536 2541621 Oh, I smell bad?<br />What you trying to say?
2541788 2544457 Stop turning everything around!<br />You're so damn touchy.
2544624 2547043 These guys'll tell you.<br />We got a history together.
2547210 2550796 Maybe we'll work together someday!<br />I'm the bomb! They'll tell you.
2550964 2554968 We'll work together when I open<br />a cereal shop, you leprechaun!
2555135 2557595 I didn't call you names, fuckface!<br />Don't start!
2557763 2559806 Okay? Don't fool around!
2559973 2563101 -These guys'll tell you everything.<br />-Sir, you're double-parked.
2563435 2566229 Officer, I'm just talking<br />with the detectives.
2566563 2568940 -We don't know this guy.<br />MURTAUGH: Yeah.
2569107 2570566 Think he might've been drinking.
2570734 2572277 They're kidding. Come back!
2572444 2575029 I wasn't drinking.<br />They just said that.
2575197 2578575 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.
2578742 2581161 Blow in my fucking ear!
2581328 2583872 -Okay, okay, okay.<br />OFFICER: You're all mine. You're mine!

2618198 2620158 We have three people.
2620325 2623536 The restaurant's over there.<br />Go this way, please.
2623703 2625746 BUTTERS: They see us,<br />but we can't see them.
2625956 2628625 -Where's your green card?<br />-That's a racist remark.
2628792 2631628 I'm a policeman who asked for<br />your green card!
2631837 2632921 This is not the way.
2633088 2635548 You're the boss<br />till we get up in his ass.
2638260 2640971 It'll be fine.<br />Hey, they've refurbished.
2641138 2643223 -I couldn't stop them.<br />RIGGS: Hey, fellas.

2645767 2648478 Uncle Benny!<br />I hope this is a bad time.
2648687 2651815 -He still hasn't clipped his eyebrows.<br />MURTAUGH: What'd we tell you?
2651982 2655944 -We hate not disturbing you.<br />-This is Detective Buckles.

2676423 2680009 Know about a boatload of illegals<br />that went aground last night?
2680760 2682428 Just what I saw on the news.
2682679 2684472 Some snakehead lost big money.
2684639 2687558 Four hundred people at 35 grand.<br />Fourteen million, Uncle Benny.
2687726 2688768 [RIGGS WHISTLES]
2688935 2690937 And missed out on making slaves<br />out of them.
2691229 2695608 You are cops. I thought<br />smuggling Chinese was an INS problem.
2695775 2699111 We found three bodies full of holes,<br />so now it's a cop problem.
2699279 2700655 Three dead Chinese?
2701114 2704408 -Billion more where they came from.<br />RIGGS: That's right, life's cheap.
2704576 2707287 Problem is, he shot at me and Rog too.<br />That pisses us off.
2707454 2711954 Heh, heh, heh. Too bad they missed.<br />But still I don't know anything about it.
2713919 2716087 Hey. Who's he?
2717380 2720216 Hey. He doesn't look too happy.<br />What's his name?
2720425 2723845 Who is he? Who's this guy?<br />Is he just appraising your furniture?
2724054 2725805 He doesn't speak English.
2725972 2729976 Yeah? Then he doesn't understand<br />words like "scumbag"...
2730727 2732145 ..."eat shit"?
2733271 2735523 I think he understands good.

6728638 6731140 ...and he jumped out of the box...
6731307 6733851 ...and I ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6734018 6735853 I killed him.
6736020 6738689 I was really heartbroken. Really.
6739690 6743443 He was my best friend in the whole world,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6743611 6745696 And then I met you...
6745863 6747447 ...and Roger.
6747615 6751243 You guys really looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6751869 6753704 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6753871 6755372 No, it's okay.
6755539 6757249 It's okay.
6757416 6759334 You're my family...
6759502 6761212 ...and my friends.
6763381 6766592 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />you're just different.
6773391 6776227 And I just thought that maybe<br />that might be relevant.
6780856 6782899 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6783859 6785694 Leo...
6786362 6788489 I got a funny f-- Oh.
6788656 6791033 -What's the matter?<br />-Oh. I'm having a baby.
6791200 6793619 -What?<br />-It's Lorna. She beeped me.
6793786 6795871 Yep, it's Lorna.<br />She's having the baby.
6796038 6799332 -Holy shit. I'll get the car.<br />-I'll be two steps behind you.
6806299 6808676 You sure picked a strange angel, honey.
6809093 6810427 [CHUCKLES]
6810845 6812555 But I got the message.
6813848 6815432 I got the message.
6821689 6823607 I'll always have this.
6824191 6825609 Always have you.
6826277 6827945 In here and here.
6829280 6830614 Thanks, honey.
6830781 6832741 I gotta go. Bye.
6833409 6835411 I am not ready to have this baby!
6835578 6838247 NURSE:<br />You're as ready as you're going to be.
6838414 6840082 Fine! Just wheel me in.
6840249 6842918 My legs are staying closed!
6843085 6844461 Give me this!
6844628 6846046 Ma'am, let go.
6846464 6849425 I am a police officer.<br />And I am not ready.
6851218 6854763 I am L.A.P.D. and I can arrest you<br />for interfering...
6855723 6857474 Lorna, are you all right?
6857641 6859100 NURSE: Are you the husband?<br />-Yes.
6859268 6860560 Honey, are you all right?
6860770 6861812 No, I'm not, Riggs.
6861979 6864231 I said I didn't wanna get married,<br />but I do.
6864398 6867109 I want to be a wife before<br />I'm a mother. And I lied.
6867276 6869319 - I know you don't want to.<br />-Okay.
6870571 6872739 -You said "okay"?<br />-Yes, I did. Okay.
6872907 6874241 Let's do it. Okay.
6875201 6876911 -He said okay.<br />-Yes.
6877078 6879455 WOMAN: Congratulations.<br />-He said okay, Leo.
6879622 6881373 Oh, my God.
6881540 6883416 What's that smell?
6883584 6886587 I was on my way to the toilet<br />and she grabbed me.
6886796 6889590 -I'm so sorry.<br />-Have a nice baby.
6891425 6892801 I'm so sorry.
6895763 6897598 Will you marry me?
6899266 6900850 Oh, Riggs.
6901018 6903061 -You bet I will, Riggs.<br />-Okay.
6905398 6906649 Let's go.
6906816 6910444 I'm not going. Wait, no, no, no.<br />Wait, wait. Please, Riggs.
6910611 6911987 -Get a minister.<br />-Now?
6912196 6915157 Now. Because we're getting married.<br />Here comes another one.
6915324 6917993 -We need a license, blood test--<br />-I wanna hear the words...
6918160 6920162 -...before the baby comes.<br />-It's coming now.
6920329 6922998 Listen, I am getting married<br />or there is no baby.
6923165 6925750 This could be an aspect<br />of a transition phase.
6925918 6929129 This is no goddamn aspect<br />of a goddamn transition phase!
6929296 6931172 Honey, everybody, calm down.
6931340 6933008 Calm down. Okay?
6933175 6935677 -Get a priest, minister, anything.<br />-Where?
6935845 6938806 Go get a priest!<br />Goddamn it, Leo!
6938973 6940474 I got it, I got it. Okay.
6940808 6942768 RIGGS: Pant, pant, blow.<br />Remember Lamaze class?
6942935 6944770 Pant, blow. Pant, pant, blow.
6944937 6946939 [RIGGS & LORNA PANTING]
6947523 6950526 -But I want to say "I do."<br />RIGGS: Hey, look. Here he is.
6950693 6952361 This is Rabbi Gelb.
6952528 6955197 -A rabbi?<br />-You said anything.
6955364 6956782 No, no, no. He'll do.
6956949 6958492 For what I'll do?<br />What's going on?
6958659 6961036 We'd like you to marry us.<br />Please.
6961203 6963038 -You're Jewish?<br />-Not necessarily.
6963205 6964289 -You got a license?<br />-No.
6964457 6967042 -Well...<br />-Please don't go.
6967209 6969920 She needs to hear the words<br />before the baby comes.
6970087 6972589 Are you both serious?<br />I don't have time for hijinks.
6972756 6975300 Real serious, rabbi.<br />We're very serious.
6975634 6977552 I could do it.<br />It wouldn't be official.
6977720 6979805 It's all right.<br />I just want to hear the words.
6979972 6981890 What the hell. What are your names?
6982057 6983725 I'm Martin and this is Lorna.
6983893 6985227 Martin and Lorna.
6985394 6986436 [SPEAKING IN HEBREW]
6986604 6989231 What am I doing?<br />How do the goyim do this?
6990357 6992359 -Dearly beloved.<br />-That's it. Dearly beloved...
6992526 6997026 Dearly beloved,<br />marriage is a spiritual union...
6997490 6998699 Oh, Rabbi.
6998866 7001493 NURSE: Faster, faster.<br />She's heading for the home stretch.
7001869 7004121 Martin, will you take<br />Lorna to be your wife?
7004288 7007791 Will you honor, love, et cetera...
7007958 7010085 -...till death do you part?<br />- I will.

7018093 7019928 You may kiss the bride.<br />You already did.
7020095 7022097 -Let's go.<br />-No, wait, wait, wait.
7022264 7024099 RIGGS: What? What?<br />LEO: Hold it, hold it, hold it.
7024266 7026393 -What is it?<br />LEO: Let me have this glass.
7026560 7028103 I need this!
7028270 7031773 No, goddamn it!<br />What the hell are you doing? Aah!
7031941 7034401 Talk to the hand, okay?<br />I'll be right back. Wait, wait.
7034693 7037779 You know how long it took me<br />to fill that thing? All day!
7037947 7041075 This is unsanitary.<br />What is this?
7041242 7043619 -Break the glass.<br />-I'll get piss on my shoes.

7135628 7137838 Leo, your plastic's flaccid.<br />Face it.
7138005 7141008 These machines wreck your plastic,<br />then give you the camera.
