30653 33008 Riggs, you sure we're on<br />the right street?
33693 34808 We must be getting warm.
35773 38446 - You see anything?<br />- Where? I don't see anything.
38733 39927 This must be the place.
40173 41401 Holy shit!
42813 44132 What the hell is that?
48173 49083 Jesus!
49813 50802 Who's this joker?
51013 52810 I don't know.<br />A spokesman for the NRA.
53853 54842 Regular asshole.
55053 56202 What do we do now?
57253 58083 Run him over.
58933 60685 What if he shoots us with that rifle?
60933 63766 - He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.<br />- What if he does?
64133 66886 Don't be a Don't-Bee.<br />Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.
67173 67969 Positive?
69093 71368 - Run him over.<br />- Glad you see things my way.
71613 72807 I hope he doesn't turn.
73173 76051 He won't. We'll creep up on him<br />so he won't notice.
77493 80803 Will him not to turn.<br />Power of positive thinking.
81013 82605 Don't turn.<br />Will him with me.
83573 84528 Don't turn around.
84813 86883 I need you.<br />Don't turn around!
87973 88769 Just believe!
88973 89883 Don't turn around!
90133 92044 We're better than him.
92293 93248 We're better!
95093 96082 He's turning.
108693 110331 They just bounce off him!
110573 111926 I saw! We're in trouble!
112813 116089 Shit! I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
116333 118801 No, I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
118973 122488 Are you crazy?! You got<br />a wife, kids. I got less to lose!
127373 128488 Get out of here!
132293 135205 I'm not supposed to tell you,<br />but Lorna's pregnant.
137733 138927 What'd you say?
139253 141528 You'll be a father!
145933 149243 She was afraid to tell you.<br />She was afraid you'd get angry.
149533 151046 You never talked about children?
151533 152966 - Shit!<br />- A baby.
161533 164206 There's something I'm not<br />supposed to tell you too.
164493 167724 Rianne's pregnant. You're going<br />to be a grandfather.
167973 168962 Rianne's what?!
174453 176728 Rianne can't be pregnant.
177093 178811 She's not married.
179053 181442 I don't think she intended<br />to get that way.
193093 195288 They asking me to be a granddaddy?
223013 225049 Here's what we'll do.<br />Take your clothes off!
225373 226203 What for?
227373 228408 Okay, you run.
228653 230723 Flame-O sees you in your undies.
230973 232850 It distracts him,<br />then I shoot.
233053 235203 - Shoot what?<br />- The valve on that napalm tank!
235493 236892 Before he shoots me?
237133 238646 - Maybe.<br />- Maybe?!
248733 249563 Is he black?
249893 251724 Too much armor on.<br />I can't tell!
251973 254806 No! Not him!<br />The father of the baby!
256453 258045 Please let him be black!
264413 265812 Get going! Here he comes!
266973 268088 Are those hearts?
268373 270523 Not now, Riggs.<br />Just hit the damn valve!
270693 273048 Also, flap and make noises<br />like a bird.
273333 274971 Flap my arms? Why?
275213 277363 Lt'll distract him more.<br />I need him to turn.
279253 280891 - On 2!<br />- We always go on 3.
281133 282566 No time for 3. 2!
282813 284883 - What about 1?<br />- Okay. 1, 2, go!
285133 286930 I don't want to die in my underwear!
288813 290883 Why are you waiting?<br />Shoot the bastard!
325453 329082 Riggs, you think<br />that bird thing helped?
329453 332092 I just wanted to see if you'd do it.
334653 336006 Cute shorts.
338813 340007 Go spit!
341613 342932 I'll buy you a doughnut.
343253 345369 Don't hug me when I'm naked.
345613 347604 You're ashamed of your butt?
356213 357612 He's a lively one.
360733 363293 That shark hurts my boat,<br />I take it out on you, Leo.
363533 366127 - I didn't mean to catch it.<br />- Why do you want to keep it?
366453 368125 Yeah, why keep a shark?
368413 370051 The teeth'll look great on a wall.
370293 371612 They got to stop snapping first.
371893 373372 Maybe he'll fall asleep.
373613 375444 Converse with him.<br />He'll nod off.
375693 378765 - He don't look tired.<br />- Chewing on Leo will wear him out.
379053 381203 Sharks eat their own kind?
383253 384811 Stop it!<br />I'm in stitches!
386773 388252 Okay, where's my bag?
388533 389648 Starboard side aft.
390293 391806 Starboard, that's left, right?
392053 394806 No, port's left.<br />Starboard's right.
395573 398531 Right, yeah. Right side aft.<br />Got it!
398773 400809 - Whatever.<br />- Check both sides.
401133 403044 Careful!<br />He's behind you, shark!
406053 407486 Maybe we should throw him overboard.
407853 409650 Throw them both overboard.
410853 413925 No witnesses.<br />We'd probably get away with it.
416773 417967 You too?
421453 423648 I kept my nose out of it�
425213 427010 �but you and Lorna.
428493 431803 You're having a baby,<br />you're living together.
432933 434161 You're not marrying.
435573 438406 Why, does that violate your<br />family values system?
438933 441686 I'm just trying to understand.
443653 445245 Rianne's not married either.
445573 447643 That's hitting below the belt.
451653 453803 You know, when I was married�
454413 456244 �it was good. You know.
456493 459007 You put the ring on.<br />You make the commitment.
459933 461605 You do all the�
463933 465446 She's dead because I'm a cop.
466533 468922 She's dead because I'm a cop<br />and I�
469213 471408 I don't wear the ring anymore�
472253 474209 �but I look, and it's still there.
474453 476011 I still feel it.
477693 480969 It's like I'm not<br />finished with that yet.
481213 483363 I can't explain it.<br />Is that bullshit?
483893 485804 No. It's not finished.
486853 488411 It's not finished.
492493 494688 Okay, you did say "aft"?
494933 496525 A-F-T. Aft!
496933 498127 That's a fucking word?
498733 500769 In the back on the right side, Leo!
501373 504092 Why didn't you say that<br />to begin with, Roger?!
504653 508692 People get around boats and water,<br />everything becomes nautical!
508973 511203 "Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!
511813 513485 Man the bilge pump!"
513733 515451 Pump your fucking ass!
515693 516808 All right, all right!
519533 521444 No problem, no problem!
524773 526331 What's Lorna say about it?
526573 528370 She doesn't like nautical terms either.
529693 532651 We haven't discussed it.<br />That's pretty messed up.
532893 536522 The baby's due in days and you<br />haven't talked about marrying?
536813 537882 No.
538253 540209 I haven't done it at all.
542413 544051 Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
544293 545487 I want Leo to shoot�
545733 546529 No, Leo!
546973 548008 What?!
549693 552332 - What's the deal?!<br />- You're shooting a gun on my boat!
552533 554569 I'm not shooting your boat,<br />I'm shooting Jaws.
554773 558482 Nobody's killing it<br />just to have its teeth!
558693 561810 You're grumpy since you<br />learned you'll be a grandpa.
562093 563412 Get off of me, will you?
563653 565086 Don't fool around!
566413 568643 Some piece of hardware!<br />Got a permit?
568853 570809 Of course!<br />I'm a P.I. Now.
571093 574210 A gumshoe! You get in<br />ugly situations. I got guns!
574693 576251 You are an ugly situation.
576453 579445 You don't deserve this.<br />You're not safe.
580613 581887 Smart move, Riggs.
582813 583689 Shit!
586213 587089 Hard right!
589133 590327 You hear shots?
590573 592564 Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7.</i>
600493 602688 We're in L.A. Harbor.
603213 604407 We got an 07.
607733 609086 They're getting away!
609333 611210 Who was it? Do we know?
612253 614289 No, no, I'll drive!
617173 619641 - Want me to help?<br />- Get out of here!
620053 621088 This your gun?
621333 622846 Yeah, want laser surgery?
623133 624885 You could blind somebody!
628093 630766 Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7,</i><br /><i>in pursuit of freighter.</i>
631133 632122 Heading north.
632453 634091 Awaiting instructions. Over.
634453 636921 <i>Code 7,</i><br /><i>maintain your present course.</i>
637213 638851 <i>We have a cutter en route.</i>
639493 640767 Why you slowing down?
641013 643971 We'll hang here.<br />Coast Guard'll be here soon.
644213 646443 - What do we do now?<br />- Show them our badges.
646733 647768 LAPD!
648133 649009 LAPD!
649293 650965 Los Angeles Police Department!
651133 653089 We heard gunfire!<br />The Coast Guard's on the�
679613 682173 Coast Guard!<br />Freighter's on fire!
682453 684842 - Let's board them.<br />- What are you talking about?!
685173 687004 Fire on the freighter!
691853 694651 Okay, I'm upside.<br />Now what do you do?
694973 696725 They're getting away.<br />Get me up there!
702493 703892 Hell of a fishing trip!
704093 707085 Shut up and keep your head down!
707333 708322 LAPD!
708533 711286 Stop where you are!<br />Hold it right there!
713893 716043 He's got it! He's got it!
719133 720327 What'd he say?
720573 721722 Watch his back!
724413 725971 You didn't say you'd shoot!
727653 729211 Tie it up!
730853 732002 Pull it up!
739013 740082 Great!
740893 742849 I said keep the boat closer!
744453 745886 Why listen to Leo?
754733 755882 Shit!
765413 766926 You all right, Riggs?!
769613 770602 Look!
773053 774247 Shit!
774453 776045 Jump! Jump!
781933 783412 Where are you?
784053 786487 My boat! My new boat!
803213 806091 - The shark.<br />- What about the shark?
806413 807607 Shark!
810253 811925 Don't leave me!
825053 826042 Come on!
836653 838325 - Hurry up!<br />- I'm coming!
857373 858522 You'll make it!
866173 867731 This is all I got left.
894453 897047 Four sets of papers, totally genuine.
897373 900092 They'll get in the country<br />and can stay forever.
900413 902051 U.S. Citizens.
903293 905204 Ask them to vote the incumbent party.
905453 907967 Help me keep my State Department job.
908253 909481 Bloody marvelous!
909853 913368 They red-flag Asian visas.<br />Those were hard to slip through.
914213 917171 The ship's been impounded.
918213 919282 What about the family?
920533 922489 We don't know yet.
922973 925248 Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
927653 928972 Something wrong?
931133 933852 A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.
938613 940524 Goodbye.
940733 941609 Leave!
948333 949561 I'll find them.
950093 951162 Now.
1013173 1015641 Coast Guard interdicts<br />about one a month.
1016013 1017082 Pretty raggedy-looking.
1017413 1019881 Six weeks locked in a hole<br />with one toilet.
1020133 1023443 Rice and some fish to eat.<br />Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.
1023853 1025969 Where'd they get that kind of money?
1026293 1030172 Didn't. Got to work it off from<br />the snakeheads, the smugglers.
1030853 1032923 - They sell them as cheap labor.<br />- Sell them?
1033133 1033929 Like slaves.
1036613 1038444 These must be the lucky ones.
1038733 1042521 They'll claim asylum. Say they were<br />persecuted, like everybody else.
1042893 1046249 We'll send them packing.<br />Cost you and me a fortune.
1046613 1048808 What happened to,<br />"Bring me your tired, your poor�
1049053 1051442 �your wretched masses,<br />yearning to be free"?
1051973 1053725 Now it reads, "No vacancies."
1054453 1057411 I guess your parents<br />were Native Americans.
1061813 1063849 They pop one every boatload.
1064293 1067046 Shows the rest what'll happen<br />if they run off.
1069373 1070852 He's nobody's slave now.
1072693 1074206 Don't coddle them, move them!
1074533 1076763 I see this barrel coming down.
1077053 1079328 Murtaugh didn't see it,<br />so I push him.
1079693 1082253 I knock him over.<br />We're in the water.
1082533 1085047 I pull because he can't swim.<br />I got to save him.
1085613 1088844 There's that kid.<br />What's his name? Bissel?
1089133 1091363 - It's a food.<br />- Burger!
1091693 1093092 No, Biscuits or something.
1093413 1096007 He always kisses my ass,<br />gives me coffee and shit.
1096253 1099370 Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />What are you doing here?
1099573 1102212 - That's a long story.<br />- You're all wet!
1102653 1104086 - You need a blanket?<br />- I'm fine.
1104533 1107889 - Somebody get this man a blanket now!<br />- Yes, sir!
1108653 1111725 - Get this body out of here.<br />- What do we got here?
1112013 1113765 Step back, step back.
1115373 1116692 Shit!
1117053 1119123 He's dead.<br />He's fucking dead!
1119493 1120642 - Shit!<br />- What?
1120933 1123367 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1123653 1125211 Was he in the killing section?
1125613 1127444 This guy's been shot four times!
1128533 1131001 At close range, like he was executed!
1131213 1132362 He was executed.
1132573 1133369 By the crew.
1134293 1139128 People get killed left, right<br />and center in this town!
1139373 1141011 Now we import victims?
1141373 1144490 Gangbangers kill each other,<br />no problem!
1144773 1147082 One of us gets shot,<br />occupational hazard!
1147493 1151486 But just a normal guy?<br />What did he ever do to anybody?!
1151773 1153445 - That ain't right.<br />- Easy, Biscuits.
1153613 1155729 You'll get an ulcer.<br />Settle down.
1156053 1156883 Blanket!
1158493 1159687 Sorry, Blankets.
1160613 1162171 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1162493 1165326 I hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1165693 1169572 We'd stick around, Butler,<br />but you're in charge so�
1169893 1172691 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1173013 1177052 - Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />- All right, Boogers.
1177813 1179565 Hey, get them out of here!
1180373 1181852 Get them out of here!
1182693 1185253 He takes the job kind of personally.
1185453 1188889 Yeah, he's pretty serious, I'd say.<br />Overzealous.
1189093 1190492 Jealous of who?
1190693 1193412 - I don't know. Who?<br />- You said he was jealous.
1193613 1194841 You just said�
1195133 1197203 I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1197413 1199165 He's loud too.
1199413 1200971 - He's loud!<br />- What?
1201413 1203210 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1203413 1204812 I got something in the lifeboat.
1205093 1207812 That's okay,<br />I'll catch a squad ride.
1210573 1212325 I'm sorry about your boat.
1215493 1217609 - I'm sorry.<br />- Shit!
1217893 1221488 Suddenly, a big fucking shark comes�<br />Can I say that?
1221773 1223923 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1224173 1226812 So this big darn shark comes along�
1238453 1240091 My <i>Code 7.</i>
1284733 1287201 - You were coming home last night.<br />- I'm sorry.
1287813 1289087 I had some bad Chinese.
1290653 1292405 You look a little banged up.
1292733 1294769 You look a little knocked up.
1297053 1298452 Are you okay?
1298653 1299881 You sure?
1300653 1302609 Easy, tiger!<br />There he goes again.
1302853 1304445 There she goes again.
1305893 1306689 You okay?
1306933 1309527 I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1309773 1312810 - Boat sank?<br />- I had something to do with it.
1313053 1314372 No! No grease!
1315213 1317602 - Have some cookies.<br />- What happened?
1318973 1321282 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1321733 1322609 Here, boy.
1324333 1325322 Thanks.
1325613 1329492 You were fishing.<br />Does trouble go looking for you?
1329733 1333646 It seems to know pretty much<br />where I am most of the time.
1334413 1336290 You finished the nursery.
1336573 1337608 Yeah, I did.
1337813 1340566 It's good for a girl or boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1340773 1343207 It's a dogfest!<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1343453 1346206 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1346613 1348251 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1351893 1356250 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1367613 1369763 I figured you didn't want that.
1373373 1375045 You want to get married?
1377813 1379087 Well, no.
1381533 1382727 Me neither.
1384053 1385168 Breakfast?
1400893 1403248 <i>Serve and Protect.</i>
1403573 1406246 Since when do you read this smut?
1407693 1411083 It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />Trish gave it to me.
1411293 1414251 "Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1414573 1416370 He devoured her with his eyes."
1417533 1420650 Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1423333 1425801 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1426053 1429170 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1430133 1434012 Have I ever<br />"made your womanhood reach peaks�
1434293 1436204 �to rival the Himalayas"?
1436493 1439883 - Foothills of Malibu, maybe.<br />- Not even a Teton?
1440133 1441486 - I don't think so.<br />- Thanks.
1441773 1444162 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1444413 1446051 You know I'm kidding.
1447133 1450170 - You say that to make me feel better.<br />- No, I don't.
1451253 1452288 You know I'm playing.
1452573 1455041 I've been to plenty of<br />mountaintops with you.
1455413 1457369 It's just that I'm hungry.
1459253 1461608 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.
1461853 1464128 - I brought you a doughnut.<br />- Police food!
1464373 1465522 How did you know?
1467733 1469803 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1470013 1471287 How's the rat squad?
1471533 1474252 - I picked up something good.<br />- Some cheese?
1474693 1477048 I.A. Got an anonymous tip.
1477293 1479443 The person said Roger's on the take.
1480053 1481771 No, he's not.
1482053 1485125 I know! It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1485613 1488411 But with new boats<br />and putting 2 kids through college�
1488653 1490450 �I thought you ought to know.
1490653 1493451 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1493773 1496845 Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1497173 1499243 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1499573 1501165 - That's awful.<br />- I'm kidding.
1501813 1503963 Don't tell him I said it.<br />With his problems�
1504293 1507524 �he'll blow his top.<br />Just don't say anything.
1509293 1510646 What do you mean?
1513173 1514322 Like what?
1514573 1516928 - In general, problems.<br />- You mean something specific.
1517253 1519084 I got a nose for these things. What?
1520373 1523604 You're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1523853 1526890 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better.
1527213 1529408 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1529653 1530642 Tell me.
1530933 1534369 I'll tell you!<br />Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells!
1535333 1536891 What? What?
1537253 1538766 I'm drooling. What?
1540653 1544407 Promise me you'll never<br />say a word about this ever.
1544653 1546245 - I swear, I swear.<br />- Right hand!
1546533 1547886 I swear I won't, ever.
1548173 1549526 I promise. What?
1550733 1553372 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1553613 1554932 He'd kill them. So?
1555373 1559252 Rianne married one, her baby's father.<br />She's afraid to tell Roger.
1559573 1562770 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1563093 1564845 Nobody's telling Roger?
1565053 1566327 After the baby's born.
1566613 1569685 It's a package deal?<br />Take it or leave it?
1570493 1572051 - Does Trish know?<br />- She knows.
1572653 1574803 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1575053 1577487 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1578413 1580643 - Who?<br />- Sergeant Lee Butters.
1581013 1583925 This just gets better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1584213 1585965 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee�
1586213 1588852 Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing!
1589173 1593007 I won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1593413 1597486 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I won't.
1599773 1601001 Promise.
1603293 1607445 We don't have to discuss boys' names.<br />We're having a girl.
1607773 1609445 Okay. Piadora.
1609733 1612167 I like Piadora. That's sweet.
1614933 1616651 I love that name.
1619053 1622443 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1622733 1624928 We don't want to double up.
1625213 1627443 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1627733 1630452 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! I like it better.
1630693 1632809 - Don't get me started.<br />- I like those names.
1633133 1634646 Captain wants to see us.
1634933 1637527 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1637813 1638848 Bye-bye, honey.
1639373 1641204 Who had the sleepover?
1641493 1642721 Just airing out camping gear.
1643053 1644645 - We're out of here.<br />- Something smells good.
1644933 1646048 Really good!
1646333 1648688 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1649173 1650811 That smells like Chinese food.
1651093 1652811 Chinese food?
1653133 1654805 She's into Chinese cooking.
1655133 1657124 I got to taste this.
1657893 1660009 - I love Chinese food.<br />- Hold it! Please!
1660293 1661408 Please!
1662493 1664211 There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
1664493 1665403 I saw him.
1666413 1668244 A couple of Chinese people.
1668613 1670251 Actually a whole family.
1672573 1673528 Large family.
1677253 1678368 Hey, guys!
1683013 1685129 - It does smell good.<br />- Great!
1685373 1687170 They hid in the lifeboat.
1687533 1689569 I had to do something.
1689893 1692805 - So you brought them home.<br />- It took two trips.
1693093 1695482 - Really?<br />- They fit in the station wagon?
1695773 1697764 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1698053 1700123 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks English.
1700373 1703809 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1704533 1705329 Wife?
1708253 1709527 Can we speak?
1709813 1712043 Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
1712293 1713931 I'm hungry. I'd love some.
1714933 1718608 This is illegal.<br />As in, "against the law."
1718893 1720485 You'll bring a shitstorm<br />down on you.
1720853 1723413 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1724173 1727449 The way I see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1727733 1729610 And I'm freeing slaves�
1729973 1733329 �like no one did for my ancestors.
1736173 1738892 It's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1741773 1744333 Why didn't you say so?<br />This won't be boring.
1744613 1746092 Need any help?
1747853 1749047 Where is he?
1752333 1754051 What this time,<br />food or money?
1754293 1755521 - Food and money.<br />- Money.
1755813 1757531 I see you more<br />than when you lived here.
1757813 1759610 We're independent now.
1759853 1760808 What's the money for?
1761093 1762651 - Hookers, drugs�<br />- Contraceptives.
1763293 1765488 Can you believe how<br />they talk to me?
1765773 1768731 It costs more to go to school now.
1769773 1773607 I get the tuition bills.<br />And the grades too!
1773853 1776526 This is a down payment<br />on a future ass-chewing.
1776813 1779088 Get out and go to school.
1779373 1781204 I see the tuition.
1781493 1784849 I want to see some grades!<br />I want more cluck for my buck.
1785173 1786492 Thanks for the money.
1789333 1790209 I'm tired.
1790493 1792131 Me, I can't win.
1792413 1793402 Boy!
1794733 1797372 Did we get a raise<br />and nobody told me?
1799893 1801611 I got to get to the bank.
1801933 1805448 How can you when you're taken<br />to the cleaners all the time?
1807133 1808009 Hey, guys.
1808653 1809688 Hey, Trish!
1811013 1813686 - Both the kids leave?<br />- Yes. And we're broke.
1813933 1814922 Is Lorna here?
1815213 1817807 She's in the kitchen,<br />on her third breakfast.
1818053 1819850 I remember those days.
1821133 1823488 - I'm sorry!<br />- I love it when you do that.
1825093 1826651 You look terrific.
1827013 1829402 Wait till she tries raising<br />that baby by herself.
1829693 1830728 I'll be fine.
1831373 1834490 Move back in and Grandpa'll<br />be up nights with the baby.
1834773 1836764 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1839013 1840492 A cop or something.
1841253 1842242 True.
1842493 1844085 Come on, guys.<br />See you.
1844373 1846091 I should say goodbye.
1846613 1847648 Hurry up!
1848253 1849686 Stuffing your face!
1849973 1852328 Stop kissing me.<br />Try that.
1852573 1854165 Stay away from my girl.
1854653 1857008 I'm not joking.<br />Stay away from my girl.
1857293 1860444 - Joking!<br />- Got the baby beeper?
1866013 1868004 - I know.<br />- It's your fault.
1868253 1870608 It's your fault.<br />All the chicken shit.
1870933 1872764 Flapping all over the place.
1874933 1876002 All right, everybody!
1876333 1880087 It's been a year almost.<br />This shit ain't funny no more!
1881853 1884367 - Enough is enough!<br />- Please! Enough!
1884653 1886644 I'm the one that gets it in the neck.
1886893 1888326 Can we exercise maturity?
1888613 1890968 If I find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1892853 1896368 I catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1897573 1899643 - Cut their balls off.<br />- Captain.
1901373 1904092 I look out expecting<br />to see all the old faces.
1904333 1907530 Instead, I see kids<br />whose names I barely remember.
1907853 1911687 Will you sit down?<br />We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
1911973 1912962 Speak for yourself.
1913213 1915044 We're making way for the new police:
1915253 1919724 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
1924213 1926010 Biter has a psychology degree?
1926293 1929842 - More like a psycho degree.<br />- Times have got to change.
1930133 1932772 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
1933013 1934571 That's how far back I go.
1936173 1937606 You wanted to see us?
1937973 1939406 Some things don't change.
1939733 1942372 - Here we go.<br />- The department lost its insurance.
1942653 1945326 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one�
1945653 1947928 �while you two still run around.
1949333 1951403 They can't fire you either.
1951733 1954372 So, they're promoting you.
1956373 1959490 - Lieutenant!<br />- There's no open lieutenant spots.
1959773 1963402 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />making you captains.
1964653 1966450 - Better.<br />- Captain!
1966693 1970481 Time was when this would send me over<br />the falls. I'm getting old.
1971773 1972967 What do we do now?
1973493 1974687 Captain shit!
1975013 1977129 - Hang out.<br />- Take long lunches.
1977413 1980485 Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain."
1980813 1982212 "Chief's shitting bricks!"
1982453 1983249 You finished?
1983973 1986612 Can you stay out of trouble?
1986853 1988081 Absolutely.
1988373 1990728 - Captain Riggs!<br />- Captain Murtaugh!
1999013 2002210 You want your badges?<br />Let me see those sergeant badges.
2002493 2004563 Throw them over here.
2006653 2009008 This is the most painful<br />experience of my life.
2009413 2011802 - Now get out!<br />- Thank you, Captain.
2012093 2014129 Thank you, Captain.
2014813 2017281 Enough with the "Captain" shit!<br />Get out of here!
2017573 2021282 After you, Captain, I insist!<br />"O Captain! My Captain!"
2021573 2023848 - Captains outrageous!<br />- News travels fast.
2024133 2027125 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis�
2027413 2030291 <i>They got brown rings</i><br /><i>Around their noses</i>
2031573 2034133 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper.
2034413 2036005 - Not for me.<br />- I'll take a rain check.
2036293 2039444 - Lf you change your mind, call us.<br />- He's down-to-earth.
2041253 2042447 I'm sorry.
2044293 2048923 Can we knock this off?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2051533 2054047 The man's got feelings, you know?
2061013 2062731 Congratulations.<br />Look at you!
2062933 2064571 Captain Murtaugh.
2064853 2068732 I don't know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2070533 2071727 Keep it up.
2072053 2073202 How's it going, Burton?
2073493 2076007 - It's Butters, Captain.<br />- I'll remember that.
2076293 2078887 - Kid really likes you.<br />- I wish he'd cut it out.
2079293 2080612 He likes me?
2082693 2083887 Likes me?
2088333 2091245 You don't think he likes me�
2092373 2094648 �likes me like that?
2097733 2099485 It's the police,<br />not the military.
2099813 2101724 The millennium's upon us.
2102013 2105449 The captain said:<br />"New people, new department."
2112893 2114246 Dr. Woods?
2116373 2117408 Captain Riggs.
2117693 2119285 - Don't run.<br />- I'm in a rush.
2119613 2122764 - I need to talk to you.<br />- What is it this time?
2123013 2125208 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2125533 2128889 - Or did you cook up something new?<br />- I'm sorry about all that.
2129173 2131164 I want your advice.<br />I was thinking of�
2131493 2133484 - Thinking?<br />- Marriage.
2134493 2136882 Marriage?! The "M" word?
2137133 2139647 Does "confidentiality" mean anything?
2139893 2141087 That's funny.
2141333 2143972 You know what'd happen?<br />We'd go in my office�
2144293 2146284 �and you know what you'd tell me?
2146573 2149406 You'd tell me something like, "Doc�
2149733 2151689 �I want to marry Murtaugh."
2151893 2154407 Or your mother.<br />Or Nelson Mandela!
2154693 2155808 Nelson Mandela?!
2156133 2158488 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2158733 2161167 Something to get a rise out of me.
2161693 2162808 Listen carefully!
2163093 2165243 I'm� not� stupid!
2166133 2168124 And my time is reserved�
2168493 2172247 �for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2172573 2173892 Have you got that?!
2174933 2176446 - Have you?!<br />- Ask me again?
2176693 2178445 No. And you know what?
2179133 2180361 I don't like you.
2184493 2185687 Stephanie?
2186333 2189166 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship.
2189493 2191609 I think you need to see someone.
2191853 2194083 You'll find someone to love you.
2194333 2197052 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2197333 2199369 You're disgusting!
2199613 2201126 What's the matter with you people?!
2206333 2207448 What's shaking?
2207653 2209564 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2209813 2212247 Turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2212573 2214404 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2214693 2216763 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2217053 2220125 Big enough to kick your ass.<br />What can I do for you?
2220373 2223729 One of the ship's crew shot an illegal,<br />apparently under orders�
2223973 2227648 �and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese.
2227973 2231488 We're pretty sure the big boss<br />is Benny Chan.
2231813 2232802 Uncle Benny?
2233093 2234446 You know him?
2234853 2237572 - When he was running smack.<br />- We never nailed him.
2237853 2238922 Benny's slippery.
2239333 2240732 Where's he hang out?
2241013 2243049 He's got a nightclub,<br />some restaurants.
2243333 2246530 He operates mainly out on North<br />Broadway. Here's the address.
2248253 2249481 Hi, fellas.
2250733 2252689 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Summers.
2252933 2253968 Butters.
2254613 2256205 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2256493 2260247 I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2260533 2265402 The boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2265653 2268406 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2268653 2270166 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2270413 2272608 No. What kind of bad man is he?
2272853 2274809 Real bad.<br />Crime boss in Chinatown.
2275093 2277653 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2277893 2279565 Where do I find him?
2279813 2280848 At this restaurant.
2281093 2283402 I'm hungry for Chinese.<br />How about you?
2283653 2286326 We're going there anyway.<br />We'll drive you.
2286573 2287972 Let me get my jacket.
2288493 2290927 - Not with him.<br />- He's doing good.
2291173 2292652 We might need backup.
2292933 2295845 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2296133 2297486 Like a son.
2297973 2298962 In law�
2299173 2302563 �enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2308053 2311568 Sir, it'll be an honor<br />to share egg rolls with you.
2311973 2314441 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2314653 2316006 Share?
2317733 2322409 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2322853 2324206 Why do you say that, sir?
2324493 2327849 Last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2328133 2329805 Wasn't he, Roger?
2330053 2331771 Any particular reason?
2332053 2334328 About 150,000 of them.
2334573 2337645 That's how many bullets zinged<br />my neighborhood growing up.
2337933 2340731 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2341013 2345006 Lived and ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2345493 2347609 I didn't learn to walk<br />till I was 10.
2348213 2351410 Spent my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2352213 2355364 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2355613 2358764 I'm thinking about that floor<br />and it pisses me off.
2362493 2365929 - We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />- No, why?
2366133 2368203 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look.
2368773 2371207 - Who's Leo?<br />- Maybe it's a coincidence.
2371613 2374730 - What does he want?<br />- I don't know. Let's find out.
2383733 2385530 - Fucking asshole!<br />- Bite me!
2385773 2387491 Whatever! Whatever!
2388493 2389528 Jerk!
2390573 2391722 You looking for us?
2392133 2394442 - You saw me?<br />- Yeah, we saw you.
2394853 2395888 What you doing, Leo?
2396173 2399165 I'm perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I.
2399813 2403965 He's a private eyesore.<br />Inconspicuous vehicle! I like it.
2404973 2406372 Riggs, who's the perp?
2406573 2408529 - What'd you bust him for?<br />- I'm a perp?
2408933 2411686 A brother in a police car<br />is automatically a perp?
2412333 2415609 Look at my suit!<br />Do I look like the Crips' accountant?
2416373 2417852 Look at this badge, bitch!
2418213 2419885 Check out the gun.
2420133 2421407 Put the gun down!
2421693 2424446 License! Registration!<br />Urine sample!
2424773 2425842 I got a badge too!
2426173 2428448 German Jews didn't have it<br />easy as kids!
2428813 2430485 So don't think you're the only one.
2430813 2432371 I knew you were a cop.
2432653 2435008 I was kidding.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.
2435613 2437171 You saying I smell bad?
2437453 2439728 Don't turn everything around!<br />You're so touchy.
2440453 2442728 These guys'll tell you.<br />We got a history together.
2443053 2444930 Maybe we'll work together someday!
2445173 2446322 I'm the bomb!
2446693 2450242 We'll work together when I open<br />a cereal shop, you leprechaun!
2450533 2452842 I didn't call you names, fuckface!<br />Don't start!
2453213 2454692 Don't fool around!
2455253 2458245 - These guys'll tell you.<br />- You're double-parked.
2458573 2461167 Officer, I'm just talking<br />with the detectives.
2461573 2462767 We don't know this guy.
2463973 2465167 Think he was drinking.
2465453 2467045 They're kidding.<br />Come back!
2467293 2469602 I wasn't drinking!<br />They just said that.
2469893 2473044 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.
2473333 2474812 Blow in my fucking ear!
2475733 2478201 You're all mine.<br />You're mine!
2481013 2482844 You promised to deliver the family.
2483573 2485450 They're not at the detention center.
2485653 2487245 They must have escaped.
2487693 2491129 The uncle won't finish until<br />he sees them.
2491773 2495652 Don't worry, they'll turn up.
2496893 2499532 In Hong Kong, you'd already be dead.
2504253 2505481 Where's Uncle Benny?
2506133 2507566 - He's not here.<br />- Is he in there?
2507853 2509172 - I'm sure he is.<br />- This way.
2509453 2510772 Yes, it's a two-way.
2511093 2512845 We have 3 people.
2513293 2516171 The restaurant's over there.<br />Go this way, please.
2516453 2518330 They see us,<br />but we can't see them.
2518533 2521047 - Where's your green card?<br />- That's a racist remark.
2521413 2523847 I'm a policeman<br />who asked for your green card!
2524173 2525208 This is not the way.
2525413 2527643 You're the boss<br />till we get up in his ass.
2530333 2532563 It'll be fine.<br />They've refurbished!
2533133 2534771 I couldn't stop them.
2535213 2537568 - Out, out!<br />- Can I get drink or food?
2537853 2540128 Uncle Benny!<br />I hope this is a bad time.
2540333 2543325 - He still has unclipped eyebrows.<br />- What'd we tell you?
2543653 2547282 - We hate not disturbing you.<br />- This is Detective Buckles.
2547493 2551486 Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?<br />How's the restaurant?
2551813 2552882 Eat something.
2553213 2555124 Give you the police discount.
2555413 2557210 Flied lice?
2557453 2559284 It is fried rice, you plick!
2562693 2564684 I'm busy.<br />What is it this time?
2565533 2566761 Tell him, Buttkiss.
2567013 2570369 Know about a boatload of<br />illegals that went aground?
2571093 2572685 Just what I saw on the news.
2572933 2574764 Someone lost big money.
2575013 2577481 400 people at 35 grand.<br />14 million!
2578853 2580844 And missed making them slaves.
2581133 2585126 You are cops.<br />Smuggling Chinese is an INS problem.
2585493 2588565 We found 3 bodies full of holes,<br />so now it's a cop problem.
2588853 2590172 Three dead Chinese?
2590613 2593730 - Billion more where they came from.<br />- Yes, life's cheap.
2594013 2597085 But he shot at us too.<br />That pisses us off.
2597653 2598802 Too bad they missed.
2599413 2601005 But I know nothing about it.
2602893 2604121 Who's he?
2607053 2608930 He looks unhappy.<br />What's his name?
2609133 2612409 Who's this guy?<br />Is he just appraising your furniture?
2612613 2614251 He doesn't speak English.
2614453 2618287 Then he doesn't understand<br />words like "scumbag"�
2619013 2620366 �"eat shit"?
2621453 2623603 I think he understands good.
2628413 2630847 - Enter the drag queen.<br />- The insurance, remember?
2631173 2633562 If you have nothing on me,<br />get out.
2634053 2635566 We're still around.
2636013 2637241 I'm on your ass too.
2638213 2639726 But the door is this way!
2640213 2642568 This is quicker.<br />This is quicker, really.
2646093 2647367 See? It's quicker!
2649253 2652165 Don't forget my<br />10�/� policeman's discount.
2654573 2657963 You in Hong Kong,<br />you'd be dead.
2659933 2661571 No, not that!<br />Riggs! Don't!
2663893 2665406 The insurance�<br />What the hell?
2672373 2673692 Hurry up!
2674013 2677369 Try it sometime.<br />It's satisfying and therapeutic.
2677653 2680531 - Saves the cost of shrinks.<br />- Bad guys can't call the cops.
2680813 2683373 - Why not? We're already here!<br />- El Ni o!
2684453 2685568 I know this guy.
2685773 2687126 That's the captain.<br />Hold it!
2692693 2693842 Remember, no damage!
2708213 2709441 Shit!

2876213 2877407 You'll catch me?
2877733 2880645 No, I won't catch you.<br />I got a dumpster here.
2880933 2882844 You didn't do nothing.<br />Why'd you run?
2883053 2883929 Butters!

3078373 3079567 An artist?
3082533 3084330 It's tough leaving home, huh?
3087693 3089126 In America�
3089773 3092333 �my children have chance<br />to make good life.

3233693 3234682 Get him!
3238013 3239492 What's wrong?
3239773 3241411 It's the shoulder.
3242133 3245523 It's an old injury.<br />I'll have to toss in the towel.
3246493 3248085 It happens periodically.
3249053 3252011 I was just getting going too.<br />You're lucky, kid.
3252293 3255126 - You're lucky he didn't kill you.<br />- You owe me a rematch!
3255453 3257842 - Anytime you want.<br />- I might even train for it.
3258133 3260203 Better bring your own paramedic too.
3262213 3265330 - I'll get ice for that shoulder.<br />- It's okay.
3265573 3267643 There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.
3270373 3271931 I was faking it.
3272533 3273932 Faking it?
3274893 3278647 Gomez was killing me out there.<br />I didn't have anything left.
3278973 3280645 I told you that kid was good.
3280773 3283446 He's good, but it's not all him.
3284813 3288726 I've been feeling it lately.<br />You know the other�
3294493 3297291 Like, on the ship<br />when that guy nailed me.
3297493 3299768 And yesterday I couldn't catch him.
3300173 3302971 I just thought,<br />I'm out of shape or something.
3303253 3305813 You know.<br />But it's more than that.
3306093 3309529 It's like,<br />I hate to say this but�
3309733 3311849 You're getting too old for this shit.
3316973 3318372 How about that?
3318973 3319962 Finally.
3320973 3323328 No, but I can't be.<br />I mean, I'm only�
3325013 3327004 - Jesus.<br />- Yeah, you're only.
3328853 3330684 Can't beat the clock, Riggs.
3333173 3336324 Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.<br />What'll I do?
3337013 3338241 Accept it.
3340853 3342047 Like I do.
3344413 3345732 No. Bullshit!
3346413 3347641 I won't accept it.
3347893 3349292 I'll will it not to happen.
3349493 3351131 You're going to will it?
3351453 3353250 I'm not too old for this shit.
3353453 3357207 I'm not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for this shit.
3357573 3360451 We're not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for�
3360693 3361808 Say it like you believe it.
3362093 3364084 We're not too old for this shit.
3365333 3367642 I'm not going to buy<br />a hemorrhoid cushion.
3367973 3368769 I won't get corns!
3368973 3370292 I got corns!
3370493 3371369 I won't wear a suit!
3371853 3373889 What's wrong with wearing a suit?
3374133 3375566 How's it going, Captain?
3385733 3387564 Thanks a lot, guys.<br />Very funny!
3387853 3389889 That cop tried to strip-search me!
3390173 3391731 - You get his phone number?<br />- Funny.
3392013 3394481 Sugar-glazed with jelly.<br />Thanks, Leo.
3394733 3396564 - What happened? The scratches.<br />- A dog.
3396813 3399611 A dog catch you<br />drinking out of his bowl?
3399813 3401963 I'm working on<br />an important P.I. Case.
3402213 3403362 Did the dog hire you?
3403613 3406605 No! The people that<br />lost the dog hired me.
3406853 3407842 Sounds like a big case.
3408093 3412371 It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot.<br />It's an expensive dog.
3412653 3414405 - A Bolshoi.<br />- Borzoi.
3414693 3415921 Whatever, whatever!
3416493 3417926 And you found it?
3418213 3420681 Sort of.<br />Listen to what happens.
3421333 3425121 Instead of going looking for the dog,<br />I went to the pound.
3425453 3429162 I take the dog home, dye him.<br />It looks exactly like their dog.
3429453 3430727 Dog was a real rat, though.
3430933 3432730 He scratched me.<br />But I got the job done.
3433013 3434890 Some kind of P.I. Business you got.
3435253 3437084 Douche Ventura, pet infective.
3437373 3438931 It's grand theft.
3439213 3440851 With trickery, it's a felony.
3441093 3443687 It is?<br />You guys are always kidding.
3444013 3447972 I get it. Here comes<br />that touchy kid. I'm not here.
3449333 3450129 Putter!
3450573 3452723 The guy you chased in Chinatown?
3452973 3455282 His gun matched slugs<br />on the bodies on the boat.
3455493 3456369 He's your shooter.
3458413 3459732 Guy that got away from me.
3459893 3463329 He didn't get far.<br />They found him on a rooftop nearby.
3463533 3466172 Strangled.<br />And pigeons ate his eyeballs.
3467373 3468249 Cool.
3468893 3470372 Excuse me.
3472773 3476243 I hate these phones!<br />You get a call, they cut you off.
3476493 3478848 You make a call, they cut you off!
3479173 3482290 You know what they're doing?<br />They fuck you with cell phones.
3482533 3485764 They love when you get cut off.<br />You know why?
3486053 3487406 When you call back�
3487653 3491362 �they charge you for the first<br />minute again at that high rate.
3491653 3493609 If you're able to call back�
3493933 3497209 �because the 3-hour battery<br />you got only lasts 20 minutes.
3497493 3499245 If you're behind a hill, it goes�
3499533 3503208 Or you go through a tunnel.<br />And they keep making it smaller!
3503453 3505921 You know why?<br />So you can lose it.
3506333 3509370 So you buy more phones.<br />I never lost my mother's phone!
3509653 3512804 Take you two hours to make<br />a long-distance call.
3515373 3518649 I messed up! Hang up.<br />Got to do it again!
3519853 3522765 I never lost my<br /><i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit phone.
3523013 3526562 And scanners! They get your<br />number and call all over the world!
3526893 3530169 Somebody took my number<br />and called Afghanistan!
3530933 3534369 I don't know what fucking<br />Afghanistan look like.
3534653 3538441 Even if I did, I would not talk<br />to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!
3538733 3540724 I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours!
3541013 3543607 They fuck you with the cell phones!
3543893 3546612 You know when you go to a drive-through?<br />Hold on.
3546893 3548326 Why am I talking�?
3549493 3552451 - Leo Getz, private investigator.<br />- Private investigator?
3552653 3555611 I wondered if you'd<br />investigate my privates.
3556573 3557722 Investigate what?
3558013 3561449 My privates, you stupid shit.<br />Shut the fuck up!
3561733 3564372 Very funny!<br />You're costing me money.
3564613 3567491 $3 to answer a call.<br />They fuck me, now you!
3567693 3569251 You're tough when on the phone.
3569453 3571125 Right!<br />Telephone tough guy.
3571333 3572812 Why are we talking on the phone?
3573013 3575083 Get out of here.<br />Go home!
3575373 3576772 What happened to your face?
3577373 3579204 "No" means no!
3581973 3583770 He'll like me, I can tell.
3584093 3585162 He'd be the first.
3587973 3589645 Whatever! Whatever!
3594293 3597126 You know, we should hire Leo.
3597653 3598642 Hire Leo?
3598933 3600730 He can follow Uncle Benny around.
3601013 3602605 - Benny'll see him.<br />- Yeah!
3602853 3605447 - He'll drive him nuts.<br />- Benny'll shoot him.
3607253 3608447 Let's hire him!
3609213 3611283 I smell like stale coffee.
3614493 3617053 Why do you care if I go home<br />and change shirts?
3617333 3620405 A coffee stain's not something<br />that'd bother me.
3620653 3621847 Look at the way you dress.
3622773 3624047 What's that supposed to mean?
3626293 3629205 I don't have nifty suits like you.<br />Not many cops do.
3629493 3631131 What's that supposed to mean?
3633253 3636245 I've wondered,<br />where's the money coming from?
3637453 3639250 Where do you think?
3639493 3641404 - Where do you think?<br />- I don't know.
3641693 3644446 - It's none of my business.<br />- You don't know!
3644813 3647373 Trish gave me some money.
3647653 3650611 Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.
3651213 3652726 All right. Sorry.
3655573 3656767 Whose car is that?
3657773 3658922 I don't know.
3659613 3662332 It looks like a full house<br />for Lamaze class.
3662573 3663642 You know that car?
3663933 3665525 Here you go, Captains.
3667093 3668321 No charge for the ride.
3669173 3673291 - Rianne and Lorna are here.<br />- I'll put it on your account, Captain.
3677893 3678882 Hey, honey.
3679453 3681842 What's going on?<br />I came home to change my shirt�
3687333 3688243 Why are you here?
3688693 3689921 They took the Hongs.
3697733 3698722 Shit!
3700053 3701247 Drop it.
3714933 3716651 Girls, get out!
3721173 3722652 Look who we got here.
3722973 3724770 - Uncle Benny's friend.<br />- Hey, Bruce.
3725773 3727126 Nice pajamas.
3728933 3730651 Where are the Hongs?
3738533 3739886 Drop your guns.
3740373 3742568 - Drop them!<br />- Okay, take it easy.
3742973 3745248 Don't stand for that, honey.
3752413 3753289 Son of a bitch!
3842613 3844171 Let the women go.
3863413 3865005 I can't breathe!
3894773 3895842 Son of a bitch!

3935893 3937246 Go ahead, cut me.
3977893 3979326 It's all right.
3980333 3981527 You okay, honey?
3981973 3983691 I owe you one, kid.
3984213 3987489 - The keys to your car?<br />- They're in the car.
3988493 3989562 We need a radio.
3994173 3995401 We have to go.
3997053 4000363 How will we find them?<br />We got to catch them assholes!
4006653 4010362 <i>- 3-William-56, this is Air 12.</i><br />- We need your eyes, guys.

4050093 4052084 - Is it the right one?<br />- I don't know.
4052333 4054210 We're going east and China's east.
4054533 4056364 - China's west too.<br />- We can't divide.
4056613 4057523 Think positive!

4063653 4064608 You see him?
4071773 4073411 Watch the road!
4073853 4075764 I'd give my right arm for a siren!
4079893 4081690 Why'd they take the Hongs?
4082013 4084573 Maybe they're shaking them down<br />for more money.
4087733 4091089 Hong's uncle paid already.<br />He got in touch with his uncle.
4091453 4094570 He left him a message.<br />It's how they know where I live.

4666173 4667401 It was Benny.

4711893 4714361 I think I know what it is.
4714613 4715807 You do?
4717053 4718532 It's okay.
4719333 4720607 It is?
4720853 4723048 People have the right to do<br />what makes them happy.
4723333 4725449 Just don't expect me to like it.
4726173 4727970 I know this must be hard for you.
4728293 4729408 It's impossible for me!
4730813 4734283 I hoped we'd get together<br />for the holidays, say Christmas.
4734653 4738646 Why should we get together<br />and see each other on Christmas?
4739253 4741403 - I'm trying to reach out.<br />- Reach somewhere else!
4741813 4744088 Do what you want,<br />but leave me out of it.
4744413 4746973 - I got it.<br />- I don't want to hear about it.
4747333 4748482 Not a word.

4757493 4758482 My ass hurts.

4761293 4763853 - Please be quiet.<br />- I'm trying! I'm in pain!
4764133 4766772 Why don't you go see<br />your own dentist?
4767133 4769408 My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!
4769693 4772161 - Oh, brother!<br />- Oh, brother?! Get the dentist!
4773213 4775773 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />It's an emergency.
4776093 4778129 A man walked in off the street.
4778373 4780841 He's in a lot of pain.<br />You better come.
4785013 4787322 Okay, you can come in now!
4795173 4798848 - Leo can pull this off?<br />- Leo's got a B.S. In B.S.

4810053 4812772 You hurt me, I'll stick<br />an egg roll up your ass.
4820013 4822322 Don't be alarmed.<br />It's only a drill.
4822653 4823642 Don't say a word.
4824053 4825042 Shut up.
4826333 4829609 Where are the Hongs?<br />Open wide and tell me.
4829853 4831081 I don't know any Hongs.
4831373 4833967 Their uncle paid you<br />to get them out of China.
4834253 4836244 More smuggling?<br />We went through that.
4836493 4837767 We're going through it again.
4838133 4839566 I have nothing to say.
4839973 4841964 These look very interesting.
4842213 4843566 You're not going to use it.
4843973 4845201 You won't shoot me.
4845453 4847489 - You're lousy cops.<br />- We're good cops.
4850053 4851247 This will settle him down.
4851653 4853769 Breathe, Uncle Benny.<br />Breathe!
4854733 4855848 Crank up the nitrous.
4856533 4857727 Crank that baby up.
4858013 4859685 You said it wouldn't hurt!
4860013 4861332 I'm holding this. Go ahead.
4861973 4864043 Deep! Right down to your toes.
4871053 4873169 - He's wasted!<br />- Have some more.
4873533 4875205 He'll talk.
4876093 4877572 Good, breathe.
4881173 4882845 - That's me.<br />- That's you.
4885133 4887363 Now, where are the Hongs?

4923813 4926247 �and watch him<br />try to get out of here.
4928773 4930968 What you got in your hands there?
4931253 4932447 A nut cup.

4951933 4954925 That's one funny son-in-law<br />you got there, Rog.
4955573 4957006 After tonight it be too late.
4957333 4958971 Too late for what?
4961253 4962925 Why'd you call him my son-in-law?
4963293 4964965 Uncle Benny? He's too old.
4967173 4970006 Buy Four Fathers back<br />at Four Fathers' store.
4970893 4972929 Why's he talking about his ancestors?
4973173 4974492 I don't know.
4975173 4977243 Why you call him my son-in-law?
4977733 4978927 Because I am!
4984293 4985521 I thought he was�
4988453 4989727 No, I'm�
4992173 4993162 Bloody marvelous!

5005813 5007610 What are you doing?
5007813 5009963 I couldn't stall anymore.
5010893 5012451 What happened?
5013613 5015683 Rog, look at this.<br />Does that hurt?
5023413 5026769 Uncle Benny,<br />anything happens to the Hongs�
5026973 5028929 �we'll come back<br />and rip you a new one.
5029133 5030691 That's two for Benny.
5031053 5032725 Bloody marvelous!
5036213 5038602 - Are you crazy?<br />- Why did you do that?
5038853 5040809 For keeping it from me<br />and letting me think�
5041173 5042845 Hit him, not me.
5043093 5046369 As soon as we find the Hongs,<br />we're getting into this.

5129293 5133366 Finish now or watch the others die.
5149973 5151406 <i>Rimminy</i>?
5151813 5154725 A young bimbo? A jumping jiminy?<br />I don't know.
5155893 5157121 <i>I can 't remember.</i>
5157653 5159211 No, Riggs. <i>Renminbi.</i>
5159733 5160848 Say that again.
5161133 5162088 That's it!
5162413 5163323 <i>You got it.</i>
5163573 5165086 <i>Means, "people's money."</i>
5165293 5166328 People's money?
5166693 5167842 <i>What else did Benny say?</i>
5168173 5171882 <i>He was talking about</i><br /><i>buying back his ancestors.</i>
5172253 5173925 <i>And about how tonight's�</i>
5174333 5175971 �too late.<br />Mean anything to you?
5176173 5177242 No, nothing at all.
5177573 5181566 And the guy who torched my house?<br />Benny was afraid of him.
5181853 5184572 <i>If Benny's scared,</i><br /><i>he's got to be a Chinese Triad.</i>
5185013 5187322 <i>Those guys kill anyone</i><br /><i>in their way.</i>

5191653 5193132 <i>- Thanks, Ng.</i><br /><i>- Keep me posted.</i>
5194413 5196768 Pick up your wife, my daughter.
5196973 5199203 - I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.<br />- Her and Ping.
5260373 5261203 What?
5262533 5264171 You want to get married, don't you?
5266093 5266969 No.
5271613 5273569 Yes. Yes, I do.
5274453 5276569 But if you don't want to, it's okay.
5277493 5278892 Why didn't you tell me?
5279213 5281807 Because I didn't want to put<br />any pressure on you.
5282013 5284243 If you want to someday, that'd be great.
5285973 5287372 If you don't�
5287853 5289491 �I love you.
5293013 5295766 I'll take you any way I can get you.
5300893 5302121 Feel that!
5302893 5305532 - Ping, feel the baby!<br />- He's really dancing.
5305813 5307246 He's kicking. You feel him?
5354933 5355922 You're okay.
5356173 5357686 <i>Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.</i>
5357933 5359605 Riggs, it's Murtaugh.
5360613 5363969 I'm sick of these fuckers.<br />Let's just find them and shoot them.
5364613 5366922 Meet me and Butters on South Spring.
5367213 5368168 <i>What's going on?</i>
5370613 5372444 They found my watch.
5375893 5379442 They killed Hong, his uncle,<br />Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.
5379733 5382042 - Where's the rest of the family?<br />- They're okay.
5382893 5386203 INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.
5386893 5390966 Hong's family was being held there<br />and they led them back here.
5392573 5394291 They were making funny money.
5394573 5395972 Ink's still wet.
5396693 5399332 - Where are the faces?<br />- It's why I call it funny.
5399933 5401730 Why are they making Chinese money?
5402013 5403810 Can they even exchange it here?
5404013 5405241 - Only in China.<br /><i>- Renminbi.</i>
5405493 5406687 I remember.
5408573 5411963 Hong's uncle was an artist.<br />Maybe an engraver.
5412373 5415968 Bringing over his family could've<br />been how he was paid for the job.
5416253 5417686 - That's thin.<br />- It's not.
5417973 5419201 Keep talking. What?
5419573 5422531 Benny said something about paying�
5422853 5424525 �buying back his forefathers.
5424853 5425683 What'd you say?
5426773 5430004 Benny said something about buying<br />back his forefathers.
5430293 5431885 You said ancestors.
5432133 5433851 What's the difference?
5434133 5436966 The number four.<br />Four Fathers.
5437293 5439602 They were the top guys<br />of the Hong Kong Triad.
5439813 5441405 They disappeared from prison.
5441613 5443683 Reds jailed them when they<br />took over Hong Kong.
5443853 5444649 I bet they're here.
5444853 5445968 Damn, we're good.
5446253 5449131 Grab Ping. I don't want him<br />to see the bodies.
5452133 5454249 10 to 1, I know where the money is�
5454493 5457246 �and where the Four Fathers are.<br />Let me make a call.
5457653 5458642 Don't leave without us.
5459373 5461648 Good work!<br />You must be a detective.
5461893 5463485 I have my moments.
5469573 5470642 Uncle Benny.
5471253 5473687 I was actually starting<br />to like the old goat.
5473933 5475412 Bloody marvelous.
5475733 5477724 And it's fried rice, "you plick."
5485813 5488486 - Which one is Hong?<br />- In front of you.
5489053 5491726 I want a complete set<br />of forensics on all three.
5495613 5497569 Dads and their kids.
5500293 5502090 I'll take care of yours, buddy.
5502773 5503762 We got to go!
5504133 5506283 - Take care of yourself.<br />- Where're we going?
5506533 5508046 - L.A. Harbor.<br />- What's there?
5508293 5510011 It's a foreign trade zone.
5510213 5512681 Shady deals with the Chinese military.
5513333 5515528 <i>It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.</i>
5515853 5520449 <i>I got it, a corrupt Chinese general</i><br /><i>brought the Four Fathers here�</i>
5520733 5522530 <i>� and the Triad's</i><br /><i>buying their release.</i>
5522813 5525281 <i>That's what Uncle Benny meant</i><br /><i>by buying them back.</i>
5525573 5528690 <i>That general will shit</i><br /><i>when he sees the money's counterfeit.</i>
5528973 5530452 <i>Let's tell him.</i>
5571373 5572692 Hi, gang.
5572973 5574122 LAPD.
5578133 5579725 I saw Hong.
5580053 5582647 This is what Benny meant<br />by buying the Four Fathers.
5582893 5586647 Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.<br />How are you, boys?
5587053 5588168 Who's the naughty general?
5588453 5590409 Who's been lining his pockets?
5590733 5593293 Naughty!<br />Speaky English?
5595093 5596082 What do you want?
5597613 5598489 See this?
5598813 5601771 I hope you need lots of<br />toilet paper back home.
5602013 5603605 That's all it's good for.
5603933 5606766 Take the Four Pops back to China.<br />We don't give a shit.
5607093 5607923 The Four Pops!
5609053 5611248 Don't want them no more.<br />It's counterfeit.
5611533 5613888 Triads never prosper<br />cheating a general.
5615853 5617206 See for yourself.
5628533 5631366 Money losing face.<br />General losing face.
5631653 5634121 Hard when Triad try to sit on it.
5637133 5639124 I fucked you. I fucked you!
5639653 5640563 We fucked you.
5640853 5642923 It's beautiful!
5645413 5646607 Don't we get a hand?
5656973 5659123 Keep your head down!<br />Let them shoot each other!
5659413 5660607 Watch out!
5662813 5663643 Thanks!
5675053 5676042 Was this a good idea?
5676253 5677322 It was an idea!
5684133 5685566 11 in the mag, 1 in the pipe.<br />You?
5685813 5687292 Wheel gun. 6 shots.
5689693 5690489 Four!
5697733 5699689 Why are you lying to me?
5701333 5703085 I.A. Says you're on the take.
5703293 5704442 I'm on the take?!
5704653 5707690 I think it's crazy!<br />But you're spending lots of money!
5708053 5709611 You ever hear of Ebony Clark?
5710733 5713725 Yeah! She writes those<br />cheesy sex novels!
5714653 5715768 Are you boinking her?
5716013 5718925 No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark!
5719213 5720851 Trish is Ebony Clark.
5723573 5724449 You are boinking her!
5726253 5728209 Yeah, I'm boinking her.
5742053 5743247 Too embarrassing to tell anybody.
5743533 5745012 Yeah, I don't blame you.
5745373 5746726 - She makes lots of money.<br />- How many you got?
5746973 5748406 Two.
5749293 5750646 I'll look for more ammo.
5780253 5781652 Who's in white pajamas?
5782253 5784926 Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father<br />with him is his older brother.
5785173 5786447 No kidding?
5795693 5797570 - Hey, Butters.<br />- Shit! Shit!
5797973 5799725 Now you got my name right.
5799973 5801850 I'm out.<br />I got to find some rounds.
5802613 5804092 I'll help you.
5804613 5806569 Never been shot before.
5810493 5812165 Take care of my son-in-law.
5857133 5859806 - You all right?<br />- No, I got my ass kicked again.
5860053 5861805 Shit, I'm out.
5862093 5865324 I hit the bastard. I thought<br />I missed him. Where'd they go?
5877213 5878282 Come on!
5880253 5882323 We got Door Number 1,<br />Number 2, or Number 3.
5885613 5887843 - Looks like Number 2, Monty.<br />- Let's go.
5892813 5895486 What's behind Door Number 2?<br />Bingo.
5903253 5904732 Now you've done it.
5905133 5906532 Now he's really pissed.
5911333 5913722 Son of a bitch will be a handful.
5918133 5922365 Since I met you, I've done some<br />hairy shit. But this won't happen.
5923413 5925165 I'm going to be a grandfather�
5925493 5927563 �and you and Lorna will have a baby.
5931253 5934051 He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.
5936733 5938291 Yeah, you're right.
5940133 5942806 If he gets away we can<br />track him down later�
5943053 5944850 �with a howitzer or something.
5945053 5948045 Your son-in-law's bleeding.<br />We should get him and go.
5948693 5951446 - Shit, it's raining.<br />- I'm too old for this shit.
5952453 5954205 Guy's too damn good.
5954533 5957411 How'd he do that thing with the gun?
5957813 5961522 He took my gun apart with one move.<br />How'd he do that?
5963893 5964882 How?
5973173 5974891 Yeah, okay.
5975253 5976242 Let's go ask him.
6198093 6199492 Are you up there?
6200133 6201361 Are you all right?
6236693 6238251 Where are you, Riggs?

6249013 6251129 You going to have a baby. Will me!
6251373 6253648 You son of a bitch.<br />God! Will me!
6259573 6261609 I hear you, Riggs.

6313253 6315164 I heard you, Riggs!
6316493 6318609 You willed me to it!
6318933 6320605 What took you so long?
6320893 6323691 What the hell do you mean?
6323973 6327204 I was knocked down over here!<br />I couldn't even get up!

6358973 6362204 �and I love her.<br />I won't lie to you. I do.
6362733 6365122 And I want to make her happy.
6367293 6369409 I'm looking for help here, honey.
6371293 6372692 I don't know what to do.
6374253 6376323 Funny talking to you about<br />this stuff�
6381053 6383203 You want to get yourself shot?
6385773 6387729 What the hell are you doing here?
6388293 6389408 I was tailing you.
6390773 6391762 Sorry.
6394893 6397771 I'll leave you alone.<br />I guess you want to be alone.
6398373 6399806 I'd appreciate it.
6404333 6406688 When I was a kid I had a pet frog.
6407093 6407889 What?
6409013 6411527 Give me a second.<br />Let me tell you this.
6411893 6414532 I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.
6414933 6416764 He was my best friend in the world.
6417613 6420173 I didn't have lots of friends.<br />In fact�
6420693 6422604 �I had no friends.
6425373 6427568 I used to kiss the frog too.
6427813 6429644 I thought maybe�
6430213 6433364 �it would turn into a princess<br />since I was a boy.
6433733 6435166 And it could be�
6435493 6436608 �my mother.
6437573 6440485 They told me that<br />she left or something.
6441453 6443808 And my father was no bargain.
6444053 6445566 And so, just the frog�
6445973 6447611 �Froggy, was my friend.
6447893 6450965 I loved him and took him<br />everywhere with me.
6451213 6453090 I was riding my bike one day�
6453373 6455443 �he jumped out of the box�
6455733 6457564 �and I ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6458333 6459812 I killed him.
6460293 6462807 I was really heartbroken. Really.
6463773 6466333 He was my best friend,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6467773 6469445 And then I met you�
6469853 6471047 �and Roger.
6471413 6474849 You looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6475453 6477205 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6477573 6478801 No, it's okay.
6479293 6480362 It's okay.
6480773 6482286 You're my family�
6482813 6484405 �and my friends.
6486493 6489565 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />just different.
6496093 6498812 I just thought that<br />might be relevant.
6503253 6505209 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6508533 6510251 I got a funny f�
6510893 6511643 What's wrong?!
6512013 6513571 I'm having a baby.
6513933 6515082 Lorna beeped me.
6515613 6517649 Yes, it's Lorna.<br />She's having the baby.
6518013 6519890 - I'll get the car.<br />- I'll be behind you.
6527653 6529928 You picked a strange angel, honey.
6532013 6533651 But I got the message.
6534893 6536406 I got the message.
6542413 6544244 I'll always have this.
6544813 6546166 Always have you.
6546813 6548405 In here and here.
6549933 6550763 Thanks, honey.
6551133 6553010 I got to go. Bye.
6553653 6555291 I am not ready to have this baby!
6555653 6557928 You're as ready as you're going to be.
6558293 6559726 Fine! Just wheel me in.
6560173 6562209 My legs are staying closed!
6563133 6564043 Give me this!
6564413 6565766 Ma'am, let go!
6566173 6569006 I am a police officer!<br />And I am not ready!
6575373 6576567 Are you all right?
6576933 6578286 - Are you the husband?<br />- Yes.
6578573 6579688 Honey, are you all right?
6579893 6580803 No, I'm not.
6581133 6582885 I said I didn't want<br />to get married, but I do.
6583213 6585807 I want to be a wife<br />before I'm a mother.
6586133 6587282 I know you don't want to.
6589293 6590851 - You said "okay"?<br />- Yes, I did. Okay.
6591253 6592652 Let's do it.
6593733 6595007 He said okay.
6595533 6597683 - Congratulations.<br />- He said okay, Leo.
6598133 6599486 Oh, my God!
6599853 6601366 What's that smell?
6601733 6604645 I was on my way to the toilet<br />and she grabbed me.
6604853 6607526 - I'm so sorry.<br />- Have a nice baby!
6609293 6610612 I'm so sorry.
6613453 6615205 Will you marry me?
6618533 6619522 You bet I will.
6622693 6623569 Let's go.
6623933 6626242 I'm not going! Wait!
6627853 6629002 - Get a minister.<br />- Now?
6629213 6632046 Now. We're getting married.<br />Here comes another one.
6632293 6633282 We need a license�
6633533 6635524 I want to hear it<br />before the baby comes!
6635733 6636643 It's coming now.
6637013 6639527 Listen, I am getting married<br />or there is no baby.
6639813 6642202 This could be an aspect<br />of a transition phase.
6642453 6645251 This is no goddamn aspect<br />of a transition phase!
6645613 6647251 Honey, everybody, calm down.
6647613 6649092 Calm down. Okay?
6649453 6651728 Get a priest, minister, anything.
6652053 6654362 Go get a priest!<br />Goddamn it, Leo!
6654733 6656325 I got it. Okay.
6656653 6658530 Pant, pant, blow.<br />Remember Lamaze class?
6658813 6660451 Pant, blow. Come on!
6662533 6664012 But I want to say "I do."
6664333 6666005 Here he is!
6666333 6667561 This is Rabbi Gelb.
6667853 6668763 A rabbi?
6669013 6670366 You said anything.
6670733 6671882 He'll do.
6672133 6673612 For what I'll do?
6673853 6676083 We'd like you to marry us.<br />Please.
6676373 6677806 - You're Jewish?<br />- Not necessarily.
6678133 6679327 - You got a license?<br />- No.
6679613 6681285 Please don't go!
6681933 6684493 She needs to hear the words<br />before the baby comes.
6684773 6688209 Are you both serious?<br />I don't have time for hijinks.
6688493 6689721 We're very serious.
6690053 6691884 I could do it.<br />It wouldn't be official.
6692173 6693652 I just want to hear the words.
6694053 6695930 What the hell! Your names?
6696293 6697646 I'm Martin and this is Lorna.
6698093 6699492 Martin and Lorna.
6700293 6702966 What am I doing?<br />How do the <i>goyim</i> do this?
6704293 6706090 Dearly beloved!
6706373 6710844 Dearly beloved,<br />marriage is a spiritual union�
6712013 6714846 Faster!<br />She's heading for the home stretch.
6715213 6717329 Martin, will you take<br />Lorna to be your wife?
6717613 6720889 Will you honor, love, etc�
6721133 6723089 �till death do you part?<br />- I will.
6723293 6725887 Lorna, will you take Martin<br />to be your husband?
6726253 6728721 - I do.<br />- The same thing.
6728933 6730082 I pronounce you man and wife.
6730373 6732443 You may kiss the bride.<br />You already did.
6732733 6734530 - Let's go.<br />- No, wait!
6734813 6736087 Hold it!
6736453 6737522 What is it?
6737933 6740083 Let me have this glass!
6740413 6743052 No, goddamn it!<br />What are you doing?!
6743573 6746406 Talk to the hand!<br />I'll be right back.
6746693 6749685 You know how long it took me<br />to fill that thing? All day!
6749933 6752686 This is unsanitary.<br />What is this?
6753093 6754731 - Break the glass.<br />- I'll get piss on my shoes!
6755453 6756727 You got to do this!
6757493 6758926 <i>Mazel tov</i>!
6761133 6763089 Come back here,<br />you little son of a bitch!
6763413 6764562 Pant, pant, blow.
6764853 6766127 Leo, please.
6767733 6770805 Your work is over here.<br />I think someone else needs you.
6775933 6777810 Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.
6781373 6782567 Thanks a lot.
6787213 6788771 Stick around.<br />Meet the kid.
6789013 6791083 Good luck, Lorna!
6796773 6798764 Here it comes.
6800813 6802007 Here he is.
6802573 6805610 He's looking right at you.<br />He knows it's you.
6810253 6811891 Rog, look what I found.
6812493 6814848 - Look at that.<br />- What a beauty!
6815533 6817251 Look at those eyes!
6817853 6820208 - He looks like his mother.<br />- Yes, he does.
6820533 6821488 Murtaugh!
6824253 6825572 No, Butters!
6826013 6827844 Butters' baby.<br />Better not be Murtaugh.
6828173 6829606 It's Butters.
6831093 6832606 Look at that baby.
6833333 6834812 Look at the hair.
6835773 6837411 That's my baby!
6838013 6840527 Look at her. You're so cute.<br />Look at you!
6840773 6843333 27 people, nobody thought<br />of bringing a camera?
6843573 6845086 Leo, your plastic's flaccid.
6845453 6848684 These machines wreck your plastic,<br />then give you the camera.
6849053 6851203 The camera doesn't work.<br />They're trying to�
6855573 6856926 What are you doing here?
6857693 6859126 Look at these two babies.
6859373 6861409 A little something from the squad.
6864013 6866322 - Give back the captain badges.<br />- Why?
6866573 6869724 Congratulations, you're sergeants again.<br />The city's self-insured.
6870013 6871924 I thought they'd make us president.
6873053 6875248 By the way, Grandpa,<br />you owe the chief one.
6875573 6876847 He went to the INS�
6877053 6879487 �and they're giving asylum<br />to the Hongs.
6879933 6880922 All right!
6882653 6884211 We're going to take a picture.
6888373 6890489 Squeeze together.<br />Candy stripers out.
6890813 6892087 Out! Okay. Out!
6892813 6894929 I can't.<br />There's not enough room.
6896813 6898485 You got to back up.
6899253 6900288 I'm taking big steps!
6900613 6902012 Get this guy to take it.
6902293 6904807 Doc, can you take a picture<br />of all of us?
6907893 6910009 It's my best man, after all.
6910373 6911852 Get my grandbaby in it too.
6912133 6913168 Are you all friends?
6913493 6916326 No. We're family!
6916613 6917409 Okay, on 3.
6917693 6919604 One, two, three!
