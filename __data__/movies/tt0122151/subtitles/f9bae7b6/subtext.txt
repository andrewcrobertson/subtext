30640 33000 Riggs, you sure we're on<br />the right street?
33680 34800 We must be getting warm.
35760 38440 - You see anything?<br />- Where? I don't see anything.
38720 39920 This must be the place.
40160 41400 Holy shit!
42800 44120 What the hell is that?
48160 49080 Jesus!
49800 50800 Who's this joker?
51000 52800 I don't know.<br />A spokesman for the NRA.
53840 54840 Regular asshole.
55040 56200 What do we do now?
57240 58080 Run him over.
58920 60680 What if he shoots us with that rifle?
60920 63760 - He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.<br />- What if he does?
64120 66880 Don't be a Don't-Bee.<br />Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.
67160 67960 Positive?
69080 71360 - Run him over.<br />- Glad you see things my way.
71600 72800 I hope he doesn't turn.
73160 76040 He won't. We'll creep up on him<br />so he won't notice.
77480 80800 Will him not to turn.<br />Power of positive thinking.
81000 82600 Don't turn.<br />Will him with me.
83560 84520 Don't turn around.
84800 86880 I need you.<br />Don't turn around!
87960 88760 Just believe!
88960 89880 Don't turn around!
90120 92040 We're better than him.
92280 93240 We're better!
95080 96080 He's turning.
108680 110320 They just bounce off him!
110560 111920 I saw! We're in trouble!
112800 116080 Shit! I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
116320 118800 No, I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
118960 122480 Are you crazy?! You got<br />a wife, kids. I got less to lose!
127360 128480 Get out of here!
132280 135200 I'm not supposed to tell you,<br />but Lorna's pregnant.
137720 138920 What'd you say?
139240 141520 You'll be a father!
145920 149240 She was afraid to tell you.<br />She was afraid you'd get angry.
149520 151040 You never talked about children?
151520 152960 - Shit!<br />- A baby.
161520 164200 There's something I'm not<br />supposed to tell you too.
164480 167720 Rianne's pregnant. You're going<br />to be a grandfather.
167960 168960 Rianne's what?!
174440 176720 Rianne can't be pregnant.
177080 178800 She's not married.
179040 181440 I don't think she intended<br />to get that way.
193080 195280 They asking me to be a granddaddy?
223000 225040 Here's what we'll do.<br />Take your clothes off!
225360 226200 What for?
227360 228400 Okay, you run.
228640 230720 Flame-O sees you in your undies.
230960 232840 It distracts him,<br />then I shoot.
233040 235200 - Shoot what?<br />- The valve on that napalm tank!
235480 236880 Before he shoots me?
237120 238640 - Maybe.<br />- Maybe?!
248720 249560 Is he black?
249880 251720 Too much armor on.<br />I can't tell!
251960 254800 No! Not him!<br />The father of the baby!
256440 258040 Please let him be black!
264400 265800 Get going! Here he comes!
266960 268080 Are those hearts?
268360 270520 Not now, Riggs.<br />Just hit the damn valve!
270680 273040 Also, flap and make noises<br />like a bird.
273320 274960 Flap my arms? Why?
275200 277360 Lt'll distract him more.<br />I need him to turn.
279240 280880 - On 2!<br />- We always go on 3.
281120 282560 No time for 3. 2!
282800 284880 - What about 1?<br />- Okay. 1, 2, go!
285120 286920 I don't want to die in my underwear!
288800 290880 Why are you waiting?<br />Shoot the bastard!
325440 329080 Riggs, you think<br />that bird thing helped?
329440 332080 I just wanted to see if you'd do it.
334640 336000 Cute shorts.
338800 340000 Go spit!
341600 342920 I'll buy you a doughnut.
343240 345360 Don't hug me when I'm naked.
345600 347600 You're ashamed of your butt?
356200 357600 He's a lively one.
360720 363280 That shark hurts my boat,<br />I take it out on you, Leo.
363520 366120 - I didn't mean to catch it.<br />- Why do you want to keep it?
366440 368120 Yeah, why keep a shark?
368400 370040 The teeth'll look great on a wall.
370280 371600 They got to stop snapping first.
371880 373360 Maybe he'll fall asleep.
373600 375440 Converse with him.<br />He'll nod off.
375680 378760 - He don't look tired.<br />- Chewing on Leo will wear him out.
379040 381200 Sharks eat their own kind?
383240 384800 Stop it!<br />I'm in stitches!
386760 388240 Okay, where's my bag?
388520 389640 Starboard side aft.
390280 391800 Starboard, that's left, right?
392040 394800 No, port's left.<br />Starboard's right.
395560 398520 Right, yeah. Right side aft.<br />Got it!
398760 400800 - Whatever.<br />- Check both sides.
401120 403040 Careful!<br />He's behind you, shark!
406040 407480 Maybe we should throw him overboard.
407840 409640 Throw them both overboard.
410840 413920 No witnesses.<br />We'd probably get away with it.
416760 417960 You too?
421440 423640 I kept my nose out of it...
425200 427000 ...but you and Lorna.
428480 431800 You're having a baby,<br />you're living together.
432920 434160 You're not marrying.
435560 438400 Why, does that violate your<br />family values system?
438920 441680 I'm just trying to understand.
443640 445240 Rianne's not married either.
445560 447640 That's hitting below the belt.
451640 453800 You know, when I was married...
454400 456240 ...it was good. You know.
456480 459000 You put the ring on.<br />You make the commitment.
459920 461600 You do all the...
463920 465440 She's dead because I'm a cop.
466520 468920 She's dead because I'm a cop<br />and I...
469200 471400 I don't wear the ring anymore...
472240 474200 ...but I look, and it's still there.
474440 476000 I still feel it.
477680 480960 It's like I'm not<br />finished with that yet.
481200 483360 I can't explain it.<br />Is that bullshit?
483880 485800 No. It's not finished.
486840 488400 It's not finished.
492480 494680 Okay, you did say "aft"?
494920 496520 A-F-T. Aft!
496920 498120 That's a fucking word?
498720 500760 In the back on the right side, Leo!
501360 504080 Why didn't you say that<br />to begin with, Roger?!
504640 508680 People get around boats and water,<br />everything becomes nautical!
508960 511200 "Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!
511800 513480 Man the bilge pump!"
513720 515440 Pump your fucking ass!
515680 516800 All right, all right!
519520 521440 No problem, no problem!
524760 526320 What's Lorna say about it?
526560 528360 She doesn't like nautical terms either.
529680 532640 We haven't discussed it.<br />That's pretty messed up.
532880 536520 The baby's due in days and you<br />haven't talked about marrying?
536800 537880 No.
538240 540200 I haven't done it at all.
542400 544040 Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
544280 545480 I want Leo to shoot...
545720 546520 No, Leo!
546960 548000 What?!
549680 552320 - What's the deal?!<br />- You're shooting a gun on my boat!
552520 554560 I'm not shooting your boat,<br />I'm shooting Jaws.
554760 558480 Nobody's killing it<br />just to have its teeth!
558680 561800 You're grumpy since you<br />learned you'll be a grandpa.
562080 563400 Get off of me, will you?
563640 565080 Don't fool around!
566400 568640 Some piece of hardware!<br />Got a permit?
568840 570800 Of course!<br />I'm a P.I. Now.
571080 574200 A gumshoe! You get in<br />ugly situations. I got guns!
574680 576240 You are an ugly situation.
576440 579440 You don't deserve this.<br />You're not safe.
580600 581880 Smart move, Riggs.
582800 583680 Shit!
586200 587080 Hard right!
589120 590320 You hear shots?
590560 592560 Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7.</i>
600480 602680 We're in L.A. Harbor.
603200 604400 We got an 07.
607720 609080 They're getting away!
609320 611200 Who was it? Do we know?
612240 614280 No, no, I'll drive!
617160 619640 - Want me to help?<br />- Get out of here!
620040 621080 This your gun?
621320 622840 Yeah, want laser surgery?
623120 624880 You could blind somebody!
628080 630760 Coast Guard, this is <i>Code 7,</i><br /><i>in pursuit of freighter.</i>
631120 632120 Heading north.
632440 634080 Awaiting instructions. Over.
634440 636920 <i>Code 7,</i><br /><i>maintain your present course.</i>
637200 638840 <i>We have a cutter en route.</i>
639480 640760 Why you slowing down?
641000 643960 We'll hang here.<br />Coast Guard'll be here soon.
644200 646440 - What do we do now?<br />- Show them our badges.
646720 647760 LAPD!
648120 649000 LAPD!
649280 650960 Los Angeles Police Department!
651120 653080 We heard gunfire!<br />The Coast Guard's on the...
679600 682160 Coast Guard!<br />Freighter's on fire!
682440 684840 - Let's board them.<br />- What are you talking about?!
685160 687000 Fire on the freighter!
691840 694640 Okay, I'm upside.<br />Now what do you do?
694960 696720 They're getting away.<br />Get me up there!
702480 703880 Hell of a fishing trip!
704080 707080 Shut up and keep your head down!
707320 708320 LAPD!
708520 711280 Stop where you are!<br />Hold it right there!
713880 716040 He's got it! He's got it!
719120 720320 What'd he say?
720560 721720 Watch his back!
724400 725960 You didn't say you'd shoot!
727640 729200 Tie it up!
730840 732000 Pull it up!
739000 740080 Great!
740880 742840 I said keep the boat closer!
744440 745880 Why listen to Leo?
754720 755880 Shit!
765400 766920 You all right, Riggs?!
769600 770600 Look!
773040 774240 Shit!
774440 776040 Jump! Jump!
781920 783400 Where are you?
784040 786480 My boat! My new boat!
803200 806080 - The shark.<br />- What about the shark?
806400 807600 Shark!
810240 811920 Don't leave me!
825040 826040 Come on!
836640 838320 - Hurry up!<br />- I'm coming!
857360 858520 You'll make it!
866160 867720 This is all I got left.
894440 897040 Four sets of papers, totally genuine.
897360 900080 They'll get in the country<br />and can stay forever.
900400 902040 U.S. Citizens.
903280 905200 Ask them to vote the incumbent party.
905440 907960 Help me keep my State Department job.
908240 909480 Bloody marvelous!
909840 913360 They red-flag Asian visas.<br />Those were hard to slip through.
914200 917160 The ship's been impounded.
918200 919280 What about the family?
920520 922480 We don't know yet.
922960 925240 Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
927640 928960 Something wrong?
931120 933840 A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.
938600 940520 Goodbye.
940720 941600 Leave!
948320 949560 I'll find them.
950080 951160 Now.
1013160 1015640 Coast Guard interdicts<br />about one a month.
1016000 1017080 Pretty raggedy-looking.
1017400 1019880 Six weeks locked in a hole<br />with one toilet.
1020120 1023440 Rice and some fish to eat.<br />Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.
1023840 1025960 Where'd they get that kind of money?
1026280 1030160 Didn't. Got to work it off from<br />the snakeheads, the smugglers.
1030840 1032920 - They sell them as cheap labor.<br />- Sell them?
1033120 1033920 Like slaves.
1036600 1038440 These must be the lucky ones.
1038720 1042520 They'll claim asylum. Say they were<br />persecuted, like everybody else.
1042880 1046240 We'll send them packing.<br />Cost you and me a fortune.
1046600 1048800 What happened to,<br />"Bring me your tired, your poor...
1049040 1051440 ...your wretched masses,<br />yearning to be free"?
1051960 1053720 Now it reads, "No vacancies."
1054440 1057400 I guess your parents<br />were Native Americans.
1061800 1063840 They pop one every boatload.
1064280 1067040 Shows the rest what'll happen<br />if they run off.
1069360 1070840 He's nobody's slave now.
1072680 1074200 Don't coddle them, move them!
1074520 1076760 I see this barrel coming down.
1077040 1079320 Murtaugh didn't see it,<br />so I push him.
1079680 1082240 I knock him over.<br />We're in the water.
1082520 1085040 I pull because he can't swim.<br />I got to save him.
1085600 1088840 There's that kid.<br />What's his name? Bissel?
1089120 1091360 - It's a food.<br />- Burger!
1091680 1093080 No, Biscuits or something.
1093400 1096000 He always kisses my ass,<br />gives me coffee and shit.
1096240 1099360 Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />What are you doing here?
1099560 1102200 - That's a long story.<br />- You're all wet!
1102640 1104080 - You need a blanket?<br />- I'm fine.
1104520 1107880 - Somebody get this man a blanket now!<br />- Yes, sir!
1108640 1111720 - Get this body out of here.<br />- What do we got here?
1112000 1113760 Step back, step back.
1115360 1116680 Shit!
1117040 1119120 He's dead.<br />He's fucking dead!
1119480 1120640 - Shit!<br />- What?
1120920 1123360 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1123640 1125200 Was he in the killing section?
1125600 1127440 This guy's been shot four times!
1128520 1131000 At close range, like he was executed!
1131200 1132360 He was executed.
1132560 1133360 By the crew.
1134280 1139120 People get killed left, right<br />and center in this town!
1139360 1141000 Now we import victims?
1141360 1144480 Gangbangers kill each other,<br />no problem!
1144760 1147080 One of us gets shot,<br />occupational hazard!
1147480 1151480 But just a normal guy?<br />What did he ever do to anybody?!
1151760 1153440 - That ain't right.<br />- Easy, Biscuits.
1153600 1155720 You'll get an ulcer.<br />Settle down.
1156040 1156880 Blanket!
1158480 1159680 Sorry, Blankets.
1160600 1162160 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1162480 1165320 I hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1165680 1169560 We'd stick around, Butler,<br />but you're in charge so...
1169880 1172680 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1173000 1177040 - Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />- All right, Boogers.
1177800 1179560 Hey, get them out of here!
1180360 1181840 Get them out of here!
1182680 1185240 He takes the job kind of personally.
1185440 1188880 Yeah, he's pretty serious, I'd say.<br />Overzealous.
1189080 1190480 Jealous of who?
1190680 1193400 - I don't know. Who?<br />- You said he was jealous.
1193600 1194840 You just said...
1195120 1197200 I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1197400 1199160 He's loud too.
1199400 1200960 - He's loud!<br />- What?
1201400 1203200 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1203400 1204800 I got something in the lifeboat.
1205080 1207800 That's okay,<br />I'll catch a squad ride.
1210560 1212320 I'm sorry about your boat.
1215480 1217600 - I'm sorry.<br />- Shit!
1217880 1221480 Suddenly, a big fucking shark comes...<br />Can I say that?
1221760 1223920 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1224160 1226800 So this big darn shark comes along...
1238440 1240080 My <i>Code 7.</i>
1284720 1287200 - You were coming home last night.<br />- I'm sorry.
1287800 1289080 I had some bad Chinese.
1290640 1292400 You look a little banged up.
1292720 1294760 You look a little knocked up.
1297040 1298440 Are you okay?
1298640 1299880 You sure?
1300640 1302600 Easy, tiger!<br />There he goes again.
1302840 1304440 There she goes again.
1305880 1306680 You okay?
1306920 1309520 I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1309760 1312800 - Boat sank?<br />- I had something to do with it.
1313040 1314360 No! No grease!
1315200 1317600 - Have some cookies.<br />- What happened?
1318960 1321280 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1321720 1322600 Here, boy.
1324320 1325320 Thanks.
1325600 1329480 You were fishing.<br />Does trouble go looking for you?
1329720 1333640 It seems to know pretty much<br />where I am most of the time.
1334400 1336280 You finished the nursery.
1336560 1337600 Yeah, I did.
1337800 1340560 It's good for a girl or boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1340760 1343200 It's a dogfest!<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1343440 1346200 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1346600 1348240 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1351880 1356240 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1367600 1369760 I figured you didn't want that.
1373360 1375040 You want to get married?
1377800 1379080 Well, no.
1381520 1382720 Me neither.
1384040 1385160 Breakfast?
1400880 1403240 <i>Serve and Protect.</i>
1403560 1406240 Since when do you read this smut?
1407680 1411080 It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />Trish gave it to me.
1411280 1414240 "Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1414560 1416360 He devoured her with his eyes."
1417520 1420640 Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1423320 1425800 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1426040 1429160 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1430120 1434000 Have I ever<br />"made your womanhood reach peaks...
1434280 1436200 ...to rival the Himalayas"?
1436480 1439880 - Foothills of Malibu, maybe.<br />- Not even a Teton?
1440120 1441480 - I don't think so.<br />- Thanks.
1441760 1444160 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1444400 1446040 You know I'm kidding.
1447120 1450160 - You say that to make me feel better.<br />- No, I don't.
1451240 1452280 You know I'm playing.
1452560 1455040 I've been to plenty of<br />mountaintops with you.
1455400 1457360 It's just that I'm hungry.
1459240 1461600 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.
1461840 1464120 - I brought you a doughnut.<br />- Police food!
1464360 1465520 How did you know?
1467720 1469800 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1470000 1471280 How's the rat squad?
1471520 1474240 - I picked up something good.<br />- Some cheese?
1474680 1477040 I.A. Got an anonymous tip.
1477280 1479440 The person said Roger's on the take.
1480040 1481760 No, he's not.
1482040 1485120 I know! It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1485600 1488400 But with new boats<br />and putting 2 kids through college...
1488640 1490440 ...I thought you ought to know.
1490640 1493440 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1493760 1496840 Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1497160 1499240 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1499560 1501160 - That's awful.<br />- I'm kidding.
1501800 1503960 Don't tell him I said it.<br />With his problems...
1504280 1507520 ...he'll blow his top.<br />Just don't say anything.
1509280 1510640 What do you mean?
1513160 1514320 Like what?
1514560 1516920 - In general, problems.<br />- You mean something specific.
1517240 1519080 I got a nose for these things. What?
1520360 1523600 You're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1523840 1526880 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better.
1527200 1529400 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1529640 1530640 Tell me.
1530920 1534360 I'll tell you!<br />Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells!
1535320 1536880 What? What?
1537240 1538760 I'm drooling. What?
1540640 1544400 Promise me you'll never<br />say a word about this ever.
1544640 1546240 - I swear, I swear.<br />- Right hand!
1546520 1547880 I swear I won't, ever.
1548160 1549520 I promise. What?
1550720 1553360 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1553600 1554920 He'd kill them. So?
1555360 1559240 Rianne married one, her baby's father.<br />She's afraid to tell Roger.
1559560 1562760 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1563080 1564840 Nobody's telling Roger?
1565040 1566320 After the baby's born.
1566600 1569680 It's a package deal?<br />Take it or leave it?
1570480 1572040 - Does Trish know?<br />- She knows.
1572640 1574800 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1575040 1577480 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1578400 1580640 - Who?<br />- Sergeant Lee Butters.
1581000 1583920 This just gets better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1584200 1585960 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee...
1586200 1588840 Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing!
1589160 1593000 I won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1593400 1597480 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I won't.
1599760 1601000 Promise.
1603280 1607440 We don't have to discuss boys' names.<br />We're having a girl.
1607760 1609440 Okay. Piadora.
1609720 1612160 I like Piadora. That's sweet.
1614920 1616640 I love that name.
1619040 1622440 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1622720 1624920 We don't want to double up.
1625200 1627440 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1627720 1630440 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! I like it better.
1630680 1632800 - Don't get me started.<br />- I like those names.
1633120 1634640 Captain wants to see us.
1634920 1637520 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1637800 1638840 Bye-bye, honey.
1639360 1641200 Who had the sleepover?
1641480 1642720 Just airing out camping gear.
1643040 1644640 - We're out of here.<br />- Something smells good.
1644920 1646040 Really good!
1646320 1648680 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1649160 1650800 That smells like Chinese food.
1651080 1652800 Chinese food?
1653120 1654800 She's into Chinese cooking.
1655120 1657120 I got to taste this.
1657880 1660000 - I love Chinese food.<br />- Hold it! Please!
1660280 1661400 Please!
1662480 1664200 There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
1664480 1665400 I saw him.
1666400 1668240 A couple of Chinese people.
1668600 1670240 Actually a whole family.
1672560 1673520 Large family.
1677240 1678360 Hey, guys!
1683000 1685120 - It does smell good.<br />- Great!
1685360 1687160 They hid in the lifeboat.
1687520 1689560 I had to do something.
1689880 1692800 - So you brought them home.<br />- It took two trips.
1693080 1695480 - Really?<br />- They fit in the station wagon?
1695760 1697760 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1698040 1700120 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks English.
1700360 1703800 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1704520 1705320 Wife?
1708240 1709520 Can we speak?
1709800 1712040 Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
1712280 1713920 I'm hungry. I'd love some.
1714920 1718600 This is illegal.<br />As in, "against the law."
1718880 1720480 You'll bring a shitstorm<br />down on you.
1720840 1723400 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1724160 1727440 The way I see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1727720 1729600 And I'm freeing slaves...
1729960 1733320 ...like no one did for my ancestors.
1736160 1738880 It's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1741760 1744320 Why didn't you say so?<br />This won't be boring.
1744600 1746080 Need any help?
1747840 1749040 Where is he?
1752320 1754040 What this time,<br />food or money?
1754280 1755520 - Food and money.<br />- Money.
1755800 1757520 I see you more<br />than when you lived here.
1757800 1759600 We're independent now.
1759840 1760800 What's the money for?
1761080 1762640 - Hookers, drugs...<br />- Contraceptives.
1763280 1765480 Can you believe how<br />they talk to me?
1765760 1768720 It costs more to go to school now.
1769760 1773600 I get the tuition bills.<br />And the grades too!
1773840 1776520 This is a down payment<br />on a future ass-chewing.
1776800 1779080 Get out and go to school.
1779360 1781200 I see the tuition.
1781480 1784840 I want to see some grades!<br />I want more cluck for my buck.
1785160 1786480 Thanks for the money.
1789320 1790200 I'm tired.
1790480 1792120 Me, I can't win.
1792400 1793400 Boy!
1794720 1797360 Did we get a raise<br />and nobody told me?
1799880 1801600 I got to get to the bank.
1801920 1805440 How can you when you're taken<br />to the cleaners all the time?
1807120 1808000 Hey, guys.
1808640 1809680 Hey, Trish!
1811000 1813680 - Both the kids leave?<br />- Yes. And we're broke.
1813920 1814920 Is Lorna here?
1815200 1817800 She's in the kitchen,<br />on her third breakfast.
1818040 1819840 I remember those days.
1821120 1823480 - I'm sorry!<br />- I love it when you do that.
1825080 1826640 You look terrific.
1827000 1829400 Wait till she tries raising<br />that baby by herself.
1829680 1830720 I'll be fine.
1831360 1834480 Move back in and Grandpa'll<br />be up nights with the baby.
1834760 1836760 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1839000 1840480 A cop or something.
1841240 1842240 True.
1842480 1844080 Come on, guys.<br />See you.
1844360 1846080 I should say goodbye.
1846600 1847640 Hurry up!
1848240 1849680 Stuffing your face!
1849960 1852320 Stop kissing me.<br />Try that.
1852560 1854160 Stay away from my girl.
1854640 1857000 I'm not joking.<br />Stay away from my girl.
1857280 1860440 - Joking!<br />- Got the baby beeper?
1866000 1868000 - I know.<br />- It's your fault.
1868240 1870600 It's your fault.<br />All the chicken shit.
1870920 1872760 Flapping all over the place.
1874920 1876000 All right, everybody!
1876320 1880080 It's been a year almost.<br />This shit ain't funny no more!
1881840 1884360 - Enough is enough!<br />- Please! Enough!
1884640 1886640 I'm the one that gets it in the neck.
1886880 1888320 Can we exercise maturity?
1888600 1890960 If I find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1892840 1896360 I catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1897560 1899640 - Cut their balls off.<br />- Captain.
1901360 1904080 I look out expecting<br />to see all the old faces.
1904320 1907520 Instead, I see kids<br />whose names I barely remember.
1907840 1911680 Will you sit down?<br />We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
1911960 1912960 Speak for yourself.
1913200 1915040 We're making way for the new police:
1915240 1919720 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
1924200 1926000 Biter has a psychology degree?
1926280 1929840 - More like a psycho degree.<br />- Times have got to change.
1930120 1932760 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
1933000 1934560 That's how far back I go.
1936160 1937600 You wanted to see us?
1937960 1939400 Some things don't change.
1939720 1942360 - Here we go.<br />- The department lost its insurance.
1942640 1945320 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one...
1945640 1947920 ...while you two still run around.
1949320 1951400 They can't fire you either.
1951720 1954360 So, they're promoting you.
1956360 1959480 - Lieutenant!<br />- There's no open lieutenant spots.
1959760 1963400 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />making you captains.
1964640 1966440 - Better.<br />- Captain!
1966680 1970480 Time was when this would send me over<br />the falls. I'm getting old.
1971760 1972960 What do we do now?
1973480 1974680 Captain shit!
1975000 1977120 - Hang out.<br />- Take long lunches.
1977400 1980480 Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain."
1980800 1982200 "Chief's shitting bricks!"
1982440 1983240 You finished?
1983960 1986600 Can you stay out of trouble?
1986840 1988080 Absolutely.
1988360 1990720 - Captain Riggs!<br />- Captain Murtaugh!
1999000 2002200 You want your badges?<br />Let me see those sergeant badges.
2002480 2004560 Throw them over here.
2006640 2009000 This is the most painful<br />experience of my life.
2009400 2011800 - Now get out!<br />- Thank you, Captain.
2012080 2014120 Thank you, Captain.
2014800 2017280 Enough with the "Captain" shit!<br />Get out of here!
2017560 2021280 After you, Captain, I insist!<br />"O Captain! My Captain!"
2021560 2023840 - Captains outrageous!<br />- News travels fast.
2024120 2027120 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis...
2027400 2030280 <i>They got brown rings</i><br /><i>Around their noses</i>
2031560 2034120 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper.
2034400 2036000 - Not for me.<br />- I'll take a rain check.
2036280 2039440 - Lf you change your mind, call us.<br />- He's down-to-earth.
2041240 2042440 I'm sorry.
2044280 2048920 Can we knock this off?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2051520 2054040 The man's got feelings, you know?
2061000 2062720 Congratulations.<br />Look at you!
2062920 2064560 Captain Murtaugh.
2064840 2068720 I don't know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2070520 2071720 Keep it up.
2072040 2073200 How's it going, Burton?
2073480 2076000 - It's Butters, Captain.<br />- I'll remember that.
2076280 2078880 - Kid really likes you.<br />- I wish he'd cut it out.
2079280 2080600 He likes me?
2082680 2083880 Likes me?
2088320 2091240 You don't think he likes me...
2092360 2094640 ...likes me like that?
2097720 2099480 It's the police,<br />not the military.
2099800 2101720 The millennium's upon us.
2102000 2105440 The captain said:<br />"New people, new department."
2112880 2114240 Dr. Woods?
2116360 2117400 Captain Riggs.
2117680 2119280 - Don't run.<br />- I'm in a rush.
2119600 2122760 - I need to talk to you.<br />- What is it this time?
2123000 2125200 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2125520 2128880 - Or did you cook up something new?<br />- I'm sorry about all that.
2129160 2131160 I want your advice.<br />I was thinking of...
2131480 2133480 - Thinking?<br />- Marriage.
2134480 2136880 Marriage?! The "M" word?
2137120 2139640 Does "confidentiality" mean anything?
2139880 2141080 That's funny.
2141320 2143960 You know what'd happen?<br />We'd go in my office...
2144280 2146280 ...and you know what you'd tell me?
2146560 2149400 You'd tell me something like, "Doc...
2149720 2151680 ...I want to marry Murtaugh."
2151880 2154400 Or your mother.<br />Or Nelson Mandela!
2154680 2155800 Nelson Mandela?!
2156120 2158480 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2158720 2161160 Something to get a rise out of me.
2161680 2162800 Listen carefully!
2163080 2165240 I'm... not... stupid!
2166120 2168120 And my time is reserved...
2168480 2172240 ...for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2172560 2173880 Have you got that?!
2174920 2176440 - Have you?!<br />- Ask me again?
2176680 2178440 No. And you know what?
2179120 2180360 I don't like you.
2184480 2185680 Stephanie?
2186320 2189160 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship.
2189480 2191600 I think you need to see someone.
2191840 2194080 You'll find someone to love you.
2194320 2197040 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2197320 2199360 You're disgusting!
2199600 2201120 What's the matter with you people?!
2206320 2207440 What's shaking?
2207640 2209560 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2209800 2212240 Turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2212560 2214400 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2214680 2216760 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2217040 2220120 Big enough to kick your ass.<br />What can I do for you?
2220360 2223720 One of the ship's crew shot an illegal,<br />apparently under orders...
2223960 2227640 ...and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese.
2227960 2231480 We're pretty sure the big boss<br />is Benny Chan.
2231800 2232800 Uncle Benny?
2233080 2234440 You know him?
2234840 2237560 - When he was running smack.<br />- We never nailed him.
2237840 2238920 Benny's slippery.
2239320 2240720 Where's he hang out?
2241000 2243040 He's got a nightclub,<br />some restaurants.
2243320 2246520 He operates mainly out on North<br />Broadway. Here's the address.
2248240 2249480 Hi, fellas.
2250720 2252680 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Summers.
2252920 2253960 Butters.
2254600 2256200 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2256480 2260240 I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2260520 2265400 The boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2265640 2268400 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2268640 2270160 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2270400 2272600 No. What kind of bad man is he?
2272840 2274800 Real bad.<br />Crime boss in Chinatown.
2275080 2277640 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2277880 2279560 Where do I find him?
2279800 2280840 At this restaurant.
2281080 2283400 I'm hungry for Chinese.<br />How about you?
2283640 2286320 We're going there anyway.<br />We'll drive you.
2286560 2287960 Let me get my jacket.
2288480 2290920 - Not with him.<br />- He's doing good.
2291160 2292640 We might need backup.
2292920 2295840 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2296120 2297480 Like a son.
2297960 2298960 In law...
2299160 2302560 ...enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2308040 2311560 Sir, it'll be an honor<br />to share egg rolls with you.
2311960 2314440 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2314640 2316000 Share?
2317720 2322400 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2322840 2324200 Why do you say that, sir?
2324480 2327840 Last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2328120 2329800 Wasn't he, Roger?
2330040 2331760 Any particular reason?
2332040 2334320 About 150,000 of them.
2334560 2337640 That's how many bullets zinged<br />my neighborhood growing up.
2337920 2340720 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2341000 2345000 Lived and ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2345480 2347600 I didn't learn to walk<br />till I was 10.
2348200 2351400 Spent my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2352200 2355360 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2355600 2358760 I'm thinking about that floor<br />and it pisses me off.
2362480 2365920 - We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />- No, why?
2366120 2368200 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look.
2368760 2371200 - Who's Leo?<br />- Maybe it's a coincidence.
2371600 2374720 - What does he want?<br />- I don't know. Let's find out.
2383720 2385520 - Fucking asshole!<br />- Bite me!
2385760 2387480 Whatever! Whatever!
2388480 2389520 Jerk!
2390560 2391720 You looking for us?
2392120 2394440 - You saw me?<br />- Yeah, we saw you.
2394840 2395880 What you doing, Leo?
2396160 2399160 I'm perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I.
2399800 2403960 He's a private eyesore.<br />Inconspicuous vehicle! I like it.
2404960 2406360 Riggs, who's the perp?
2406560 2408520 - What'd you bust him for?<br />- I'm a perp?
2408920 2411680 A brother in a police car<br />is automatically a perp?
2412320 2415600 Look at my suit!<br />Do I look like the Crips' accountant?
2416360 2417840 Look at this badge, bitch!
2418200 2419880 Check out the gun.
2420120 2421400 Put the gun down!
2421680 2424440 License! Registration!<br />Urine sample!
2424760 2425840 I got a badge too!
2426160 2428440 German Jews didn't have it<br />easy as kids!
2428800 2430480 So don't think you're the only one.
2430800 2432360 I knew you were a cop.
2432640 2435000 I was kidding.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.
2435600 2437160 You saying I smell bad?
2437440 2439720 Don't turn everything around!<br />You're so touchy.
2440440 2442720 These guys'll tell you.<br />We got a history together.
2443040 2444920 Maybe we'll work together someday!
2445160 2446320 I'm the bomb!
2446680 2450240 We'll work together when I open<br />a cereal shop, you leprechaun!
2450520 2452840 I didn't call you names, fuckface!<br />Don't start!
2453200 2454680 Don't fool around!
2455240 2458240 - These guys'll tell you.<br />- You're double-parked.
2458560 2461160 Officer, I'm just talking<br />with the detectives.
2461560 2462760 We don't know this guy.
2463960 2465160 Think he was drinking.
2465440 2467040 They're kidding.<br />Come back!
2467280 2469600 I wasn't drinking!<br />They just said that.
2469880 2473040 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.
2473320 2474800 Blow in my fucking ear!
2475720 2478200 You're all mine.<br />You're mine!
2481000 2482840 You promised to deliver the family.
2483560 2485440 They're not at the detention center.
2485640 2487240 They must have escaped.
2487680 2491120 The uncle won't finish until<br />he sees them.
2491760 2495640 Don't worry, they'll turn up.
2496880 2499520 In Hong Kong, you'd already be dead.
2504240 2505480 Where's Uncle Benny?
2506120 2507560 - He's not here.<br />- Is he in there?
2507840 2509160 - I'm sure he is.<br />- This way.
2509440 2510760 Yes, it's a two-way.
2511080 2512840 We have 3 people.
2513280 2516160 The restaurant's over there.<br />Go this way, please.
2516440 2518320 They see us,<br />but we can't see them.
2518520 2521040 - Where's your green card?<br />- That's a racist remark.
2521400 2523840 I'm a policeman<br />who asked for your green card!
2524160 2525200 This is not the way.
2525400 2527640 You're the boss<br />till we get up in his ass.
2530320 2532560 It'll be fine.<br />They've refurbished!
2533120 2534760 I couldn't stop them.
2535200 2537560 - Out, out!<br />- Can I get drink or food?
2537840 2540120 Uncle Benny!<br />I hope this is a bad time.
2540320 2543320 - He still has unclipped eyebrows.<br />- What'd we tell you?
2543640 2547280 - We hate not disturbing you.<br />- This is Detective Buckles.
2547480 2551480 Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?<br />How's the restaurant?
2551800 2552880 Eat something.
2553200 2555120 Give you the police discount.
2555400 2557200 Flied lice?
2557440 2559280 It is fried rice, you plick!
2562680 2564680 I'm busy.<br />What is it this time?
2565520 2566760 Tell him, Buttkiss.
2567000 2570360 Know about a boatload of<br />illegals that went aground?
2571080 2572680 Just what I saw on the news.
2572920 2574760 Someone lost big money.
2575000 2577480 400 people at 35 grand.<br />14 million!
2578840 2580840 And missed making them slaves.
2581120 2585120 You are cops.<br />Smuggling Chinese is an INS problem.
2585480 2588560 We found 3 bodies full of holes,<br />so now it's a cop problem.
2588840 2590160 Three dead Chinese?
2590600 2593720 - Billion more where they came from.<br />- Yes, life's cheap.
2594000 2597080 But he shot at us too.<br />That pisses us off.
2597640 2598800 Too bad they missed.
2599400 2601000 But I know nothing about it.
2602880 2604120 Who's he?
2607040 2608920 He looks unhappy.<br />What's his name?
2609120 2612400 Who's this guy?<br />Is he just appraising your furniture?
2612600 2614240 He doesn't speak English.
2614440 2618280 Then he doesn't understand<br />words like "scumbag"...
2619000 2620360 ..."eat shit"?
2621440 2623600 I think he understands good.
2628400 2630840 - Enter the drag queen.<br />- The insurance, remember?
2631160 2633560 If you have nothing on me,<br />get out.
2634040 2635560 We're still around.
2636000 2637240 I'm on your ass too.
2638200 2639720 But the door is this way!
2640200 2642560 This is quicker.<br />This is quicker, really.
2646080 2647360 See? It's quicker!
2649240 2652160 Don't forget my<br />10�/� policeman's discount.
2654560 2657960 You in Hong Kong,<br />you'd be dead.
2659920 2661560 No, not that!<br />Riggs! Don't!
2663880 2665400 The insurance...<br />What the hell?
2672360 2673680 Hurry up!
2674000 2677360 Try it sometime.<br />It's satisfying and therapeutic.
2677640 2680520 - Saves the cost of shrinks.<br />- Bad guys can't call the cops.
2680800 2683360 - Why not? We're already here!<br />- El Ni o!
2684440 2685560 I know this guy.
2685760 2687120 That's the captain.<br />Hold it!
2692680 2693840 Remember, no damage!
2708200 2709440 Shit!
2711680 2715760 LAPD! I'm commandeering<br />your bike. Here, $200.
2716560 2717760 Riggs, I'm coming!
2718720 2720280 Somebody stole your bike!
2721880 2722920 Stop!
2723840 2724840 Police!
2726160 2727480 Out of the way!
2727880 2729560 Butler!<br />Chase the fast one!
2729800 2731600 You have Alzheimer's?
2745240 2746440 Stop! Freeze!
2759600 2762360 Stop in Chinese, motherfucker!<br />Halt!
2775680 2777240 Out the way! Police!
2777480 2778840 He's getting away!
2785680 2787120 Excuse me!<br />Out of the way!
2796880 2798040 Get down! LAPD!
2798240 2799760 Stop, you little shit!
2812760 2815120 Get down!<br />Get the fuck down!
2820280 2822440 My arm!<br />I didn't do anything!
2830480 2831840 I got you covered!
2834160 2837160 You got the right to remain silent!<br />So shut the fuck up!
2837440 2840680 You got the right to an attorney.<br />If you can't afford one...
2841040 2844320 ...we'll provide you with<br />the dumbest lawyer on Earth!
2844720 2846880 If you get Johnnie Cochran,<br />I'll kill you!
2858200 2860480 Don't jump!<br />You're going to be a father!
2860800 2862000 Don't jump!
2867400 2868440 Hold on!
2869040 2870880 Hold on! I'll get you!
2871240 2873120 Riggs, don't move!
2873400 2874520 I won't move.
2874800 2875880 Hold on! I got you!
2876200 2877400 You'll catch me?
2877720 2880640 No, I won't catch you.<br />I got a dumpster here.
2880920 2882840 You didn't do nothing.<br />Why'd you run?
2883040 2883920 Butters!
2884120 2885640 - Get over here!<br />- Shit!
2885960 2886840 Hurry up!
2887120 2888360 Come on!
2889280 2890240 Hold on!
2891600 2893600 A bit more to the left!
2893840 2895320 Move this there!<br />Now!
2895600 2896840 No, the other left!
2897440 2899160 Make up your mind!
2899400 2901080 You couldn't find something smaller?!
2901320 2902520 It's all I could find!
2902800 2905160 I got it here!<br />Now, jump on "three"!
2905440 2906280 Ready?
2906520 2908400 Ass first!<br />It breaks the fall!
2909360 2910280 One...
2910520 2912440 ...two, three!<br />Son of a bitch!
2914600 2916000 You all right?
2916240 2917520 I should've had him.
2917720 2919160 Damn right, you should've!
2919600 2921200 Who's your partner?
2921560 2923320 - Son of a bitch!<br />- I don't have a partner!
2923560 2924800 The guy you ran with!
2925040 2926560 I'm a waiter.
2927000 2929040 You guys pull a gun,<br />try to kill me!
2929320 2931760 You physically abuse me.<br />I want my lawyer!
2932880 2936640 If you're a waiter,<br />what's today's special?
2937880 2938680 What's today?
2939720 2940720 Wednesday!
2941360 2943960 Sweet and sour pork,<br />barbecue spareribs...
2944240 2945640 Shut up!
2946400 2949160 Next time, don't run!<br />Stay still!
2950400 2951800 Johnnie Cochran!
2952000 2953440 He fight for me!
2996400 2999880 <i>Mao began helping in the fields</i><br /><i>when he was 6 years old.</i>
3000160 3003400 <i>- He led a rebellion early against his</i><br /><i>domineering father.</i>
3003640 3007160 <i>Finally, Mao left home</i><br /><i>to continue his schooling.</i>
3007280 3011480 <i>Those were troubled times. Old China</i><br /><i>dissolved in a welter of unrest...</i>
3012400 3015040 - Sorry, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- Sit, please.
3015280 3016800 And it's Roger.
3017520 3020680 - It's your chair.<br />- Really, it's fine. Sit.
3020920 3022240 Something to drink?
3022440 3023480 Tequila?
3024240 3025440 Thank you so much.
3025880 3027320 From Mexico.
3028560 3031520 This can't be the first time<br />you had tequila, Hong.
3031840 3034200 - Yes.<br />- No!
3037480 3038520 Bread.
3039280 3040120 Bread.
3040920 3041960 Toast!
3042200 3043720 Yeah, toast!
3043960 3044960 Bread!
3050280 3051800 You know anybody here?
3052080 3053160 My uncle.

3056320 3057920 You been in contact with him?
3058600 3060520 No. I leave message.
3061840 3063200 What's your uncle do?
3064400 3067200 In China, he's artist.
3067480 3068680 An artist?
3071640 3073440 It's tough leaving home, huh?
3076800 3078240 In America...
3078880 3081440 ...my children have chance<br />to make good life.
3082040 3084640 We want the best for our children.
3084880 3086640 And our grandchildren!
3087640 3089800 You believe<br />I'm a grandfather?
3090160 3091880 That's right! Little Ping!
3092600 3094080 You're a grandpa!
3095320 3096800 Where's the time go?
3098720 3099760 Don't know.
3099960 3101200 Have no watch.
3101480 3102880 You have no watch?
3103320 3104440 Here.
3104800 3107000 This is my pop's. Take it.
3107280 3109840 He got it when he retired<br />from the force.
3110080 3111840 No, I cannot!
3112160 3113440 I want you to have it.
3113640 3117320 It belonged to a good man.<br />It ought to belong to another good man.
3119360 3120880 Thank you so much...
3121080 3121960 ...Roger.
3207280 3208520 Shit!
3212920 3213640 Hold him!
3214680 3215840 Push him off!
3222800 3223800 Get him!
3227120 3228600 What's wrong?
3228880 3230520 It's the shoulder.
3231240 3234640 It's an old injury.<br />I'll have to toss in the towel.
3235600 3237200 It happens periodically.
3238160 3241120 I was just getting going too.<br />You're lucky, kid.
3241400 3244240 - You're lucky he didn't kill you.<br />- You owe me a rematch!
3244560 3246960 - Anytime you want.<br />- I might even train for it.
3247240 3249320 Better bring your own paramedic too.
3251320 3254440 - I'll get ice for that shoulder.<br />- It's okay.
3254680 3256760 There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.
3259480 3261040 I was faking it.
3261640 3263040 Faking it?
3264000 3267760 Gomez was killing me out there.<br />I didn't have anything left.
3268080 3269760 I told you that kid was good.
3269880 3272560 He's good, but it's not all him.
3273920 3277840 I've been feeling it lately.<br />You know the other...
3283600 3286400 Like, on the ship<br />when that guy nailed me.
3286600 3288880 And yesterday I couldn't catch him.
3289280 3292080 I just thought,<br />I'm out of shape or something.
3292360 3294920 You know.<br />But it's more than that.
3295200 3298640 It's like,<br />I hate to say this but...
3298840 3300960 You're getting too old for this shit.
3306080 3307480 How about that?
3308080 3309080 Finally.
3310080 3312440 No, but I can't be.<br />I mean, I'm only...
3314120 3316120 - Jesus.<br />- Yeah, you're only.
3317960 3319800 Can't beat the clock, Riggs.
3322280 3325440 Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.<br />What'll I do?
3326120 3327360 Accept it.
3329960 3331160 Like I do.
3333520 3334840 No. Bullshit!
3335520 3336760 I won't accept it.
3337000 3338400 I'll will it not to happen.
3338600 3340240 You're going to will it?
3340560 3342360 I'm not too old for this shit.
3342560 3346320 I'm not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for this shit.
3346680 3349560 We're not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for...
3349800 3350920 Say it like you believe it.
3351200 3353200 We're not too old for this shit.
3354440 3356760 I'm not going to buy<br />a hemorrhoid cushion.
3357080 3357880 I won't get corns!
3358080 3359400 I got corns!
3359600 3360480 I won't wear a suit!
3360960 3363000 What's wrong with wearing a suit?
3363240 3364680 How's it going, Captain?
3374840 3376680 Thanks a lot, guys.<br />Very funny!
3376960 3379000 That cop tried to strip-search me!
3379280 3380840 - You get his phone number?<br />- Funny.
3381120 3383600 Sugar-glazed with jelly.<br />Thanks, Leo.
3383840 3385680 - What happened? The scratches.<br />- A dog.
3385920 3388720 A dog catch you<br />drinking out of his bowl?
3388920 3391080 I'm working on<br />an important P.I. Case.
3391320 3392480 Did the dog hire you?
3392720 3395720 No! The people that<br />lost the dog hired me.
3395960 3396960 Sounds like a big case.
3397200 3401480 It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot.<br />It's an expensive dog.
3401760 3403520 - A Bolshoi.<br />- Borzoi.
3403800 3405040 Whatever, whatever!
3405600 3407040 And you found it?
3407320 3409800 Sort of.<br />Listen to what happens.
3410440 3414240 Instead of going looking for the dog,<br />I went to the pound.
3414560 3418280 I take the dog home, dye him.<br />It looks exactly like their dog.
3418560 3419840 Dog was a real rat, though.
3420040 3421840 He scratched me.<br />But I got the job done.
3422120 3424000 Some kind of P.I. Business you got.
3424360 3426200 Douche Ventura, pet infective.
3426480 3428040 It's grand theft.
3428320 3429960 With trickery, it's a felony.
3430200 3432800 It is?<br />You guys are always kidding.
3433120 3437080 I get it. Here comes<br />that touchy kid. I'm not here.
3438440 3439240 Putter!
3439680 3441840 The guy you chased in Chinatown?
3442080 3444400 His gun matched slugs<br />on the bodies on the boat.
3444600 3445480 He's your shooter.
3447520 3448840 Guy that got away from me.
3449000 3452440 He didn't get far.<br />They found him on a rooftop nearby.
3452640 3455280 Strangled.<br />And pigeons ate his eyeballs.
3456480 3457360 Cool.
3458000 3459480 Excuse me.
3461880 3465360 I hate these phones!<br />You get a call, they cut you off.
3465600 3467960 You make a call, they cut you off!
3468280 3471400 You know what they're doing?<br />They fuck you with cell phones.
3471640 3474880 They love when you get cut off.<br />You know why?
3475160 3476520 When you call back...
3476760 3480480 ...they charge you for the first<br />minute again at that high rate.
3480760 3482720 If you're able to call back...
3483040 3486320 ...because the 3-hour battery<br />you got only lasts 20 minutes.
3486600 3488360 If you're behind a hill, it goes...
3488640 3492320 Or you go through a tunnel.<br />And they keep making it smaller!
3492560 3495040 You know why?<br />So you can lose it.
3495440 3498480 So you buy more phones.<br />I never lost my mother's phone!
3498760 3501920 Take you two hours to make<br />a long-distance call.
3504480 3507760 I messed up! Hang up.<br />Got to do it again!
3508960 3511880 I never lost my<br /><i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit phone.
3512120 3515680 And scanners! They get your<br />number and call all over the world!
3516000 3519280 Somebody took my number<br />and called Afghanistan!
3520040 3523480 I don't know what fucking<br />Afghanistan look like.
3523760 3527560 Even if I did, I would not talk<br />to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!
3527840 3529840 I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours!
3530120 3532720 They fuck you with the cell phones!
3533000 3535720 You know when you go to a drive-through?<br />Hold on.
3536000 3537440 Why am I talking...?
3538600 3541560 - Leo Getz, private investigator.<br />- Private investigator?
3541760 3544720 I wondered if you'd<br />investigate my privates.
3545680 3546840 Investigate what?
3547120 3550560 My privates, you stupid shit.<br />Shut the fuck up!
3550840 3553480 Very funny!<br />You're costing me money.
3553720 3556600 $3 to answer a call.<br />They fuck me, now you!
3556800 3558360 You're tough when on the phone.
3558560 3560240 Right!<br />Telephone tough guy.
3560440 3561920 Why are we talking on the phone?
3562120 3564200 Get out of here.<br />Go home!
3564480 3565880 What happened to your face?
3566480 3568320 "No" means no!
3571080 3572880 He'll like me, I can tell.
3573200 3574280 He'd be the first.
3577080 3578760 Whatever! Whatever!
3583400 3586240 You know, we should hire Leo.
3586760 3587760 Hire Leo?
3588040 3589840 He can follow Uncle Benny around.
3590120 3591720 - Benny'll see him.<br />- Yeah!
3591960 3594560 - He'll drive him nuts.<br />- Benny'll shoot him.
3596360 3597560 Let's hire him!
3598320 3600400 I smell like stale coffee.
3603600 3606160 Why do you care if I go home<br />and change shirts?
3606440 3609520 A coffee stain's not something<br />that'd bother me.
3609760 3610960 Look at the way you dress.
3611880 3613160 What's that supposed to mean?
3615400 3618320 I don't have nifty suits like you.<br />Not many cops do.
3618600 3620240 What's that supposed to mean?
3622360 3625360 I've wondered,<br />where's the money coming from?
3626560 3628360 Where do you think?
3628600 3630520 - Where do you think?<br />- I don't know.
3630800 3633560 - It's none of my business.<br />- You don't know!
3633920 3636480 Trish gave me some money.
3636760 3639720 Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.
3640320 3641840 All right. Sorry.
3644680 3645880 Whose car is that?
3646880 3648040 I don't know.
3648720 3651440 It looks like a full house<br />for Lamaze class.
3651680 3652760 You know that car?
3653040 3654640 Here you go, Captains.
3656200 3657440 No charge for the ride.
3658280 3662400 - Rianne and Lorna are here.<br />- I'll put it on your account, Captain.
3667000 3668000 Hey, honey.
3668560 3670960 What's going on?<br />I came home to change my shirt...
3676440 3677360 Why are you here?
3677800 3679040 They took the Hongs.
3686840 3687840 Shit!
3689160 3690360 Drop it.
3704040 3705760 Girls, get out!
3710280 3711760 Look who we got here.
3712080 3713880 - Uncle Benny's friend.<br />- Hey, Bruce.
3714880 3716240 Nice pajamas.
3718040 3719760 Where are the Hongs?
3726400 3727760 Drop your guns.
3728240 3730440 - Drop them!<br />- Okay, take it easy.
3730840 3733120 Don't stand for that, honey.
3739080 3739960 Son of a bitch!
3819720 3821280 Let the women go.
3840520 3842120 I can't breathe!
3871880 3872960 Son of a bitch!
3880600 3882240 I'll be damned!<br />Thanks, kid!
3887000 3888400 Ping, cut us loose!
3894840 3895840 Cut me loose!
3898120 3899480 Go ahead, cut me.
3940120 3941560 It's all right.
3942560 3943760 You okay, honey?
3944200 3945920 I owe you one, kid.
3946440 3949720 - The keys to your car?<br />- They're in the car.
3950720 3951800 We need a radio.
3956400 3957640 We have to go.
3959280 3962600 How will we find them?<br />We got to catch them assholes!
3968880 3972600 <i>- 3-William-56, this is Air 12.</i><br />- We need your eyes, guys.
3972960 3976040 Looking for a black Mercedes<br />and a black Continental.
3976360 3978880 <i>Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.</i>
3979160 3981280 Black Mercedes and black Continental?
3981560 3984320 <i>Shouldn 't be hard</i><br /><i>to find in this town.</i>
3984560 3986720 Just give it a shot, will you?
3986960 3988960 <i>- Be cooperative.</i><br />- That's a roger.
3999080 4000560 Will wonders never cease?
4000880 4004600 <i>We've got 2 black Mercedes,</i><br /><i>one heading east, one west.</i>
4005280 4007480 <i>Eastbound's on the Valley View ramp.</i>
4008960 4011000 We'll take it.<br />Locate the Continental.
4012320 4014320 - Is it the right one?<br />- I don't know.
4014560 4016440 We're going east and China's east.
4016760 4018600 - China's west too.<br />- We can't divide.
4018840 4019760 Think positive!
4024440 4025480 You crossed two lanes!
4025880 4026840 You see him?
4034000 4035640 Watch the road!
4036080 4038000 I'd give my right arm for a siren!
4042120 4043920 Why'd they take the Hongs?
4044240 4046800 Maybe they're shaking them down<br />for more money.
4049960 4053320 Hong's uncle paid already.<br />He got in touch with his uncle.
4053680 4056800 He left him a message.<br />It's how they know where I live.
4066160 4068880 There's the son of a bitch right there!
4069200 4072080 Bastards left us to burn!<br />I want to talk with them.
4072400 4074240 You don't have any guns!
4074480 4075800 Get me near this trailer.
4076080 4076920 But you're driving!
4077120 4078120 No, you're driving!
4078320 4080520 There's cruise control.<br />Just steer!
4080920 4082840 Why make shit complicated?
4090680 4093160 Closer. Don't be shy.<br />Get up there!
4095000 4096680 Closer! Closer!
4096920 4098000 That's it!

4472720 4474800 When will you have<br />the money for their release?
4475400 4476440 Very soon.
4528080 4530480 Brother... it's been a long time.
4530920 4532920 It'll be our time again soon.
4534520 4536800 America has many laws.
4537040 4541320 But written by men.
4542000 4545120 Money can change everything.
4580040 4582600 - Sorry about your loss.<br />- Thank you.
4584200 4585440 How's my hero?
4585760 4589040 He's a little sad,<br />talking about his mom and dad.
4593160 4594360 Here's Butters.
4598800 4600080 How's it going?
4600320 4601240 Why are you here?
4601520 4605160 I heard it on the radio.<br />I'm sorry about your house.
4607280 4608920 This is Detective...
4609200 4610760 Butters.
4611000 4612480 Trish, my wife.
4612760 4614840 Nick, Carrie...
4615080 4616080 ...Rianne.
4616360 4617360 Everybody okay?
4619400 4621040 You know who did this?
4621280 4622520 It was Benny.
4623840 4625280 Leo!
4626000 4628760 - You got a phone?<br />- The little Fonzie guy?
4629120 4630280 That's him.
4630880 4633520 - You be okay?<br />- We'll be all right.
4634080 4635120 Call me.
4637920 4640720 He's there?<br />We'll be right there.
4640960 4644640 - Butters, can you drive us?<br />- Yeah, let's do it.
4645040 4647440 Leo's got him at the dentist.<br />Let's go!
4651400 4652520 Sit down.
4658800 4659840 <i>Captain Murtaugh...</i>
4660440 4663400 ...I know this is a bad time...
4663840 4666520 ...but there's something<br />you need to know about me.
4667280 4669760 I think I know what it is.
4670000 4671200 You do?
4672440 4673920 It's okay.
4674720 4676000 It is?
4676240 4678440 People have the right to do<br />what makes them happy.
4678720 4680840 Just don't expect me to like it.
4681560 4683360 I know this must be hard for you.
4683680 4684800 It's impossible for me!
4686200 4689680 I hoped we'd get together<br />for the holidays, say Christmas.
4690040 4694040 Why should we get together<br />and see each other on Christmas?
4694640 4696800 - I'm trying to reach out.<br />- Reach somewhere else!
4697200 4699480 Do what you want,<br />but leave me out of it.
4699800 4702360 - I got it.<br />- I don't want to hear about it.
4702720 4703880 Not a word.
4704120 4708160 Why you grinning?<br />Think about how we can talk to Benny.
4708600 4710240 I got it all worked out.
4711000 4712440 What's the matter?
4712880 4713880 My ass hurts.
4714120 4716160 My tooth!<br />Is this a dentist or proctologist?
4716680 4719240 - Please be quiet.<br />- I'm trying! I'm in pain!
4719520 4722160 Why don't you go see<br />your own dentist?
4722520 4724800 My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!
4725080 4727560 - Oh, brother!<br />- Oh, brother?! Get the dentist!
4728600 4731160 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />It's an emergency.
4731480 4733520 A man walked in off the street.
4733760 4736240 He's in a lot of pain.<br />You better come.
4740400 4742720 Okay, you can come in now!
4750560 4754240 - Leo can pull this off?<br />- Leo's got a B.S. In B.S.
4756200 4757640 Coast is clear.
4759360 4761280 Talk to the hand!<br />One second.
4761960 4765040 - Wait a minute.<br />- Let me do my job!
4765440 4768160 You hurt me, I'll stick<br />an egg roll up your ass.
4775400 4777720 Don't be alarmed.<br />It's only a drill.
4778040 4779040 Don't say a word.
4779440 4780440 Shut up.
4781720 4785000 Where are the Hongs?<br />Open wide and tell me.
4785240 4786480 I don't know any Hongs.
4786760 4789360 Their uncle paid you<br />to get them out of China.
4789640 4791640 More smuggling?<br />We went through that.
4791880 4793160 We're going through it again.
4793520 4794960 I have nothing to say.
4795360 4797360 These look very interesting.
4797600 4798960 You're not going to use it.
4799360 4800600 You won't shoot me.
4800840 4802880 - You're lousy cops.<br />- We're good cops.
4805440 4806640 This will settle him down.
4807040 4809160 Breathe, Uncle Benny.<br />Breathe!
4810120 4811240 Crank up the nitrous.
4811920 4813120 Crank that baby up.
4813400 4815080 You said it wouldn't hurt!
4815400 4816720 I'm holding this. Go ahead.
4817360 4819440 Deep! Right down to your toes.
4826440 4828560 - He's wasted!<br />- Have some more.
4828920 4830600 He'll talk.
4831480 4832960 Good, breathe.
4836560 4838240 - That's me.<br />- That's you.
4840520 4842760 Now, where are the Hongs?
4845960 4848280 - What's <i>renminbi</i> mean?<br /><i>- Renminbi</i> means...
4848520 4849480 <i>... renminbi.</i>
4849840 4852600 - You're a funny guy.<br />- This guy's wasting our time.
4852920 4853920 Time!
4854480 4856440 Time for Four Fathers!
4856720 4858320 Washington, Jefferson?<br />Those guys?
4858640 4859640 Roosevelt?
4860560 4862720 I'm sleeping with my wife's 2 sisters.
4863120 4864320 You lucky son of a bitch!
4864640 4865840 That's a good one.
4866640 4867800 Not so good...
4868200 4869920 ...when my wife finds out.
4872080 4874560 I don't need needles!
4876880 4878960 Let's shoot his legs with Novocain...
4879200 4881640 ...and watch him<br />try to get out of here.
4884160 4886360 What you got in your hands there?
4886640 4887840 A nut cup.
4889080 4890720 I got some big nuts!
4893600 4894880 That's nitrous...
4895600 4896880 ...oxide!
4897840 4899160 Laughing gas!
4899520 4901240 We're stoned!
4905360 4906920 Murtaugh! Hurry up!
4907320 4910320 That's one funny son-in-law<br />you got there, Rog.
4910960 4912400 After tonight it be too late.
4912720 4914360 Too late for what?
4916640 4918320 Why'd you call him my son-in-law?
4918680 4920360 Uncle Benny? He's too old.
4922560 4925400 Buy Four Fathers back<br />at Four Fathers' store.
4926280 4928320 Why's he talking about his ancestors?
4928560 4929880 I don't know.
4930560 4932640 Why you call him my son-in-law?
4933120 4934320 Because I am!
4939680 4940920 I thought he was...
4943840 4945120 No, I'm...
4947560 4948560 Bloody marvelous!
4949240 4951360 Your baby is having my baby.
4952960 4955680 My baby is having his baby.
4956080 4958400 And your baby? Whoa, baby!
4958720 4960160 Whoa, baby! My baby!
4961200 4963000 What are you doing?
4963200 4965360 I couldn't stall anymore.
4966280 4967840 What happened?
4969000 4971080 Rog, look at this.<br />Does that hurt?
4978800 4982160 Uncle Benny,<br />anything happens to the Hongs...
4982360 4984320 ...we'll come back<br />and rip you a new one.
4984520 4986080 That's two for Benny.
4986440 4988120 Bloody marvelous!
4991600 4994000 - Are you crazy?<br />- Why did you do that?
4994240 4996200 For keeping it from me<br />and letting me think...
4996560 4998240 Hit him, not me.
4998480 5001760 As soon as we find the Hongs,<br />we're getting into this.
5047440 5048280 Uncle.
5048800 5049960 You're all here?
5050240 5051520 All here.
5053200 5054600 What's going on?
5054920 5057320 As payment for bringing you<br />to America...
5057520 5059520 ...your uncle's working for us.
5060400 5061600 Now finish the job.
5061840 5063640 What job?
5064280 5065920 No time to talk now.
5066160 5068240 Take them to their new homes...
5068480 5071040 ...and guarantee their safety.<br />Then I'll finish.
5084680 5088760 Finish now or watch the others die.
5103080 5104520 <i>Rimminy</i>?
5104920 5107840 A young bimbo? A jumping jiminy?<br />I don't know.
5109000 5110240 <i>I can 't remember.</i>
5110760 5112320 No, Riggs. <i>Renminbi.</i>
5112840 5113960 Say that again.
5114240 5115200 That's it!
5115520 5116440 <i>You got it.</i>
5116680 5118200 <i>Means, "people's money."</i>
5118400 5119440 People's money?
5119800 5120960 <i>What else did Benny say?</i>
5121280 5125000 <i>He was talking about</i><br /><i>buying back his ancestors.</i>
5125360 5127040 <i>And about how tonight's...</i>
5127440 5129080 ...too late.<br />Mean anything to you?
5129280 5130360 No, nothing at all.
5130680 5134680 And the guy who torched my house?<br />Benny was afraid of him.
5134960 5137680 <i>If Benny's scared,</i><br /><i>he's got to be a Chinese Triad.</i>
5138120 5140440 <i>Those guys kill anyone</i><br /><i>in their way.</i>
5140720 5141480 Including cops...
5141680 5144480 <i>... and their families.</i><br /><i>Watch your asses!</i>
5144760 5146240 <i>- Thanks, Ng.</i><br /><i>- Keep me posted.</i>
5147520 5149880 Pick up your wife, my daughter.
5150080 5152320 - I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.<br />- Her and Ping.
5213480 5214320 What?
5215640 5217280 You want to get married, don't you?
5219200 5220080 No.
5224720 5226680 Yes. Yes, I do.
5227560 5229680 But if you don't want to, it's okay.
5230600 5232000 Why didn't you tell me?
5232320 5234920 Because I didn't want to put<br />any pressure on you.
5235120 5237360 If you want to someday, that'd be great.
5239080 5240480 If you don't...
5240960 5242600 ...I love you.
5246120 5248880 I'll take you any way I can get you.
5254000 5255240 Feel that!
5256000 5258640 - Ping, feel the baby!<br />- He's really dancing.
5258920 5260360 He's kicking. You feel him?
5307880 5308880 You're okay.
5309120 5310640 <i>Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.</i>
5310720 5312400 Riggs, it's Murtaugh.
5313400 5316760 I'm sick of these fuckers.<br />Let's just find them and shoot them.
5317400 5319720 Meet me and Butters on South Spring.
5320000 5320960 <i>What's going on?</i>
5323400 5325240 They found my watch.
5328680 5332240 They killed Hong, his uncle,<br />Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.
5332520 5334840 - Where's the rest of the family?<br />- They're okay.
5335680 5339000 INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.
5339680 5343760 Hong's family was being held there<br />and they led them back here.
5345360 5347080 They were making funny money.
5347360 5348760 Ink's still wet.
5349480 5352120 - Where are the faces?<br />- It's why I call it funny.
5352720 5354520 Why are they making Chinese money?
5354800 5356600 Can they even exchange it here?
5356800 5358040 - Only in China.<br /><i>- Renminbi.</i>
5358280 5359480 I remember.
5361360 5364760 Hong's uncle was an artist.<br />Maybe an engraver.
5365160 5368760 Bringing over his family could've<br />been how he was paid for the job.
5369040 5370480 - That's thin.<br />- It's not.
5370760 5372000 Keep talking. What?
5372360 5375320 Benny said something about paying...
5375640 5377320 ...buying back his forefathers.
5377640 5378480 What'd you say?
5379560 5382800 Benny said something about buying<br />back his forefathers.
5383080 5384680 You said ancestors.
5384920 5386640 What's the difference?
5386920 5389760 The number four.<br />Four Fathers.
5390080 5392400 They were the top guys<br />of the Hong Kong Triad.
5392600 5394200 They disappeared from prison.
5394400 5396480 Reds jailed them when they<br />took over Hong Kong.
5396640 5397440 I bet they're here.
5397640 5398760 Damn, we're good.
5399040 5401920 Grab Ping. I don't want him<br />to see the bodies.
5404920 5407040 10 to 1, I know where the money is...
5407280 5410040 20 to 1 I know where the Four Fathers are.<br />Let me make a call.
5410440 5411440 Don't leave without us.
5412160 5414440 Good work!<br />You must be a detective.
5414680 5416280 I have my moments.
5422360 5423440 Uncle Benny.
5424040 5426480 I was actually starting<br />to like the old goat.
5426720 5428200 Bloody marvelous.
5428520 5430520 And it's fried rice, "you plick."
5438600 5441280 - Which one is Hong?<br />- In front of you.
5441840 5444520 I want a complete set<br />of forensics on all three.
5448400 5450360 Dads and their kids.
5453080 5454880 I'll take care of yours, buddy.
5455560 5456560 We got to go!
5456920 5459080 - Take care of yourself.<br />- Where're we going?
5459320 5460840 - L.A. Harbor.<br />- What's there?
5461080 5462800 It's a foreign trade zone.
5463000 5465480 Shady deals with the Chinese military.
5466120 5468320 <i>It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.</i>
5468640 5473240 <i>I got it, a corrupt Chinese general</i><br /><i>brought the Four Fathers here...</i>
5473520 5475320 <i>... and the Triad's</i><br /><i>buying their release.</i>
5475600 5478080 <i>That's what Uncle Benny meant</i><br /><i>by buying them back.</i>
5478360 5481480 <i>That general will shit</i><br /><i>when he sees the money's counterfeit.</i>
5481760 5483240 <i>Let's tell him.</i>
5524160 5525480 Hi, gang.
5525760 5526920 LAPD.
5530920 5532520 I saw Hong.
5532840 5535440 This is what Benny meant<br />by buying the Four Fathers.
5535680 5539440 Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.<br />How are you, boys?
5539840 5540960 Who's the naughty general?
5541240 5543200 Who's been lining his pockets?
5543520 5546080 Naughty!<br />Speaky English?
5547880 5548880 What do you want?
5550400 5551280 See this?
5551600 5554560 I hope you need lots of<br />toilet paper back home.
5554800 5556400 That's all it's good for.
5556720 5559560 Take the Four Pops back to China.<br />We don't give a shit.
5559880 5560720 The Four Pops!
5561840 5564040 Don't want them no more.<br />It's counterfeit.
5564320 5566680 Triads never prosper<br />cheating a general.
5568640 5570000 See for yourself.
5581320 5584160 Money losing face.<br />General losing face.
5584440 5586920 Hard when Triad try to sit on it.
5589920 5591920 I fucked you. I fucked you!
5592440 5593360 We fucked you.
5593640 5595720 It's beautiful!
5598200 5599400 Don't we get a hand?
5607920 5610080 Keep your head down!<br />Let them shoot each other!
5610360 5611560 Watch out!
5613760 5614600 Thanks!
5626000 5627000 Was this a good idea?
5627200 5628280 It was an idea!
5635080 5636520 11 in the mag, 1 in the pipe.<br />You?
5636760 5638240 Wheel gun. 6 shots.
5640640 5641440 Four!
5648680 5650640 Why are you lying to me?
5652280 5654040 I.A. Says you're on the take.
5654240 5655400 I'm on the take?!
5655600 5658640 I think it's crazy!<br />But you're spending lots of money!
5659000 5660560 You ever hear of Ebony Clark?
5661680 5664680 Yeah! She writes those<br />cheesy sex novels!
5665600 5666720 Are you boinking her?
5666960 5669880 No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark!
5670160 5671800 Trish is Ebony Clark.
5674520 5675800 You are boinking her!
5677200 5679720 Yeah, I'm boinking her.
5691600 5692800 Too embarrassing to tell anybody.
5693080 5694560 Yeah, I don't blame you.
5694920 5697080 - She makes lots of money.<br />- How many you got?
5697160 5698600 Two.
5699480 5700840 I'll look for more ammo.
5730440 5731840 Who's in white pajamas?
5732440 5735120 Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father<br />with him is his older brother.
5735360 5736640 No kidding?
5745880 5747760 - Hey, Butters.<br />- Shit! Shit!
5748160 5749920 Now you got my name right.
5750160 5752040 I'm out.<br />I got to find some rounds.
5752800 5754280 I'll help you.
5754800 5756760 Never been shot before.
5760680 5762360 Take care of my son-in-law.
5807320 5810000 - You all right?<br />- No, I got my ass kicked again.
5810240 5812000 Shit, I'm out.
5812280 5815520 I hit the bastard. I thought<br />I missed him. Where'd they go?
5827400 5828480 Come on!
5830440 5832520 We got Door Number 1,<br />Number 2, or Number 3.
5835800 5838040 - Looks like Number 2, Monty.<br />- Let's go.
5843000 5845680 What's behind Door Number 2?<br />Bingo.
5853440 5854920 Now you've done it.
5855320 5856720 Now he's really pissed.
5861520 5863920 Son of a bitch will be a handful.
5868320 5872560 Since I met you, I've done some<br />hairy shit. But this won't happen.
5873600 5875360 I'm going to be a grandfather...
5875680 5877760 ...and you and Lorna will have a baby.
5881440 5884240 He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.
5886920 5888480 Yeah, you're right.
5890320 5893000 If he gets away we can<br />track him down later...
5893240 5895040 ...with a howitzer or something.
5895240 5898240 Your son-in-law's bleeding.<br />We should get him and go.
5898880 5901640 - Shit, it's raining.<br />- I'm too old for this shit.
5902640 5904400 Guy's too damn good.
5904720 5907600 How'd he do that thing with the gun?
5908000 5911720 He took my gun apart with one move.<br />How'd he do that?
5914080 5915080 How?
5923360 5925080 Yeah, okay.
5925440 5926440 Let's go ask him.
6109240 6110640 Are you up there?
6111280 6112520 Are you all right?
6147840 6149400 Where are you, Riggs?
6149800 6151800 Will it to me, Riggs!
6153320 6154560 Where are you?
6154760 6155960 Will it to me!
6158320 6159880 Will me, Riggs.
6160160 6162280 You going to have a baby. Will me!
6162520 6164800 You son of a bitch.<br />God! Will me!
6170720 6172760 I hear you, Riggs.
6173320 6175520 I got you! I'm coming!
6224400 6226320 I heard you, Riggs!
6227640 6229760 You willed me to it!
6230080 6232520 What took you so long?<br />What took you so long?
6233200 6235200 What the hell do you mean?
6235280 6238520 I was knocked down over here!<br />I couldn't even get up!
6240840 6241880 Come back here!
6245200 6246840 Let's go home, man.
6247400 6249080 Let's get out of here.
6254880 6258160 I haven't been here enough<br />lately, Vicky. I'm sorry.
6259760 6262600 I need to talk to you about Lorna.<br />Me and Lorna.
6265520 6268400 It's like this.<br />She wants to get married...
6269960 6273200 ...and I love her.<br />I won't lie to you. I do.
6273720 6276120 And I want to make her happy.
6278280 6280400 I'm looking for help here, honey.
6282280 6283680 I don't know what to do.
6285240 6287320 Funny talking to you about<br />this stuff...
6292040 6294200 You want to get yourself shot?
6296760 6298720 What the hell are you doing here?
6299280 6300400 I was tailing you.
6301760 6302760 Sorry.
6305880 6308760 I'll leave you alone.<br />I guess you want to be alone.
6309360 6310800 I'd appreciate it.
6315320 6317680 When I was a kid I had a pet frog.
6318080 6318880 What?
6320000 6322520 Give me a second.<br />Let me tell you this.
6322880 6325520 I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.
6325920 6327760 He was my best friend in the world.
6328600 6331160 I didn't have lots of friends.<br />In fact...
6331680 6333600 ...I had no friends.
6336360 6338560 I used to kiss the frog too.
6338800 6340640 I thought maybe...
6341200 6344360 ...it would turn into a princess<br />since I was a boy.
6344720 6346160 And it could be...
6346480 6347600 ...my mother.
6348560 6351480 They told me that<br />she left or something.
6352440 6354800 And my father was no bargain.
6355040 6356560 And so, just the frog...
6356960 6358600 ...Froggy, was my friend.
6358880 6361960 I loved him and took him<br />everywhere with me.
6362200 6364080 I was riding my bike one day...
6364360 6366440 ...he jumped out of the box...
6366720 6368560 ...and I ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6369320 6370800 I killed him.
6371280 6373800 I was really heartbroken. Really.
6374760 6377320 He was my best friend,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6378760 6380440 And then I met you...
6380840 6382040 ...and Roger.
6382400 6385840 You looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6386440 6388200 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6388560 6389800 No, it's okay.
6390280 6391360 It's okay.
6391760 6393280 You're my family...
6393800 6395400 ...and my friends.
6397480 6400560 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />just different.
6407080 6409800 I just thought that<br />might be relevant.
6414240 6416200 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6419520 6421240 I got a funny f...
6421880 6422640 What's wrong?!
6423000 6424560 I'm having a baby.
6424920 6426080 Lorna beeped me.
6426600 6428640 Yes, it's Lorna.<br />She's having the baby.
6429000 6430880 - I'll get the car.<br />- I'll be behind you.
6438640 6440920 You picked a strange angel, honey.
6443000 6444640 But I got the message.
6445880 6447400 I got the message.
6453400 6455240 I'll always have this.
6455800 6457160 Always have you.
6457800 6459400 In here and here.
6460920 6461760 Thanks, honey.
6462120 6464000 I got to go. Bye.
6464640 6466280 I am not ready to have this baby!
6466640 6468920 You're as ready as you're going to be.
6469280 6470720 Fine! Just wheel me in.
6471160 6473200 My legs are staying closed!
6474120 6475040 Give me this!
6475400 6476760 Ma'am, let go!
6477160 6480000 I am a police officer!<br />And I am not ready!
6486360 6487560 Are you all right?
6487920 6489280 - Are you the husband?<br />- Yes.
6489560 6490680 Honey, are you all right?
6490880 6491800 No, I'm not.
6492120 6493880 I said I didn't want<br />to get married, but I do.
6494200 6496800 I want to be a wife<br />before I'm a mother.
6497120 6498280 I know you don't want to.
6500280 6501840 - You said "okay"?<br />- Yes, I did. Okay.
6502240 6503640 Let's do it.
6504720 6506000 He said okay.
6506520 6508680 - Congratulations.<br />- He said okay, Leo.
6509120 6510480 Oh, my God!
6510840 6512360 What's that smell?
6512720 6515640 I was on my way to the toilet<br />and she grabbed me.
6515840 6518520 - I'm so sorry.<br />- Have a nice baby!
6520280 6521600 I'm so sorry.
6524440 6526200 Will you marry me?
6529520 6530520 You bet I will.
6533680 6534560 Let's go.
6534920 6537240 I'm not going! Wait!
6538840 6540000 - Get a minister.<br />- Now?
6540200 6543040 Now. We're getting married.<br />Here comes another one.
6543280 6544280 We need a license...
6544520 6546520 I want to hear it<br />before the baby comes!
6546720 6547640 It's coming now.
6548000 6550520 Listen, I am getting married<br />or there is no baby.
6550800 6553200 This could be an aspect<br />of a transition phase.
6553440 6556240 This is no goddamn aspect<br />of a transition phase!
6556600 6558240 Honey, everybody, calm down.
6558600 6560080 Calm down. Okay?
6560440 6562720 Get a priest, minister, anything.
6563040 6565360 Go get a priest!<br />Goddamn it, Leo!
6565720 6567320 I got it. Okay.
6567640 6569520 Pant, pant, blow.<br />Remember Lamaze class?
6569800 6571440 Pant, blow. Come on!
6573520 6575000 But I want to say "I do."
6575320 6577000 Here he is!
6577320 6578560 This is Rabbi Gelb.
6578840 6579760 A rabbi?
6580000 6581360 You said anything.
6581720 6582880 He'll do.
6583120 6584600 For what I'll do?
6584840 6587080 We'd like you to marry us.<br />Please.
6587360 6588800 - You're Jewish?<br />- Not necessarily.
6589120 6590320 - You got a license?<br />- No.
6590600 6592280 Please don't go!
6592920 6595480 She needs to hear the words<br />before the baby comes.
6595760 6599200 Are you both serious?<br />I don't have time for hijinks.
6599480 6600720 We're very serious.
6601040 6602880 I could do it.<br />It wouldn't be official.
6603160 6604640 I just want to hear the words.
6605040 6606920 What the hell! Your names?
6607280 6608640 I'm Martin and this is Lorna.
6609080 6610480 Martin and Lorna.
6611280 6613960 What am I doing?<br />How do the <i>goyim</i> do this?
6615280 6617080 Dearly beloved!
6617360 6621840 Dearly beloved,<br />marriage is a spiritual union...
6623000 6625840 Faster!<br />She's heading for the home stretch.
6626200 6628320 Martin, will you take<br />Lorna to be your wife?
6628600 6631880 Will you honor, love, etc...
6632120 6634080 ...till death do you part?<br />- I will.
6634280 6636880 Lorna, will you take Martin<br />to be your husband?
6637240 6639720 - I do.<br />- The same thing.
6639920 6641080 I pronounce you man and wife.
6641360 6643440 You may kiss the bride.<br />You already did.
6643720 6645520 - Let's go.<br />- No, wait!
6645800 6647080 Hold it!
6647440 6648520 What is it?
6648920 6651080 Let me have this glass!
6651400 6654040 No, goddamn it!<br />What are you doing?!
6654560 6657400 Talk to the hand!<br />I'll be right back.
6657680 6660680 You know how long it took me<br />to fill that thing? All day!
6660920 6663680 This is unsanitary.<br />What is this?
6664080 6665720 - Break the glass.<br />- I'll get piss on my shoes!
6666440 6667720 You got to do this!
6668480 6669920 <i>Mazel tov</i>!
6672120 6674080 Come back here,<br />you little son of a bitch!
6674400 6675560 Pant, pant, blow.
6675840 6677120 Leo, please.
6678720 6681800 Your work is over here.<br />I think someone else needs you.
6686920 6688800 Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.
6692360 6693560 Thanks a lot.
6698200 6699760 Stick around.<br />Meet the kid.
6700000 6702080 Good luck, Lorna!
6707760 6709760 Here it comes.
6711800 6713000 Here he is.
6713560 6716600 He's looking right at you.<br />He knows it's you.
6721240 6722880 Rog, look what I found.
6723480 6725840 - Look at that.<br />- What a beauty!
6726520 6728240 Look at those eyes!
6728840 6731200 - He looks like his mother.<br />- Yes, he does.
6731520 6732480 Murtaugh!
6735240 6736560 No, Butters!
6737000 6738840 Butters' baby.<br />Better not be Murtaugh.
6739160 6740600 It's Butters.
6742080 6743600 Look at that baby.
6744320 6745800 Look at the hair.
6746760 6748400 That's my baby!
6749000 6751520 Look at her. You're so cute.<br />Look at you!
6751760 6754320 27 people, nobody thought<br />of bringing a camera?
6754560 6756080 Leo, your plastic's flaccid.
6756440 6759680 These machines wreck your plastic,<br />then give you the camera.
6760040 6762200 The camera doesn't work.<br />They're trying to...
6766560 6767920 What are you doing here?
6768680 6770120 Look at these two babies.
6770360 6772400 A little something from the squad.
6775000 6777320 - Give back the captain badges.<br />- Why?
6777560 6780720 Congratulations, you're sergeants again.<br />The city's self-insured.
6781000 6782920 I thought they'd make us president.
6784040 6786240 By the way, Grandpa,<br />you owe the chief one.
6786560 6787840 He went to the INS...
6788040 6790480 ...and they're giving asylum<br />to the Hongs.
6790920 6791920 All right!
6793640 6795200 We're going to take a picture.
6799360 6801480 Squeeze together.<br />Candy stripers out.
6801800 6803080 Out! Okay. Out!
6803800 6805920 I can't.<br />There's not enough room.
6807800 6809480 You got to back up.
6810240 6811280 I'm taking big steps!
6811600 6813000 Get this guy to take it.
6813280 6815800 Doc, can you take a picture<br />of all of us?
6818880 6821000 It's my best man, after all.
6821360 6822840 Get my grandbaby in it too.
6823120 6824160 Are you all friends?
6824480 6827320 No. We're family!
6827600 6828400 Okay, on 3.
6828680 6830600 One, two, three!
