31823 33742 Riggs, you sure we're on<br />the right street?
33909 35160 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah?
35327 36995 We must be getting warm.
37162 40082 - You see anything?<br />- Where? I don't see anything.
40249 41583 This must be the place.
41750 43043 Holy shit!
44503 46004 What the hell is that?
50092 51635 Jesus.
51802 52844 Who's this joker?
53053 54930 I don't know.<br />A spokesman for the NRA.
56014 58475 Regular asshole.<br />What do we do now?
59768 61144 Run him over.
61311 63313 What if he shoots us with that rifle?
63480 66358 - He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't.<br />- What if he does?
66733 69611 Don't be a Don't-Bee.<br />Be a Do-Bee. Be positive.
69778 71697 Positive?
71905 74366 - Let's run him over.<br />- Glad you see things my way.
74533 76201 I hope he doesn't turn around.
76368 79162 He won't. We'll creep up on him<br />slow so he won't notice.
79329 80497 Yeah. Okay.
80664 83959 Will him not to turn.<br />Power of positive thinking.
84126 86003 Don't turn.<br />Come on, will him with me.
86169 88046 - Will him?<br />- Don't turn around.
88213 91466 -I need you, man. Don't turn around.<br />Don't turn around.
91633 93635 - Just believe.<br />- Don't turn around!
93802 95887 We're better than him.
96054 97097 We're better!
99016 100058 He's turning.
103353 106106 I was wrong, I was wrong.<br />Get down, get down.
113196 115032 They just bounce right off him!
115198 116575 I saw. We're in trouble, man!
117492 120996 Shit. I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
121163 123749 No, I'll draw his fire.<br />You run for cover.
123915 127586 Are you out of your mind?<br />You got a wife, kids. I got less to lose!
132007 134676 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Get going, Rog. Get out of here!
136887 139848 Riggs, I wasn't supposed to tell you this,<br />but Lorna's pregnant.
140015 142351 - You're gonna be a father.<br />- Get going. Get...
143477 144936 What'd you say?
145103 147522 You're gonna be a father!<br />Riggs...
152069 155614 She was afraid to tell you.<br />She was afraid you'd get angry.
155781 157407 You never talked about children?
157574 160327 - Shit.<br />- A baby.
168293 170587 There's something I'm not<br />supposed to tell you too.
170754 171797 What?
171963 174758 Rianne's pregnant.<br />You're gonna be a grandfather.
174925 176051 Rianne's what?
181765 185060 But Rianne can't be pregnant.
185227 186353 She's not married.
186520 189064 Well, I don't think she intended<br />to get that way.
201201 203495 They asking me to be a granddaddy?
203954 206289 Mm-hm. Yeah.
217676 219803 A fire
220512 222514 In the hole
224141 225684 Son of a...
232399 234568 Here's what we'll do.<br />Take your clothes off.
234735 236361 - What the hell for?<br />- What for?
236528 238071 - Yeah.<br />- Okay, you run.
238238 240407 Flame-O here turns,<br />sees you in your undies.
240574 242659 It distracts him,<br />and that's when I shoot.
242826 245120 - Shoot what?<br />- The valve on that napalm tank!
245287 246872 Before he shoots me?
247038 248707 - Maybe.<br />- Maybe?
259050 260093 Is he black?
260260 262637 Too much armor on.<br />I can't tell!
262804 266224 No! Not him!<br />The father of the baby!
266391 268935 - Okay.<br />- Please let him be black!
269102 272981 Fire in the hole
275567 277027 Get going! Here he comes!
278236 279362 Are those little hearts?
279529 281615 Not now, Riggs.<br />Just hit the damn valve!
281782 284576 Okay. Also, flap your arms<br />and make noises like a bird.
284743 286578 Flap my arms? Why?
286745 287913 It'll distract him more.
288079 290081 - I need him to turn.<br />- All right, all right.
290248 292751 - On two!<br />- We always go on three.
292918 294503 No time for three. Go. Two!
294669 296922 What about one?<br />- Okay. One, two, get going!
297172 299049 I don't want to die in my underwear!
301009 303136 Why are you waiting for?<br />Shoot the bastard!
303303 304888 Shoot him, shoot him!
332624 334292 Incoming!
337963 339005 Whew.
339214 343009 Riggs, you think that bird thing helped?<br />You think it helped?
343176 346137 No, no,<br />I just wanted to see if you'd do it.
348807 350225 Cute shorts.
353144 354437 Go spit, Riggs!
356022 357607 Come on, I'll buy you a doughnut.
357774 360068 Don't put your arms around me<br />when I'm naked.
360235 362320 Well, surely you're ashamed of your butt.
371288 372747 He's a lively one.
375959 378753 That shark damages<br />my new boat, I'll take it out on you, Leo.
378920 381798 I didn't mean to catch it.<br />What do you want to keep it for?
381965 383717 Yeah, why keep a shark anyway?
383884 385760 The teeth'll look great on a wall.
385927 389222 -They gotta stop snapping first.<br />Maybe he'll fall asleep.
389389 391391 Go down, converse with him.<br />He'll nod off.
391558 394895 - He don't look tired.<br />- Maybe chewing on Leo will wear him out.
395061 397355 You think sharks eat their own kind?
399357 401109 Oh, stop it. You guys got me in stitches.
403153 404696 Okay, where's my bag?
404863 406656 Starboard side aft.
406823 408408 Starboard, that's left, right?
408575 410368 No, port's left. Starboard's right.
410535 412162 - Yeah, right.<br />- Yeah, right.
412329 415415 Right, yeah. Right side aft.<br />Got it!
415665 417751 - Whatever.<br />- Check both sides. You'll find it.
417918 420128 Careful!<br />He's behind you, shark!
423256 425008 Maybe we should throw him overboard.
425175 428094 Throw them both overboard. Boy.
428261 431473 No witnesses out here tonight.<br />We'd probably get away with it.
434392 435685 You too?
439314 441608 I kept my nose out of it...
443234 445111 but you and Lorna.
446655 450116 You're having a baby,<br />you're living together.
451284 452577 You're not getting married.
454037 457624 Why, does that violate<br />your family values system or something?
457791 460418 No, I'm just trying to understand.
462462 464172 Rianne's not married either.
464339 466633 Okay, okay. That's hitting below the belt.
470804 473431 You know, when I was married...
473598 475684 it was good. You know.
475850 478478 You put the ring on.<br />You make the commitment.
479437 481189 You do all the...
483608 485193 She's dead because I'm a cop.
486319 488822 She's dead because I'm a cop<br />and I...
488989 491408 I don't wear the ring anymore...
492283 494369 but I look down, it's still there.
494536 496204 I still feel it.
496371 501418 And, I don't know, it's like<br />I'm not finished with that yet.
501584 504254 I don't know how to explain it.<br />Is that bullshit?
504421 507340 No. It's not finished.
507507 510051 It's not finished. Yeah.
513388 515682 Okay, you did say "aft"?
515849 517851 A-F-T. Aft!
518018 519811 That's a fucking word?
519978 522605 In the back of the cabin<br />on the right side, Leo!
522772 525942 Why didn't you say that<br />to begin with, Roger?!
526109 530447 People get around boats and water,<br />everything becomes fucking nautical!
530613 532907 "Astern! Avast, you landlubbers!
533533 535285 Man the bilge pump!‚Äù
535535 537328 Pump your fucking ass!
537579 539456 All right, all right, all right.
539622 541458 Okay, okay, okay.
541624 543585 No problem, no problem!
547047 548673 What's Lorna say about this?
548923 550800 She doesn't like nautical terms either.
550967 554054 - Huh?<br />- We haven't discussed it.
554220 555263 That's pretty messed up.
555513 559142 The baby's due in days and you guys<br />haven't talked about getting married?
559309 560935 No.
561102 563146 I haven't done it at all.
565440 567192 Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?
567358 570111 Do we want Leo to shoot...?<br />Hey, hey! No, Leo!
570278 572864 What? Hey, hey.
573031 575784 - What's the big deal?<br />- You're shooting a gun on my boat!
575992 578203 I'm not shooting your boat,<br />I'm shooting Jaws.
578369 582248 Nobody's killing it. I'm not letting a good<br />animal die so you can have its teeth.
582415 585794 Sure getting grumpy since you<br />found out you're gonna be a grandpa.
585960 587462 Get off of me, will you?
587712 589089 Don't fool around!
590465 592801 This is some piece of hardware.<br />You got a permit?
593009 595095 - I'm a P.I. now. Of course I do.<br />- A P what?
595261 598973 A P.I., a gumshoe! You get<br />in ugly situations. I got guns, everything.
599140 600725 You are an ugly situation.
600934 604062 Permit or no permit, you don't<br />deserve this. You're not safe.
605438 607398 Smart move, Riggs.
607565 609234 Shit!
611111 612862 Hard right, Rog.
613655 615490 They're gonna hit us.<br />You hear shots?
615657 617742 Coast Guard, this is Code 7.
626000 628378 We're in L.A. Harbor. Over.
628545 631047 -We gotta go. Come on, Rog.<br />Code 7.
633550 634968 They're getting away!
635218 637178 Who was it? Do we know?
638263 640390 No, no, I'll drive!
643393 645979 - Want me to help?<br />- Get out of here!
646396 647522 This your gun?
647689 649482 Yeah, you want some laser surgery?
649649 651442 Hey, hey! You could blind somebody!
654779 657699 Coast Guard, this is Code 7,<br />in pursuit of freighter.
657866 658992 Heading north.
659159 660910 Awaiting instructions. Over.
661077 664998 Code 7, this is U.S.<br />Coast Guard. Maintain your present course.
665165 668001 -We have a cutter en route.<br />Why you slowing down?
668251 671337 We'll hang here.<br />Coast Guard'll be here soon.
671588 673923 What do we do now?<br />Show them our badges.
674090 676718 LAPD! LAPD!
676885 678636 Los Angeles Police Department!
678803 680847 We heard gunfire!<br />The Coast Guard's on the...
708499 711169 Coast Guard! Freighter's on fire!
711336 713963 - Let's board them.<br />- What are you talking about?
714172 716216 Fire on the freighter!
721262 724265 Okay, I'm upside.<br />Now what do you do?
724432 726351 They're getting away.<br />Get me up there!
732357 733900 Hell of a fishing trip!
734067 736486 Shut up and keep your head down!
736653 738404 LAPD! LAPD!
738571 741532 Stop where you are!<br />Hold it right there!
744244 746496 He's got it! He's got it!
750500 752418 What'd he say?<br />He said watch his back.
755088 757382 Why didn't you tell me you<br />were gonna shoot?
758591 760218 Tie it up!
760551 761761 What?
761928 763137 Pull it up!
770436 772230 That was great, wasn't it?
772397 774440 I told you to keep the boat closer!
775984 777610 What are you listening to Leo for?
786828 788037 Oh, shit.
797964 799549 You all right, Riggs?
802343 804220 Wow. Look at that.
805930 807181 Oh, shit.
807390 809058 Jump! Jump!
815189 816733 Where are you?
817400 819902 My boat! My new boat!
836794 837837 - Hey, Rog.<br />- What?
838004 840381 - The shark.<br />- What about the shark?
840715 841966 Oh, shark!
844719 846471 Don't leave me!
860151 861194 Come on, Leo!
872246 873998 Hurry up!<br />I'm coming!
893851 895478 You can make it, Leo.
903027 904695 This is all I got left.
904862 906989 And since I met Riggs,<br />I've had my house destroyed...
908699 911035 my car wrecked<br />and now my boat sunk.
911202 912995 What's left?
913162 914622 I think that's about it.
932515 935226 Four sets of papers, totally genuine.
935393 938396 They'll get in the country<br />and they'll be able to stay forever.
938729 940440 U.S. citizens.
941732 944527 Ask them to vote the incumbent party<br />next election.
944694 946612 Help me keep my State Department job.
946904 948322 Bloody marvelous!
948489 953035 They've red-flagged the Asian visas lately.<br />Those weren't so easy to slip through.
967133 968509 Something wrong?
970761 973598 A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody.
978561 980563 Goodbye.
980771 982523 Leave!
1056305 1058891 Coast Guard interdicts<br />about one of these a month.
1059058 1060768 Pretty raggedy-looking.
1060935 1063437 Six weeks locked in a hole<br />with one toilet.
1063604 1067024 Rice and a little fish to eat.<br />Lousy deal for 35 grand a head.
1067191 1069735 Thirty-five grand.<br />Where'd they get that kind of money?
1069902 1074657 Didn't. Got to work it off from<br />the snake heads, the smugglers.
1074824 1076909 - They sell them as cheap labor.<br />- Sell them?
1077118 1078828 Like slaves.
1080746 1082665 I guess these must be the lucky ones.
1082832 1086919 They'll claim asylum. Say<br />they were persecuted, like everybody else.
1087086 1090881 We'll send them packing.<br />Cost you and me a goddamn fortune.
1091048 1093509 What happened to,<br />"Bring me your tired, your poor...
1093676 1096178 your wretched masses,<br />yearning to be free"?
1096762 1098598 Now it reads, "No vacancies."
1099348 1102435 I guess your parents<br />were Native Americans.
1107023 1109317 They pop one every boatload.
1109483 1112486 Shows the rest what'll happen<br />if they run off or don't pay.
1114739 1116449 At least he's nobody's slave now.
1118200 1120036 Come on.<br />Don't coddle them, move them!
1120202 1122622 We're on the boat and<br />I see this barrel coming down.
1122788 1125374 Murtaugh didn't see it,<br />so I push him out of the way.
1125541 1128336 Big guy. I knock him over.<br />We're in the water.
1128502 1131255 I pull him because he doesn't swim good.<br />I gotta save him.
1131839 1135217 There's that kid.<br />What's his name? Bissel?
1135384 1138012 - It's a food.<br />- Burger!
1138179 1139722 No, Biscuits or something.
1139889 1142683 He's always kissing my ass,<br />giving me coffee and shit.
1142933 1146187 Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />What are you doing here?
1146354 1149482 -Hell, that's a long story.<br />Hey, man, you're all wet.
1149649 1151275 -You need a blanket?<br />No, I'm fine.
1151442 1154236 -Somebody get this man a blanket now!<br />Yes, sir!
1154403 1155696 Al right.
1155863 1159200 Get this body out of here.<br />Hold up. What do we got here?
1159367 1161202 Step back, step back.
1162870 1164497 Shit.
1164664 1166957 He's dead, man.<br />He's fucking dead, man!
1167124 1168417 - Shit!<br />- What?
1168584 1171337 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1171504 1173297 Was he in the killing section?
1173464 1176467 - This guy's been shot four times!<br />- Well, yeah.
1176634 1179178 At close range, like he was executed!
1179387 1181639 - He was executed.<br />- Yeah, by the crew.
1182598 1187728 What the fuck, man? People get killed<br />left, right and center in this town!
1187895 1189730 Now we're importing victims?
1189897 1192942 Gangbangers wanna kill each other,<br />no problem.
1193109 1196112 You and me, one of us gets shot,<br />hey, occupational hazard.
1196278 1200616 But just a normal guy, this fucking guy?<br />What the fuck did he ever do to anybody?
1200783 1202576 - That ain't right.<br />- Easy, Biscuits.
1202743 1205079 You'll get an ulcer like this, kid.<br />Settle down.
1205246 1207123 Blanket!
1207832 1209875 - Sorry, Blankets.<br />- Here's your blanket.
1210042 1211836 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1212002 1214630 I just hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1214797 1219552 We'd like to stick around and shoot the<br />breeze, Butler, but you're in charge so...
1219719 1222680 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1222847 1226851 -Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />All right, Boogers.
1227017 1229812 Sir, over here!<br />- Hey, get them out of here!
1230646 1232189 Get them out of here!
1233065 1235735 Yeah, yeah.<br />He takes the job kind of personally.
1235943 1239613 Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious,<br />I'd say. Overzealous.
1239780 1241198 - Emotionally...<br />- Jealous of who?
1241407 1244326 - I don't know. Who?<br />- You just said he was jealous.
1244493 1245870 - I didn't...<br />- You just said...
1246036 1248914 No, I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1249081 1250416 - He's loud too.<br />- What?
1250583 1252126 - He's loud!<br />- What?
1252585 1254462 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1254670 1256297 I got something in the lifeboat.
1256464 1260092 That's okay, see you tomorrow.<br />I'll catch a squad ride. Hey, Rog.
1262136 1263971 I'm sorry about your boat.
1265014 1266515 Riggs.
1267183 1269560 - I'm sorry.<br />- Shit.
1269727 1273522 All of a sudden, this big<br />fucking shark comes... Can I say that?
1273814 1276066 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1276233 1279069 So this big darn shark comes along...
1290289 1292917 Shit. My Code 7.
1335918 1339296 -Hey! Hey.<br />Hey.
1339463 1342508 - You were coming home last night.<br />- I know, I'm sorry.
1342675 1344009 I had some bad Chinese.
1345636 1347471 You look a little banged up.
1347805 1349265 You look a little knocked up.
1352309 1353769 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah.
1353936 1355437 - You sure?<br />- Yeah.
1355604 1357773 Whoa. Easy, tiger!<br />There he goes again.
1357940 1360025 She. There she goes again.
1361527 1362570 You okay?
1362736 1364989 I'm good. I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1365155 1368742 No. Boat sank?<br />- I had something to do with it.
1368993 1370369 No! No grease!
1371245 1373122 Have some cookies.<br />- What happened?
1373289 1374915 What happened?
1375082 1377585 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1377751 1378961 Here, boy.
1379628 1381881 Oh. Thanks.
1382047 1386135 You were out fishing. I mean,<br />does trouble just go looking for you?
1386385 1390472 Well, it seems to know pretty much<br />where I am most of the time.
1391265 1393267 You finished the nursery.
1393434 1394935 Yeah, I did.
1395102 1397688 I figured it was good for a girl or a boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1397897 1400441 It's a dogfest.<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1400691 1403611 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1403777 1405696 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1409491 1414038 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1425883 1428135 Well, I sort of figured<br />you didn't want that.
1431889 1433641 You want to get married?
1436518 1437853 Well, no.
1440397 1441649 Me neither.
1443025 1444193 You want some breakfast?
1445694 1447321 Yeah. Yeah.
1460584 1463045 Serve and Protect.
1463379 1466173 Since when do you read this smut?
1467675 1469969 - It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />- Ebony Clark.
1470135 1471220 Trish gave it to me.
1471428 1474598 "Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1474765 1476725 He devoured her with his eyes."
1477142 1481188 Hey. Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1482731 1483816 Whew.
1483983 1486568 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1486819 1490072 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1491073 1494952 Have I ever<br />"made your womanhood reach peaks...
1495119 1497413 that would rival<br />the highest Himalayas"?
1497579 1501375 - Foothills of Malibu, maybe.<br />- Not even a Teton?
1501542 1503460 - I don't think so.<br />- Thanks.
1503627 1505796 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1505963 1507673 Well, you know I'm kidding.
1508799 1510968 You're just saying that<br />to make me feel better.
1511135 1512928 No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
1513095 1514388 You know I'm playing.
1514555 1517266 I've been to plenty of<br />mountaintops with you, Riggs.
1517433 1519476 It's just that I'm hungry.
1521437 1524064 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.
1524231 1526650 - I brought you a doughnut.<br />- A doughnut. Police food.
1526817 1527860 How did you know?
1530279 1532489 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1532656 1534074 Really? How's the rat squad?
1534241 1536452 - I picked something up, good one.<br />- Some cheese?
1536618 1539997 Oh, yeah. I.A. got an anonymous tip.
1540247 1542499 The person said Roger's on the take.
1543125 1544960 No, he's not.
1545127 1548797 I know he's not. It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1548964 1551800 But with the new boats<br />and putting two kids through college...
1551967 1553969 thought you ought to know.
1554178 1556472 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1556638 1560809 Oh! Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1560976 1563145 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1563312 1565481 - That's awful.<br />- I'm kidding.
1565647 1568233 Don't tell him I said it.<br />He's got enough problems...
1568400 1571779 he'll blow his top, it'll be awful.<br />Just don't say anything.
1573614 1575032 What do you mean?
1577659 1578994 Like what?
1579161 1582039 - In general, problems.<br />- You mean something specific.
1582206 1585000 I got a nose for these things.<br />Come on, tell me. What?
1585167 1589254 No, you know, you're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1589421 1591799 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better. Tell me.
1591965 1593842 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1594009 1595886 Son of a bitch.<br />- Tell me.
1596053 1600599 I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed my<br />brain cells! I can't believe I said that!
1600766 1602601 What? What?
1602768 1605270 - I'm drooling. What?<br />- Oh, Riggs.
1605437 1610234 Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll<br />never say a word about this ever.
1610484 1612277 - I swear, I swear.<br />- Right hand!
1612444 1613946 I swear I won't, ever.
1614113 1616365 I promise. What?
1616824 1619576 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1619743 1621495 He'd kill them. So?
1621662 1625707 Rianne married one, he's her baby's father.<br />She's too afraid to tell Roger.
1626041 1629378 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1629545 1631505 And nobody's telling Roger about this?
1631672 1633298 After the baby's born, Riggs.
1633465 1637261 You mean it's a package deal? Here<br />it is, take it or leave it? Ha, ha, ha.
1637427 1639513 - Does Trish know about this?<br />- Yeah, she knows.
1639680 1641932 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1642182 1644560 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1644726 1645853 Riggs.
1646019 1647563 - Who?<br />- Sergeant Lee Butters.
1647729 1651441 Oh. Oh. This just gets better and better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1651608 1653610 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee...
1653777 1656780 Okay, okay. Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing.
1656947 1661076 You kidding? I won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1661243 1665581 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I promise. I won't.
1667958 1669251 Promise.
1671628 1676133 We don't have to discuss boys'<br />names, period, because we're having a girl.
1676300 1678051 Okay. Piadora.
1678218 1681889 - I like Piadora. That's sweet.<br />- Yeah?
1683265 1685559 - Can't live with that.<br />- I love that name.
1688061 1691607 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1691773 1694568 Need all the help we can get.<br />We don't want to double up.
1694735 1697070 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1697237 1700073 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! I like it better.
1700240 1702534 -Don't get me started.<br />I like those names.
1702701 1704328 Captain wants to see us downtown.
1704494 1707372 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1707539 1709082 Bye-bye, honey.<br />- Yeah.
1709249 1711251 Who had the sleepover?
1711418 1712753 Just airing out camping gear.
1712920 1714880 - We're out of here.<br />- Wow. Something smells good.
1714963 1716215 Really good!
1716381 1719301 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1719468 1721178 That smells like Chinese food.
1721345 1723263 Chinese food?
1723430 1725390 She's into Chinese cooking.
1725557 1727768 I gotta see this. Can I taste?
1728560 1730896 -I love Chinese food.<br />Hold it! Please, Lorna.
1731063 1732231 Please.
1733190 1735108 There's a Chinese person in the kitchen.
1735275 1736401 I saw him.
1737444 1739529 A couple of Chinese people.
1739696 1741448 Actually a whole family.
1743825 1744868 Large family.
1748747 1750958 - Oh. Hey, guys! What's up?<br />- Hey.
1752292 1754419 -Hello.<br />Yeah.
1754586 1756797 - It does smell good.<br />- Great.
1756964 1759091 - They were hiding in the lifeboat.<br />- They were?
1759258 1761635 With what the INS guy said,<br />I had to do something.
1761802 1764972 - So you brought them home.<br />- It took two trips.
1765264 1767766 - Really?<br />- They fit in the station wagon?
1768058 1770143 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1770310 1772729 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks pretty good English.
1772896 1776441 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1776984 1778026 Wife?
1778610 1779903 No.
1781071 1782447 Rog, can I speak to you?
1782614 1785033 Lorna, this is the best breakfast.
1785284 1786994 I'm hungry. I'd love some.
1788036 1791873 Are you out of your mind? This is illegal.<br />As in, "against the law."
1792040 1793834 You'll bring a shit storm<br />down on you.
1794001 1796878 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1797671 1801133 The way I see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1801300 1804886 And I'm freeing slaves,<br />I'm freeing slaves...
1805053 1808056 like no one did<br />for my ancestors. Okay?
1809266 1813020 Riggs, it's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1816023 1818734 Why didn't you say so?<br />This is not gonna be boring.
1818900 1820527 Need any help?
1820694 1821820 Okay.
1822279 1823613 Where is he?
1824948 1826825 Hey, Daddy.
1826992 1828910 What is it this time,<br />food or money?
1829077 1830329 - Food and money.<br />- Money.
1830495 1832414 I see you more<br />than when you lived here.
1832581 1833999 We're independent now.
1834166 1835876 Okay, okay. What's the money for?
1836043 1838253 - Hookers, drugs...<br />- Contraceptives.
1838420 1840464 Can you believe they talk to<br />their father like this?
1840630 1844509 -Better than their parole officer.<br />It costs more to go to school now.
1845177 1846928 Me first, me first.
1847095 1849306 I get the tuition bills.<br />And the grades too.
1849473 1852517 Consider this a down payment<br />on a future ass-chewing.
1852684 1855395 Get out of here and go to school.<br />I wanna see some grades.
1855562 1857147 I see the tuition.
1857314 1861068 I want to see some grades!<br />I want more cluck for my buck.
1861234 1862652 Thanks for the money.
1864821 1866573 - Oh, boy.<br />- I'm tired.
1866740 1868533 Me, I can't win.
1868700 1869868 Boy!
1871244 1873997 Did we get a raise<br />and nobody told me about it?
1876625 1878418 Heh, heh. I got to get to the bank.
1878752 1881630 How can you when you're taken<br />to the cleaners all the time?
1881797 1883215 Yeah.
1884174 1885592 Hey, guys.
1885759 1888053 - Hey, Trish.<br />- Hey, babe.
1888220 1891014 - Those the kids leaving?<br />- Yes. And we're broke.
1891264 1892307 Is Lorna here?
1892474 1895310 Yeah. She's in the kitchen,<br />probably on her third breakfast.
1895560 1897437 I remember those days.
1898063 1901233 - Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.<br />- I love it when you do that.
1902901 1904736 - You look terrific.<br />- Thank you.
1904903 1907572 Wait till she starts trying to raise<br />that baby by herself.
1907739 1909282 Daddy, I'll be fine.
1909449 1912702 Move back in and Grandpa Rog<br />will be up all night with the baby.
1912994 1915080 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1917416 1919584 Well, you know, a cop or something.
1919751 1920836 True.
1921002 1922712 Come on, guys. See you.
1922879 1925173 - I should say goodbye.<br />Hey, Lorna.
1925340 1926842 Hurry up.
1927008 1928802 Oh, yeah. Stuffing your face.
1928969 1931304 Stop kissing me. Try that.
1931471 1933598 You stay away from my girl.
1933765 1936226 I'm not joking.<br />Stay away from my girl.
1936393 1939020 - Joking.<br />- Bye! Got the baby beeper?
1939187 1940230 Yeah.
1945569 1947654 - I know.<br />- It's your fault.
1947904 1950365 It's your fault.<br />All the chicken shit.
1950699 1952617 Flapping all over the place.
1954870 1955996 All right, everybody!
1956163 1960250 It's been a year almost already, okay?<br />This shit ain't funny no more!
1961209 1964713 - All right? Enough is enough!<br />- Please! Enough.
1965005 1968925 I'm the one that gets it in the neck. Can<br />we exercise a little maturity around here?
1969092 1971595 If I find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1972554 1974139 What asshole is doing this?
1974306 1977225 Riggs, I catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1977392 1978393 That's it.
1978560 1980228 Cut their balls off.<br />- Captain.
1980395 1982272 Hey, captain.
1982439 1985275 I look out expecting<br />to see all the old faces.
1985525 1988987 Instead, I see a bunch of kids<br />whose names I barely remember.
1989154 1993158 Will you sit down?<br />We're dinosaurs headed for extinction.
1993325 1994659 Speak for yourself.
1994826 1996703 We're making way for the new police:
1996912 2001583 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
2006254 2009382 - Biter has a psychology degree?<br />- More like a psycho degree.
2009549 2012135 Hell, I got nothing against it.<br />Times have got to change.
2012427 2015180 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
2015347 2017057 That's how far back I go.
2018517 2020227 You wanted to see us<br />about something?
2020393 2022145 Some things don't change.
2022312 2025273 -Here we go.<br />The department lost its insurance.
2025440 2028443 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one...
2028610 2030987 while you two guys<br />are still running around.
2032447 2034741 They can't fire you either.
2034908 2037702 So they're promoting you.
2038787 2039913 - Heh.<br />- Eh.
2040080 2043124 -Lieutenant.<br />There's no open lieutenant spots.
2043291 2047128 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />he's making you captains.
2048547 2050298 - Better.<br />- Captain.
2050549 2054511 Time was when this would send me<br />over the falls. I'm getting old.
2055845 2057430 So, what the hell we do now?
2057597 2058848 I don't know, captain shit.
2059015 2061476 -Hang out.<br />Take long lunches.
2061643 2064980 Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain.‚Äù
2065146 2068400 "Chief's shitting bricks, man."<br />- You finished? You finished?
2068567 2071319 Think you can stay off the streets<br />and out of trouble?
2071486 2072988 Absolutely.
2073154 2075156 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2079411 2082330 All right, hey.<br />- Hey, this is...
2082497 2083748 Hey.
2084249 2087586 You want your badges? Let me see<br />those sergeant badges. Give me those.
2087752 2090046 -Throw them over here.<br />Never liked it.
2090213 2091881 - Here.<br />- Give me those.
2092048 2095051 This is one of the most painful<br />fucking experiences of my life.
2095218 2097178 - Now get out of here.<br />- Thank you, captain.
2097345 2099180 - Thank you, captain.<br />- Thank you, captain.
2099347 2101027 - Captain, after you.<br />- After you, captain.
2101141 2103351 Enough with the "captain‚Äù shit.<br />Get out of here.
2103518 2107480 After you, captain, I insist!<br />"O Captain! My Captain!"
2107772 2110150 - Captains outrageous!<br />- News travels fast.
2110442 2113570 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis...
2113862 2115071 They got brown rings
2115238 2116865 Around their noses
2118199 2120994 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper for a ride.
2121161 2123330 -Not for me.<br />I'll take a rain check.
2123496 2126216 - If you change your mind, call us.<br />- He's down-to-earth kind of guy.
2126291 2127709 Aw.
2128293 2129544 I'm sorry.
2131463 2135383 Can we knock this shit off, please?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2135550 2138845 - Can we knock it off, please? Okay?<br />- Jesus.
2139012 2141640 The man's got feelings, you know?
2148897 2150649 Hey, congratulations. Look at you.
2150815 2152651 Captain Murtaugh.
2152817 2156946 I don't really know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2158823 2160241 Keep it up.
2160408 2161743 How's it going, Burton?
2161910 2164663 - It's Butters, captain.<br />- Yeah. I'll remember that.
2164829 2167624 - Kid really likes you.<br />- I wish he'd cut that shit out.
2167791 2169334 He likes me?
2171503 2174255 - Likes me?<br />- What?
2175882 2181429 No. You don't think he likes me,<br />likes me, likes me...
2181596 2183973 - likes me like that?<br />- Oh.
2186851 2189062 This is not the military,<br />it's the police force.
2189229 2191439 The millennium's creeping up on us.
2191606 2195235 The captain said,<br />"New people, new department.‚Äù
2202992 2205745 -Dr. Woods?<br />Yes.
2205912 2207831 Oh. Captain Riggs.
2207997 2209874 - Don't run.<br />- I'm in a rush.
2210041 2213294 - I need to talk to you.<br />- Do you? Ah. What is it this time?
2213461 2215964 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2216131 2219718 - Or did you cook up something new?<br />- I'm sorry about all that.
2219884 2222220 I wanted your advice.<br />I was thinking of...
2222387 2224472 - Thinking?<br />- Marriage.
2225849 2228143 Marriage? The "M" word?
2228309 2230854 Does "confidentiality"<br />mean anything to you?
2231020 2232480 That's funny.
2232647 2235400 You know what would happen?<br />We'd go in my office...
2235567 2237777 - and you know what you'd tell me?<br />- What?
2237944 2241072 You'd tell me something like, "Doc...
2241239 2243450 I want to marry Murtaugh."
2243616 2246619 Or your mother maybe.<br />Or how about Nelson Mandela?
2246786 2247829 Nelson Mandela?
2247996 2250540 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2250790 2253376 Something to get a rise out of me.
2253877 2255170 Listen carefully.
2255336 2258006 I'm not stupid.
2258506 2260675 And my time is reserved...
2260842 2265054 for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2265221 2266681 Have you got that?
2267682 2269267 - Have you?<br />- Run it by me again?
2269517 2271895 No. And you know what?
2272061 2273354 I don't like you.
2277650 2278902 Stephanie?
2279569 2282614 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship. I'm very happy.
2282781 2285074 I think you need to see someone.
2285241 2287660 You'll find someone someday<br />who'll love you.
2287911 2290997 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2291164 2293082 You're disgusting!
2293249 2295001 What's the matter with you people?
2300423 2301591 What's shaking?
2301758 2303802 - Captain Riggs.<br />- Captain Murtaugh.
2303968 2306805 You're supposed to turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2306971 2308932 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2309098 2311309 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2311476 2314896 They were short, but big enough<br />to kick your ass. What can I do for you?
2315063 2318566 One of the ship's crew shot one of<br />the illegals, apparently under orders...
2318733 2322654 and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese these days.
2322862 2326699 We got no hard evidence, but we're<br />pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan.
2326866 2328076 Uncle Benny?
2328243 2329953 -You know him?<br />Yeah.
2330119 2332997 - Back when he was running smack.<br />- We never nailed him either.
2333164 2334415 Benny's slippery.
2334582 2336501 Where's he hanging out these days?
2336668 2338920 He's got a nightclub,<br />couple restaurants.
2339087 2342340 He operates mainly out on North Broadway.<br />Here's the address.
2344133 2346427 -Hi, fellas.<br />Riggs.
2346719 2348763 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers.
2348930 2350515 Butters.
2350682 2352725 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2352892 2356688 I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2356855 2358189 Checked out the boat.
2358356 2362026 Turns out the boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2362277 2365154 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2365405 2366990 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2367240 2369784 Benny Chan.<br />No. What kind of bad man is he?
2369951 2372036 Real bad.<br />Big crime boss in Chinatown.
2372203 2374831 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2374998 2376791 Where do I find him?
2376958 2378126 At this restaurant.
2378293 2380837 I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.<br />How about you?
2381004 2383298 Since we're going there anyway,<br />we'll drive you.
2383464 2385550 Chinese? Let me get my jacket.
2386092 2388636 - Riggs, not with him.<br />- The kid's doing a good job.
2388887 2390388 We might need backup.
2390555 2393808 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2393975 2395310 Like a son.
2395476 2397020 - A son?<br />- In law...
2397228 2399564 enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2399731 2401816 He might have to back you up<br />one day.
2406487 2410158 Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor<br />to share some egg rolls with you.
2410575 2413161 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2413369 2414787 Share?
2416581 2420168 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2420335 2423421 - If you don't mind me saying so.<br />- Why do you say that, sir?
2423588 2427091 It's just last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2427258 2429218 - Wasn't he, Roger?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2429385 2431387 Any particular reason?
2431554 2433932 About 150,000 of them.
2434098 2437435 That's how many bullets zinged around<br />my neighborhood growing up.
2437602 2440688 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2440855 2445026 Lived on the floor, ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2445526 2448196 I didn't learn how to walk<br />till I was 10 years old.
2448363 2452408 Spent most of my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2452575 2455912 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2456079 2459374 I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor,<br />and it pisses me off.
2460708 2462126 Hey.
2463252 2466839 - We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />- No, why?
2467048 2469717 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look too hard.
2469884 2472553 Who's Leo?<br />- Maybe it's a coincidence.
2472720 2476057 What does he want?<br />- I don't know. Let's find out.
2476224 2477850 Yeah. Heh, heh, heh.
2485400 2488069 Fucking asshole!<br />Bite me! Bite me, okay?
2488236 2491447 Whatever! Whatever! Jerk.
2492532 2493825 You looking for us, Leo?
2493992 2496577 -You saw me?<br />Yeah, we saw you.
2496744 2498204 What you doing, Leo?
2498371 2502083 I've been perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I. and all.
2502250 2506504 He's a private eyesore.<br />Nice inconspicuous vehicle. I like it.
2507547 2509007 Riggs, who's the perp?
2509215 2511551 - What'd you bust him for?<br />- I'm a perp?
2511718 2515138 A young brother in back of a police car,<br />automatically I'm a perp?
2515304 2519267 Look at my suit! Look at my tie! Do I<br />look like the fucking Crips' accountant?
2519434 2521227 Look at this badge, bitch.
2521394 2523187 - Check out the gun.<br />- Okay, okay.
2523354 2525106 Put the gun down. Put the gun down.
2525273 2528026 License. Registration.<br />Urine sample.
2528192 2529485 I got a badge too, okay?
2529652 2532238 German Jews didn't have it<br />any easier when we were kids.
2532405 2534365 So don't think you're the only one.<br />Okay?
2534532 2536242 Besides, I knew you were a cop.
2536409 2539370 I was kidding with you.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.
2539537 2541622 Oh, I smell bad?<br />What you trying to say?
2541789 2544459 Stop turning everything around!<br />You're so damn touchy.
2544625 2547045 These guys'll tell you.<br />We got a history together.
2547211 2550798 Maybe we'll work together someday!<br />I'm the bomb! They'll tell you.
2550965 2554969 We'll work together when I open<br />a cereal shop, you leprechaun!
2555136 2557597 I didn't call you names, fuck face!<br />Don't start!
2557764 2559807 Okay? Don't fool around!
2559974 2563102 - These guys'll tell you everything.<br />- Sir, you're double-parked.
2563436 2566230 Officer, I'm just talking<br />with the detectives.
2566564 2568941 -We don't know this guy.<br />Yeah.
2569108 2570568 Think he might've been drinking.
2570735 2572278 They're kidding. Come back!
2572445 2575031 I wasn't drinking.<br />They just said that.
2575198 2578576 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.
2578743 2581162 Blow in my fucking ear!
2581329 2583873 -Okay, okay, okay.<br />You're all mine. You're mine!
2611067 2612360 Where's Uncle Benny?
2612527 2614570 - He's not here.<br />Is he in there?
2614737 2616322 - I'm sure he is.<br />- This way.
2616489 2618032 Yes, it's a two-way.
2618199 2620159 We have three people.
2620326 2623538 The restaurant's over there.<br />Go this way, please.
2623704 2625748 They see us,<br />but we can't see them.
2625957 2628626 - Where's your green card?<br />- That's a racist remark.
2628793 2631629 I'm a policeman who asked for<br />your green card!
2631838 2632922 This is not the way.
2633089 2635550 You're the boss<br />till we get up in his ass.
2638261 2640972 It'll be fine.<br />Hey, they've refurbished.
2641139 2643224 -I couldn't stop them.<br />Hey, fellas.
2643391 2645601 Out, out!<br />- Can I get drink or food?
2645768 2648479 Uncle Benny!<br />I hope this is a bad time.
2648688 2651816 -He still hasn't clipped his eyebrows.<br />What'd we tell you?
2651983 2655945 - We hate not disturbing you.<br />- This is Detective Buckles.
2656154 2660324 Sell any heroin? Kill anyone lately?<br />How's the front...? Restaurant?
2660491 2664162 Have something to eat.<br />Give you the police discount.
2664328 2666205 - Flied lice?<br />- Flied lice?
2666372 2668457 It is fried rice, you plick!
2672003 2674797 I'm very busy.<br />What is it this time?
2674964 2676257 Tell him, Buttkiss.
2676424 2680011 Know about a boatload of illegals<br />that went aground last night?
2680761 2682430 Just what I saw on the news.
2682680 2684473 Some snake head lost big money.
2684640 2687560 Four hundred people at 35 grand.<br />Fourteen million, Uncle Benny.
2688936 2690938 And missed out on making slaves<br />out of them.
2691230 2695610 You are cops. I thought<br />smuggling Chinese was an INS problem.
2695776 2699113 We found three bodies full of holes,<br />SO now it's a cop problem.
2699280 2700656 Three dead Chinese?
2701115 2704410 -Billion more where they came from.<br />That's right, life's cheap.
2704577 2707288 Problem is, he shot at me and Rog too.<br />That pisses us off.
2707455 2711959 Heh, heh, heh. Too bad they missed.<br />But still I don't know anything about it.
2713920 2716088 Hey. Who's he?
2717381 2720218 Hey. He doesn't look too happy.<br />What's his name?
2720426 2723846 Who is he? Who's this guy?<br />Is he just appraising your furniture?
2724055 2725806 He doesn't speak English.
2725973 2729977 Yeah? Then he doesn't understand<br />words like "scumbag"...
2730728 2732146 . "eat shit"?
2733272 2735524 I think he understands good.
2736025 2737068 Oh.
2739320 2741030 Riggs.<br />- Enter the drag queen.
2741197 2743241 The insurance, remember?
2743407 2746118 I'm busy. If you have nothing on me,<br />get out.
2746285 2747995 Just know that we're still around.
2748454 2750581 - I'm on your ass too.<br />- Yeah.
2750748 2752333 But the door is this way!
2752833 2755294 This is quicker.<br />This is quicker, really.
2758965 2760299 See? It's quicker!
2762260 2765304 Don't forget my 10 percent<br />policeman's discount.
2767807 2771352 In Hong Kong, you'd be dead.
2773396 2776232 - No, not that! Riggs, don't!<br />- No, no, no!
2777525 2779110 The insurance...<br />Ah, what the hell?
2786367 2787702 Hurry up!
2787994 2791706 Try it sometime. Give it a whirl. Not<br />only is it satisfying, it's therapeutic.
2791872 2795209 - Saves the cost of shrinks.<br />- Bad guys can't call the cops.
2795376 2797837 - Why not? We're already here!<br />- El Ni√±o.
2798963 2800131 I know this guy.
2800339 2801757 That's the captain. Hold it!
2806554 2808764 Hey, Riggs! Remember, no damage!
2819567 2821068 Hold it!
2823738 2825031 Shit.
2827366 2831620 LAPD. I'm commandeering<br />your bike. Shit. Here, $200.
2832455 2833706 Riggs, I'm coming!
2834707 2836334 Somebody stole your bike!
2838002 2839086 Stop!
2840046 2841756 Police!
2842465 2843841 Out of the way!
2844258 2846260 Butler! Chase the fast one!
2846427 2848137 What, do you have Alzheimer's?
2862360 2863611 Stop! Freeze!
2876624 2880211 Stop! Stop in Chinese, motherfucker!<br />Halt!
2894100 2895726 Out the way! Police!
2895976 2897395 He's getting away!
2904527 2906028 Excuse me. Out of the way.
2916205 2917415 Get down! LAPD!
2917623 2919208 Stop, you little shit!
2932763 2935224 Get down! Get the fuck down!
2940604 2942857 My arm!<br />I didn't do anything!
2951157 2952658 I got you covered down here!
2955077 2958289 You got the right to remain silent.<br />So shut the fuck up.
2958456 2962209 You got the right to an attorney.<br />If you can't afford one...
2962376 2965796 we'll provide you with<br />the dumbest fucking lawyer on earth.
2965963 2968257 If you get Johnnie Cochran,<br />I'll kill you!
2980144 2982605 Riggs, don't jump!<br />You're going to be a father!
2982771 2984106 Don't jump!
2988736 2990821 Oh, shit. Hold on!
2991447 2993365 Hold on! I'll get you!
2993741 2997328 - Riggs, don't move!<br />- Oh, okay. I won't move.
2997495 2998704 Hold on! I got you!
2998871 3000206 You'll catch me?
3000372 3003542 No, I'm not gonna catch you.<br />Wait. I got a Dumpster here.
3003834 3005836 You didn't do nothing,<br />why you running?
3006045 3007046 Butters!
3007213 3008839 - Get over here!<br />- Shit!
3009006 3011592 Hurry up!<br />- Come on!
3012551 3013594 Hold on, Riggs!
3014970 3017097 A bit more to the left!
3017264 3018849 Move this there. Now.
3019141 3020976 No, the other left!
3021143 3022895 Make up your mind!
3023062 3026440 - Couldn't you find something smaller?<br />- It's the only one I could find!
3026607 3029276 I got it here. Now, jump on "three."
3029443 3032488 - Okay. Ready?<br />- Ass first! It breaks the fall!
3032655 3034615 Ready. One...
3034782 3036700 two, three. Son of a bitch.
3038953 3040538 Hey, Riggs, you all right?
3040704 3042081 I should've had him.
3042248 3043791 Damn right, you should've. Shit.
3043958 3046085 Hey. Who's your partner?
3046252 3048128 - Son of a bitch.<br />- I don't have a partner.
3048295 3049713 The guy you were running with.
3049880 3051423 I'm a waiter at a restaurant.
3051882 3054009 You guys pull a gun,<br />try to kill me.
3054301 3056845 You physically abuse me.<br />I want my lawyer.
3058013 3062977 You ain't no waiter. If you're a waiter,<br />what's today's special?
3063143 3064979 What's today?
3065145 3066730 Wednesday.<br />- Yeah, Wednesday.
3066897 3069567 Sweet and sour pork,<br />barbecue spareribs...
3069858 3071318 Aw, shut up!
3072111 3074989 Next time, don't run!<br />Stay still!

3143307 3146977 Finally, Mao left home<br />to continue his schooling.
3152274 3155194 - Sorry, Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- No, no, no. Sit, please.
3155361 3157363 And it's Roger.
3157529 3160908 - It's your chair.<br />- Sit down. Really, it's fine. Sit.
3161075 3162534 Want something to drink?
3162701 3163869 Tequila?
3164620 3165871 Thank you so much.

3169124 3172336 This can't be the first time<br />you had tequila, Hong.
3172503 3175923 Yes.<br />- No.
3178425 3180094 - Bread.<br />- Huh?
3180260 3181845 Bread.
3182012 3183138 Toast.
3183305 3185057 Oh, yeah, toast.
3185224 3186266 Bread.
3191772 3193482 You know anybody here?

3197986 3200280 You been in contact with him?

3203826 3205244 What's your uncle do?
3206495 3209456 In China, he's artist.
3209623 3212668 - An artist?<br />- Yeah.
3214044 3215921 It's tough leaving home, huh?
3219425 3221427 In America...
3221593 3224388 my children have chance<br />to make good life.
3224888 3227599 We want the best for our children.
3227766 3229685 And our grandchildren.
3230728 3233147 You believe I'm a grandfather?
3233313 3235733 - That's right. Little Ping.<br />- Oh, yes.
3235899 3238235 You're a grandpa.
3238736 3240279 Where's the time go?
3240863 3242114 Oh.
3242281 3243365 Don't know.
3243574 3244867 Have no watch.
3245159 3246618 You have no watch?
3247077 3248454 Here.
3248620 3250873 This is my pop's. Take it.
3251039 3253834 He got it when he retired<br />from the force.
3254001 3256003 No, no. No, I cannot.
3256170 3257629 No, no. I want you to have it.
3257838 3261675 It belonged to a good man.<br />It ought to belong to another good man.
3263802 3266513 Thank you so much, Roger.
3355477 3356770 Shit!
3358564 3360440 No, no, Riggs.
3361358 3363026 Hold him, hold him.
3363193 3365112 Push him off.
3367364 3370868 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good.
3371660 3372703 Get him!
3376164 3377708 What's wrong?
3378000 3380294 It's the shoulder. It's the shoulder.
3380460 3384006 It's an old shoulder injury.<br />I'll have to toss in the towel.
3384172 3387050 No problem. Sorry, man.<br />- It happens periodically.
3387217 3390762 I was just getting going too.<br />You're lucky, kid.
3390929 3394266 - You're lucky he didn't kill you.<br />- You owe me a rematch!
3394433 3397144 Anytime you want.<br />- I might even train for it.
3397311 3399313 Better bring your own paramedic too.
3401398 3404651 - I'll get ice for that shoulder.<br />- Shoulder's okay, Rog.
3404902 3407070 There's nothing wrong with my shoulder.
3409907 3411992 I was faking it, Rog.
3412159 3413619 Faking it?
3414620 3418498 Gomez was killing me out there.<br />I didn't have anything left.
3418665 3420584 I told you that kid was good.
3420751 3423545 He's good, but it's not all him.
3424963 3429051 I've been feeling it lately.<br />You know the other...
3435057 3437976 Like, the other night on the ship<br />when that guy nailed me.
3438185 3440520 And yesterday I couldn't catch him.
3440687 3444066 Other stuff too. I just thought,<br />I'm out of shape or something.
3444232 3446902 You know.<br />But it's more than that.
3447069 3450739 It's like,<br />I hate to say this but...
3450948 3453158 You're getting too old for this shit.
3456036 3457162 Yeah.
3458497 3460374 How about that?
3460540 3461625 Finally.
3462668 3465128 No, but I can't be.<br />I mean, I'm only...
3466880 3469716 - Jesus.<br />- Yeah, you're only.
3470884 3472803 Can't beat the clock, Riggs.
3473637 3475097 Wow.
3475389 3478684 Murphy's right. We're dinosaurs.<br />What'll I do?
3479393 3481019 Accept it.
3483397 3484648 Like I do.
3487109 3489027 - No. Bullshit.<br />- Yeah.
3489194 3490487 Bullshit. I won't accept it.
3490737 3492239 I'll will it not to happen.
3492406 3493448 - Will it?<br />- Yeah.
3493615 3496326 - Will it?<br />- I'm not too old for this shit.
3496535 3500455 I'm not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for this shit.
3500831 3503834 We're not too old for this shit.<br />We're not too old for...
3504001 3505252 Say it like you believe it.
3505419 3508046 We're not too old for this shit.
3508213 3509493 We're not too old for this shit.
3509631 3511466 I'm not gonna buy<br />a hemorrhoid cushion.
3511633 3514094 - I won't get corns!<br />- I got corns!
3514261 3515721 I'm not wearing a suit!
3515887 3517764 What's wrong with wearing a suit?
3517931 3519599 Hey. How's it going, captain?
3530193 3531945 Thanks a lot, you guys.<br />Very funny.
3532112 3534990 That cop had me here for an hour<br />and tried to strip-search me.
3535157 3536950 - You get his phone number?<br />- Ha, ha. Funny.
3537117 3539286 Sugar-glazed with jelly.<br />Thanks, Leo.
3539453 3541538 - What happened? The scratches.<br />- A dog.
3541705 3543123 - A dog?<br />- Dog cut you like that?
3543290 3544916 Catch you drinking out of his bowl?
3545083 3547335 Very funny. I'm working on<br />an important P.I. case.
3547502 3548837 Did the dog hire you?
3549004 3551965 No. The people that lost the dog<br />hired me.
3552132 3553258 Sounds like a big case.
3553425 3557971 It is a big case, Mr. Big Shot, for all<br />you know. It's a very expensive dog.
3558138 3560140 -A Bolshoi.<br />Borzoi.
3560307 3561725 Whatever, whatever.
3562267 3563810 And you found it?
3563977 3566646 Sort of. Okay.<br />Listen to what happens.
3567314 3571443 Instead of going around town looking for a<br />dog, spending money, I went to the pound.
3571610 3575489 I take the dog home, I dye the dog.<br />It looks exactly like their dog.
3575655 3577157 Dog was a real rat, though.
3577324 3579826 He scratched me.<br />But I got the job done.
3579993 3583830 - Some kind of P.I. business you got.<br />- Douche Ventura, pet infective.
3583997 3585999 - It's grand theft.<br />- What's grand theft?
3586166 3587876 - With trickery, it's a felony.<br />- Yeah.
3588043 3590796 It is?<br />You guys are always kidding.
3590962 3594549 Whatever. I get it. Here comes<br />that touchy kid. I'm not here.
3594716 3597677 - Captain Riggs, Captain Murtaugh.<br />- What you got, Putter?
3597844 3600055 - The guy you chased in Chinatown?<br />- Yeah?
3600305 3603850 His gun matched slugs on the bodies<br />on the boat. That's your shooter.
3605852 3607562 Son of a bitch<br />that got away from me.
3607729 3610649 He didn't get too far.<br />They found him on a rooftop nearby.
3610816 3614069 Strangled. And get this.<br />Pigeons ate his eyeballs.
3615320 3616655 Cool.
3618031 3620784 Excuse me.<br />Hello? Hello?
3620951 3624579 Shit! I hate these fucking phones, man.<br />You get a call, they cut you off.
3624830 3627457 You make a call, they cut you off.<br />What's the point?
3627624 3630961 You know what they're doing?<br />They fuck you with cell phones.
3631128 3634631 They're fucking you with the phone. They<br />love when you get cut off. You know why?
3634798 3637801 Because when you call back,<br />which they know you'll do...
3637968 3640887 they charge you for the first<br />minute again at that high rate.
3641054 3642806 If you're able to call back...
3642973 3646476 because the 3-hour battery<br />you got only lasts for 20 fucking minutes.
3646643 3648562 What if you're behind a hill,<br />and it's going:
3649896 3652776 Or you go through a tunnel or some shit.<br />And they keep making it smaller.
3652941 3655694 You know why they make them this small?<br />So you can lose it.
3655861 3659614 Why? So you have to buy more phones.<br />I never lost my mother's phone.
3659781 3662075 Take you two hours to make<br />a damn long-distance call.
3662242 3665328 Da-da-da, four. Da-da-da, five. Da-da-da...
3665495 3669749 Oh. I messed up. Hang up. Gotta do it<br />again. Da-da-da, four. Da-da-da, five.
3669916 3673086 I never lost my<br />Sports illustrated swimsuit phone.
3673336 3677048 How about the scanners? They get your<br />number and call all over the world!
3677215 3681428 Somebody took my number<br />and called Afghanistan. Afghanistan!
3681595 3685182 I don't know what<br />fucking Afghanistan look like.
3685473 3689394 Even if I did, I would not talk<br />to their Afghan ass for 3 hours!
3689561 3691855 I won't talk to my daddy for 3 hours.
3692022 3694858 They fuck you,<br />they fuck you with the cell phones.
3695025 3696625 You know when you go to a drive-through?
3697986 3699738 - Hold on.<br />- Why am I talking...?
3700906 3702282 Leo Getz, private investigator.
3702449 3704034 Private investigator?
3704242 3708163 I wondered if you'd<br />investigate my privates.
3708330 3709623 Investigate what?
3709789 3711499 My privates, you stupid shit.
3711666 3713543 Shut the fuck up.
3713710 3716463 Very funny, Riggs.<br />You're costing me a lot of money.
3716713 3719716 Three dollars to answer a fucking call.<br />They fuck me, now you!
3719925 3721551 You're tough when on the phone.
3721760 3723511 Right. Telephone tough guy.
3723720 3725222 Why are we talking on the phone?
3725388 3727641 Get the fuck out of here. Go home.
3727933 3729392 What happened to your face?
3730018 3731937 "No" means no!
3734814 3736733 This kid's gonna like me, I can tell.
3736900 3738151 He'd be the first one.
3738318 3742822 Okay, okay, okay. Whatever. Whatever.
3747661 3750622 You know, we should hire Leo.
3751164 3752249 Hire Leo?
3752415 3754417 Hire him.<br />He can follow Uncle Benny around.
3754584 3756336 - Benny'll see him.<br />- Yeah.
3756503 3759297 - He'll drive him nuts.<br />- Benny'll shoot him.
3761174 3762342 Let's hire him.
3763218 3765387 I smell like stale coffee.
3768723 3771393 Why do you care if I go home<br />and change shirts?
3771685 3774896 A coffee stain's not something<br />that'd bother me.
3775146 3776398 Look at the way you dress.
3777357 3778692 What's that supposed to mean?
3781027 3784072 Just because I don't have nifty suits<br />like you. Not many cops do.
3784364 3786074 What's that supposed to mean?
3787617 3791413 Ahem. I've been wondering,<br />where's the money coming from?
3792664 3794541 Where do you think it's coming from?
3794791 3796793 - Where do you think?<br />- I don't know.
3796960 3800171 - It's none of my business.<br />- You don't know. Okay?
3800338 3802507 Okay? Trish gave me some money.
3802674 3806261 - It's none of my damn business.<br />- Money from my Aunt Anne, who died.
3806428 3808596 - Okay?<br />- All right. Sorry.
3811558 3812809 Whose car is that?
3813852 3815061 I don't know.
3815770 3818648 It looks like a full house<br />for Lamaze class.
3818815 3821943 -You know who belongs to that car?<br />Here you go, captains.
3823570 3824863 No charge for the ride.
3825739 3827615 Rianne's here and Lorna's here.
3827782 3829218 I'll put it on your account, captain.
3829242 3830910 All right, then.
3834831 3836416 Hey, honey. Hey, Lorna.
3836583 3838960 What's going on?<br />I came home to change my shirt...
3844674 3847302 - What the hell are you doing here?<br />- They took the Hongs.
3855518 3856561 Shit.
3857937 3859189 Drop it.
3873453 3875246 Girls, get out of here!
3879959 3881878 Look who we got here.
3882045 3884589 - Uncle Benny's friend.<br />- Hey, Bruce.
3884756 3886633 Nice pajamas.
3888051 3889844 What did you do with the Hongs?
3898061 3899479 Drop your guns.
3899979 3902315 - Drop them!<br />- Okay, take it easy.
3902482 3905068 You're not gonna stand for that,<br />are you, honey?
3912534 3914077 Son of a bitch!
4006586 4008213 Let the women go.
4017388 4019265 Don't panic.
4028274 4029943 I can't breathe!
4050755 4052173 Riggs!
4053299 4054467 Trish!
4058763 4060473 Trying to get my...
4060974 4062100 Son of a bitch!
4067313 4068815 Trish!
4075530 4077490 Riggs!
4084914 4087834 - I'll be damned. Thanks, kid.<br />- Ping.
4089877 4091963 Ping. Get Ping.
4092130 4093715 Ping, cut us loose!
4100430 4101472 Cut me loose!
4103850 4105268 Go ahead, cut me.
4147644 4149145 It's all right.
4150188 4151731 - You okay, honey?<br />- Yeah.
4151898 4153691 I owe you one, kid.
4154233 4157654 - Rianne, the keys to your car?<br />- They're in the car.
4157820 4159822 -I got a car.<br />We need a radio.
4164619 4165912 We have to go, baby.
4167622 4171084 How we gonna find them?<br />We got to catch them assholes.
4177632 4180051 3-William-56, this is Air 12.
4180218 4181511 We need your eyes, guys.
4181678 4185056 Looking for a black Mercedes<br />and a black Lincoln Continental.
4185223 4188142 - Vicinity of Ladera at the 210 freeway.<br />- Heh, heh.
4188309 4190561 Black Mercedes and black Continental, eh?
4190728 4193731 Well, that shouldn't be too hard<br />to find in this town.
4193981 4196234 Just give it a shot, will you?
4196401 4198569 - Be cooperative.<br />- That's a roger.
4209122 4210790 Will wonders never cease?
4210998 4214877 We've got two black Mercedes,<br />one heading east, one west.
4215586 4217880 Eastbound one just got on<br />the Valley View ramp.
4219424 4221718 We'll take that one.<br />Try locating the Continental.
4222760 4225012 - How do we know it's the right one?<br />- I don't know.
4225263 4227432 We're going east and China's east.
4227598 4229308 - China's west too.<br />- We can't divide.
4229475 4230685 Okay. Think positive!
4235565 4238067 - You crossed two lanes!<br />- You see him?
4245533 4247243 Watch the road!
4247702 4249704 I'd give my right arm for a siren<br />right now.
4254000 4255960 Why'd they take the Hongs anyway?
4256127 4258254 Maybe they're shaking them down<br />for more money.
4258421 4260339 You know what smugglers are like.
4262175 4265678 Hong said his uncle paid already.<br />He got in touch with his uncle.
4266053 4268213 He left him a message.<br />It's how they know where I live.
4268347 4269891 -Shit.<br />That's exactly how.
4270057 4273186 Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
4275813 4276981 Go, go, go!
4279066 4281861 - There's the son of a bitch right there!<br />- That's them.
4282028 4285281 Bastards left us to burn.<br />I wanna have a chat with them.
4285448 4286968 - How? You don't have any guns!<br />- Yeah?

4651897 4655067 You are now entering<br />an international holding area.
4655234 4657903 Please have proper documentation ready.
4822318 4824987 Sorry, Rog, about your loss.<br />- Thank you, man.
4826655 4827948 How's my hero?
4828282 4831702 He's a little sad,<br />talking about his mom and dad.
4835998 4837249 Here's Butters.
4841879 4843297 How's it going, Riggs?<br />- Hi.
4843464 4844965 What the hell you doing here?
4845132 4848510 I heard it on the radio.<br />I'm sorry about your house.
4850721 4852556 This is Detective...
4852723 4854433 - Butters.<br />- Butters.
4854600 4856268 - Trish, my wife.<br />- Hello, Trish.

4860064 4861982 Everybody okay?
4863192 4865110 You get a make on the guys<br />that did this?
4865277 4867821 It was Uncle Benny.
4867988 4869531 - Leo.<br />- Leo.
4869698 4872701 You got a phone?<br />- The little Fonzie guy?
4872868 4874411 Yeah. That's him.
4875037 4877790 - You be okay, baby?<br />- We'll be all right.
4878374 4879458 Call me.

4886465 4889426 - Butters, can you drive us?<br />- Yeah, let's do it.
4889593 4892304 Leo's got him at the dentist.<br />Let's go.
4896308 4897601 - What?<br />- There. Sit down.
4897768 4899103 Oh.
4904149 4905734 Captain Murtaugh...
4905901 4909113 I know this is a bad time...
4909279 4912241 but I think there's something<br />you need to know about me.
4912408 4915577 - Now, this is hard for me...<br />- I think maybe I know what it is.
4915828 4917079 You do?
4917704 4919915 Yeah. And it's okay.
4920749 4922084 It is?
4922251 4924795 People have the right to do<br />whatever makes them happy.
4924962 4927673 Just don't expect me to like it too.
4927840 4929800 I know this must be hard for you.
4929967 4932302 It's impossible for me.
4932719 4936598 I was just hoping we'd get together<br />for the holidays, say Christmas.
4936765 4940894 Why should we get together<br />and see each other on Christmas?
4941520 4944231 - I was just trying to reach out.<br />- Reach somewhere else.
4944398 4946984 Do what you want,<br />but leave me out of it. Got it?
4947151 4949695 - I got it.<br />- I don't want to hear about it.
4949862 4951238 Not a word.
4951405 4956076 What you grinning about?<br />Think about how we can talk to Benny.
4956243 4957786 I got it all worked out.
4958579 4960080 What's the matter?
4960247 4961665 My ass hurts.
4961832 4964668 My tooth!<br />Is this a dentist or proctologist?
4964835 4967504 - Please be quiet.<br />- I'm trying! I'm in pain!
4967671 4970215 Why don't you go see<br />your own dentist?
4970382 4973051 My dentist's in Detroit or I'd go!
4973218 4975846 - Oh, brother.<br />- Oh, brother? Get the dentist!
4976930 4979600 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />It's an emergency.
4979766 4982060 A man has just<br />walked in off the street.
4982227 4984897 He's in a lot of pain.<br />You better come with me. Thank you.
4989234 4991862 Okay, you can come in now! Aah!
4999828 5003665 You sure Leo can pull this off?<br />- Leo'sgotaB.S.InB.S.
5005709 5007211 Coast is clear.
5009004 5011006 Talk to the hand, okay?<br />Just one second.
5011715 5015260 - Okay, okay. Wait a minute.<br />- Let me do my job!
5015427 5018180 You hurt me, I'll stick<br />an egg roll up your ass.
5024645 5025771 What is this?
5025938 5028190 Don't be alarmed, Uncle Benny.<br />It's only a drill.
5028357 5029775 Don't say a word.
5029942 5031276 Shut up.
5031443 5035614 Now, where are the Hongs?<br />Open wide and tell me.
5035781 5037241 I don't know any Hongs.
5037407 5040285 You know them. Their uncle paid you<br />to get them out of China.
5040452 5042788 More about smuggling?<br />We went through that.
5042955 5044540 We're going through it again.
5044706 5046124 I have nothing to say.
5046291 5048669 These look very interesting.
5048835 5050462 You're not going to use it.
5050629 5051964 You won't shoot me.
5052130 5054383 - You're lousy cops.<br />- We're good cops.
5057052 5058303 This will settle him down.
5058470 5060931 Breathe, Uncle Benny. Breathe.
5061932 5063100 Crank up the nitrous.
5063809 5065102 Crank that baby up.
5065269 5067104 Ow! You said it wouldn't hurt!
5067271 5068897 I'm holding this. Go ahead.
5069565 5071650 Deep. Right down to your toes.
5073402 5076071 Benny?
5078365 5081243 -Aw, man. He's wasted.<br />Have some more.
5081410 5082452 He'll talk.
5084204 5085747 Good, breathe.
5086039 5088417 Uncle Benny, Uncle Benny, Uncle Benny.
5089501 5091253 - That's me.<br />That's you.
5093630 5095966 Now, where are the Hongs?
5099303 5101680 What's renminbi mean?<br />- Renminbi means...
5101847 5103098 renminbi.
5103265 5106310 You're a funny guy.<br />- This guy's wasting our time.
5106476 5108061 Time!
5108228 5110188 Time for Four Fathers!
5110355 5112149 Washington, Jefferson?<br />Those guys?
5112316 5113859 - Roosevelt? Ha, ha, ha.<br />- Ha, ha, ha.
5114526 5116778 I'm sleeping with my wife's two sisters.
5116945 5118447 You lucky son of a bitch!
5118614 5120699 That's a good one, Uncle Benny.
5120866 5122284 Not so good...
5122451 5124286 when my wife finds out.
5126538 5129458 I don't need needles!<br />I don't need needles! Aah!
5131543 5133712 Let's shoot his legs with Novocain...
5133962 5136506 and watch him<br />try to get out of here.
5139134 5141386 What you got in your hands there?
5141553 5142971 A nut cup.
5144264 5145974 I got some big nuts.
5148977 5150312 That's nitrous...
5151063 5152397 oxide.
5153398 5154858 Laughing gas.
5155025 5156943 We're stoned!
5161239 5162866 Murtaugh! Hurry up!
5163283 5166411 That's one funny son-in-law<br />you got there, Rog.
5167079 5168580 After tonight it be too late.
5168747 5170624 Too late for what?
5171541 5174920 Hey, Riggs.<br />Why'd you call him my son-in-law?
5175087 5176880 Uncle Benny? He's too old.
5179174 5182135 Buy Four Fathers back<br />at Four Fathers' store.
5183053 5185263 Why's he talking about his ancestors?
5185430 5186807 I don't know.
5187516 5189685 Why you call him my son-in-law?
5190185 5192145 Because I am.
5197025 5199444 I thought he was...<br />I thought he was:
5201363 5202698 No, I'm:
5205242 5206284 Bloody marvelous!
5206993 5210497 Your baby is having my baby.
5210872 5213709 My baby is having his baby.
5214126 5216545 And your baby? Whoa, baby!
5216878 5218380 Whoa, baby! My baby!
5219464 5221341 What's going on? What are you doing?
5221550 5223802 I couldn't stall anymore.
5224761 5226388 What happened?
5227597 5229766 Rog, look at this.<br />Does that hurt?
5237816 5241319 Uncle Benny,<br />anything happens to the Hongs...
5241528 5243572 we'll come back<br />and rip you a new one.
5243780 5247033 - A new one. That's two for Benny.<br />- Bloody marvelous. Bloody marvelous.
5251163 5253707 - Are you crazy?<br />- Why did you do that?
5253874 5255959 For keeping it from me<br />and letting me think...
5256126 5258086 Hit him, not me.
5258336 5261757 As soon as we find the Hongs,<br />me, you and Rianne is getting into this.
5369781 5371408 Rimminy?
5371575 5374744 Young bimbo? Jumping Jiminy?<br />I don't know.
5375954 5377247 I can't remember.
5377789 5379457 No, Riggs. Renminbi.
5379624 5381251 -What? Say that again.<br />Renminbi.
5381418 5382460 That's it.
5382627 5384421 -You got it.<br />Means "people's money."
5384588 5386840 - Currency in mainland China.<br />- People's money?
5387215 5388383 What else did Benny say?
5388550 5389926 Might lead somewhere.
5390093 5392804 He was talking about his ancestors,<br />buying them back.
5392971 5394848 Something about how tonight...
5395015 5396808 would be too late.<br />Mean anything to you?
5396975 5398476 No, nothing at all.
5398643 5400478 What about<br />the guy who torched my house?
5400645 5402772 In the restaurant,<br />Benny was afraid of him.
5402939 5405859 If Benny's scared of this guy,<br />he's gotta be a Chinese Triad.
5406026 5408820 Those guys will kill anyone<br />who gets in their way.
5408987 5412908 That includes cops and their families.<br />So watch your asses, all right?
5413074 5414743 Thanks, Ng.<br />Keep me posted.
5414910 5417078 Yeah.<br />You pick up your wife, my daughter.
5417245 5418747 - Make sure she's safe.<br />- Yes, Sir.
5418914 5421124 I'll get Trish, you get Lorna.<br />Her and Ping.
5484896 5486564 What?
5487148 5488858 You wanna get married, don't you?
5490735 5491778 No.
5496616 5498660 Yes. Yes, I do.
5499577 5501788 But if you don't want to, it's okay.
5502747 5504416 Why didn't you tell me?
5504582 5507210 Because I didn't want to put<br />any pressure on you, Riggs.
5507377 5509796 If you want to someday, that'd be great.
5511589 5513383 If you don't...
5513550 5515260 love you.
5518930 5521808 I'll take you<br />any way I can get you, Riggs.
5527605 5528857 Feel that.
5529232 5531901 -Ping, feel the baby.<br />He's really dancing.
5532068 5533778 He's kicking. You feel him?
5551629 5552964 Hang on!
5583495 5584621 You're okay.
5584788 5586498 Riggs. Pick up, Riggs.
5586664 5588374 Riggs, it's Murtaugh.
5589417 5592921 I'm sick of these fuckers, Rog.<br />I say we just find them and shoot them.
5593088 5596049 - What do you think?<br />- Meet me and Butters on South Spring then.
5596216 5597300 What's going on?
5599844 5601763 They found my watch.
5605350 5609062 They killed Hong, his uncle,<br />Uncle Benny too. Bodies are in there.
5609229 5611773 - Where's the rest of the family?<br />- They're okay.
5612524 5616111 INS raided a Chinese sweatshop.
5616820 5621199 Hong's family was being held there<br />and they led them back here.
5621366 5622575 -Murtaugh, Riggs.<br />Hey.
5622742 5626287 Looks like they were making<br />funny money. Ink's still wet.
5627038 5629791 Where are the faces?<br />- That's why I call it funny.
5630375 5632377 Why in hell<br />are they making Chinese money?
5632544 5634462 Can they even exchange this stuff here?
5634671 5635964 - Only in China.<br />- Renminbi.
5636131 5637674 -I remember.<br />Hey, Riggs.
5637841 5639425 Yeah?
5639592 5643179 Hong's uncle was an artist.<br />Maybe an engraver.
5643346 5646891 Bringing over his family could've been<br />how he was paid to do the job.
5647058 5648143 That's kind of thin.
5648309 5650770 No, that's not thin.<br />You keep talking. What?
5650937 5653982 Benny said something about paying...
5654149 5656234 - Buying back his forefathers.<br />- That's right.
5656401 5658236 Murtaugh, what'd you say?
5658403 5661614 Benny said something about<br />buying back his forefathers.
5661781 5663408 Wait, wait. You said ancestors.
5663575 5665869 - Ancestors, forefathers.<br />- What's the difference?
5666035 5669038 No, no, no. The number four.<br />Four Fathers.
5669205 5671791 These guys were the top guys<br />of the Hong Kong Triad.
5672000 5673668 These guys disappeared from prison.
5673877 5676045 Reds jailed them<br />when they took over Hong Kong.
5676212 5678173 - I bet they're here.<br />- Damn, we're good.
5678339 5681718 Lorna, grab Ping.<br />I don't want him to see the bodies.
5682760 5684637 Come on, sweetie. Come here.<br />- Hey, hey.
5684804 5687056 Ten to 1, I know where the money is.
5687223 5690518 Twenty to 1, I know where<br />the Four Fathers are. Let me make a call.
5690685 5692395 Don't leave without us.
5692562 5694772 That was good work.<br />You must be a detective.
5695023 5696691 I have my moments.
5703031 5704157 Uncle Benny.
5704782 5707327 I was actually starting<br />to like the old goat.
5707577 5709120 Bloody marvelous.
5709454 5712040 And it's fried rice, "you plick."
5712957 5714959 Oh, here.
5719964 5722759 - Which one is Hong?<br />- Hong is right in front of you.
5723176 5725595 I want a complete set<br />of forensics on all three.
5725762 5727805 Yes, sir.
5730183 5732227 Dads and their kids.
5735063 5736898 I'll take care of yours, buddy.
5737649 5739067 We gotta go, Rog.
5739234 5741319 -Take care of yourself.<br />Where're we going?
5741486 5743238 L.A. Harbor.<br />What's there?
5743404 5745323 It's what they call<br />a foreign trade zone.
5745490 5748618 There are a lot of shady deals<br />going down with the Chinese military.
5748785 5750954 It's run by a corrupt Chinese general.
5751287 5756084 I got it. Some corrupt Chinese<br />general brought the Four Fathers here...
5756251 5758336 and the Triad's<br />buying their release.
5758503 5761172 That's what Uncle Benny meant<br />by buying them back.
5761339 5764801 That general's gonna shit kittens<br />when he sees the money's counterfeit.
5764968 5766511 Yeah. Let's tell him.
5809178 5810596 Hi, gang.
5810763 5812056 LAPD.
5816227 5818021 I saw Hong.
5818187 5821024 This is what Benny meant<br />by buying the Four Fathers back.
5821190 5825236 Look, it's Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko.<br />How are you, boys?
5825403 5826738 Who's the naughty general?
5826904 5828990 Who's been lining his pockets?
5829157 5832035 Naughty. Speaky English?
5833745 5834954 What do you want?
5835955 5837457 See all this?
5837790 5840335 I hope you need a lot of<br />toilet paper back home.
5840501 5842795 That's about all it's good for,<br />wiping your ass.
5842962 5846090 Take the Four Pops back to China.<br />We don't give a shit.
5846257 5848301 Heh, heh. The Four Pops. Heh.
5848468 5850762 We don't want them no more.<br />It's counterfeit. See?
5850928 5853514 Triads never prosper<br />when they try cheating a general.
5855558 5856976 See for yourself.
5868780 5871741 There you go. Money losing face.<br />General losing face.
5872033 5874619 Hard when Triad try to sit on it.
5877747 5880208 I fucked you. I fucked you.
5880375 5883795 - We fucked you. It's beautiful.<br />- It's beautiful.
5886381 5887632 Don't we get a hand?
5888007 5889133 Here we go.
5898434 5900603 Keep your head down.<br />Let them shoot each other!
5900770 5902230 Riggs, watch out!
5904357 5905400 Thanks!
5917286 5918329 Was this a good idea?
5918538 5919664 It was an idea!
5926629 5928506 Eleven in the mag, one in the pipe.<br />You?
5928673 5930633 A real gun. Six shots.
5932552 5934137 Four!
5938850 5940768 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
5940935 5942979 What's going on?'<br />Why are you lying to me?
5944689 5946524 I.A. says you're on the take.
5946732 5947942 I'm on the take?
5948151 5951529 I think it's crazy too.<br />But you're spending lots of money.
5951696 5953322 You ever hear of Ebony Clark?
5954490 5957160 Yeah. She writes those<br />cheesy sex novels!
5957326 5959745 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />- Are you boinking her?
5959996 5963040 No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark.
5963207 5967211 - Trish is Ebony Clark.<br />- Trish is Ebony...
5967879 5969547 You are boinking her.
5970673 5972717 Yeah, I'm boinking her.
5987148 5989901 - Too embarrassing to tell anybody.<br />- Yeah, I don't blame you.
5990067 5992570 - She's making a shitload of money.<br />- How many you got?
5992737 5996115 - Uh, two.<br />- All right. I'll look for more ammo.
6026938 6028648 Who's the guy with<br />the white pajamas?
6028814 6031901 That's Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father<br />with him is his older brother.
6032068 6033361 No kidding?
6037657 6039367 Get down!
6043079 6045039 - Hey, Butters.<br />- Shit! Shit!
6045456 6047291 Now you got my name right.
6047542 6049502 I'm out.<br />I got to find some rounds.
6050294 6051837 I'll help you.
6052380 6054423 Never been shot before.
6055800 6057385 Hey, hey, Ng.
6058511 6060263 Take care of my son-in-law here.
6101679 6103347 Hey, Riggs!
6107143 6109937 - You all right?<br />- No, I got my ass kicked again.
6110187 6112023 Shit, I'm out. I'm out.
6112315 6115693 I hit the son of a bitch. I thought<br />I missed him. Where'd they go?
6128080 6129999 Come on, come on.
6131083 6134170 We got door number one,<br />number two, or number three.
6136839 6139175 - Looks like number two, Monty.<br />- Let's go.
6144347 6147141 What do we got behind<br />door number two? Bingo.
6155232 6156776 Now you've done it.
6157193 6158653 Now he's really pissed.
6163658 6166160 Son of a bitch gonna be a handful.
6170748 6175169 Since I met you, I've done some<br />hairy shit. But this is not gonna happen.
6176253 6178089 I'm gonna be a grandfather...
6178422 6180591 and you and Lorna gonna have a baby.
6184428 6187348 He ain't worth dying for, Riggs.<br />He ain't worth it.
6190142 6191769 Yeah, you're right.
6193688 6196482 If he gets away<br />we can track him down later on...
6196732 6198275 with a howitzer or something.
6198442 6202446 Your son-in-law's in there, bleeding. We<br />should get him, get the hell out of here.
6202613 6205491 - Shit, it's raining.<br />- I'm too old for this shit too.
6206534 6208077 Guy's too damn good.
6208244 6211706 Yeah, he's damn good.<br />How'd he do that thing with the gun?
6212123 6216001 He took my gun apart with one deft move.<br />How'd he do that?
6217920 6219505 Huh? How?
6228139 6229932 Yeah, okay.
6230099 6231308 Let's go ask him.
6290201 6291327 You mother...
6461330 6464124 Rog! Are you up there?
6464291 6466085 Are you all right?
6466669 6468379 Rog!
6483435 6484561 Riggs!
6488899 6490609 Riggs!
6493487 6495447 Riggs!
6496991 6498826 Hey, Riggs!
6500452 6502079 Riggs!
6502913 6504540 Where are you, Riggs?
6504957 6507751 Will it to me, Riggs! Riggs!
6508627 6509920 Where are you, Riggs?
6510087 6512006 Will it to me, Riggs!
6513841 6515592 Will me, Riggs. Will me.
6515759 6518053 Riggs, you going to have a baby. Will me.
6518220 6522057 You son of a bitch.<br />God. Will me. Riggs. Riggs.
6526770 6529314 I hear you, Riggs. I hear you.
6529481 6531775 I got you! I'm coming!
6582659 6584745 I heard you, Riggs! I heard you!
6586121 6588332 You willed me to it, man.<br />You willed me, baby.
6588499 6590417 What took you so long?
6590709 6593670 What took me so long?<br />What the hell do you mean?
6593837 6597299 I was knocked down over here.<br />I couldn't even get up.
6599426 6601303 Hey, hey! Come back here.
6604598 6606308 Let's go home, man.
6606892 6608644 Let's get out of here.
6614691 6618112 I haven't been here enough<br />lately, Vicky. I'm sorry.
6619696 6622741 I need to talk to you about Lorna.<br />Me and Lorna.
6625786 6628789 It's like this.<br />She wants to get married...
6630415 6634044 and I love her.<br />I won't lie to you. I do.
6634211 6636839 And I want to make her happy.
6639091 6641301 I'm looking for help here, honey.
6643262 6644721 I don't know what to do.
6646181 6647741 Funny talking to you about<br />this stuff...
6650894 6653272 - Oh, Leo.<br />- Hey, Riggs.
6653438 6655691 You want to get yourself shot,<br />is that it?
6658360 6660404 What the hell are you doing here?
6660988 6662156 I was tailing you.
6663574 6664616 Sorry.
6667870 6670330 I'll leave you alone.<br />I guess you want to be alone.
6670497 6673417 - Yeah. I'd appreciate it.<br />- Okay.
6677713 6680174 When I was a kid I had a pet frog.
6680591 6682301 What?
6682467 6685512 Just give me a second.<br />Let me tell you this, okay?
6685679 6688682 I had this pet frog, name was Froggy.
6688849 6690684 He was my best friend in the world.
6691560 6694605 I didn't have a lot of friends.<br />Matter of fact...
6694771 6696773 I had no friends.
6699651 6701945 I used to kiss the frog too.
6702196 6704114 I thought maybe...
6704615 6708118 it would turn into a princess<br />since I was a boy.
6708285 6710037 And it could be...
6710204 6711455 my mother.
6712372 6715417 They told me that<br />she left or something.
6716418 6718962 And my father was no bargain.
6719129 6720797 And so, just the frog...
6720964 6722966 Froggy, was my friend.
6723133 6726386 I really loved him and took him<br />everywhere with me.
6726553 6728472 I was riding my bike one day...
6728639 6731141 and he jumped out of the box...
6731308 6733852 and I ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6734019 6735854 I killed him.
6736021 6738690 I was really heartbroken. Really.
6739691 6743445 He was my best friend in the whole world,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6743612 6745697 And then I met you...
6745864 6747449 and Roger.
6747616 6751245 You guys really looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6751870 6753705 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6753872 6755374 No, it's okay.
6755540 6757251 It's okay.
6757417 6759336 You're my family...
6759503 6761213 and my friends.
6763382 6766593 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />you're just different.
6773392 6776228 And I just thought that maybe<br />that might be relevant.
6780857 6782901 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6783860 6785696 Leo...
6786363 6788490 I got a funny f... Oh.
6788657 6791034 - What's the matter?<br />- Oh. I'm having a baby.
6791201 6793620 - What?<br />- It's Lorna. She beeped me.
6793787 6795872 Yep, it's Lorna.<br />She's having the baby.
6796039 6799334 - Holy shit. I'll get the car.<br />- I'll be two steps behind you.
6806300 6808677 You sure picked a strange angel, honey.
6810846 6812556 But I got the message.
6813849 6815434 I got the message.
6821690 6823608 I'll always have this.
6824192 6825610 Always have you.
6826278 6827946 In here and here.
6829281 6830615 Thanks, honey.
6830782 6832743 I gotta go. Bye.
6833410 6835412 I am not ready to have this baby!
6835579 6838248 You're as ready as you're going to be.
6838415 6840083 Fine! Just wheel me in.
6840250 6842919 My legs are staying closed!
6843086 6844463 Give me this!
6844629 6846048 Ma'am, let go.
6846465 6849426 I am a police officer.<br />And I am not ready.
6851219 6854765 I am L.A.P.D. and I can arrest you<br />for interfering...
6855724 6857476 Lorna, are you all right?
6857642 6859102 Are you the husband?<br />- Yes.
6859269 6860562 Honey, are you all right?
6860771 6861813 No, I'm not, Riggs.
6861980 6864232 I said I didn't wanna get married,<br />but I do.
6864399 6867110 I want to be a wife before<br />I'm a mother. And I lied.
6867277 6869321 - I know you don't want to.<br />- Okay.
6870572 6872741 - You said "okay"?<br />- Yes, I did. Okay.
6872908 6874242 Let's do it. Okay.
6875202 6876912 - He said okay.<br />- Yes.
6877079 6879456 Congratulations.<br />- He said okay, Leo.
6879623 6881375 Oh, my God.
6881541 6883418 What's that smell?
6883585 6886588 I was on my way to the toilet<br />and she grabbed me.
6886797 6889591 - I'm so sorry.<br />- Have a nice baby.
6891426 6892803 I'm so sorry.
6895764 6897599 Will you marry me?
6899267 6900852 Oh, Riggs.
6901019 6903063 - You bet I will, Riggs.<br />- Okay.
6905399 6906650 Let's go.
6906817 6910445 I'm not going. Wait, no, no, no.<br />Wait, wait. Please, Riggs.
6910612 6911988 - Get a minister.<br />- Now?
6912197 6915158 Now. Because we're getting married.<br />Here comes another one.
6915325 6917994 - We need a license, blood test...<br />- I wanna hear the words...
6918161 6920163 - before the baby comes.<br />- It's coming now.
6920330 6922999 Listen, I am getting married<br />or there is no baby.
6923166 6925752 This could be an aspect<br />of a transition phase.
6925919 6929131 This is no goddamn aspect<br />of a goddamn transition phase!
6929297 6931174 Honey, everybody, calm down.
6931341 6933009 Calm down. Okay?
6933176 6935679 - Get a priest, minister, anything.<br />- Where?
6935846 6938807 Go get a priest!<br />Goddamn it, Leo!
6938974 6940475 I got it, I got it. Okay.
6940809 6942769 Pant, pant, blow.<br />Remember Lamaze class?
6942936 6944771 Pant, blow. Pant, pant, blow.
6947524 6950527 -But I want to say "I do."<br />Hey, look. Here he is.
6950694 6952362 This is Rabbi Gelb.
6952529 6955198 - A rabbi?<br />- You said anything.
6955365 6956783 No, no, no. He'll do.
6956950 6958493 For what I'll do?<br />What's going on?
6958660 6961037 We'd like you to marry us.<br />Please.
6961204 6963039 - You're Jewish?<br />- Not necessarily.
6963206 6964291 - You got a license?<br />- No.
6964458 6967043 - Well...<br />- Please don't go.
6967210 6969921 She needs to hear the words<br />before the baby comes.
6970088 6972591 Are you both serious?<br />I don't have time for hijinks.
6972757 6975302 Real serious, rabbi.<br />We're very serious.
6975635 6977554 I could do it.<br />It wouldn't be official.
6977721 6979806 It's all right.<br />I just want to hear the words.
6979973 6981892 What the hell. What are your names?
6982058 6983727 I'm Martin and this is Lorna.
6983894 6985228 Martin and Lorna.
6986605 6989232 What am I doing?<br />How do the goyim do this?
6990358 6992360 - Dearly beloved.<br />- That's it. Dearly beloved...
6992527 6997324 Dearly beloved,<br />marriage is a spiritual union...
6997491 6998700 Oh, Rabbi.
6998867 7001495 Faster, faster.<br />She's heading for the home stretch.
7001870 7004122 Martin, will you take<br />Lorna to be your wife?
7004289 7007792 Will you honor, love, et cetera...
7007959 7010086 - till death do you part?<br />- I will.
7010253 7014257 Lorna, will you take Martin<br />to be your husband, et cetera?
7014424 7015926 -Yes, I do.<br />The same thing.
7016092 7017928 All right.<br />I pronounce you man and wife.
7018094 7019930 You may kiss the bride.<br />You already did.
7020096 7022098 - Let's go.<br />- No, wait, wait, wait.
7022265 7024100 What? What?<br />Hold it, hold it, hold it.
7024267 7026394 -What is it?<br />Let me have this glass.
7026561 7028104 I need this!
7028271 7031775 No, goddamn it!<br />What the hell are you doing? Aah!
7031942 7034402 Talk to the hand, okay?<br />I'll be right back. Wait, wait.
7034694 7037781 You know how long it took me<br />to fill that thing? All day!
7037948 7041076 This is unsanitary.<br />What is this?
7041243 7043620 - Break the glass.<br />- I'll get piss on my shoes.
7043787 7045664 - You gotta do this!<br />- Okay.
7045914 7047207 Mazeltov.
7048458 7049751 Hey! What the hell?
7049918 7051795 Come back here,<br />you little son of a bitch!
7051962 7053505 Pant, pant, blow.
7053672 7055340 Leo, please.
7056633 7059261 Your work is over here.<br />I think someone else needs you.
7059427 7061137 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
7065183 7067644 Good luck, Lorna, Riggs.
7067811 7069563 - Leo?<br />- Yeah.
7070855 7072816 - Thanks a lot.<br />- Oh, okay.
7076945 7078572 Stick around. Meet the kid.
7078822 7081491 Good luck, Lorna! Okay, okay.
7085745 7086788 Riggs.
7086955 7088999 Here it comes, here it comes.
7091126 7092377 Here he is.
7092961 7096131 He's looking right at you.<br />He knows it's you.
7100969 7102679 Rog, look what I found.
7103305 7105765 - Look at that.<br />- Oh, boy. What a beauty.
7106474 7108268 Look at those eyes.
7108893 7111354 - He looks like his mother.<br />- Yes, he does.
7111521 7113857 Murtaugh, Murtaugh, Murtaugh!
7115567 7116860 No, Butters!
7117402 7119321 Butters' baby.<br />Better not be Murtaugh.
7119487 7121156 It's Butters.
7122699 7124284 Look at that baby.
7125035 7126578 Look at the hair.
7127579 7129581 Oh, that's my baby.
7129748 7132500 Look at her. You're so cute.<br />Look at you.
7132667 7135462 Twenty-seven people, nobody thought<br />of bringing a camera?
