1164664 1166957 He's dead, man.<br />He's fucking dead, man!
1167124 1168416 -Shit!<br />-What?
1168584 1171336 This is how he wanted<br />to come to America?
1171504 1173296 Was he in the killing section?
1173464 1176466 -This guy's been shot four times!<br />-Well, yeah.
1176634 1179177 At close range, like he was executed!
1179387 1181638 -He was executed.<br />-Yeah, by the crew.
1182598 1187727 What the fuck, man? People get killed<br />left, right and center in this town!
1187895 1189729 Now we're importing victims?
1189897 1192941 Gangbangers wanna kill each other,<br />no problem.
1193109 1196111 You and me, one of us gets shot,<br />hey, occupational hazard.
1196279 1200615 But just a normal guy, this fucking guy?<br />What the fuck did he ever do to anybody?
1200783 1202576 -That ain't right.<br />-Easy, Biscuits.
1202743 1205078 You'll get an ulcer like this, kid.<br />Settle down.
1205246 1207122 BUTTERS:<br />Blanket!
1207832 1209875 -Sorry, Blankets.<br />-Here's your blanket.
1210042 1211835 Sorry, I'm losing my head.
1212003 1214629 I just hate to see bad things<br />happen to good folk.
1214797 1219551 We'd like to stick around and shoot<br />the breeze, Butler, but you're in charge so--
1219719 1222679 You should take this, it's free.<br />You're all wet.
1222847 1226850 -Get some vapor rub on your chest.<br />MURTAUGH: All right, Boogers.
1227018 1229811 REPORTER: Sir, over here!<br />-Hey, get them out of here!
1230646 1232188 Get them out of here!
1233065 1235734 Yeah, yeah.<br />He takes the job kind of personally.
1235943 1239613 Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious,<br />I'd say. Overzealous.
1239780 1241197 -Emotionally--<br />-Jealous of who?
1241407 1244326 -l don't know. Who?<br />-You just said he was jealous.
1244493 1245869 -l didn't--<br />-You just said--
1246037 1248914 No, I said he was zealous.<br />Full of zeal.
1249081 1250415 -He's loud too.<br />-What?
1250583 1252125 -He's loud!<br />-What?
1252585 1254461 We better get up<br />before the sun's up.
1254670 1256296 I got something in the lifeboat.
1256464 1260091 That's okay, see you tomorrow.<br />I'll catch a squad ride. Hey, Rog.
1262136 1263970 I'm sorry about your boat.
1265014 1266514 Riggs.
1267183 1269559 -I'm sorry.<br />-Shit.
1269727 1273521 All of a sudden, this big<br />fucking shark comes-- Can I say that?
1273814 1276066 You can say it, but we can't air it.
1276233 1279069 So this big darn shark comes along....
1290289 1292916 Shit. My <i>Code 7.</i>

1342675 1344009 I had some bad Chinese.
1345636 1347470 You look a little banged up.
1347805 1349264 You look a little knocked up.
1349432 1350932 [LORNA LAUGHS]
1352309 1353768 -Are you okay?<br />-Yeah.
1353936 1355437 -You sure?<br />-Yeah.

1361527 1362569 You okay?
1362737 1364988 I'm good. I'm better than Roger.<br />His boat sank.
1365156 1368742 LORNA: No. Boat sank?<br />-l had something to do with it.
1368993 1370368 No! No grease!
1371245 1373121 RIGGS: Have some cookies.<br />-What happened?
1373289 1374914 RIGGS:<br />What happened?
1375082 1377584 Gunfights, explosions, sharks.<br />The usual.
1377752 1378960 Here, boy.
1379628 1381880 Oh. Thanks.
1382048 1386134 You were out fishing. l mean,<br />does trouble just go looking for you?
1386385 1390472 Well, it seems to know pretty much<br />where l am most of the time.
1391265 1393266 You finished the nursery.
1393434 1394934 Yeah, l did.
1395102 1397687 I figured it was good for a girl or a boy.<br />Cute, huh?
1397897 1400440 RIGGS: It's a dogfest.<br />Did you get the whole 101?
1400691 1403610 I know. I got a little<br />carried away with puppies.
1403778 1405695 Kid'll probably hate dogs.
1409492 1414037 You know, Lorna, we never<br />ever talked about marriage.
1425883 1428134 Well, l sort of figured<br />you didn't want that.
1431889 1433640 You want to get married?
1436519 1437852 Well, no.
1440397 1441648 Me neither.
1443025 1444192 You want some breakfast?
1445694 1447320 Yeah. Yeah.
1460584 1463044 <i>Serve and Protect.</i>
1463379 1466172 Since when do you read this smut?
1467675 1469968 -It's not smut, it's Ebony Clark.<br />-Ebony Clark.
1470136 1471219 Trish gave it to me.
1471428 1474597 "Every fiber in his being<br />desired her.
1474765 1476724 He devoured her with his eyes."
1477143 1481187 Hey. Can we try this thing<br />on page 196 sometime?
1482731 1483815 Whew.
1483983 1486568 There's a good one on 168.<br />Maybe later.
1486819 1490071 Nothing comes between<br />a pregnant lady and a meal.
1491073 1494951 Have l ever<br />"made your womanhood reach peaks...
1495119 1497412 ...that would rival<br />the highest Himalayas"?
1497580 1501374 -Foothills of Malibu, maybe.<br />-Not even a Teton?
1501542 1503459 -l don't think so.<br />-Thanks.
1503627 1505795 I thought I'd at least<br />rate the Rockies.
1505963 1507672 Well, you know I'm kidding.
1508799 1510967 You're just saying that<br />to make me feel better.
1511135 1512927 No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
1513095 1514387 You know I'm playing.
1514555 1517265 I've been to plenty of<br />mountaintops with you, Riggs.
1517433 1519475 It's just that I'm hungry.
1521437 1524063 When you have that kid,<br />we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens.
1524231 1526649 -l brought you a doughnut.<br />-A doughnut. Police food.
1526817 1527859 How did you know?
1530279 1532488 I dropped by Internal Affairs yesterday.
1532656 1534073 Really? How's the rat squad?
1534241 1536451 -l picked something up, good one.<br />-Some cheese?
1536619 1539996 Oh, yeah. I.A. got an anonymous tip.
1540247 1542498 The person said Roger's on the take.
1543125 1544959 No, he's not.
1545127 1548796 I know he's not. It's probably<br />some jerk he put away.
1548964 1551799 But with the new boats<br />and putting two kids through college...
1551967 1553968 ...l thought you ought to know.
1554178 1556471 I actually tried to<br />persuade him to take money.
1556639 1560808 Oh! Stop it, Riggs!<br />I can't hear that! Nothing!
1560976 1563144 I won't say anything anymore.<br />I'm kidding.
1563312 1565480 -That's awful.<br />-I'm kidding.
1565648 1568233 Don't tell him l said it.<br />He's got enough problems...
1568400 1571778 ...he'll blow his top, it'll be awful.<br />Just don't say anything.
1573614 1575031 What do you mean?
1577660 1578993 Like what?
1579161 1582038 -In general, problems.<br />-You mean something specific.
1582206 1584999 I got a nose for these things.<br />Come on, tell me. What?
1585167 1589254 No, you know, you're pushing me.<br />I don't want you to go there.
1589421 1591798 Get it off your chest.<br />You'll feel better. Tell me.
1591966 1593841 I won't leave you alone<br />till you tell me.
1594009 1595885 LORNA: Son of a bitch.<br />-Tell me.
1596053 1600598 I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed<br />my brain cells! I can't believe l said that!
1600766 1602600 What? What?
1602768 1605270 -I'm drooling. What?<br />-Oh, Riggs.
1605437 1610233 Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll<br />never say a word about this ever.
1610484 1612277 -l swear, I swear.<br />-Right hand!
1612444 1613945 I swear l won't, ever.
1614113 1616364 I promise. What?
1616824 1619575 You know how Roger is<br />about his daughter dating cops.
1619743 1621494 He'd kill them. So?
1621662 1625707 Rianne married one, he's her baby's father.<br />She's too afraid to tell Roger.
1626041 1629377 They met, fell in love.<br />She got pregnant, they got hitched.
1629545 1631504 And nobody's telling Roger about this?
1631672 1633298 After the baby's born, Riggs.
1633465 1637260 You mean it's a package deal?<br />Here it is, take it or leave it? Ha, ha, ha.
1637428 1639512 -Does Trish know about this?<br />-Yeah, she knows.
1639680 1641931 She doesn't know you know.<br />But Trish knows.
1642182 1644559 Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead<br />son-in-law?
1644727 1645852 Riggs.
1646020 1647562 -Who?<br />-Sergeant Lee Butters.
1647730 1651441 Oh. Oh. This just gets better and better!<br />No wonder he sucks up to Rog.
1651608 1653609 Brings him apples,<br />blankets, coffee....
1653777 1656779 Okay, okay. Not a word.<br />I'm telling you, nothing.
1656947 1661075 You kidding? l won't tell. He'd shoot me<br />just for being the messenger.
1661243 1665580 He's my best friend. It'd be wrong<br />to mess with him. I promise. I won't.
1667958 1669250 Promise.
1671628 1676132 LORNA: We don't have to discuss boys'<br />names, period, because we're having a girl.
1676300 1678051 Okay. Piadora.
1678218 1681888 -l like Piadora. That's sweet.<br />-Yeah?
1682056 1683097 [KNOCKING]
1683265 1685558 -Can't live with that.<br />-l love that name.
1688062 1691606 We're talking kids' names.<br />Has Rianne picked any out?
1691774 1694567 Need all the help we can get.<br />We don't want to double up.
1694735 1697070 Oscar for the boy,<br />Loreen if it's a girl.
1697237 1700073 I like Lee Butter.<br />Better! l like it better.
1700240 1702533 -Don't get me started.<br />LORNA: I like those names.
1702701 1704327 MURTAUGH:<br />Captain wants to see us downtown.
1704495 1707372 Trish'll be right down.<br />Have fun shopping for the baby.
1707539 1709082 RIGGS: Bye-bye, honey.<br />-Yeah.
1709249 1711250 Who had the sleepover?
1711418 1712752 Just airing out camping gear.
1712920 1714796 -We're out of here.<br />-Wow. Something smells good.
1714963 1716214 LORNA:<br />Really good!
1716382 1719300 Trish has food on the stove.<br />We're out of here.
1719468 1721177 That smells like Chinese food.
1721345 1723262 MURTAUGH:<br />Chinese food?
1723430 1725390 She's into Chinese cooking.
1725557 1727767 RIGGS:<br />I gotta see this. Can l taste?
1728560 1730895 -l love Chinese food.<br />MURTAUGH: Hold it! Please, Lorna.
1731063 1732230 Please.

1737444 1739529 A couple of Chinese people.
1739696 1741447 Actually a whole family.

1759258 1761634 MURTAUGH: With what the INS guy said,<br />I had to do something.
1761802 1764971 -So you brought them home.<br />-It took two trips.
1765264 1767765 -Really?<br />-They fit in the station wagon?
1768058 1770143 That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong.
1770310 1772728 He's head of the family.<br />Speaks pretty good English.
1772896 1776441 Hong, this is my partner,<br />Martin Riggs, and Lorna.
1776984 1778025 Wife?

1792040 1793833 You'll bring a shitstorm<br />down on you.
1794001 1796878 Just hold on!<br />Just wait a frigging minute!
1797671 1801132 The way l see it,<br />those are slave ships out there.
1801300 1804886 And I'm freeing slaves,<br />I'm freeing slaves...
1805053 1808055 ...like no one did<br />for my ancestors. Okay?
1809266 1813019 Riggs, it's my chance to do something<br />and do it right.
1816023 1818733 Why didn't you say so?<br />This is not gonna be boring.

1855562 1857146 I see the tuition.

1907739 1909282 Daddy, I'll be fine.
1909449 1912702 Move back in and Grandpa Rog<br />will be up all night with the baby.
1912995 1915079 Better than her<br />marrying the wrong guy.
1917416 1919584 Well, you know, a cop or something.

1969092 1971594 If l find who's doing this,<br />I'll kick his ass.
1972554 1974138 What asshole is doing this?
1974306 1977224 Riggs, l catch that asshole who<br />put my picture up, that's it!
1977392 1978392 That's it.

1994826 1996702 We're making way for the new police:
1996912 2001582 Guys with guns and psychology degrees,<br />like Butters out there.
2006254 2009382 -Biter has a psychology degree?<br />-More like a psycho degree.
2009549 2012134 Hell, I got nothing against it.<br />Times have got to change.
2012427 2015179 I once got shot by a hot-rodder<br />with a zip gun.
2015347 2017056 That's how far back I go.
2018517 2020226 You wanted to see us<br />about something?
2020394 2022144 Some things don't change.
2022312 2025272 -Here we go.<br />MURPHY: The department lost its insurance.
2025440 2028442 All the damage you've done,<br />they can't get a new one...
2028610 2030986 ...while you two guys<br />are still running around.
2032447 2034740 They can't fire you either.
2034908 2037702 So they're promoting you.
2038787 2039912 -Heh.<br />-Eh.
2040080 2043124 -Lieutenant.<br />MURPHY: There's no open lieutenant spots.
2043291 2047128 So the chief used his special privilege,<br />he's making you captains.
2048547 2050297 -Better.<br />-Captain.
2050549 2054510 Time was when this would send me<br />over the falls. I'm getting old.
2055846 2057430 So, what the hell we do now?
2057597 2058848 I don't know, captain shit.
2059015 2061475 -Hang out.<br />MURTAUGH: Take long lunches.
2061643 2064979 Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh,<br />I'm the captain."
2065147 2068399 MURTAUGH: "Chief's shitting bricks, man."<br />-You finished? You finished?
2068567 2071318 Think you can stay off the streets<br />and out of trouble?
2071486 2072987 Absolutely.
2073155 2075156 -Captain Riggs.<br />-Captain Murtaugh.
2075323 2077324 [LAUGHING]
2079411 2082329 RIGGS: All right, hey.<br />-Hey, this is--
2082497 2083748 MURPHY:<br />Hey.
2084249 2087585 You want your badges? Let me see<br />those sergeant badges. Give me those.
2087753 2090045 -Throw them over here.<br />RIGGS: Never liked it.
2090213 2091881 -Here.<br />-Give me those.
2092048 2095050 This is one of the most painful<br />fucking experiences of my life.
2095218 2097178 -Now get out of here.<br />-Thank you, captain.
2097345 2099180 -Thank you, captain.<br />-Thank you, captain.
2099347 2100973 -Captain, after you.<br />-After you, captain.
2101141 2103350 Enough with the "captain" shit.<br />Get out of here.
2103518 2107480 After you, captain, l insist!<br />"O Captain! My Captain!"
2107773 2110149 -Captains outrageous!<br />-News travels fast.
2110442 2113569 Get a break from real police work.<br />Play golf, tennis....
2113862 2115070 [SINGING]<br /><i>They got brown rings</i>
2115238 2116864 ALL:<br /><i>Around their noses</i>
2118200 2120993 Now that you're captains,<br />come up in the chopper for a ride.
2121161 2123329 -Not for me.<br />RIGGS: I'll take a rain check.
2123497 2126123 -If you change your mind, call us.<br />-He's down-to-earth kind of guy.
2126291 2127708 Aw.
2128293 2129543 I'm sorry.
2131463 2135382 Can we knock this shit off, please?<br />This is your captain speaking.
2135550 2138844 -Can we knock it off, please? Okay?<br />-Jesus.
2139012 2141639 The man's got feelings, you know?
2142599 2144266 [PEOPLE LAUGHING]
2148897 2150648 BUTTERS:<br />Hey, congratulations. Look at you.
2150816 2152650 Captain Murtaugh.
2152818 2156946 I don't really know how to say this,<br />but you really inspire me.
2158824 2160241 Keep it up.
2160408 2161742 RIGGS:<br />How's it going, Burton?
2161910 2164662 -It's Butters, captain.<br />-Yeah. I'll remember that.
2164830 2167623 -Kid really likes you.<br />-l wish he'd cut that shit out.
2167791 2169333 He likes me?
2171503 2174255 -Likes me?<br />-What?
2175882 2181428 No. You don't think he likes me,<br />likes me, likes me...
2181596 2183973 -...likes me like that?<br />-Oh.
2186852 2189061 This is not the military,<br />it's the police force.
2189229 2191438 The millennium's creeping up on us.
2191606 2195234 The captain said,<br />"New people, new department."
2202993 2205744 -Dr. Woods?<br />WOODS: Yes.
2205912 2207830 Oh. Captain Riggs.
2207998 2209874 -Don't run.<br />-I'm in a rush.
2210041 2213294 -l need to talk to you.<br />-Do you? Ah. What is it this time?
2213461 2215963 Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
2216131 2219717 -Or did you cook up something new?<br />-I'm sorry about all that.
2219885 2222219 I wanted your advice.<br />I was thinking of--
2222387 2224471 -Thinking?<br />-Marriage.
2224639 2225681 [LAUGHS]
2225849 2228142 Marriage? The "M" word?
2228310 2230853 Does "confidentiality"<br />mean anything to you?
2231021 2232479 That's funny.
2232647 2235399 You know what would happen?<br />We'd go in my office...
2235567 2237776 -...and you know what you'd tell me?<br />-What?
2237944 2241071 You'd tell me something like, "Doc...
2241239 2243449 ...l want to marry Murtaugh."
2243617 2246619 Or your mother maybe.<br />Or how about Nelson Mandela?
2246786 2247828 Nelson Mandela?
2247996 2250539 Something to ridicule me, Riggs.
2250790 2253375 Something to get a rise out of me.
2253877 2255169 Listen carefully.
2255337 2258005 I'm not stupid.
2258506 2260674 And my time is reserved...
2260842 2265054 ...for police officers with<br />real needs and real problems.
2265221 2266680 Have you got that?
2267682 2269266 -Have you?<br />-Run it by me again?
2269517 2271894 No. And you know what?
2272062 2273354 I don't like you.
2277651 2278901 RIGGS:<br />Stephanie?
2279569 2282613 I can't go out with you.<br />I'm in a relationship. I'm very happy.
2282781 2285074 I think you need to see someone.
2285241 2287660 You'll find someone someday<br />who'll love you.
2287911 2290996 Not in this department.<br />But stop bothering me!
2291164 2293082 WOODS:<br />You're disgusting!
2293249 2295000 What's the matter with you people?
2300423 2301590 What's shaking?
2301758 2303801 -Captain Riggs.<br />-Captain Murtaugh.
2303969 2306804 You're supposed to turn around and do that.<br />We're captains.
2306972 2308931 Heard you were up to your ass<br />in Chinese.
2309099 2311308 The taller ones come up to the navel.
2311476 2314895 They were short, but big enough<br />to kick your ass. What can l do for you?
2315063 2318565 One of the ship's crew shot one of<br />the illegals, apparently under orders...
2318733 2322653 ...and we'd dearly like to know<br />who's smuggling Chinese these days.
2322862 2326699 We got no hard evidence, but we're<br />pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan.
2326866 2328075 MURTAUGH:<br />Uncle Benny?
2328243 2329952 -You know him?<br />RIGGS: Yeah.
2330120 2332997 -Back when he was running smack.<br />-We never nailed him either.
2333164 2334415 Benny's slippery.
2334582 2336500 Where's he hanging out these days?
2336668 2338919 He's got a nightclub,<br />couple restaurants.
2339087 2342339 He operates mainly out on North Broadway.<br />Here's the address.
2344134 2346427 -Hi, fellas.<br />MAN: Riggs.
2346720 2348762 There he is.<br />Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers.
2348930 2350514 BUTTERS:<br />Butters.
2350682 2352725 What you got on the freighter homicide?
2352892 2356687 I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.<br />They only knew the shooter by sight.
2356855 2358188 Checked out the boat.
2358356 2362026 Turns out the boat's registered under<br />a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.
2362277 2365154 It'll be a rough one to crack,<br />but we'll nail them.
2365405 2366989 You ever hear of Benny Chan?
2367240 2369783 Benny Chan.<br />No. What kind of bad man is he?
2369951 2372036 Real bad.<br />Big crime boss in Chinatown.
2372203 2374830 If it's dirty and Chinese,<br />Benny's doing it.
2374998 2376790 Where do l find him?
2376958 2378125 At this restaurant.
2378293 2380836 I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.<br />How about you?
2381004 2383297 Since we're going there anyway,<br />we'll drive you.
2383465 2385549 Chinese? Let me get my jacket.
2386092 2388635 -Riggs, not with him.<br />-The kid's doing a good job.
2388887 2390387 We might need backup.
2390555 2393807 Spend time with him.<br />You might learn to love him.
2393975 2395309 Like a son.
2395477 2397019 -A son?<br />-In law...
2397228 2399563 ...enforcement it pays to know<br />your fellow officer.
2399731 2401815 He might have to back you up<br />one day.
2404110 2405444 [MURTAUGH CLEARS THROAT]
2406488 2410157 Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor<br />to share some egg rolls with you.
2410575 2413160 Yeah, all right. Let's go.
2413369 2414787 Share?
2416581 2420167 Butters, it seems like you hate crime<br />in a sort of personal way.
2420335 2423420 -If you don't mind me saying so.<br />-Why do you say that, sir?
2423588 2427091 It's just last night I noticed you were<br />more than slightly miffed.
2427258 2429218 -Wasn't he, Roger?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
2429385 2431386 Any particular reason?
2431554 2433931 About 150,000 of them.
2434099 2437434 That's how many bullets zinged around<br />my neighbourhood growing up.
2437602 2440687 Couldn't go outside.<br />Couldn't go near a window.
2440855 2445025 Lived on the floor, ate on the floor,<br />slept and watched TV on the floor.
2445527 2448195 I didn't learn how to walk<br />till l was 10 years old.
2448363 2452407 Spent most of my formative years<br />nose-to-nose with the family beagle.
2452575 2455911 When I work on a crime,<br />I ain't thinking about the crime.
2456079 2459373 I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor,<br />and it pisses me off.
2460708 2462126 Hey.
2463253 2466839 -We supposed to meet Leo somewhere?<br />-No, why?
2467048 2469716 Because he's following us.<br />Don't look too hard.
2469884 2472553 BUTTERS: Who's Leo?<br />-Maybe it's a coincidence.
2472720 2476056 BUTTERS: What does he want?<br />-l don't know. Let's find out.
2476224 2477850 Yeah. Heh, heh, heh.
2478476 2479810 [SIREN CHIRPS]
2485400 2488068 DRIVER: Fucking asshole!<br />LEO: Bite me! Bite me, okay?
2488236 2491446 Whatever! Whatever! Jerk.
2492532 2493824 You looking for us, Leo?
2493992 2496577 -You saw me?<br />MURTAUGH: Yeah, we saw you.
2496744 2498203 What you doing, Leo?
2498371 2502082 I've been perfecting my tailing technique<br />now that I'm a P.I. and all.
2502250 2506503 He's a private eyesore.<br />Nice inconspicuous vehicle. l like it.
2507547 2509006 Riggs, who's the perp?
2509215 2511550 -What'd you bust him for?<br />-I'm a perp?
2511718 2515137 A young brother in back of a police car,<br />automatically I'm a perp?
2515305 2519266 Look at my suit! Look at my tie!<br />Do I look like the fucking Crips' accountant?
2519434 2521226 Look at this badge, bitch.
2521394 2523187 -Check out the gun.<br />-Okay, okay.
2523354 2525105 Put the gun down. Put the gun down.
2525273 2528025 License. Registration.<br />Urine sample.
2528193 2529484 I got a badge too, okay?
2529652 2532237 German Jews didn't have it<br />any easier when we were kids.
2532405 2534364 So don't think you're the only one.<br />Okay?
2534532 2536241 Besides, l knew you were a cop.
2536409 2539369 I was kidding with you.<br />I can smell a cop a mile away.

2566564 2568941 -We don't know this guy.<br />MURTAUGH: Yeah.

2570735 2572277 They're kidding. Come back!
2572445 2575030 I wasn't drinking.<br />They just said that.
2575198 2578575 Blow your breath in my hand.<br />I can smell it already.

6731308 6733851 ...and l ran him over<br />with the back tire.
6734019 6735853 I killed him.
6736021 6738689 I was really heartbroken. Really.
6739691 6743444 He was my best friend in the whole world,<br />the only thing I ever loved.
6743612 6745696 And then I met you...
6745864 6747448 ...and Roger.
6747616 6751244 You guys really looked after me<br />a lot more than you had to.
6751870 6753704 I'm terrible to you, Leo.
6753872 6755373 No, it's okay.

6759503 6761212 ...and my friends.
6763382 6766592 You're not better friends than Froggy,<br />you're just different.
6773392 6776227 And l just thought that maybe<br />that might be relevant.
6780858 6782900 Okay, I'll leave you alone now.
6783861 6785695 Leo....
