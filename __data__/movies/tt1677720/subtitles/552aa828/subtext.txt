120538 122998 (GRUNTING)
127086 128462 Hello, Wade.
128629 130214 Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.
130381 133217 What's the matter?<br />Life getting you down?
135094 136262 (MRS. GILMORE CHUCKLES)
137930 140307 WADE: <i>I was born in 2027.</i>
140474 144103 <i>After the Corn Syrup Droughts,</i><br /><i>after the Bandwidth Riots.</i>
144270 146313 <i>After people stopped trying</i><br /><i>to fix problems</i>
146480 148732 <i>and just tried to outlive them.</i>
155364 157658 <i>My parents, they didn't make it</i><br /><i>through those times,</i>
157825 160995 <i>so I live here in Columbus, Ohio,</i><br /><i>with my Aunt Alice.</i>
161787 166166 <i>In 2045, Columbus is</i><br /><i>the fastest-growing city on Earth.</i>
167126 170421 <i>It's where Halliday and Morrow</i><br /><i>started Gregarious Games.</i>
175342 177595 <i>These days, reality is a bummer.</i>
177761 179555 <i>Everyone is looking for a way to escape,</i>
179722 180973 <i>and that's why Halliday...</i>
181140 183100 <i>That's why he was such a hero to us.</i>
184101 187605 <i>He showed us that we could go somewhere</i><br /><i>without going anywhere at all.</i>
189565 190608 <i>You don't need a destination</i>
190816 192902 <i>when you're running</i><br /><i>on an omnidirectional treadmill</i>
193068 195362 <i>with quadraphonic,</i><br /><i>pressure-sensitive underlay.</i>
196363 198616 <i>James Halliday saw the future.</i>
198782 200326 <i>And then he built it.</i>
200492 202494 <i>He gave us a place to go.</i>
202661 204413 <i>A place called</i>
204997 206373 <i>the OASIS.</i>
210794 213005 (CHORUS SINGING)
219553 221722 <i>This is the OASIS.</i>
221889 226060 <i>It's a place where the limits of reality</i><br /><i>are your own imagination.</i>
239531 241617 <i>-You can do anything...</i><br />-(CROWD CHEERING)
242618 243661 <i>...go anywhere.</i>
245287 246789 <i>Like the vacation planet.</i>
246956 249667 <i>Surf a 50-foot monster wave in Hawaii.</i>
249750 252002 <i>-You can ski down the pyramids.</i><br />-(SKIERS WHOOPING)
252670 254380 <i>You can climb Mount Everest</i>
254546 256006 <i>with Batman.</i>
258759 262221 <i>Check out this place.</i><br /><i>It's a casino the size of a planet.</i>
262388 263597 <i>You can lose your money there.</i>
263764 266141 <i>You can get married.</i><br /><i>You can get divorced.</i>
266308 268644 <i>You can... You can go in there.</i>
270312 273232 <i>People come to the OASIS</i><br /><i>for all the things they can do,</i>
273399 276527 <i>but they stay because of all the things</i><br /><i>they can be.</i>
278070 281699 <i>Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex,</i>
281865 284910 <i>a different species,</i><br /><i>live-action, cartoon.</i>
285077 286662 <i>It's all your call.</i>
287705 290874 {\an8}<i>Yeah, that's me.</i><br /><i>Well, that's my avatar.</i>
291041 293836 {\an8}<i>At least, until I feel like changing it.</i>
295004 297256 <i>Except for eating, sleeping,</i><br /><i>and bathroom breaks,</i>
297423 300676 <i>whatever people wanna do,</i><br /><i>they do it in the OASIS.</i>
301510 304346 <i>And since everyone is here,</i><br /><i>this is where we meet each other.</i>
304513 305681 <i>It's where we make friends.</i>
305848 307016 Locate Aech.

313313 314690 <i>Aech located.</i>

318694 321864 WADE: <i>Planet Doom,</i><br /><i>the most dangerous place in the OASIS,</i>
322031 324950 <i>and a pretty great place</i><br /><i>to pick up coin.</i>
325117 326660 <i>Figures Aech would be there.</i>
329329 331915 <i>Aech is my best friend in the OASIS.</i>
332791 335294 <i>He's my best friend, period.</i>
335461 338297 <i>Even though I've never actually met him</i><br /><i>in the real world.</i>

348682 351143 Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.
351310 352394 <i>Is that Daito?</i>
352561 354104 Daito and Sho.
358067 359109 (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
359193 360235 (SPEAKING CHINESE)
360569 361862 <i>This an artifact hunt?</i>
362029 364156 Yup. Gregarious 120.
364323 368243 <i>Turn into any giant robot</i><br /><i>for two minutes. That's rad.</i>
368911 370204 WADE: <i>Artifacts.</i>
370996 372956 <i>Those were key.</i>
373874 375876 <i>Halliday made sure</i><br /><i>the OASIS was littered</i>
376043 378587 <i>with enough randomly powerful stuff</i>
378754 381548 <i>that anyone could win</i><br /><i>if they had the skills.</i>
383133 385803 <i>Death matches and artifact hunts</i><br /><i>are a good way to coin-snatch,</i>
385969 388639 <i>but depending on your level of armor,</i><br /><i>they're risky.</i>

390099 392392 <i>You see, everyone starts the same,</i>

419670 420796 <i>...losing your shit means...</i>
421505 423924 <i>Well, losing your shit.</i>
424133 426301 (1980s POP MUSIC PLAYING)
426510 428762 Aech, 10 minutes until the race starts.
428929 430764 AECH: <i>Okay, Mom, I heard you.</i>
430931 435102 WADE: <i>You see, the OASIS was</i><br /><i>the brainchild of James Halliday.</i>
435269 440023 <i>He and his partner, Ogden Morrow,</i><br /><i>released the first OASIS build in 2025.</i>
440190 444278 <i>It was an instant success,</i><br /><i>and it made them both very rich.</i>
444444 447906 <i>But Morrow was out of the picture</i><br /><i>after a few years. And Halliday?</i>
448073 451243 <i>He wasn't just the owner of</i><br /><i>the world's biggest company.</i>
451410 455205 <i>He was like a god. People loved him.</i>
455372 457374 <i>They worshiped him</i><br /><i>as much as his creation.</i>
457541 460210 Maybe we should stop talking about it
460377 462713 and start, uh, showing it.
462880 465007 If you all wanna reach under your seats,
465174 467342 you'll find that there's nothing there.<br />(CHUCKLES)
467509 470846 -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)<br />-But we're each gonna bring you one now.
471722 475642 WADE: <i>And then, on January 7, 2040...</i>
475851 477895 (MUSIC DISTORTS)
478645 479688 <i>He died.</i>
482733 483901 {\an8}<i>-</i>(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)<br /><i>-And what he left behind</i>
485319 487863 {\an8}<i>changed everything.</i>
500417 504463 Hello. I am James Halliday.
504630 507549 If you're watching this, I'm dead.
508091 514097 <i>Before I died, I created</i><br /><i>what we in the biz call an "Easter egg."</i>
515307 522147 <i>A hidden object in a game that gives</i><br /><i>special powers to whoever discovers it.</i>
523649 526068 <i>The first person to find the egg</i>
526235 529488 <i>I've hidden somewhere inside the OASIS</i>
529655 533325 <i>will inherit my stock</i><br /><i>in Gregarious Games,</i>
533492 537287 <i>currently valued in excess </i><br /><i>of half a million...</i>
537371 540207 <i>Uh, half a trillion dollars' worth,</i>
540374 545754 <i>and total control of the OASIS itself.</i>
546838 552052 In the form of my avatar,<br />Anorak the All-Knowing,
552552 555222 I created three keys.
556223 559434 Three hidden challenges<br />test for worthy traits
559601 563772 revealing three hidden keys<br />to three magic gates.
563939 567943 And those with the skill<br />to survive these straits
568110 572739 will reach the end,<br />where the prize awaits.
572906 575409 Off you go, keys.
577744 582582 The keys aren't just laying around<br />under a rock somewhere.
582749 585335 I suppose you could say<br />they're invisible,
585502 589047 hidden in a dark room<br />that's at the center of a maze
589214 592134 that's located somewhere
593135 595178 up here.
595554 599599 Let the hunt for Halliday's Easter egg
600267 601310 begin.
606565 607733 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
607816 610068 WADE: <i>The challenge</i><br /><i>is to find three keys,</i>
610235 613697 <i>but in five years,</i><br /><i>no one has even gotten one key.</i>
613864 616158 <i>And the big scoreboard? Still empty.</i>
616867 618618 <i>Some long-forgotten gunter</i><br /><i>cracked the first clue</i>
618785 620454 <i>and found the first challenge.</i>
620662 622622 <i>Then, this portal appeared.</i>
623373 626626 <i>But the challenge to win the first key</i><br /><i>was a race designed by Halliday</i>
626793 629629 <i>that was so hard,</i><br /><i>no one had ever finished it.</i>
629796 633133 <i>The only ones still trying</i><br /><i>are the gunters, as in "egg hunters,"</i>
633300 636178 <i>like me and Sho and Daito,</i><br /><i>and my best friend, Aech.</i>
636887 640140 <i>Oh, and of course, the Sixers.</i>
640682 641725 <i>The Sixers work for IOI...</i>
641808 642851 COMMANDER: Sixers!
642934 644269 WADE: <i>...Innovative Online Industries.</i>
644436 646480 <i>They're the second-largest company</i><br /><i>in the world</i>
646646 648440 <i>with designs on becoming the first.</i>
648899 650692 <i>Which is why they're putting</i><br /><i>everything they got</i>
650859 652027 <i>into winning Halliday's contest.</i>
652194 653820 Buckle up!
654654 656531 Sit in!
656698 659409 WADE: <i>We call 'em "Sixers"</i><br /><i>'cause that's the company rule.</i>
659576 661036 <i>No name, just numbers.</i>
662829 665499 <i>They have a support team</i><br /><i>made up of Halliday scholars.</i>
665665 668210 <i>Like me, they spend all their time</i><br /><i>studying pop culture</i>
668377 669753 <i>that Halliday was obsessed with,</i>
669920 671963 <i>trying to find clues</i><br /><i>to solve the contest.</i>
674633 677427 <i>They're just following</i><br /><i>the orders of the head of IOI,</i>
677594 680639 <i>this dickweed named Nolan Sorrento.</i>
686686 687938 How'd you get here before me?
688105 690607 Well, I didn't make a pit stop<br />at the hair salon.
690774 692567 -What up, Z?<br />-What's up, Aech?
693276 694403 Saved you a spot.
694569 695695 Thanks, bro.

1101976 1104229 -Playing as?<br />-Oddjob. Is this a test?
1104312 1105355 Favorite game variant?
1105438 1107023 Game variant was "slappers only."<br />No weapons.
1107190 1109192 I know what "slappers only" means.<br />Racer?
1109359 1111486 <i>Turbo. </i>And his favorite food<br />was Hot Pockets.
1111653 1113238 Favorite restaurant was Chuck E Cheese.
1113404 1115782 Song was <i>Video Killed the Radio Star</i><br />by the Buggles.
1115949 1117575 Video was <i>Take on Me</i> by A-ha.
1117867 1121788 Oh, oh...<br />His favorite quote was from <i>Superman.</i>
1122455 1123748 "Some people can read <i>War and Peace</i>
1123915 1126125 "and come away thinking<br />it's a simple adventure story..."

1134592 1136094 Cool.
1137262 1141140 What would you do? If you won.<br />The whole contest, I mean.
1141224 1144143 Oh! I mean, I've got tons of plans<br />in the real world.
1144310 1149065 I'd move into a huge mansion,<br />buy a bunch of cool shit, not be poor.
1150316 1152694 {\an8}Now I know why you stopped short.
1154028 1157031 I stopped because of Kong.<br />No one ever makes it past Kong.
1157198 1158992 That's, like, a rule.
1159158 1162620 Well, then you know it can't be true.<br />Because Halliday hated making rules.
1162787 1164080 I can't afford to zero out.
1164247 1165623 -You're afraid to lose your shit.<br />-No, I'm not!
1165790 1167750 What happens<br />when IOI offers you guaranteed coin
1167917 1169085 for the keys to the kingdom?
1169252 1171462 Nolan Sorrento takes over the world.
1171629 1175800 A real gunter would risk everything<br />to save the OASIS from IOI.
1175967 1177302 Who said that?
1177468 1178887 Me.
1181139 1182682 There you go. Good as new.
1183266 1185518 Thanks for the fix-up, my man.
1195278 1196821 That's better.
1197363 1201326 I'll wave to you<br />from the finish line, McFly.
1204746 1205830 (CHUCKLES) That went well.
1205997 1207707 Thanks to you, Captain Big Mouth.
1207874 1211210 AUNT ALICE: <i>Wade? Wade?</i><br /><i>Where the hell are my gloves?</i>
1211377 1213338 Shit. I gotta go.
1216466 1217508 ANNOUNCER: <i>X1.</i>
1217592 1221137 When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,<br />I need every edge I can get.
1221429 1225183 Every push, punch, gunshot,<br />you feel it all.
1225350 1229520 ANNOUNCER: <i>Get ready for the feel,</i><br /><i>the feel of real. X1.</i>
1229687 1231940 PLAYER:<br /><i>The X1 is like wearing a second skin.</i>
1232023 1233983 <i>A skin that kicks ass.</i>
1235735 1238488 I zeroed out 'cause<br />of your broke-ass gloves.
1238655 1239906 Who told you to use them?
1240073 1242158 You took hers.
1243242 1244577 So you lost a death match.
1244744 1248998 Why don't you just respawn<br />and level up like everyone else?
1249165 1250291 You don't get it.
1250458 1253378 I bought all these power-ups<br />for this challenge, and I lost it all.
1253544 1255296 That artifact<br />was gonna pay for the house!
1255380 1256422 AUNT ALICE: Wait.
1256589 1260009 How much of our house money<br />did you spend on upgrades?
1261094 1263888 Well, all of it, but I was gonna win.
1263972 1266849 (SIGHS) That was our ticket out of here.
1269477 1270561 (SOBBING) You idiot.
1270728 1272855 No, but I only lost 'cause<br />of the bad gloves.
1273022 1274607 Our house! Our goddamn house!
1274774 1275942 WADE: My boys were in that challenge.
1276109 1278152 You couldn't have beat them<br />in a bootsuit, you noob.
1278778 1281781 Stop! No! No!
1281948 1283074 Alice, call the police!
1283241 1284742 No, we are not calling the cops.
1284909 1286619 Go to your room, Rick.
1286786 1288121 Come on, Alice.
1289122 1292458 Why do you put up with this guy?<br />He's a shitshow.
1293126 1297547 I ought to kick the both of you out.<br />I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,
1297714 1300299 if I catch you touching my stuff again,
1300466 1303011 not joking... Out.
1309934 1312145 WADE: <i>"Wade Watts."</i>
1312228 1313271 <i>My dad picked that name</i>
1313438 1315690 <i>because it sounded</i><br /><i>like a superhero's alter ego,</i>
1316274 1318901 <i>like Peter Parker or Bruce Banner.</i>
1319944 1321863 <i>But he died when I was a kid.</i>
1322030 1325074 <i>My mom, too, and I ended up here,</i>
1325241 1326951 <i>living with Aunt Alice</i>
1327118 1329495 <i>and her endless string</i><br /><i>of hard-loving losers.</i>
1332373 1335084 <i>"Halliday hated making rules."</i>
1335251 1337837 <i>Why is that line sticking in my head?</i>
1340214 1343134 <i>Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis said it,</i><br /><i>and she's hot.</i>
1343760 1345845 <i>Maybe it's because she called me out,</i>
1346012 1348306 <i>sitting here</i><br /><i>in my tiny corner of nowhere,</i>
1349182 1351768 <i>protecting my small slice of nothing.</i>
1351934 1354020 <i>Or maybe...</i>
1354187 1356522 <i>Maybe it's because</i><br /><i>that line means something</i>
1356689 1358191 <i>and I missed it.</i>

1361194 1364155 <i>The day the contest was announced,</i><br /><i>the Halliday Journals appeared.</i>
1364322 1368117 <i>He told us to look in his brain.</i><br /><i>This was the next best thing.</i>
1368284 1371621 <i>At first, it was jammed</i><br /><i>with gunters looking for answers.</i>
1371788 1374248 <i>Now, the once-crowded halls</i><br /><i>of Halliday's memories</i>
1374415 1375500 <i>are left to people like me.</i>
1375666 1378294 Parzival. Oh, joy!
1378461 1381547 And how will you eat up<br />my valuable search time today?
1381964 1383841 Gregarious Games, 2029... Office party.
1384133 1387136 Office party. Yes, you've only seen it<br />a thousand times.
1387303 1389222 Why not go back?
1390056 1393601 Each entry into Halliday's Journals<br />is meticulously assembled
1393768 1396104 from personal photographs,<br />home video recordings,
1396270 1398022 surveillance, and nanny cams.
1398189 1401859 All rendered into a<br />three-dimensional virtual experience.
1402026 1405613 Also, Halliday archived every film,<br />game, book, and television program
1405696 1408616 {\an8}he ever saw, located on the mezzanine.
1409033 1412453 No weapons or mature-themed avatars<br />are permitted within the Journals.

1425591 1428010 Everything changes, Jim.<br />Everything evolves.
1428553 1431764 HALLIDAY: Some things are perfect<br />just the way they are. <i>Asteroids.</i>
1431931 1435935 People don't live inside<br />an <i>Asteroids </i>arcade cabinet.
1437311 1438521 I know that.
1438688 1441232 Yeah, well, people are living inside<br />the arcade we built.
1441399 1443276 -I built.<br />-Uh, well... (SIGHS)
1443568 1446112 Right. Well, I guess you can say<br />whatever you want.
1446279 1447321 I don't really wanna<br />talk about it anymore.
1447488 1448865 No, of course<br />you don't wanna talk about it.
1448948 1449991 You're forcing me out.
1450408 1451450 Closer on Halliday.
1451868 1453661 Look, invention<br />comes with responsibilities
1453828 1455329 you didn't ask for.
1455997 1458040 All right, if you make something<br />people want or need
1458207 1460835 then it's up to you to set the limits.<br />You have to make some rules.
1461002 1462295 (WHISPERS)<br />"I don't wanna make any more rules."
1462587 1464338 I don't wanna make any more rules.

1467175 1468968 -I build worlds.<br />-"I build worlds."
1470094 1472722 We created something beautiful, Jim,<br />but it's changed.
1472889 1474348 Okay? It's really not a game anymore.
1474515 1475850 Are we finished?
1476142 1480605 I liked how things were<br />when they were...
1482106 1483191 When it was a game.
1483357 1486903 And we're back to where we started.<br />But that's the point, isn't it?
1487069 1489280 Things move forward<br />whether you like it or not.
1489572 1491616 Yeah, we're finished.
1491699 1493326 MORROW: (SCOFFS) Fine.
1495578 1499332 HALLIDAY: Why can't we go backwards,<br />for once?
1501709 1505379 Backwards, really fast.<br />Fast as we can. (LAUGHS)
1505922 1507840 Really put the pedal to the metal,<br />you know?
1508007 1510218 Go back 10 seconds!
1510718 1514472 {\an8}Why can't we go backwards, for once?
1515348 1519268 Backwards, really fast.<br />Fast as we can. (LAUGHS)
1519769 1522480 Really put the pedal to the metal,<br />you know?

1666040 1670503 (STAMMERING)<br />Mr. Halliday... Anorak.
1671921 1673172 It's such an honor.
1673464 1675716 The honor is all mine.
1686852 1688604 Get yourself a clue.
1703160 1706622 Who is this Parzival,<br />and how the hell is he winning?
1706789 1709250 Well, here's a better question.<br />Who cares?
1709417 1711252 Halliday's contest is vitally important.
1711419 1714463 I mean, it's nothing less than a war<br />for control of the future.
1714630 1717675 But this Parzival?<br />He's not even clanned up.
1717842 1721011 He's alone. We have an army.
1721178 1722763 EXECUTIVE: And yet,<br />he's got the first key.
1722930 1724348 Yeah, he has a key,
1724515 1727643 but you have to get three of 'em<br />to win the contest.
1727810 1730312 Our stock dove 6% yesterday.
1730479 1734275 Loyalty division is reporting<br />profits of 28%. F'Nale.
1734442 1737111 We're opening<br />five new loyalty centers this month.
1737278 1739155 Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.
1739321 1741198 Now, you really wanna talk to me<br />about stock prices?
1741365 1742491 The shareholders won't be happy.
1742658 1745911 It's not our job to make them happy.<br />It's our job to make them money,
1746078 1750124 but once we launch this little baby,<br />they're gonna flip.
1751459 1754503 We call this Pure O2.
1754670 1756338 This is the first<br />of our planned upgrades.
1756505 1759008 Once we can roll back<br />some of Halliday's ad restrictions,
1759175 1763053 we estimate we can sell up to 80%
1763220 1768476 of an individual's visual field before<br />inducing seizures, so picture this...
1768642 1771645 All of this implies we win the contest.
1774607 1776692 Indeed, it does.
1776775 1777943 (MUSIC PLAYING)
1778360 1781280 Dude, you won the key and 100,000 coins?
1781363 1782406 As soon as I took the key,
1782490 1783866 all the coins<br />just appeared in my account.
1784033 1787036 I'll tell you what,<br />I'm soiling my haptics right now.

1800883 1803511 Twenty-thou for the holy hand grenade?
1803677 1805346 That's a steal!
1807681 1811352 Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!<br />I need one of those.

1893642 1895144 To be honest,<br />I have kind of a neck thing.
1895311 1897104 It's like a carpel-tunnel deal
1897271 1898981 but with your neck,<br />if that's even a thing.
1899148 1901609 So if you could just stand<br />to your right.
1901775 1902985 My right, your left.
1904903 1908198 Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.<br />Oh. (CHUCKLES)
1909325 1910409 Here he is.
1912536 1916874 The steampunk pirate king.<br />I knew him well, Sorrento.
1917541 1919752 There are only three things<br />in this world I hate,
1919918 1923714 steampunk, pirates, and tabbouleh.
1923881 1926550 I mean, why do they even have it?
1926717 1928719 Is there a reason we're meeting here?
1929428 1933974 Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.
1934683 1937978 You wanted it. He had it.<br />And so here it is.
1941815 1945611 It creates an impenetrable magic shield<br />that can only be taken down
1945778 1947988 by a magic spell.

1950574 1951825 Don't say that again.
1951992 1953035 Okay.
1955245 1958791 Now, I'm gonna need you<br />to keep this for now.
1958957 1960793 I'm gonna let you know<br />when I wanna use it.
1961168 1962211 Okay?
1964171 1965464 (BEEPING)
1965547 1969635 Right now, though,<br />I have another job for you.
1969718 1970969 Ah.
1971053 1972262 Parzival.
1972971 1975891 Let me guess,<br />you want him off the scoreboard.
1976767 1978102 Can you do that?
1978268 1980646 Well, he's a superstar.
1980813 1982314 He made it through the first gate
1982481 1985109 and avatars are gonna be on him<br />like hoes on Santa.
1985275 1987695 i-R0k, how much more do you want?
1988529 1991573 That's what I like about you, Nolan.<br />You never lick.

2243575 2247579 He says the only thing Sorrento<br />actually knew about Halliday
2247746 2249122 was how he liked his coffee.
2249289 2251750 You could have, like,<br />different tiers of accounts,
2251917 2253377 like a gold member.
2253543 2257047 A person could be<br />silver, platinum, bronze.
2257214 2258966 You know, depending on what they pay.
2259132 2262010 Highest one maybe being "Water"<br />because "OASIS," right?
2262177 2263720 Hell of a latte.
2263887 2266014 Can you fast-forward to the stuff<br />about Halliday's date?
2266181 2267933 What? Halliday actually went on a date?
2272312 2273355 So, what happened?
2273772 2276024 Nothing. I invited her over.
2277025 2279069 Well, did you at least get her name?
2279653 2283198 Yeah. Kira, I told you,<br />like the character in <i>The Dark Crystal.</i>
2283365 2285117 That's her gamer tag.
2287202 2288245 -Karen.<br />-Karen.
2288412 2290330 Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.
2290747 2294209 No, no. Karen Underwood,<br />as in Ogden Morrow's wife?
2294376 2295627 Just watch.
2296378 2299840 So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.<br />What'd you do?
2300132 2302426 She wanted to go dancing,
2302592 2304886 so we watched a movie.
2306179 2307347 And?
2309349 2311018 -Where's the juice?<br />-(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
2311184 2313311 -Give me some juice!<br />-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
2313395 2316106 -There is no juice!<br />-Oh, God!
2316773 2318275 Hold the phone.
2318442 2322154 Halliday went on a date<br />with Ogden Morrow's wife?
2322571 2325824 Just once, years before<br />they were even married, but yeah.
2325991 2328201 And despite that,<br />and the fact that she died,
2328368 2331496 the name "Kira" is only mentioned once<br />in all of Halliday's Journals.
2331663 2332831 CURATOR: That's not possible.
2332998 2334708 It is. Look it up.
2334875 2337169 What we just saw is the only time<br />she's ever mentioned.
2337335 2338462 It makes no sense.
2338754 2341048 She was an important part<br />of both their lives.
2341214 2343091 I'll bet you anything. All my coin.
2344968 2347596 Search "Karen Underwood Morrow."
2348847 2351850 <i>Kira, I told you,</i><br /><i>like the character in </i>The Dark Crystal.
2352017 2353393 <i>That's her gamer tag.</i>
2353685 2356772 WADE: Halliday purposely removed every<br />mention of her except for this one.
2356938 2358398 That's weird. Why?
2358565 2360400 It's like,<br />it was just so painful for him
2360567 2363528 to have to see her face<br />or hear her name.
2363695 2365405 Well, he loved her.
2365572 2366948 He couldn't tell that to Morrow.
2367115 2368950 Oh, that's sad.<br />He should have told her how he felt.
2369117 2370202 Yeah, well, he missed his chance.
2370577 2371620 Look.
2372746 2375791 I found the clue to<br />the race in the other scene, but...
2375957 2377375 I've always felt<br />that the biggest clue
2377542 2379002 to the contest was hidden here.
2379419 2381129 You're right.
2382255 2383840 I lose.
2384257 2385509 Don't sweat it, Curator.
2385675 2388386 You see, Kira is the Rosebud<br />at the center of his story.
2388553 2389596 She's the big mystery.
2389763 2392057 No, no. A bet is a bet.
2393642 2396520 Oh, wow. A quarter. You can keep it.
2396686 2398772 No. You can keep it.
2402150 2404444 -You free Thursday?<br />-Who, me?
2405237 2406947 No, him.
2408198 2409991 (LAUGHS) Oh, my God. Yes, you!
2412327 2413912 You know The Distracted Globe?
2414079 2416123 Yeah, the dance club.
2418125 2420794 Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.
2420961 2423171 There's something I wanna show you.
2424005 2425507 Uh, bye-bye!
2426633 2428260 Did she just ask me out?
2428426 2430137 And I was starting to like her.
2430303 2431972 All right.
2432139 2433640 I don't do that.
2437269 2439187 AECH: Z, I can't believe<br />you told her about Kira.
2439354 2441731 WADE: What? I told you.
2441898 2444192 Hey, what about this?
2445819 2448530 No. Have you considered<br />that Art3mis could be using you?
2448697 2452617 Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.<br />Maybe I'm the one using her.
2453160 2456454 Should I go more <i>Thriller?</i>

2499497 2502250 We have that. Me and you.
2502417 2505795 Yeah, I know, but that's because<br />we're best friends, dude.
2505962 2507797 She could be a dude, too, dude.
2507881 2508924 (SCOFFS) Come on.
2509090 2510634 I'm serious!
2510800 2513428 She could actually be a 300-pound dude

2619284 2620660 ART3MIS: Have you been here before?
2620827 2622454 It's cool, right? I mean...
2622537 2624748 -(PHONE RINGING)<br /><i>-So, what's the plan?</i>

2627375 2629336 They're both here<br />at The Distracted Globe.
2629502 2630837 I can't talk.
2631963 2633715 ART3MIS: <i>The Distracted Globe</i><br /><i>was one of the first clubs</i>
2633882 2634966 <i>Halliday created in the OASIS.</i>
2635133 2636468 <i>That's common knowledge.</i>
2636634 2638094 But I double-checked
2638261 2641306 and it turns out he started building it<br />right after that moment you showed me.
2641389 2642432 The date with Kira.
2642599 2644642 Right, and she was a serious dancer.
2644809 2646728 Maybe he thought he'd take her here,
2646895 2649105 like on a virtual date.
2649731 2650899 As if that ever works.
2651608 2652734 So Halliday built it for her?
2652901 2654277 But they never made it<br />past the first date.
2654444 2655779 So Halliday's the creator...
2655862 2656905 Who hates his own creation.
2656988 2658198 And the club is the thing he hates.
2658365 2660867 And "A hidden key, a leap not taken"?
2664329 2665580 But people jump off it all night long.
2665747 2667582 But none of those people<br />had the Copper Key,
2667749 2671252 <i>so when we jump off,</i><br /><i>maybe it's different. Right?</i>
2671336 2672379 WADE: <i>Right.</i>
2675256 2676549 So we take it together?
2676716 2677884 Sure.
2679886 2681846 We're not clanning up or anything.
2682013 2685058 Of course not. I don't clan.

3229393 3230686 and then there's the salary.
3231854 3233814 Four million a year.
3233981 3237401 And if you do happen to find<br />that Easter egg, there's a bonus.
3237568 3239820 Twenty-five million dollars.
3241364 3244116 (PANTING)
3245242 3248663 I can see you're using<br />emotion-suppressing software right now,
3248829 3251666 and why wouldn't you?<br />It's smart, not to show your hand.
3257171 3260841 It is a lot of money.<br />I could really use it.
3265846 3268057 But I don't think you and I<br />would have the same plans.
3268224 3271102 Well, I don't know about that.<br />What, for the OASIS?
3271268 3274397 I guess<br />if you're not a John Hughes fan...
3275564 3277149 Of course I am.
3277316 3279777 Because the first thing that I would do
3279944 3283531 is convert all the schools<br />on Ludus to replicas
3283698 3286701 from <i>The Breakfast Club</i><br />and <i>Ferris Bueller.</i>
3286867 3289120 No way. That's a great idea.
3290037 3292331 Which school, Ridgemont or Faber?
3292498 3295418 <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High,</i><br />not John Hughes.
3295584 3298671 It's a trap.<br />Faber College from <i>Animal House.</i>
3298838 3300131 John Hughes didn't direct
3300297 3302842 <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i><br />or <i>Animal House.</i>
3303467 3306637 <i>Ferris Bueller</i> and <i>The Breakfast Club,</i><br />they went to Shermer High School,
3306804 3309557 which is in Shermer, Illinois.<br />I know what you think.
3310349 3311892 You think I'm a corporate asshole,
3312059 3314270 that I don't appreciate<br />pop culture, but...
3315438 3318399 Man, that's not true.<br />You know, when I wanna blow off steam...
3318566 3322361 Drink Tab, play <i>Robotron,</i><br />listen to Duran Duran.
3322528 3323946 I crack open a Tab.
3324113 3326365 I put on some Duran Duran.<br />I play <i>Robotron.</i>
3326532 3328492 That's why I love the OASIS.
3328659 3331829 'Cause it's just full<br />of all these things, man,
3331996 3333456 that people love. You know?
3341338 3343674 I'm a businessman. I get it.
3343841 3346469 But I gotta do my job.
3346635 3351390 (SOFTLY) But I didn't ask you here<br />just to help us find the egg, Parzival.
3352391 3356145 I asked you here for what comes after.
3357396 3359023 What would Halliday say?
3360107 3362777 James Halliday is dead.
3364070 3366989 Yeah. He is.
3368074 3371911 All that's left of him is this contest.<br />And you know what?
3372995 3375206 It just seems like<br />he wouldn't want you winning it.
3375372 3376540 A fanboy knows a hater,
3376707 3379293 and I know you've got a whole department<br />of oologists in your ear.
3379460 3381545 So, if you wanna know<br />what I really think...
3381712 3383172 I think you're full of shit.
3388552 3389637 Here's my offer.
3389804 3391555 Your board of directors,<br />you got them in the other ear?
3391722 3393599 Why don't you tell 'em this.
3394809 3397228 If they dump you, I'll consider it.
3397603 3399647 I might say something off the record.
3400689 3402191 I had to make the offer.
3402358 3405569 The board expected it,<br />but I was really hoping you'd say no.
3405736 3408989 Because if anyone's gonna win<br />this competition, it's me.
3409156 3410533 My avatar gets the egg
3410699 3414286 'cause I'm the only one here<br />with the balls to run this place.
3414578 3416914 Wow, you really switched gears there.
3417081 3419458 From fairly reasonable<br />to maniacal overlord.
3420167 3422086 You should be grateful, Wade.

3443107 3444191 With all that's going on in the world,
3444358 3446068 do you really think that<br />anyone's gonna give a damn
3446152 3447194 about an explosion

3608063 3612067 Welcome to the rebellion, Wade.
3623287 3627291 WADE: That's IOI.<br />So the stacks are over there?
3628792 3631587 We've been living this close<br />to each other the whole time?
3633088 3634381 Next door,

3641805 3643766 For the record,
3644224 3645642 um...
3645726 3647936 I'm not disappointed.
3649730 3652649 You said I would be disappointed<br />when I met you, but...
3652816 3654485 I'm not.
3656070 3658822 I've lived with it my whole life.<br />You don't have to pretend.
3673420 3676131 You have a birthmark, so what?
3677091 3678759 Why would that scare me?
3686016 3688268 Z, if I hurt you, I'm sorry.
3688644 3689812 No, it's...
3690854 3693190 Wait, did you just call me "Z"?
3694149 3696110 -Oh, my God. Did I?<br />-I think you did.
3696193 3697820 (LAUGHS) Wade, I'm sorry.
3698070 3700239 Yeah, Wade, Z.
3700406 3703575 You can call me whatever you want.<br />And I'll call you Sam.
3703659 3704701 No.
3705786 3706829 Samantha?
3707329 3709540 Okay. Cool.
3716880 3718590 Wow.
3719466 3721510 It's so much slower here.
3722928 3726223 I mean, the wind, the people...
3728142 3729935 Everything.
3735190 3737192 We forget what it's like to be outside.
3737609 3738652 Yeah.
3739611 3741155 (WADE CHUCKLES)
3741989 3744366 -Uh...<br />-Oh, shit!
3745451 3746952 -I just figured it out.<br />-Figured what out?
3747119 3748495 The second clue. I know what it means.
3754877 3756378 We've been thinking about it<br />too literally.
3756920 3757963 "The leap not taken,"
3758130 3760549 the leap Halliday didn't take,<br />is with Kira.
3760716 3764386 Yeah, but... I mean, he blamed her<br />for breaking up him and Morrow.
3764553 3767347 No. Halliday was madly in love with her.
3767514 3769766 He had a chance with Kira.<br />He had a chance to kiss her, but--
3769933 3771018 He didn't take the leap.
3771185 3773854 Right. So that's where we go next.
3775022 3776440 The place where the leap wasn't taken.
3776523 3777566 Where the date was.
3778025 3779568 At the movies!
3780402 3782029 -(THUNDER RUMBLING)<br />-Hey, Curator.
3782196 3784031 We figured out the second clue.<br />The challenge is here.
3784198 3786074 Halliday kept track of every movie<br />he ever watched,
3786241 3789161 the week and the year he watched it,<br />and how many times.
3789328 3793415 Curator, can we see<br />November 23 to 27, 2025?
3794082 3795876 That's the week<br />he went on the date with Kira.
3800506 3803967 Okay, so our options for that week<br />are <i>The Fly</i> remake.
3804134 3806094 Great flick, terrible date movie.
3806261 3808847 <i>Say Anything...</i> That would make sense.
3809765 3814144 We gotta remember the clue.<br />"A creator who hates his own creation."
3818815 3820609 <i>The Shining!</i>
3820776 3822903 It's Halliday's<br />11th favorite horror film,
3823070 3825322 and it's based on the best-selling book<br />by Stephen King,
3825405 3826448 who hated the movie!
3827074 3828992 Hey! No side chitchat.
3829159 3830452 I think we found it.
3832621 3834164 (THUNDER RUMBLING)
3834248 3836792 Are you absolutely sure<br />you want to go here?
3836959 3838669 Absolutely positive.

3884631 3885716 Look.
3887217 3889219 Ticking clock.
3889386 3892139 Okay, so I'm estimating about
3893223 3895100 five minutes to find the key.
3895267 3896727 Yeah, there are so many keys<br />in <i>The Shining,</i> though.
3896893 3898312 Where do we start?
3899730 3902941 I've never seen <i>The Shining.</i><br />Is it really scary?
3903150 3906320 Uh, I had to watch it<br />through my fingers.
3907070 3909406 WADE: Okay, so we got the key<br />from room 237,
3910032 3911783 the keys to the Snowcat,
3911950 3913619 or the keys they give Jack<br />at the beginning of the movie.
3913785 3915454 ART3MIS: Well,<br />if it's "the leap not taken,"
3915537 3916580 maybe the key isn't a key at all.
3916747 3917956 SHO: I know where the Snowcat keys are!
3918123 3919207 WADE: I say we split up.
3919291 3920375 We get all the keys
3920459 3922461 and then we meet back<br />at the Torrances' apartment.

4422127 4423169 Why?
4423253 4424379 Because he was lonely.
4424546 4426840 He had no one to spend his life with<br />towards the end.
4426923 4427966 Yeah, that's true.
4428049 4430844 The contest has gotta be somehow<br />about connecting with someone.
4431010 4432345 Anyone.
4432512 4433888 He wants the person<br />who cares for the OASIS
4434055 4435598 to be connected with the world.
4435765 4438226 That's what I think<br />he's trying to tell us.

4635423 4637383 IOI cracked<br />the first three lines of the clue,
4637550 4638593 so they knew it was sector 14
4638760 4640553 but they couldn't figure out<br />"the fortress tragic."
4640720 4643056 So they sent every guide<br />they had into that sector
4643222 4645099 until they found the right fortress.
4646225 4647518 Sho?

4981394 4982978 I think he pissed himself.
4983604 4985439 Good job, Z. We're in his account.
4985606 4987358 So he really doesn't know<br />he's in the OASIS?
4989735 4992154 This is what Sorrento should be seeing,
4992321 4995449 but this... This is what we're<br />making him see.
4996575 4999453 We grabbed him in transit just<br />as he was logging out of the OASIS,
4999620 5002289 so he thinks he's back in his office<br />in the real world.
5002498 5006168 But actually, he's here,<br />in the identical office that Aech built.
5006335 5008879 SHO: So, you basically<br />just remotely hacked his rig.
5009046 5011924 AECH: A fixed rig like Sorrento's<br />is easy to locate, hard to hack.

7040284 7042119 (PANTING)
7047458 7048542 (YELLS)
7054757 7056216 (BOTH GRUNTING)
7061513 7062556 I'm gonna need a second.
7063974 7065017 (YELLS)
7071607 7072649 (GROANS)
7076069 7077154 (YELPS)
7091251 7093253 This is wrong.
7093879 7096757 This pen, this contract.
7100010 7101595 This is the moment<br />that Halliday made Morrow
7101762 7103639 sign over his shares in Gregarious.
7104348 7106433 That was the biggest mistake<br />of his life.
7107017 7109144 He knew that.
7110896 7112940 This can't be the end.
7114149 7115859 It's a test.
7120405 7123075 I won't make the same mistake you did.
7128789 7130666 Oh, good.
7133377 7136797 I just needed to be sure.
7150811 7153021 This is where you grew up.
7157985 7159444 (VIDEO GAME MUSIC)
7162281 7164658 Oh, that's just me a long time ago.
7165242 7167953 I like to have him around<br />from time to time.
7168829 7170455 Hey, I have to show you something.
7171123 7172666 This... Come on.
7172833 7174501 This is the button.
7174668 7177796 If you push it,<br />the whole simulation shuts down
7177963 7181425 and a tapeworm program will erase<br />all of the backup servers.
7181592 7184845 So you now have the power<br />to turn the OASIS off forever.
7185345 7186930 Do you understand?
7188307 7189433 (GRUNTS)
7190350 7191685 (PANTING)
7192311 7193353 Yeah,
7193520 7195314 try not to accidentally erase
7195480 7198150 the whole of the OASIS<br />on your first day.
7207534 7209244 The stacks are straight ahead!
7220964 7222215 (ALL GROANING)
7225052 7227846 HALLIDAY: Well, I expect you have to go.<br />I know I do.
7228013 7230390 So, now is the time for you<br />to receive your prize
7230557 7232935 because you won all three keys.
7233101 7237105 Once you take this egg,<br />the game will be over.
7237814 7240859 The egg, the egg...
7248325 7250577 We know what you did here.
7250744 7254039 You turn around and<br />walk out of here while you still can.
7262965 7264508 -(GUN COCKS)<br />-(CROWD GASPS)
7266677 7269054 I created the OASIS
7269221 7272891 because I never felt at home<br />in the real world.
7273976 7277270 I just didn't know how to connect<br />with the people there.
7278438 7281316 I was afraid for all of my life.
7281942 7284695 Right up until the day<br />I knew my life was ending.
7290325 7294162 Now, that... That was when<br />I realized that,
7295330 7300419 as terrifying and painful<br />as reality can be,
7301294 7305298 it's also the only place
7306967 7308593 that you can get a decent meal.
7315267 7316768 Because
7318520 7320105 reality
7325277 7326778 is real.
7326945 7328655 You understand what I'm saying?
7330490 7333118 Yes. Yes, I do.
7342919 7344171 He did it.
7345881 7347340 He got the egg.
7348175 7349426 Hooray.
7350594 7352220 -No!<br />-No! Please!
7378663 7380248 (VEHICLES APPROACHING)
7380916 7382501 (SIRENS WAILING)
7385796 7387047 OFFICER: Hold it!
7389132 7392135 Drop the gun! Now! On the ground!
7392886 7395472 Turn around! Hands on your head.
7395639 7397182 Walk back towards me.
7412906 7417327 WADE: Mr. Halliday.<br />Something I don't understand.
7418161 7420872 You're not an avatar, are you?
7421498 7423125 No.
7424668 7426670 Is Halliday really dead?
7428338 7429923 Yes.
7435679 7437430 Then what are you?
7440684 7442644 Goodbye, Parzival.
7444312 7445397 Thanks.
7446940 7449151 Thanks for playing my game.
7478180 7479472 Wade?
7480891 7482642 -Ogden Morrow?<br />-Ogden Morrow?
7482809 7484436 You can call me "Og."
7484603 7487355 Now, there are some people out here<br />that would very much like to meet you.
7487939 7490609 Wow, this is incredible.
7491193 7493945 It's an honor to meet you, Og, but I...
7498158 7499826 There's something I need to do first.
7503747 7505498 I'm not like Halliday.
7509252 7511296 I'm taking the leap.
7527771 7528980 We're looking for Wade Watts.
7530899 7532984 We need you to make a statement<br />about the clip you sent in
7533151 7535070 of Nolan Sorrento's confession.
7535362 7537447 Uh, that was me.
7538114 7540659 What? I record everything<br />in my workshop.
7547082 7548959 Help me out of this.
7555298 7556591 Who are you guys?
7557592 7561888 The people you need right now, lawyers.<br />From Gregarious Games.
7564724 7566351 They want your signature, Wade.
7574317 7576403 I'm splitting it with my clan.
7576569 7578363 We're gonna run things together.
7582909 7584953 That's a good choice.
7585120 7587122 (CROWD CHEERING)
7612897 7615942 F'Nale, listen to me very carefully.
7616526 7617610 (NOLAN GROANS)
7625160 7627912 Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,
7628079 7629372 how'd you get here so fast?
7629539 7631708 I flew from the stars<br />on my magic sleigh.
7632292 7634711 (CHUCKLES) Everyone's been watching.
7634878 7638089 Of course, I've been watching<br />a little closer than most.
7642135 7643553 You?
7644054 7645263 You're the Curator?
7649017 7651227 (IN BRITISH ACCENT)<br />Well played, Parzival.
7652479 7654356 (IN NORMAL VOICE)<br />Jim told me nothing about the contest,
7654522 7657734 so there was no rule<br />about me losing a bet to a smart kid.
7657901 7659569 Not that you needed my help.
7660528 7664491 You figured out that Kira was the key<br />on your own.
7664866 7667494 Yeah, but... Kira wasn't the key.
7668828 7670705 It was you, Mr. Morrow.
7672832 7674501 You were the Rosebud.
7674667 7676878 And Halliday's biggest regret was
7678588 7680173 losing his only friend.
7683051 7684344 (CLEARS THROAT)
7684427 7686596 You know, Jim used to say the OASIS
7686763 7689224 was never supposed to be<br />a one-player game.
7692936 7695563 Now, who do we have here?
7695730 7698233 Oh. Well, look who it is.
7698400 7699984 It's my heroes, the High Five.
7700151 7701653 -You must be Art3mis.<br />-Samantha.
7701820 7703613 WADE: <i>The High Five took over the OASIS,</i>
7703780 7705240 <i>and the first thing we did</i>
7705407 7708743 <i>was sign Ogden Morrow</i><br /><i>to a non-exclusive consultancy.</i>
7708910 7711746 <i>The salary, per his demand,</i>
7711913 7714999 <i>was 25 cents. One quarter.</i>
7715166 7716376 (COIN CLINKS)
7718378 7720630 <i>With his guidance,</i><br /><i>our second move was to ban</i>
7720797 7723466 <i>any loyalty centers</i><br /><i>from accessing the OASIS.</i>
7724259 7727679 <i>IOI had no choice.</i><br /><i>They shut 'em all down.</i>
7730473 7732934 <i>The third thing we did</i><br /><i>wasn't as popular.</i>
7733476 7736604 <i>We closed the OASIS</i><br /><i>on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</i>
7737480 7739816 <i>I know, it sounds like a weird move,</i>
7739983 7742861 <i>but people need to spend</i><br /><i>more time in the real world.</i>
7744529 7747449 <i>'Cause, like Halliday said,</i>
7747615 7751953 <i>reality is the only thing that's real.</i>
