77343 81413 Get ready for the feel,<br />the feel of real. X1.
81414 83254 No pain, no gain.
105071 106541 Pizza, guys.
112412 113682 Whoo-hoo!
128061 129595 Hello, Wade.
129596 131326 Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.
131331 134231 What's the matter?<br />Life getting you down?
138905 141435 I was born in 2027.
141441 145251 After the Corn Syrup Droughts,<br />after the Bandwidth Riots.
145252 147445 After people stopped trying<br />to fix problems
147447 149747 and just tried<br />to outlive them.
156322 159541 My parents,<br />they didn't make it through those times,
159542 162761 so I live here in Columbus,<br />Ohio, with my Aunt Alice.
162762 167101 In 2045, Columbus is the<br />fastest-growing city on Earth.
167102 171441 It's where Halliday and Morrow<br />started Gregarious Games.
176309 178709 These days,<br />reality is a bummer.
178711 180681 Everyone is looking<br />for a way to escape,
180682 182214 and that's why Halliday...
182215 185045 That's why he was<br />such a hero to us.
185051 188621 He showed us that we could go somewhere<br />without going anywhere at all.
190557 192324 You don't need a destination
192325 194055 when you're running on<br />an omnidirectional treadmill
194060 196400 with quadraphonic,<br />pressure-sensitive underlay.
197330 199730 James Halliday saw the future.
199732 201684 And then he built it.
201685 203637 He gave us a place to go.
203638 205966 A place called
205972 207412 the OASIS.
220520 222920 This is the OASIS.
222922 227092 It's a place where the limits of<br />reality are your own imagination.
240506 242636 You can do anything...
243610 244680 ...go anywhere.
246246 247906 Like the vacation planet.
247914 250724 Surf a 50-foot monster wave<br />in Hawaii.
250725 253617 You can ski<br />down the pyramids.
253620 255520 You can climb Mount Everest
255521 257021 with Batman.
259726 263356 Check out this place.<br />It's a casino the size of a planet.
263363 265030 You can lose your money there.
265031 267431 You can get married.<br />You can get divorced.
267433 271270 You can...<br />You can go in there.
271271 274371 People come to the OASIS for<br />all the things they can do,
274374 277544 but they stay because of<br />all the things they can be.
279045 282544 Tall, beautiful, scary,<br />a different sex,
282545 286045 a different species,<br />live-action, cartoon.
286052 288654 It's all your call.
288655 291985 Yeah, that's me.<br />Well, that's my avatar.
291991 295961 At least, until I feel<br />like changing it.
295962 299214 Except for eating, sleeping,<br />and bathroom breaks,
299215 302467 whatever people wanna do,<br />they do it in the OASIS.
302468 305468 And since everyone is here,<br />this is where we meet each other.
305471 306811 It's where we make friends.
306812 309136 Locate Aech.
309142 311482 Locating Aech.
314280 316348 Aech located.
316349 319649 Sector 12. Planet Doom.
319652 322992 Planet Doom,<br />the most dangerous place in the OASIS,
322993 326089 and a pretty great place<br />to pick up coin.
326092 327692 Figures Aech would be there.
330296 333766 Aech is my best friend<br />in the OASIS.
333767 336435 He's my best friend, period.
336436 339336 Even though I've never actually<br />met him in the real world.
343176 345506 - WADWhat's up, Aech?<br />- Hey, what up, Z?
345511 347951 Next race is in 20 minutes,<br />and I can't do the late one.
347952 349647 What the hell are you up to?
349649 352289 Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.
352290 353515 Is that Daito?
353519 355119 Daito and Sho.
361527 363410 This an artifact hunt?
363411 365295 Yup. Gregarious 120.
365298 369868 Turn into any giant robot<br />for two minutes. That's rad.
369869 371239 Artifacts.
371971 374840 Those were key.
374841 377011 Halliday made sure<br />the OASIS was littered
377012 379709 with enough<br />randomly powerful stuff
379712 384082 that anyone could win<br />if they had the skills.
384083 386923 Death matches and artifact hunts<br />are a good way to coin-snatch,
386924 389689 but depending on your level of armor,<br />they're risky.
391190 393530 You see,<br />everyone starts the same,
393531 394986 but the more coin you make...
394994 397162 - Mom! Mom!<br />- ...the more you level up.
397163 399073 If you get killed,<br />your avatar can come back to life...
399074 400365 Go get your dad!
400366 401896 ...but you lose<br />all your stuff.
403836 405666 Everything you've<br />ever worked for.
406539 408009 All your money.
410042 411582 Your clothes.
413112 415180 Your weapons.
415181 417781 Since people spend most of<br />their time in the OASIS...
420620 422460 ...losing your shit means...
422461 425085 Well, losing your shit.
427460 429900 Aech, 10 minutes<br />until the race starts.
429901 432096 AECOkay, Mom, I heard you.
432098 436234 You see, the OASIS was the<br />brainchild of James Halliday.
436235 441135 He and his partner, Ogden Morrow,<br />released the first OASIS build in 2025.
441140 445410 It was an instant success,<br />and it made them both very rich.
445411 449051 But Morrow was out of the picture<br />after a few years. And Halliday?
449052 452388 He wasn't just the owner of<br />the world's biggest company.
452389 456315 He was like a god.<br />People loved him.
456322 458492 They worshiped him<br />as much as his creation.
458493 461331 Maybe we should stop<br />talking about it
461332 463827 and start, uh, showing it.
463830 466130 If you all wanna reach<br />under your seats,
466132 468467 you'll find that<br />there's nothing there.
468468 472668 But we're gonna... we're each<br />gonna bring you one now.
472672 476812 And then,<br />on January 7, 2040...
479645 480705 He died.
483683 484923 And what he left behind
486285 488885 changed everything.
501367 505604 Hello. I am James Halliday.
505605 509035 If you're watching this,<br />I'm dead.
509041 516281 Before I died, I created what we<br />in the biz call an "Easter egg."
516282 523192 A hidden object in a game that gives<br />special powers to whoever discovers it.
524624 527192 The first person<br />to find the egg
527193 530831 I've hidden somewhere<br />inside the OASIS
530832 534466 will inherit my stock<br />in Gregarious Games,
534467 538337 currently valued in excess<br />of half a million do...
538338 541337 Uh, half a trillion<br />dollars' worth,
541340 547810 and total control<br />of the OASIS itself.
547813 553523 In the form of my avatar,<br />Anorak the All-Knowing,
553524 557188 I created three keys.
557189 560559 Three hidden challenges<br />test for worthy traits
560560 564813 revealing three hidden keys<br />to three magic gates.
564814 569067 And those with the skill<br />to survive these straits
569068 573868 will reach the end,<br />where the prize awaits.
573873 576443 Off you go, keys.
578711 583721 The keys aren't just laying<br />around under a rock somewhere.
583722 586446 I suppose you could say<br />they're invisible,
586452 590192 hidden in a dark room<br />that's at the center of a maze
590193 593159 that's located somewhere
594093 596528 up here.
596529 600629 Let the hunt<br />for Halliday's Easter egg
601233 602543 begin.
608774 611209 The challenge<br />is to find three keys,
611210 614810 but in five years,<br />no one has even gotten one key.
614814 617816 And the big scoreboard?<br />Still empty.
617817 619747 Some long-forgotten gunter<br />cracked the first clue
619752 622036 and found the first challenge.
622037 624321 Then, this portal appeared.
624323 627763 But the challenge to win the first<br />key was a race designed by Halliday
627764 630760 that was so hard,<br />no one had ever finished it.
630763 634273 The only ones still trying are the gunters,<br />as in "egg hunters,"
634274 637836 like me and Sho and Daito,<br />and my best friend, Aech.
637837 641637 Oh, and of course, the Sixers.
641641 642811 The Sixers work for IOI...
642812 644408 Sixers!
644410 646144 ...Innovative<br />Online Industries.
646145 647605 They're the second-largest<br />company in the world
647613 649848 with designs<br />on becoming the first.
649849 651819 Which is why they're putting<br />everything they got
651820 653147 into winning<br />Halliday's contest.
653152 654852 Buckle up!
655621 657856 Sit in!
657857 660527 We call 'em "Sixers"<br />'cause that's the company rule.
660528 663795 No name, just numbers.
663796 666626 They have a support team<br />made up of Halliday scholars.
666632 669342 Like me, they spend all their<br />time studying pop culture
669343 670995 that Halliday<br />was obsessed with,
671003 673013 trying to find clues<br />to solve the contest.
675608 678538 They're just following<br />the orders of the head of IOI,
678544 681684 this dickweed<br />named Nolan Sorrento.
687653 689287 How'd you get here before me?
689288 691718 Well, I didn't make a pit stop<br />at the hair salon.
691724 694234 - What up, Z?<br />- What's up, Aech?
694235 695526 Saved you a spot.
695528 696898 Thanks, bro.
701067 702634 I gotta go to the back.
702635 705295 Ugh. So you can skim coins<br />from crashed cars?
705304 708073 - That's just sad, man.<br />- Fuel's low.
708074 711884 Oh, but you still had enough to pay<br />for that Something About Mary hairdo.
753119 754219 First to the key.
755521 756891 First to the egg!
806071 808011 Aech, are you seeing this?
810943 813183 Yeah, I see it.<br />That's Kaneda's bike from Akira.
813184 815409 It's a licensed skin<br />over a standard frame.
815414 817768 No, not the bike.<br />Forget the bike.
817769 820093 The girl,<br />I think it's Art3mis.
820094 822419 The Art3mis? The Sixer Fixer?
822421 825361 I've seen all her walk-throughs,<br />her Twitch streams.
825362 827327 It's her. It's definitely her.
934400 936540 Go, go, go!<br />Get there! Come on!
942308 943438 AECYou got it, you got it!
952885 954315 Balls.
959959 961029 She's not gonna make it.
963762 965602 Bail! Bail out!
965603 966667 Bail!
972805 974505 Ow!
1005037 1006537 Damn, I loved that bike.
1006538 1008206 Oh, Aech could...
1008207 1010507 Well, he's my friend,<br />but he could fix it for you.
1017850 1020620 This is my workshop.<br />Touch nothing.
1027159 1029289 Where did you find<br />an Iron Giant?
1029294 1032213 - Find it? I'm building it.<br />- That's a commission.
1032214 1035093 Oh, yeah.<br />Aech is top-rated on the mod boards.
1035094 1037974 People all over the OASIS<br />pay him serious coin.
1037975 1040340 Oh, hey, check this out!
1040341 1043339 Hey. Z, yo.
1043342 1045812 - The Galactica, of course.<br />- These are my babies, all right, man?
1045813 1047578 Sulaco, from Aliens.
1047579 1050179 Dude, how are you<br />showing off my shit?
1050182 1051752 Valley Forge, from Silent Running.<br />Oh, where's the Harkonnen Drop-Ship?
1051753 1054318 That thing is sick.<br />Folds space like a boss.
1054319 1056389 I mean, you can get from Incipio<br />to Arrakis in three seconds...
1056390 1058156 Fingers!
1058157 1059587 You'll have to excuse him.
1059591 1061731 He gets a little nervous<br />around pretty girls.
1068834 1071344 I can fix it in 10 minutes.
1072671 1075271 Yup. He's pretty great.
1075274 1078344 I assume you and Shoulder<br />Blades are clanned up.
1078345 1080611 Oh, Aech? Nah.
1080612 1085582 I mean, he's really good,<br />but I don't clan.
1085584 1088286 Oh, 'cause you're Parzival,
1088287 1090857 as in the knight who found<br />the Holy Grail by himself.
1090858 1092856 What about you, Art3mis?
1092858 1095858 Goddess of the hunt.<br />Clans must be killing to sign you up.
1097429 1099397 - Favorite shooter?<br />- Excuse me?
1099398 1101368 James Halliday's<br />favorite first-person shooter.
1101369 1102934 - What?<br />- Oh. GoldenEye.
1102935 1105295 - Playing as?<br />- Oddjob. Is this a test?
1105304 1107038 Favorite game variant?
1107039 1108639 Game variant was "slappers only."<br />No weapons.
1108640 1110624 I know what "slappers only" means.<br />Racer?
1110625 1112609 Turbo. And his favorite food<br />was Hot Pockets.
1112611 1114579 Favorite restaurant<br />was Chuck E Cheese.
1114580 1116920 Song was Video Killed the<br />Radio Star by the Buggles.
1116921 1118815 Video wTake on Me by A-ha.
1118817 1123417 Oh, oh...<br />His favorite quote was from Superman.
1123422 1125389 "Some people<br />can read War and Peace
1125390 1127590 "and come away thinking it's<br />a simple adventure story..."
1127593 1130063 "Others can read the ingredients on<br />the back of a chewing-gum wrapper
1130064 1133132 "and unlock the secrets<br />of the universe."
1133133 1135572 Lex Luthor.
1135573 1138236 Cool.
1138237 1142167 What would you do? If you won.<br />The whole contest, I mean.
1142174 1145276 Oh! I mean,<br />I've got tons of plans in the real world.
1145277 1150077 I'd... I'd move into a huge mansion,<br />buy a bunch of cool shit, not be poor.
1151283 1154986 Now I know<br />why you stopped short.
1154987 1158157 I stopped because of Kong.<br />No one ever makes it past Kong.
1158158 1160424 That... That's...<br />That's, like, a rule.
1160425 1163755 Well, then you know it can't be true.<br />Because Halliday hated making rules.
1163762 1165496 I can't afford to zero out.
1165497 1167297 - You're afraid to lose your shit.<br />- No, I'm not!
1167299 1168869 What happens when IOI<br />offers you guaranteed coin
1168870 1170267 for the keys to the kingdom?
1170269 1172599 Nolan Sorrento<br />takes over the world.
1172604 1176944 A real gunter would risk everything<br />to save the OASIS from IOI.
1176945 1178442 Who said that?
1178443 1179913 Me.
1182114 1184329 There you go. Good as new.
1184330 1186546 Thanks for the fix-up, my man.
1196228 1198328 That's better.
1198330 1202370 I'll wave to you<br />from the finish line, McFly.
1205704 1207004 That went well.
1207005 1208905 Thanks to you,<br />Captain Big Mouth.
1208907 1212337 Wade? Wade?<br />Where the hell are my gloves?
1212344 1214384 Shit. I gotta go.
1217316 1219416 ANNOUNCEX1.
1219418 1222388 When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,<br />I need every edge I can get.
1222389 1226521 Every push, punch, gunshot,<br />you feel it all.
1226522 1230655 Get ready for the feel,<br />the feel of real. X1.
1230662 1233002 The X1 is like wearing<br />a second skin.
1233003 1234998 A skin that kicks ass.
1236702 1239612 I zeroed out 'cause<br />of your broke-ass gloves.
1239613 1241035 Who told you to use them?
1241039 1243179 You took hers.
1244209 1246209 So you lost a death match.
1246211 1250121 Why don't you just respawn and<br />level up like everyone else?
1250122 1252275 You don't get it.
1252284 1254524 I bought all these power-ups for<br />this challenge, and I lost it all.
1254525 1256389 That artifact<br />was gonna pay for the house!
1256390 1258055 Wait.
1258056 1262056 How much of our house money<br />did you spend on upgrades?
1262060 1264930 Well, all of it,<br />but I was gonna win.
1264931 1267870 That was our ticket<br />out of here.
1270435 1271965 You idiot.
1271970 1273970 No, but I only lost 'cause<br />of the bad gloves.
1273972 1275706 Our house! Our goddamn house!
1275707 1277441 My boys<br />were in that challenge.
1277442 1279752 You couldn't have beat them<br />in a bootsuit, you noob.
1279753 1282905 Stop! No! No!
1282914 1284215 Alice, call the police!
1284216 1285876 No, we are not<br />calling the cops.
1285884 1287988 Go to your room, Rick.
1287989 1290087 Aw, come on, Alice.
1290088 1294088 Why do you put up with this guy?<br />He's a shitshow.
1294092 1298662 I ought to kick the both of you out.<br />I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,
1298664 1301434 if I catch you<br />touching my stuff again,
1301435 1304043 not joking... Out.
1310909 1313244 "Wade Watts."
1313245 1315005 My dad picked that name
1315013 1317253 because it sounded<br />like a superhero's alter ego,
1317254 1320919 like Peter Parker<br />or Bruce Banner.
1320920 1322987 But he died when I was a kid.
1322988 1326188 My mom, too,<br />and I ended up here,
1326191 1328091 living with Aunt Alice
1328093 1330533 and her endless string<br />of hard-loving losers.
1333332 1336200 "Halliday hated making rules."
1336201 1338871 Why is that line<br />sticking in my head?
1341173 1344713 Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis said it,<br />and she's hot.
1344714 1346977 Maybe it's because<br />she called me out,
1346978 1350148 sitting here<br />in my tiny corner of nowhere,
1350149 1352878 protecting my small slice<br />of nothing.
1352884 1355152 Or maybe...
1355153 1357663 Maybe it's because<br />that line means something
1357664 1359356 and I missed it.
1362160 1364109 The day the contest<br />was announced,
1364110 1366059 the Halliday Journals<br />appeared.
1366064 1369403 He told us to look in his brain.<br />This was the next best thing.
1369404 1372744 At first, it was jammed with<br />gunters looking for answers.
1372745 1375368 Now, the once-crowded halls<br />of Halliday's memories
1375374 1376644 are left to people like me.
1376645 1379410 Parzival. Oh, joy!
1379411 1382911 And how will you eat up<br />my valuable search time today?
1382914 1385082 Gregarious Games, 2029...<br />Office party.
1385083 1388253 Office party.<br />Yes, you've only seen it a thousand times.
1388254 1391021 Why not go back?
1391022 1394732 Each entry into Halliday's<br />Journals is meticulously assembled
1394733 1397226 from personal photographs,<br />home video recordings,
1397229 1399159 surveillance, and nanny cams.
1399164 1403000 All rendered into a three-dimensional<br />virtual experience.
1403001 1406671 Also, Halliday archived every film,<br />game, book, and television program
1406672 1410007 he ever saw,<br />located on the mezzanine.
1410008 1413578 No weapons or mature-themed avatars<br />are permitted within the Journals.
1413579 1417378 Please enjoy your time with us,<br />and happy gunting!
1417382 1419216 I like cleaning up.
1419217 1421647 Okay, Jim,<br />I'm, uh... I'm going.
1426558 1429527 Everything changes, Jim.<br />Everything evolves.
1429528 1433247 Some things are perfect just<br />the way they arAsteroids.
1433248 1436968 People don't live inside<br />an Asteroids arcade cabinet.
1438270 1440137 I know that.
1440138 1442368 Yeah, well,<br />people are living inside the arcade we built.
1442374 1444542 - I built.<br />- Uh, well...
1444543 1447253 Right. Well,<br />I guess you can say whatever you want.
1447254 1448775 I don't really wanna<br />talk about it anymore.
1448780 1449950 No, of course<br />you don't wanna talk about it.
1449951 1451378 You're forcing me out.
1451383 1452917 Closer on Halliday.
1452918 1454788 Look, invention<br />comes with responsibilities
1454789 1456954 you didn't ask for.
1456955 1459155 All right,<br />if you make something people want or need
1459157 1461957 then it's up to you to set the limits.<br />You have to make some rules.
1461960 1463560 "I don't wanna make<br />any more rules."
1463562 1465402 I don't wanna make<br />any more rules.
1465403 1466827 "I'm a dreamer."
1466832 1468132 I'm a dreamer.
1468133 1471068 - I build worlds.<br />- "I build worlds."
1471069 1473839 We created something beautiful,<br />Jim, but it's changed.
1473840 1475469 Okay? It's really<br />not a game anymore.
1475474 1477107 Are we finished?
1477108 1481648 I liked how things were<br />when they were...
1483081 1485249 When it was a game.
1485250 1488020 And we're back to where we started.<br />But that's the point, isn't it?
1488021 1490519 Things move forward<br />whether you like it or not.
1490522 1492662 Yeah, we're finished.
1492663 1494357 Fine.
1496528 1500368 Why can't we go backwards,<br />for once?
1502667 1506867 Backwards, really fast.<br />Fast as we can.
1506872 1508972 Really put the pedal to the metal,<br />you know?
1508974 1511675 Go back 10 seconds!
1511676 1516306 Why can't we go backwards,<br />for once?
1516314 1520718 Backwards, really fast.<br />Fast as we can.
1520719 1523519 Really put the pedal to the metal,<br />you know?
1524523 1526323 Bill and Ted did it.
1547646 1549706 Back again so soon?
1551249 1553449 Careful not to lose your shit.
1557489 1559859 You figured something out.
1559860 1562088 Parzival, tell me.
1662160 1667000 Nice racing, Padawan.<br />You're the first to finish.
1667001 1671538 Mr. Halliday... Anorak.
1672871 1674804 It's such an honor.
1674805 1676739 The honor is all mine.
1687819 1689619 Get yourself a clue.
1704135 1707735 Who is this Parzival,<br />and how the hell is he winning?
1707739 1710106 Well, here's a better question.<br />Who cares?
1710107 1712475 Halliday's contest<br />is vitally important.
1712477 1715577 I mean, it's nothing less than a<br />war for control of the future.
1715580 1718820 But this Parzival?<br />He's not even clanned up.
1718821 1722147 He's alone. We have an army.
1722153 1723893 And yet,<br />he's got the first key.
1723894 1725756 Yeah, he has a key,
1725757 1728757 but you have to get three of<br />'em to win the contest.
1728760 1731428 Our stock dove 6% yesterday.
1731429 1735399 Loyalty division is reporting<br />profits of 28%. F'Nale.
1735400 1738240 We're opening five new<br />loyalty centers this month.
1738241 1740266 Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.
1740271 1742341 Now, you really wanna talk<br />to me about stock prices?
1742342 1744374 The shareholders<br />won't be happy.
1744375 1747045 It's not our job to make them happy.<br />It's our job to make them money,
1747046 1751145 but once we launch this little baby,<br />they're gonna flip.
1752417 1755617 We call this Pure O2.
1755620 1757520 This is the first<br />of our planned upgrades.
1757522 1760132 Once we can roll back some of<br />Halliday's ad restrictions,
1760133 1764194 we estimate<br />we can sell up to 80%
1764195 1769595 of an individual's visual field before<br />inducing seizures, so picture this...
1769601 1772671 All of this implies<br />we win the contest.
1775573 1777743 Indeed, it does.
1779544 1782314 Dude, you won the key<br />and 100,000 coins?
1782315 1783814 As soon as I took the key,
1783815 1785715 all the coins<br />just appeared in my account.
1785717 1788047 I'll tell you what,<br />I'm soiling my haptics right now.
1791656 1793456 What the hell's a Cataclyst?
1793458 1797228 A bomb. Kills every avatar<br />on a planet, even the owner.
1797229 1798458 Who'd want that?
1798463 1800533 IOI.<br />They buy everything.
1801833 1804643 Twenty-thou<br />for the holy hand grenade?
1804644 1806366 That's a steal!
1808640 1812480 Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!<br />I need one of those.
1812481 1814207 Okay, don't spend<br />all your money.
1817816 1820186 X1 haptic bootsuit.
1834766 1836226 Oh, yeah!
1889220 1892420 i-R0k, old friend.<br />How are you?
1894592 1896262 To be honest,<br />I have kind of a neck thing.
1896263 1898228 It's like a carpel-tunnel deal
1898229 1900478 but with your neck,<br />if that's even a thing.
1900479 1902728 So if you could just stand<br />to... to your right.
1902734 1904004 My right, your left.
1905870 1909240 Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.<br />Oh.
1910275 1911435 Here he is.
1913511 1917198 The steampunk pirate king.<br />I knew him well, Sorrento.
1917199 1920886 There are only three things<br />in this world I hate,
1920887 1924855 steampunk, pirates,<br />and tabbouleh.
1924856 1927686 I mean,<br />why do they even have it?
1927692 1930402 Is there a reason<br />we're meeting here?
1930403 1935625 Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.
1935633 1939003 You wanted it. He had it.<br />And so here it is.
1942774 1946744 It creates an impenetrable magic<br />shield that can only be taken down
1946745 1949148 by a magic spell.
1949149 1951048 The Orb of Osuvox.
1951049 1952949 Don't say that again.
1952951 1954051 Okay.
1956220 1959920 Now, I'm gonna need you<br />to keep this for now.
1959924 1962164 I'm gonna let you know<br />when I wanna use it.
1962165 1963230 Okay?
1966631 1970671 Right now, though,<br />I have another job for you.
1970672 1971998 Ah.
1972003 1973937 Parzival.
1973938 1976908 Let me guess,<br />you want him off the scoreboard.
1977742 1979242 Can you do that?
1979243 1981778 Well, he's a superstar.
1981779 1983647 He made it<br />through the first gate
1983648 1986248 and avatars are gonna be<br />on him like hoes on Santa.
1986250 1989486 i-R0k, how much more<br />do you want?
1989487 1993117 That's what I like about you, Nolan.<br />You never lick.
1993124 1995164 You bite straight<br />to the chocolaty center
1995165 1997294 of the Tootsie Pop.
1997295 1999695 Remember that old commercial,<br />with the owl?
1999697 2000767 i-R0k.
2002700 2004500 Three times my normal fee.
2004502 2006136 Done.
2006137 2008007 Wait, really?<br />I should have asked for five.
2008008 2010006 Is four still on the table?
2012210 2015210 There's five of us<br />on the big board now.
2015213 2018015 Art3mis was next,<br />no surprise there.
2018016 2021346 She was on the track when I won.<br />She saw me going backwards.
2021352 2026392 I gave Aech a tip, made him promise not<br />to say anything, and then he won next.
2026393 2029061 I'm pretty sure<br />he bragged to our pal Daito,
2029062 2031795 'cause he won right after.
2031796 2035396 And of course,<br />Daito told his best friend, Sho...
2035400 2037547 He totally totaled his car,
2037548 2039695 but then Sho got it, too.
2048679 2050914 "A creator who hates<br />his own creation.
2050915 2055415 "A hidden key, a leap not taken.<br />Retrace your steps, escape your past."
2055420 2058155 "A creator who hates<br />his own creation.
2058156 2062586 "A hidden key, a leap not taken.<br />Retrace your steps, escape your past.
2062593 2065063 "And the key of jade<br />will be yours at last."
2106904 2108874 "Escape your past."
2112543 2115513 What part of your past are you<br />trying to escape, Halliday?
2127325 2129085 - Hey, it's Parzival!<br />- Dude!
2130561 2132101 You're, like,<br />totally my hero!
2132102 2133256 Hey, Parzival!<br />Over here!
2133264 2135398 Dude, you're amazing!
2135399 2137469 Hey, Parzival! Right here!<br />Let me get an autograph!
2143474 2145308 Watch it!
2145309 2149449 You're famous now!<br />You can't just go wherever you want!
2149450 2150847 No, no, no, I...
2155486 2157656 Huh?
2161125 2163525 Ahh!
2169600 2173800 That is... That is not funny.
2173804 2176458 Oh, God.
2176459 2179109 Ugh.
2179110 2181744 Oh, God. Don't you get it?
2181745 2184379 You're "the Parzival" now.
2184382 2185882 You have to have a disguise.
2188152 2189792 Okay, here.
2191022 2192722 Clark Kent glasses.
2192723 2195033 They hide your identity<br />without changing your look.
2203734 2205344 I'm not wearing that.
2214879 2217514 This is great.
2217515 2219575 The way your inventory<br />bursts out when you die.
2219584 2221251 They didn't want<br />any more blood.
2221252 2222892 This is right before<br />the OASIS went live.
2222893 2226487 Six days prior.<br />December 2nd, 2025.
2226490 2228525 Check this out.
2228526 2230156 You know who that is?
2231762 2233530 Is that Sorrento?
2233531 2235498 Sorrento started<br />as an intern.
2235499 2237934 He claims he learned<br />at the feet of the master.
2237935 2240665 That's how he convinced IOI<br />to create the Sixers for him,
2240671 2242605 his Halliday knowledge.
2242606 2244540 But ask Ogden Morrow?
2244542 2248712 He says the only thing Sorrento<br />actually knew about Halliday
2248713 2250380 was how he liked his coffee.
2250381 2252881 You could have, like,<br />different tiers of accounts,
2252883 2254517 like a gold member.
2254518 2258188 A person could be<br />silver, platinum, bronze.
2258189 2260257 You know, depending on<br />what they paid.
2260258 2263128 You know, highest one maybe being<br />"Water" because "OASIS," right?
2263129 2265057 Hell of a latte.
2265062 2267132 Can you fast-forward to the<br />stuff about Halliday's date?
2267133 2268971 What? Halliday actually went<br />on a date?
2273271 2274738 So, what happened?
2274739 2277974 Nothing. I invited her over.
2277975 2280605 Well, did you at least<br />get her name?
2280611 2284321 Yeah. Kira, I told you,<br />like the character in The Dark Crystal.
2284322 2286145 That's her gamer tag.
2288219 2289386 - Karen.<br />- Karen.
2289387 2291717 Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.
2291722 2295332 No, no. Karen Underwood,<br />as in Ogden Morrow's wife?
2295333 2297326 Just watch.
2297328 2301098 So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.<br />What'd you do?
2301099 2303497 She wanted to go dancing,
2303498 2305897 so we watched a movie.
2307138 2308368 And?
2310308 2312138 Where's the juice?
2312143 2314344 Give me some juice!
2314345 2317745 - There is no juice!<br />- Oh, God!
2317748 2319416 Hold the phone.
2319417 2323517 Halliday went on a date<br />with Ogden Morrow's wife?
2323521 2326961 Just once, years before they<br />were even married, but yeah.
2326962 2329326 And despite that,<br />and the fact that she died,
2329327 2332627 the name "Kira" is only mentioned<br />once in all of Halliday's Journals.
2332630 2333960 That's not possible.
2333964 2335865 It is. Look it up.
2335866 2338296 What we just saw is the only<br />time she's ever mentioned.
2338302 2339802 It makes no sense.
2339804 2342174 She was an important part<br />of both their lives.
2342175 2344113 I'll bet you anything.<br />All my coin.
2345943 2349813 Search<br />"Karen Underwood Morrow."
2349814 2352984 Kira, I told you,<br />like the character in The Dark Crystal.
2352985 2355185 That's her gamer tag.
2355186 2357886 Halliday purposely removed every<br />mention of her except for this one.
2357888 2359518 That's weird. Why?
2359523 2362088 It's like, it was just<br />so painful for him
2362089 2364655 to have to see her face<br />or hear her name.
2364662 2366529 Well, he loved her.
2366530 2368398 He couldn't tell that<br />to Morrow.
2368399 2370069 Oh, that's sad.<br />He should have told her how he felt.
2370070 2371567 Yeah, well,<br />he missed his chance.
2371569 2373699 Look.
2373704 2376914 I found the clue to the race<br />in the other scene, but...
2376915 2378507 I've always felt<br />that the biggest clue
2378509 2380379 to the contest<br />was hidden here.
2380380 2382148 You're right.
2383214 2385215 I lose.
2385216 2387016 Don't sweat it, Curator.
2387017 2389517 You see, Kira is the Rosebud<br />at the center of his story.
2389520 2390720 She's the big mystery.
2390721 2393091 No, no. A bet is a bet.
2394592 2397662 Oh, wow. A quarter.<br />You can keep it.
2397663 2399801 No. You can keep it.
2403100 2405470 - You free Thursday?<br />- Who, me?
2406203 2407973 No, him.
2409173 2411013 Oh, my God. Yes, you!
2413277 2415047 You know The Distracted Globe?
2415048 2417145 Yeah, the dance club.
2419083 2421918 Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.
2421919 2424189 There's something<br />I wanna show you.
2424955 2426515 Uh, bye-bye!
2427591 2429391 Did she just ask me out?
2429393 2431263 And I was starting<br />to like her.
2431264 2433096 All right.
2433097 2434667 I don't do that.
2438235 2440295 Z, I can't believe<br />you told her about Kira.
2440304 2443543 What? I told you.
2443544 2446776 Hey, what about this?
2446777 2449646 No. Have you considered that<br />Art3mis could be using you?
2449647 2454117 Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.<br />Maybe I'm the one using her.
2454118 2457718 Should I go more Thriller?
2457721 2459161 No.
2459890 2460990 Punk?
2460991 2462061 No.
2464094 2465464 Duran Duran.
2465465 2467297 No.
2467298 2468468 Does it look like<br />I'm trying too hard?
2468469 2471734 Yes! Listen to yourself!
2471735 2474604 You have a massive cyber crush<br />on this girl.
2474605 2477475 She's hacking your heart<br />to get to your head.
2478976 2480846 I got it!
2481979 2484009 - Buckaroo Banzai?<br />- Yeah!
2484014 2487284 Really? You're gonna wear the<br />outfit from your favorite movie?
2487285 2488988 Don't be that guy.
2488989 2490687 I am that guy.
2490688 2492458 Z, you gotta be more careful<br />about who you meet in the OASIS.
2492459 2495756 Aech, Art3mis gets me.<br />She'll get my outfit.
2495759 2498759 There's just this connection.<br />I mean, sometimes, we even...
2498762 2500462 - Finish each other's sentences?<br />- Yeah!
2500464 2503366 We have that. Me and you.
2503367 2506937 Yeah, I know,<br />but that's because we're best friends, dude.
2506938 2508867 She could be a dude,<br />too, dude.
2508873 2510326 Come on.
2510327 2511774 I'm serious!
2511775 2514544 She could actually be<br />a 300-pound dude
2514545 2517715 who lives in his mama's<br />basement in suburban Detroit.
2517716 2519615 And her name is Chuck.
2521285 2523885 Think about that.
2553083 2554484 Whoa, dude,<br />is that Parzival?
2554485 2556215 - Parzival!<br />- Oh, my God, Parzival!
2556220 2559490 Come here, man.<br />Hey, can we get a photo?
2561492 2563832 - Thank you so much!<br />- Dude, you're my hero!
2563833 2565157 Hey, Parzival.
2567398 2569298 Thank you.
2583080 2586180 Get out of town!<br />Buckaroo Banzai?
2586183 2588523 - Huh?<br />- I like it. I liBuckaroo Banzai.
2588524 2590240 - Oh, thanks!<br />- It's great!
2590241 2591957 - Yeah! You look...<br />- Oh.
2591958 2593456 You look awesome!
2593457 2594657 - Thank you.<br />- Wow.
2596393 2598263 A big one, a small one?
2598264 2599462 A big one!
2614645 2618314 Get out of here.
2618315 2620245 What a freak!<br />I thought he was kind of cute.
2620250 2621867 Have you been here before?
2621868 2623485 It's cool, right? I mean...
2623487 2625887 So, what's the plan?
2625889 2628329 Are you gonna kill their avatars?<br />Zero them out?
2628330 2630455 They're both here<br />at The Distracted Globe.
2630461 2632929 I can't talk.
2632930 2634830 The Distracted Globe<br />was one of the first clubs
2634832 2636102 Halliday created in the OASIS.
2636103 2637600 That's common knowledge.
2637601 2639936 But I double-checked
2639937 2642407 and it turns out he started building it<br />right after that moment you showed me.
2642408 2643666 The date with Kira.
2643674 2645759 Right, and she was<br />a serious dancer.
2645760 2647846 Maybe he thought<br />he'd take her here,
2647847 2650675 like on a virtual date.
2650681 2652581 As if that ever works.
2652583 2654083 So Halliday built it for her?
2654084 2655424 But they never made it<br />past the first date.
2655425 2656849 So Halliday's the creator...
2656854 2658187 Who hates his own creation.
2658188 2659588 And the club<br />is the thing he hates.
2659590 2661890 And "A hidden key,<br />a leap not taken"?
2665295 2666755 But people jump off it<br />all night long.
2666764 2668698 But none of those people<br />had the Copper Key,
2668699 2672339 so when we jump off,<br />maybe it's different. Right?
2672340 2673396 WADRight.
2676206 2677676 So we take it together?
2677677 2678905 Sure.
2680844 2682984 We're not clanning up<br />or anything.
2682985 2686080 Of course not. I don't clan.
2687151 2688419 Wait...
2688420 2689688 Whoa!
2691021 2692761 Ow! Whoa.
2697194 2701004 I don't think this is it.<br />No scoreboard, no obstacles.
2701005 2703698 - Maybe a dance challenge?<br />- Huh? Whoa!
2719149 2721149 Old-school!
2744508 2745838 You come prepared?
2745843 2747113 "Prepared"?
2750681 2753249 What kind of haptics<br />you rockin'?
2753250 2755750 You got the gloves and full visor,<br />or a full body?
2759690 2761390 Can you feel this?
2764128 2766228 Um, yeah.
2766230 2769100 I got the X1 haptic bootsuit with<br />the microfiber crotch inlay.
2781378 2784348 My, Parzival,<br />you did come prepared.
2787651 2791254 So, I've been thinking.
2791255 2793885 Maybe it'd be cool if we<br />met up in the real world.
2793891 2795994 No, you'd be disappointed.
2795995 2798159 No, I wouldn't. I like you.
2798160 2800325 You don't even know me.
2800330 2802165 This isn't<br />what I really look like.
2802166 2806166 This isn't my real body,<br />or my real face.
2806170 2807904 I don't care.
2807905 2809465 I wanna know your real name.
2809473 2812983 Stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br />Ah, ha, ha, ha
2822686 2824216 - My name's Wade.<br />- What?
2825689 2827657 - I said my name's...<br />- Stop!
2827658 2830526 Well, Buckaroo blows it.<br />Shocking.
2830527 2833157 Are you crazy?<br />You don't tell anyone who you are.
2833163 2834673 You can't use your real name.
2834674 2835925 You're not just anyone.
2835933 2837633 You don't know me.
2837634 2838974 You don't know anything about me.<br />We've never met.
2838975 2840769 I do know you, Arty.
2842506 2844066 I'm in love with you.
2852549 2854949 - Is this part of the challenge?<br />- No.
2854952 2856192 It's an ambush.
2863627 2866357 IOI, always in the way.
2866363 2868203 Did you hear what I said?<br />I said I'm in love with you.
2868204 2869628 No, you're not.
2871168 2872798 You only know<br />what I want you to know.
2872803 2874713 You only see<br />what I want you to see.
2877574 2879444 That's what<br />you're in love with.
2893257 2894457 Watch out!
2904668 2906138 Pull.
2918715 2921915 Head back! Z!<br />Your armor is running low.
2921919 2923119 I just bought this.
2931128 2932428 Zemeckis Cube.
2932429 2934329 Turns everything<br />back in time 60 seconds.
2938902 2940972 And you waited<br />until now to use it?
2949046 2951206 Wow, you were amazing.
2954318 2956548 This isn't a game, Z.
2957821 2959789 I'm doing this to stop IOI.
2959790 2962290 I'm talking about<br />real-world consequences.
2962292 2963892 People suffering.
2963894 2967282 - Actual life-and-death stuff.<br />- I know. I know...
2967283 2970672 No, you don't know!<br />My dad died in a loyalty center.
2970673 2973836 - He borrowed gear.<br />- He built up debt.
2973837 2977337 He moved in with the promise of<br />working it off, but he never did.
2977341 2979241 IOI just raised<br />his living expenses,
2979242 2980812 then he got sick,<br />and he couldn't afford to get out.
2980813 2983311 And then he died!
2983313 2984680 I'm so sorry, I didn't...
2984681 2986781 No, you don't live<br />in the real world, Z.
2986783 2989853 From what you've told me,<br />I don't think you ever have.
2989854 2992690 You live inside this...<br />This illusion,
2992691 2995527 and I can't afford<br />to let you distract me.
3008138 3010468 How the hell<br />did they get away?
3010474 3012784 Do you want the long version?<br />Your guys suck.
3012785 3014476 They failed<br />to kill his avatar,
3014478 3016708 which, if we're offering<br />constructive criticism,
3016713 3019548 was a lame idea and only<br />would've slowed him down.
3019549 3023889 Whereas my plan, which was cool<br />because I rock, actually worked.
3023890 3025654 He's still on the board.
3025655 3029185 I know that, Nolan.<br />But he won't be for long.
3029192 3031160 I did a search<br />for all the Wades
3031161 3033361 who had recently bought<br />an X1 bootsuit,
3033363 3036573 cross-referenced that with public records,<br />and voila,
3036574 3040636 which is French for...<br />"And then I found out."
3041204 3042972 Ready?
3042973 3047283 The real-world identity<br />of Parzival is Wade Watts.
3048011 3049611 Voila.
3051248 3054148 Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?
3054151 3055921 You really want me<br />to answer that?
3055922 3057486 Well, when you're at war,
3057487 3060517 you need people<br />who are loyal to a fault.
3060524 3062391 People you can count on<br />to get things done.
3062392 3065061 I just get people arrested<br />for not paying their bills.
3065062 3068002 Yeah, 'cause there are some problems<br />that require a physical solution,
3068003 3070568 but there are other times,<br />particularly at war,
3070569 3072267 when you need<br />a different set of rules.
3072269 3074099 - The rules of war.<br />- Exactly.
3074104 3076714 It's too bad my division doesn't<br />operate inside the OASIS.
3076715 3079606 Yeah, but if this war<br />remains in the OASIS,
3079609 3082009 then you can't do anything.
3082012 3084952 So, this is one of those conversations<br />that we're not really having.
3084953 3086718 Well, we've had these kind<br />of conversations before,
3086719 3088446 and look where you are now.
3088452 3090752 You got a seat on the board,<br />head of your own division,
3090754 3094424 a division that will cease to exist if<br />the wrong person wins this contest.
3094425 3097760 F'Nale, a game decides<br />our fate.
3097761 3101601 The only question is,<br />how far are we willing to go to win it?
3103733 3105843 Tell me what you need, Nolan.
3184147 3185717 Whoa.
3189486 3191146 Where am I?
3191154 3193464 IOI Plaza.<br />You're a hologram in the real world.
3194324 3195991 That's a really cool rig.
3195992 3200032 Thank you.<br />It's a brand-new Habashaw, OIR 9400.
3200033 3202030 It looks like<br />a giant hamster ball.
3202032 3206802 You know, if you came to work at IOI,<br />you'd get one of these.
3206803 3208737 I don't clan up.
3208738 3210968 You'd also get your own<br />penthouse apartment in Columbus
3210974 3213242 with the<br />highest-speed connection.
3213243 3218653 In the OASIS, you'd get unlimited weapons,<br />magic items, ships.
3218654 3220516 You want the ship<br />from Defender?
3220517 3223247 You know, the kind that can<br />just jump into hyperspace?
3223253 3225163 You want<br />the Millennium Falcon?
3226056 3227516 You have that?
3227524 3230364 Anything you need<br />to help you find that egg,
3230365 3231730 and then there's the salary.
3232829 3234929 Four million a year.
3234931 3238541 And if you do happen to find that Easter egg,<br />there's a bonus.
3238542 3240835 Twenty-five million dollars.
3246209 3249779 I can see you're using<br />emotion-suppressing software right now,
3249780 3252679 and why wouldn't you?<br />It's smart, not to show your hand.
3258121 3261861 It is a lot of money.<br />I could really use it.
3266796 3269196 But I don't think you and I<br />would have the same plans.
3269199 3272239 Well, I don't know about that.<br />What, for the OASIS?
3272240 3275435 I guess if you're not<br />a John Hughes fan...
3276539 3278274 Of course I am.
3278275 3280905 Because the first thing<br />that I would do
3280910 3284363 is convert all the schools<br />on Ludus to replicas
3284364 3287818 from The Breakfast Club<br />and Ferris Bueller.
3287819 3290986 No way. That's a great idea.
3290987 3293455 Which school,<br />Ridgemont or Faber?
3293456 3296556 Fast Times at Ridgemont High,<br />not John Hughes.
3296559 3299799 It's a trap.<br />Faber College from Animal House.
3299800 3301426 John Hughes didn't direct
3301431 3304431 Fast Times at Ridgemont High<br />or Animal House.
3304434 3307774 Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club,<br />they went to Shermer High School,
3307775 3311311 which is in Shermer, Illinois.<br />I know what you think.
3311312 3313008 You think<br />I'm a corporate asshole,
3313009 3316409 that I don't appreciate<br />pop culture, but...
3316413 3319523 Man, that's not true.<br />You know, when I wanna blow off steam...
3319524 3323486 Drink Tab, plRobotron,<br />listen to Duran Duran.
3323487 3325086 I crack open a Tab.
3325088 3327488 I put on some Duran Duran.<br />I play Robotron.
3327490 3329625 That's why I love the OASIS.
3329626 3332956 'Cause it's just full<br />of all these things, man,
3332962 3334502 that people love. You know?
3342305 3344805 I'm a businessman. I get it.
3344808 3347608 But I gotta do my job.
3347610 3353350 But I didn't ask you here just to<br />help us find the egg, Parzival.
3353351 3357190 I asked you here<br />for what comes after.
3358355 3360055 What would Halliday say?
3361057 3363787 James Halliday is dead.
3365028 3369028 Yeah. He is.
3369032 3373972 All that's left of him is this<br />contest. And you know what?
3373973 3376340 It just seems like he<br />wouldn't want you winning it.
3376341 3378339 A fanboy knows a hater,
3378341 3380411 and I know you've got a whole<br />department of oologists in your ear.
3380412 3382680 So, if you wanna know<br />what I really think...
3382681 3384209 I think you're full of shit.
3389519 3391186 Here's my offer.
3391187 3392687 Your board of directors,<br />you got them in the other ear?
3392689 3394619 Why don't you tell 'em this.
3395759 3398559 If they dump you,<br />I'll consider it.
3398561 3400661 I might say something<br />off the record.
3401664 3403699 I had to make the offer.
3403700 3406700 The board expected it,<br />but I was really hoping you'd say no.
3406703 3410113 Because if anyone's gonna win<br />this competition, it's me.
3410114 3412174 My avatar gets the egg
3412175 3415545 'cause I'm the only one here with<br />the balls to run this place.
3415546 3418045 Wow, you really<br />switched gears there.
3418047 3421117 From fairly reasonable<br />to maniacal overlord.
3421118 3424117 You should be grateful, Wade.
3424120 3427560 You won't be around<br />to endure my maniacal reign.
3427561 3429357 Yeah, that's right.<br />I know who you are.
3429359 3434596 Wade Owen Watts,<br />born August 12, 2027.
3434597 3438597 I also know where you are.<br />Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.
3438601 3441371 You were last seen entering<br />your trailer three days ago.
3441372 3442805 You haven't left since.
3442806 3444136 What are you doing?<br />You can't...
3444140 3445740 With all that's going on<br />in the world,
3445742 3447112 do you really think that<br />anyone's gonna give a damn
3447113 3448644 about an explosion
3448645 3451205 in some ghetto trash<br />rat warren in Columbus?
3451214 3453454 Sorrento, don't do this.<br />I'm not even there!
3453455 3455350 Not for long.
3458988 3461218 Call Alice.
3461224 3462964 Dial Alice.
3489419 3491319 Pick up! Pick up! Alice!
3496359 3498829 This bootsuit's pretty awesome.<br />Thanks for that.
3498830 3500928 Rick! Rick, the place<br />is gonna blow!
3500930 3502430 Rick, is that Wade?
3502432 3504632 - Put Alice on!<br />- Let me talk to him.
3504634 3506644 Don't call here anymore,<br />you got me?
3508137 3510937 I don't wanna hear your voice<br />ever again.
3547911 3551212 Contact Aech, Daito,<br />Sho, and Art3mis.
3551213 3554515 IOI came for me<br />in the real world.
3554517 3557317 They gotta be coming after you,<br />so wherever you are...
3583379 3585496 Sorry about the blindfold.
3585497 3587615 My guys are a little paranoid.
3588418 3590618 Say that again.
3590620 3593020 My guys are a little paranoid.
3594090 3595590 Art3mis?
3597093 3601163 My real name is Samantha,<br />but yeah, I'm Art3mis.
3603032 3605772 Showers are that way,<br />clean clothes, too.
3609038 3613108 Welcome to the rebellion,<br />Wade.
3624253 3629758 That's IOI.<br />So the stacks are over there?
3629759 3632629 We've been living this close<br />to each other the whole time?
3634063 3636231 Next door,
3636232 3640342 around the world, it's...<br />it's all the same in the OASIS.
3642772 3645172 For the record,
3645174 3646675 um...
3646676 3650676 I'm not disappointed.
3650680 3653780 You said I... I would be<br />disappointed when I met you, but...
3653783 3657019 I'm not.
3657020 3659860 I've lived with it my whole life.<br />You don't have to pretend.
3674370 3677170 You have a birthmark, so what?
3678041 3679781 Why would that scare me?
3686983 3689623 Z, if I hurt you,<br />I'm... I'm sorry.
3689624 3691819 No, it's...
3691821 3695121 Wait, did... did you<br />just call me "Z"?
3695124 3697164 - Oh, my God. Did I?<br />- I think you did.
3697165 3699261 Wade, I'm sorry.
3699262 3701358 Yeah, Wade, Z.
3701364 3704674 You can call me whatever you want.<br />And I'll call you Sam.
3704675 3705737 No.
3706803 3708303 Uh, Samantha?
3708304 3710574 Okay. Cool.
3717847 3719617 Wow.
3720416 3722546 It's so much slower here.
3723886 3727256 I mean, the wind,<br />the people...
3729092 3730962 Everything.
3736165 3738595 We forget what it's like<br />to be outside.
3738601 3739671 Yeah.
3742939 3746408 - Uh...<br />- Oh, shit!
3746409 3748079 - I just figured it out.<br />- Figured what out?
3748080 3749507 The second clue.<br />I know what it means.
3755852 3757922 We've been thinking about it<br />too literally.
3757923 3759454 "The leap not taken,"
3759455 3761685 the leap Halliday didn't take,<br />is with Kira.
3761691 3765531 Yeah, but... I mean,<br />he blamed her for breaking up him and Morrow.
3765532 3768458 No. Halliday was madly<br />in love with her.
3768464 3770904 He had a chance with Kira.<br />He had a chance to kiss her, but...
3770905 3772234 He didn't take the leap.
3772235 3775965 Right. So that's where<br />we go next.
3775972 3777542 The place where the leap<br />wasn't taken.
3777543 3779210 Where the date was.
3779211 3781178 At the movies!
3781179 3783145 Hey, Curator.
3783146 3785146 We figured out the second clue.<br />The challenge is here.
3785148 3787215 Halliday kept track of every<br />movie he ever watched,
3787216 3790286 the week and the year he watched it,<br />and how many times.
3790287 3795056 Curator, can we see<br />November 23 to 27, 2025?
3795057 3796887 That's the week<br />he went on the date with Kira.
3801464 3805104 Okay, so our options for that<br />week are The Fly remake.
3805105 3807235 Great flick,<br />terrible date movie.
3807236 3810736 Say Anything...<br />That would make sense.
3810740 3815180 We gotta remember the clue.<br />"A creator who hates his own creation."
3819782 3821750 The Shining!
3821751 3824019 It's Halliday's<br />11th favorite horror film,
3824020 3826420 and it's based on the best-selling<br />book by Stephen King,
3826422 3828022 who hated the movie!
3828024 3829754 Hey! No side chitchat.
3829755 3831486 I think we found it.
3835198 3837928 Are you absolutely sure<br />you want to go here?
3837934 3839801 Absolutely positive.
3839802 3842642 Let's hope<br />you have the belly for it.
3885581 3886751 Look.
3888184 3890352 Ticking clock.
3890353 3893163 Okay, so I'm estimating about
3894190 3896224 five minutes to find the key.
3896225 3897855 Yeah, there are so many keys<br />The Shining, though.
3897860 3900695 Where do we start?
3900696 3904096 I've never seen The Shining.<br />Is it really scary?
3904100 3907553 Uh, I had to watch it<br />through my fingers.
3907554 3911007 Okay, so we got the key<br />from room 237,
3911008 3912907 the keys to the Snowcat,
3912909 3914739 or the keys they give Jack<br />at the beginning of the movie.
3914744 3916374 Well,<br />if it's "the leap not taken,"
3916375 3918005 maybe the key<br />isn't a key at all.
3918014 3919084 I know<br />where the Snowcat keys are!
3919085 3920281 I say we split up.
3920283 3921950 We get all the keys
3921951 3923491 and then we meet back<br />at the Torrances' apartment.
3927423 3929133 Hello, Danny.
3930293 3932093 Come play with us.
3932094 3935364 Little girls, y'all know<br />how to get out of here?
3940303 3941469 Wait, wait!
3941470 3943610 Wait, where's Aech?
3943611 3944936 Wait!
3945975 3947035 Aech!
3947777 3948877 No, no, no, no!
3967063 3968733 Ahh!
3973402 3975042 Ahh!
4008504 4011373 Oh, uh, hi, naked lady.<br />I'm sorry.
4011374 4013484 I didn't mean to interrupt,<br />uh, your bath time.
4013485 4015536 Uh, I know self-care<br />can be important.
4015544 4018714 Uh, but can you do me a favor and tell me,<br />where are all the exits?
4022284 4023852 Huh. Whoa.
4023853 4026221 Okay, am I being punked?
4026222 4028622 'Cause you're likin' me<br />a little way too much.
4030126 4032286 All right, you know what?<br />I'ma go with it.
4045808 4046908 Ahh!
4084180 4085580 Time's running out.
4085581 4087715 Yo, Z, is Art3mis<br />pissed at me?
4087716 4090116 Dude, I'm pissed at you.<br />You've never seen The Shining, have you?
4090119 4091519 You know I hate scary movies!
4091520 4092803 We got the key.
4092804 4094088 Sweet! To room 237!
4094090 4096630 We ain't got no business<br />goin' to room 237!
4096631 4098425 We should stay out!
4098427 4100057 Plus, there was this crazy,<br />naked zombie lady in there.
4100062 4101762 There are no zombies<br />The Shining.
4101764 4103734 Well, maybe it's not supposed<br />to be like the movie.
4103735 4105432 Kira is the key.<br />You're the one who said it.
4105434 4107644 Hey, y'all.<br />I saw a picture of Kira!
4107645 4109766 Huh?
4112241 4113341 Where?
4120282 4124422 It's Kira.<br />"Escape your past."
4124423 4127620 "The leap not taken."
4127623 4129633 Halliday's greatest fear<br />wasn't The Shining
4129634 4132085 or any book or movie.
4132094 4135668 His biggest fear<br />was kissing a girl.
4135669 4139244 That's the leap<br />he couldn't take.
4146175 4147875 The ballroom.
4162458 4164588 Aech, come on.
4168130 4170170 Zombies. Told you.
4171534 4172844 That's her.
4173869 4174639 That's Kira.
4178374 4180375 None of this<br />is in The Shining.
4180376 4182646 Z, look. That's the zombie-circle<br />level in Mayhem Mansion,
4182647 4184275 one of Halliday's first games.
4184280 4186120 The whole Shining trivia<br />is just a diversion.
4187316 4188946 One minute left.
4190352 4191692 How do we get to her?
4191693 4192857 Take the leap.
4192858 4193915 Wait!
4195291 4196431 Whoa!
4202231 4205001 Okay, Mr. Dead Guy.<br />Cool if I lead?
4252615 4254915 Care to dance?
4254917 4258447 Do you know how long I've<br />been waiting for you to ask?
4264260 4266860 Well, well, well.
4266862 4271302 So you found my Jade Key.
4273736 4275696 Imagine that.
4280643 4282283 Thank you.
4286982 4289122 - Kira was a very beautiful...<br />- Go on.
4318113 4321183 One of our oologists saw them<br />enter the media library.
4321184 4322850 She cracked the clue.
4322851 4326661 Now, we just have to win<br />The Shining challenge.
4328991 4331791 Get her off me!<br />Get her off me!
4341203 4345773 Mr. Sorrento, I really think<br />you need to see this.
4347843 4349713 Now Parzival's<br />got the Jade Key.
4360055 4362455 He's alive.
4362458 4365388 I know. I'll get back to you.
4365394 4367464 I got what you're looking for.
4371333 4375603 Freeze. This guy.<br />The one with the lame tattoo.
4379842 4383082 Run him through our database,<br />every IOI drone in Columbus.
4383083 4384578 Find him.
4411440 4413174 Groceries are here.
4413175 4414675 All right. Gluten-O's...
4414676 4415906 "If you know<br />the answer ultimate,
4415911 4418179 "divide it<br />by the number magic,
4418180 4421020 "and what you need, want, and desire<br />will be found in the fortress tragic."
4421021 4423116 "Tragic," that's gotta be<br />Halliday referring to himself.
4423118 4424218 Why?
4424219 4426019 Because he was lonely.
4426021 4427921 He had no one to spend his<br />life with towards the end.
4427923 4430024 Yeah, that's true.
4430025 4431955 The contest has gotta be somehow<br />about connecting with someone.
4431960 4433528 Anyone.
4433529 4435029 He wants the person<br />who cares for the OASIS
4435030 4436730 to be connected<br />with the world.
4436732 4439272 That's what I think<br />he's trying to tell us.
4445207 4446877 Wade.
4448877 4451207 You understand Halliday.
4451213 4454564 You know him<br />better than anyone.
4454565 4457917 It's exactly<br />why I think you'll win.
4457920 4461790 Really? You really think<br />I'm gonna win?
4465661 4467461 Do not move!
4472835 4474335 Target identified!
4475337 4476967 Freeze! Don't move!
4483779 4486419 - This leads right to the alley.<br />- You first.
4486420 4488145 I'm right behind you. Go now!
4489685 4491285 Come on!
4491286 4493786 - Wade, the OASIS needs you.<br />- What?
4493789 4495089 - I'm gonna delay them.<br />- Wait!
4495090 4497525 No, no, no, wait! No, no, no!
4497526 4499756 You'll forgive me<br />for this, I promise.
4508937 4510567 Freeze, freeze, freeze!
4511540 4512610 Don't move!
4517846 4520546 Samantha Evelyn Cook.
4520549 4524219 IOI has purchased and consolidated<br />all of your outstanding debt,
4524220 4527488 currently in excess<br />of 23,000 credits.
4527489 4530359 You will be remanded to the<br />nearest IOI loyalty center
4530360 4531859 until your debt<br />is paid in full,
4531860 4534660 including any interest,<br />processing,
4534663 4537331 or late fees<br />you incur henceforth.
4537332 4539572 Does anybody have eyes?<br />Check down the next street!
4552347 4554547 - "First to the key."<br />- "First to the egg."
4554550 4556850 Wait, what?
4556852 4559856 "Never trust someone you meet<br />in the OASIS."
4559857 4562857 "She might be a 300-pound dude<br />named Chuck..."
4562858 4566128 "Who lives in his mama's<br />basement in suburban Detroit."
4568430 4570364 Aech!
4570365 4573935 Helen. My dad called me "H."<br />It kinda stuck. Let's go!
4583745 4585975 That thing's IDing my van.
4600762 4602832 Come on. They've spotted us.
4603599 4605199 Daito.
4605200 4608040 My real name is Toshiro.<br />Samantha got us a message.
4608041 4609866 She told us to meet you here.
4609871 4611271 Samantha,<br />they took her to the...
4611273 4613307 The loyalty center, I know.
4613308 4616878 Look, in other awesome news,<br />the Sixers found the third challenge.
4616879 4618778 - What?<br />- Just come on, get in!
4618780 4619980 All right. Let's go.
4619982 4622182 Hurry up.<br />Go, go, go. All right.
4633895 4636395 How did IOI find<br />the third challenge so fast?
4636398 4638498 IOI cracked the first<br />three lines of the clue,
4638500 4640167 so they knew it was sector 14
4640168 4641768 but they couldn't figure out<br />"the fortress tragic."
4641770 4644170 So they sent every guide<br />they had into that sector
4644172 4646142 until they found<br />the right fortress.
4647175 4648635 Sho?
4648644 4650954 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />I'm 11, so what?
4650955 4652976 His real name is Xo.
4652981 4655751 But everyone else calls me Sho,<br />no big deal.
4655752 4658519 No. It is a big deal.
4658520 4662090 Sho, you're the world's most<br />badass 11-year-old ever.
4662091 4663157 He knows.
4663158 4665358 Shut up! Let him tell me.
4665360 4666500 Aech!
4669965 4671665 We have to go save Samantha.
4671667 4674035 Well, we can't just<br />go through the doors of IOI.
4674036 4676266 Look, I've been thinkin' about it.<br />I got a better plan.
4676271 4678271 You saw Sorrento's rig, right?
4678273 4680374 Yeah.
4680375 4682805 Let's go after the man himself and<br />make him give Art3mis back to us.
4682811 4684711 But first,<br />I have to know exactly,
4684713 4686723 how much about Sorrento's rig<br />do you remember?
4688116 4690416 Kind of everything.
4704132 4708042 Maintenance,<br />report to loyalty pod 31-B.
4712074 4716714 Security, please report<br />to section 97 for escort.
4737432 4740302 Hey! Newbie, get to work.
4742437 4743567 Get to work.
4749878 4753008 - Work violation.<br />- Work violation.
4754750 4757850 Lay those charges<br />every six feet.
4762858 4765028 Keep it moving!
4766294 4767364 Hey, you!
4769464 4771304 Those are explosives!
4773034 4776244 IOI will not reimburse<br />any lost coin if you zero out.
4776245 4778038 Keep it moving!
4782744 4785784 So what is this challenge,<br />some sort of video game thing?
4785785 4787881 An Atari 2600, sir.
4787883 4791493 And every game ever made for it,<br />thousands of possibilities.
4792254 4793624 Come up!
4798093 4799560 Halliday,
4799561 4801495 this is how<br />you plan to resolve
4801496 4804926 the fate of the world's most<br />important economic resource?
4804933 4806903 - Call me when you're close.<br />- Yes, sir.
4806904 4808502 Go, go! No! Ahh!
4810772 4813942 One minute into Centipede,<br />the ice broke.
4813943 4816010 It has to be Joust!
4816011 4818951 Halliday still holds the world record<br />on the 2600 port of that game.
4818952 4820947 Maybe we just need<br />to beat his high score.
4820949 4823249 Pitfall! One of the only 2600<br />games that still hasn't ended.
4823251 4824691 And how about<br />those Swordquest games?
4824692 4826586 Yes!<br />The Swordquest games.
4826588 4828658 They were created for a contest<br />Atari held with real...
4836331 4839331 i-R0k, how are we doin'?
4839334 4841604 To be honest, I think I need<br />physical therapy because it's not...
4841605 4843673 Is the Orb ready?
4844606 4846336 Um, as you wish.
4850445 4851605 The Orb...
4851613 4853083 Of Osuvox.
4853882 4855049 Ah...
4855050 4857117 How does it work?
4857118 4860558 Has it got, like,<br />a remote or is there a button or something?
4860559 4864185 Nolan, it's a level-99<br />magic artifact,
4864192 4868002 not one of your drones,<br />so it is activated by a magic spell.
4868003 4870096 Would you care<br />to do the honors?
4922017 4923384 Where is she?
4923385 4924685 How'd you get in here?
4924686 4925946 - Art3mis.<br />- Who?
4925954 4930624 Samantha Cook. Where is she?
4930625 4934525 If you wanna talk, we can talk,<br />but you gotta put that gun down.
4934529 4937429 You killed my mom's sister.
4937432 4939066 You think I won't kill you?
4939067 4943267 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Just slow down, okay?
4943271 4946641 That was a corporate decision.<br />It was not personal.
4946642 4947975 Where is she?
4947976 4950306 She's downstairs<br />in the loyalty center!
4950312 4953214 I know she's in<br />the goddamn loyalty center.
4953215 4956118 You're gonna tell me<br />exactly which rig she's in
4956119 4958517 and the access code<br />to contact her.
4959554 4961864 Yeah, that seems appropriate.
4964659 4966729 Start with access code.
4967896 4969695 6, 45, 7, 25.
4969696 4971495 Where's the rig?
4982344 4984578 I think he pissed himself.
4984579 4986579 Good job, Z.<br />We're in his account.
4986581 4988381 So he really doesn't know<br />he's in the OASIS?
4990685 4993285 This is what Sorrento<br />should be seeing,
4993288 4997524 but this... This is what we're<br />making him see.
4997525 5000595 We grabbed him in transit just as<br />he was logging out of the OASIS,
5000596 5003464 so he thinks he's back in his<br />office in the real world.
5003465 5007295 But actually, he's here,<br />in the identical office that Aech built.
5007302 5010004 So, you basically<br />just remotely hacked his rig.
5010005 5013035 A fixed rig like Sorrento's is<br />easy to locate, hard to hack.
5013041 5015781 Unless he's stupid enough to<br />leave his password lying around.
5015782 5017177 Loyalty center, I'm in.
5017178 5019008 All right,<br />let's get to work.
5026721 5029056 - Arty.<br />- Z? Z? Z?
5029057 5030624 Arty, don't say anything.
5030625 5032625 I'm tapped directly<br />into your audio feed.
5034195 5035695 How did you find me?
5035697 5037467 We got his password,<br />hacked Sorrento's rig.
5039034 5041502 Z, I have something<br />to tell you.
5041503 5043513 Not now. I have something to show<br />you that'll get you out of there.
5043514 5046975 The Sixers found the third challenge.<br />It's on Planet Doom.
5046976 5048505 And there's more,<br />they just put a force field
5048510 5050380 around Anorak's Castle.
5054749 5057368 I heard one of the guards calling it<br />"the Orb of Osuvox,"
5057369 5059989 and the only way to take it<br />down is from the inside.
5059990 5063157 She's right.<br />Level-99 artifact,
5063158 5066088 creates a magic-resistant,<br />impenetrable barrier.
5066094 5067828 No way through it.
5067829 5069559 Okay, listen.<br />That's not important right now.
5069564 5070974 What's important is that<br />we get you out of the rig.
5073701 5076071 All right, so I'm looking<br />at a diagram of your rig.
5078740 5080872 If you reach up with your<br />left hand at 11 o'clock,
5080873 5083006 there's some...<br />there's a panel above your head.
5087749 5089917 Yeah, yeah.<br />Yeah, I can feel it.
5089918 5091948 Okay, there should be<br />two release handles.
5091953 5093905 Nine o'clock and three o'clock.<br />Can you feel them?
5093906 5095858 - Yeah, I got it.<br />- Okay, pull it towards you.
5098193 5100094 Okay, inside the panel,<br />there's a lever.
5100095 5102455 Grab it with your right hand<br />and slide it to the left.
5102464 5103974 That should release you.
5111239 5113979 It worked. It worked, I'm out.
5113980 5116105 Loyalty pod 41-F,
5116111 5119111 you are on an authorized<br />break for 10 minutes.
5124385 5127555 Pod 41-F, you are<br />on 10-minute break.
5127556 5129715 Proceed to break area.
5130959 5132257 Wade, are you still there?
5132258 5133557 Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?
5133561 5135761 Where is Sorrento's office?
5135763 5137173 It's in the IOI war room,<br />two levels above where you are now.
5137174 5138965 But that's not the way out.
5138967 5140567 What's his password?
5141836 5143236 Wade, answer me.
5143238 5147178 Okay, it's capital<br />B-0-55-man-69.
5147179 5149575 But, Arty, you need to go.
5149577 5150907 You need to raise an army.
5151779 5153409 An army?
5153414 5155024 Get to Planet Doom,<br />and wait for my signal.
5155025 5156316 What signal?
5156317 5158447 I'm gonna take down<br />that shield.
5158453 5160193 Wait, Arty, wait!<br />You gotta get out of there! Arty!
5168796 5171426 Hey, how much<br />are they paying you?
5171432 5173200 'Cause, man,<br />I got a lot of paper.
5173201 5175601 You know, I can make you,<br />like, a forest.
5175603 5177873 Hey, shut up.
5177874 5179042 Okay.
5201629 5203869 This isn't real,<br />you're tapping my feed.
5203870 5205925 Uh-oh. Guys.
5224419 5227159 F'Nale, they've hacked my rig.<br />They're after the girl.
5227160 5229415 Meet me at loyalty.
5242937 5246537 Pod 41-F,<br />you have exceeded your break time.
5246541 5250311 Report to security or your coin<br />count will be reset to zero.
5259220 5264030 So, she just walks out of here,<br />how does that happen?
5264031 5266285 They're smart. They knew<br />what they were doing.
5266294 5269134 But we know they're in Columbus.<br />And now, all five of them are together.
5269135 5271630 Wait. Wait, we know what?<br />How do we know?
5271633 5275403 We have the make and model of the van.<br />We'll spot them.
5275404 5277537 "We'll spot them"?
5277538 5280778 That sounds like a great<br />inscription for our tombstones.
5280779 5282305 Why didn't you tell me<br />this earlier?
5282310 5283910 It wasn't relevant yet.
5283911 5285311 I need to know where they are.
5285313 5286713 We need to know.<br />We need to find them!
5286714 5289750 They're kids, Nolan.<br />Man the hell up!
5289751 5292951 Do your job, and I'll do mine,<br />unless you wanna take this
5292954 5295024 and go after them yourself.
5299560 5300860 Find them!
5309804 5314484 The Complete Nancy Drew,<br />Kegel Exercises for...
5316077 5318807 Bingo. Okay.
5318813 5321083 "Congratulations,<br />you are the proud owner of the Orb of Osuvox,
5321084 5323016 "a 99th level magic artifact.
5323017 5325847 "Read these instructions before deploying.<br />To turn orb on, off."
5325853 5327354 Off! Yes, off.
5327355 5329685 "Utter spell<br />within 10 feet of orb."
5343604 5345806 Citizens of the OASIS,
5345807 5348637 I am Parzival,<br />first to the key.
5348643 5351683 I'm here talking to all of you now<br />because our future's being threatened
5351684 5355779 by people who will stop at<br />nothing to win this contest.
5355783 5357818 Some of you already know this,
5357819 5361789 and you've lost much more than<br />just your avatars or your weapons.
5361790 5365729 Some have lost their freedom.<br />Some have lost their lives.
5368162 5370964 And now, this.
5370965 5373965 A force field<br />around the third challenge.
5376471 5380481 I only came here to escape the<br />shitty hand that life dealt me.
5380482 5383235 But I stayed,<br />like many of you,
5383244 5388354 because I found something<br />much bigger than just myself.
5388355 5390219 I found a cause.
5391319 5394588 I found my friends.
5394589 5398089 And yes, I know<br />it's kind of a groaner, but...
5399360 5401000 I found love.
5402230 5403864 And I don't wanna lose that
5403865 5406525 to this colossal douchebag,<br />Nolan Sorrento.
5406534 5410737 This guy.<br />Back to work, people.
5410738 5415008 He thinks that we're all too<br />distracted to even notice...
5415009 5419779 Nolan Sorrento thinks<br />that we won't put up a fight.
5419781 5421047 Sir! Sir!
5421048 5422848 This is going out live!
5422850 5424950 The only thing<br />Halliday let this guy do...
5424952 5426622 - It's absolutely everywhere.<br />- ...was get him a cup of coffee.
5426623 5427521 And now, we're supposed<br />to hand him the OASIS?
5435396 5438196 This Parzival...<br />Oh, man.
5442236 5444736 Come on, come on.<br />Give me this thing.
5444739 5445939 Yes, sir.
5446574 5448708 Left arm.
5448709 5451209 - Left arm!<br />- Sir.
5451212 5453212 No, I need the left arm.
5453214 5455554 No, I don't care if...<br />I want it on.
5457385 5460145 He thinks that we won't<br />even put up a fight!
5460154 5462956 Well, I say he's wrong.
5462957 5466757 I say, tell that to the gunter<br />clans in the gold mines of Gygax.
5466761 5470001 Activate the Iron Giant.
5494088 5499158 Ask yourselves,<br />are you willing to zero out for the OASIS?
5499160 5501100 Are you willing to fight?
5502497 5505097 I am Parzival<br />of the High Five.
5505099 5507839 In the name of Art3mis,<br />in the name of Aech,
5507840 5510535 in the name of Daito and Sho,
5510538 5513872 we ask you to join us<br />on Planet Doom.
5513873 5517208 In the name<br />of James Halliday himself,
5517211 5519281 help us save the OASIS.
5574235 5576665 No, no, no, no.
5586747 5589377 "No man is a failure<br />who has friends."
5611472 5614712 Squadron 14, armor up,<br />you're in the lead.
5627588 5631988 One minute into Swordquest,<br />the ice broke.
5631993 5635763 Well, all three Swordquests.<br />What's next?
5635764 5637603 Dark Cavern, Laser Blast.
5637604 5638828 It's Adventure.
5638833 5641101 Released in 1979,<br />for the 2600,
5641102 5643169 Adventure was created by<br />Warren Robinett,
5643170 5645340 who was the first video game designer<br />ever to hide his name. In fact...
5645341 5647409 Try Adventure.
5648609 5650179 Play Adventure.
5702496 5704826 More than a minute,<br />we're still alive.
5704832 5706872 This must be the right game.
5713641 5716481 How long does it last,<br />this orb thing?
5723884 5726653 I'd say about ten...
5726654 5730024 Yeah, about 10 million years,<br />so we should be fine.
5747208 5749056 First to the key!
5749057 5750906 First to the egg!
5750911 5753781 First to the egg!
5782109 5783739 Adventure.
5799627 5801897 What? Come on!
5831458 5833088 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5835196 5837966 The Sixers are in the final challenge.<br />It's an Atari 2600.
5837967 5840195 Are you in the Sixer war room?
5840201 5841801 No, no, no.<br />You gotta get out of there.
5841802 5844102 They're playing Adventure.
5844104 5846506 Adventure, of course!
5846507 5848307 Created by Warren Robinett!
5848309 5849839 He was the first designer to<br />ever hide an Easter egg in...
5849844 5850914 Dude!
5855883 5858723 We're looking for a USPS truck,<br />Ohio plates,
5858724 5861789 a drone spitter, 2036 model.
5880307 5883707 Daito! When are you<br />getting into this fight?
5897658 5898888 I'm out. Inventory's empty.
5898893 5900076 Last clip for me.
5900077 5901260 More weapons!
5901262 5905432 Anti-personnel<br />ordinance cannon!
5908335 5911065 Railgun!
5916210 5917910 Yo, Z!
5917912 5921622 Yo, Z! Try this little guy.
5925119 5926786 Ow!
5926787 5928687 Get rid of it! Get rid of it!
5929757 5931627 It's fucking Chucky!
5936897 5938711 Move! Move!
5938712 5940526 Go, go, go!
5998258 5999828 Mechagodzilla!
6020948 6024448 Daito, we need you!<br />Daito, now!
6024451 6026691 Get to the bridge.<br />Go now, he's distracted.
6026692 6027757 Go, go, go.
6069029 6070099 Z!
6089950 6091750 Arty!
6091752 6093352 Get to the castle!<br />Win the third key before they do!
6105065 6106765 What is that?
6106767 6109197 He's only got 30 seconds<br />before changing back!
6120380 6123320 Daito, abort, abort!<br />You got 10 seconds!
6137931 6139201 First to the egg!
6178605 6179935 Shit, it's her.
6199960 6203296 Arty! Arty!
6203297 6205827 Z! Got to get<br />to the castle!
6211838 6214468 She never left.<br />She's still here.
6217377 6218977 The girl's in the war room.
6257050 6258650 No, no, no.
6272733 6275343 Sho! Hang on!
6294721 6296361 No!
6318779 6320679 Arty, we've got this.<br />You need to log out.
6320681 6323451 If the game is Adventure,<br />why haven't they won yet?
6323452 6325318 I don't know. Arty, Arty.
6325319 6327319 I'm serious, Sorrento's crazy.<br />He'll kill you.
6329489 6331373 What are you looking at?
6331374 6333258 There's nothing over there.
6334261 6335331 You're in trouble, aren't you?
6338699 6342269 Samantha, you know I love you.
6342270 6343636 Not the time, Z.
6343637 6345204 I can handle the challenge,
6345205 6348304 but I can't let you get hurt<br />in the real world.
6348305 6351405 Get out of IOI,<br />and meet us at River South.
6357718 6359448 Wade, no.
6359453 6361323 You'll forgive me<br />for this, I promise.
6361324 6362521 Wade, no, no, no.
6372566 6376036 Get it together, Sixer.<br />Back to respawn.
6376037 6377366 Let's go, move.
6377371 6378641 You're in.
6396857 6399487 Holy hand grenade!<br />How much did that cost?
6399493 6402003 Less than<br />it's gonna cost them.
6403063 6404633 What is that?
6414941 6417681 Sir, the gunters<br />are approaching the challenge.
6417682 6419677 - i-R0k?<br />- In position, sir.
6419679 6420946 Prepare my rig.
6420947 6423647 The ice is holding.<br />Still going.
6433927 6435257 Wait.
6435262 6436462 He's trying to win.
6439766 6442366 Yeah! I won.
6445806 6447766 He lost.
6447774 6449844 Not Adventure.
6453914 6458384 Everyone who wins loses.
6458385 6461715 It's not about winning.<br />It's about playing.
6462789 6465289 Remember<br />Halliday's announcement.
6465292 6467732 The keys are invisible,<br />and they're hidden in a dark room
6467733 6470296 that's at the center<br />of a maze.
6470297 6473967 Well, there's a secret in Adventure,<br />and you don't find it by winning.
6473968 6476897 You find it by wandering<br />around in a dark room.
6476903 6478604 Until you get<br />to the invisible dot.
6478605 6480305 It's pretty easy<br />if you know what you're doing.
6480307 6481637 Really?
6482476 6484846 Let me finish it for you.
6488815 6490745 It's your last chance, Wade.
6490750 6493650 Last chance. Give me the key.
6493653 6498693 I give you 50 million<br />in your account right now.
6498694 6500532 Why the hell<br />would I ever do that?
6502262 6504179 Dude!<br />That's the Cataclyst.
6504180 6506097 Now, personally, I don't care.
6506099 6507829 I'd just as soon never set<br />foot in the OASIS again,
6507834 6510002 let alone have to deal<br />with any of this absurdity.
6510003 6515207 But I know how important Halliday's<br />competition is to you, so...
6515208 6519648 I will never let the future of the OASIS<br />rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.
6519649 6523676 Well, that's fine.<br />Three easy steps. One.
6523683 6526153 Wait, I thought you were bluffing.<br />You know that kills all of us, right?
6526154 6528222 I've got 10 years' worth<br />of shit inside of me.
6528223 6529889 Last chance. Two.
6529890 6531290 I'm not goin' out like that.
6531291 6532825 That's a camper move.
6532826 6533956 You don't even know<br />how to activate an orb.
6546139 6547269 Yeah, I felt those.
6548642 6550782 But this is my world,<br />Sorrento.
6554681 6555981 Hadouken!
6575535 6578165 - No, no, no!<br />- Step three.
6578171 6579941 No, no, no!
6637397 6639127 Get me out of this thing.
6653513 6654880 Uh...
6654881 6656248 Guys?
6662789 6664689 Z. He's still alive!
6672532 6674402 Extra life.
6676770 6678240 Thanks, Curator.
6681041 6682241 Hold on.
6689949 6692549 Live feed<br />in all OASIS channels.
6692552 6695162 Halliday's letting everyone<br />watch the end of the contest.
6695163 6696515 That's so Halliday.
6696523 6698793 God damn it,<br />we tried Adventure.
6698794 6700359 No, we tried to win it.
6700360 6702828 But the hidden room isn't<br />at the end of the game.
6702829 6705399 You've gotta go straight to the<br />invisible dot at the start.
6719012 6720979 Is that her?
6720980 6724380 Red hair, IOI uniform,<br />doesn't know what planet she's on?
6724384 6725494 That's her.
6737263 6740073 I'm Toshiro.<br />You know me as Daito.
6742902 6744002 Oh.
6746706 6748166 Hey, Arty.
6750176 6754346 Yeah, I know. Not what<br />you were expecting, huh?
6754347 6758947 Yeah, I wasn't expecting<br />a late '30s-model postal van.
6760954 6763122 Wade?
6763123 6765093 Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.<br />How are you still playing?
6765094 6767661 Extra life, long story.<br />Sorry I shot you.
6769929 6771559 Sho?
6771564 6774099 What? Do I have to wear<br />a sign saying,
6774100 6777240 "I am 11 years old, shoot me first"?<br />No, thanks.
6777241 6779567 - Dude, give me a hug.<br />- Ninjas don't hug!
6779572 6781142 All right, everybody,<br />hold on to somethin'.
6802896 6804226 Got you.
6807934 6809704 Come on, Nolan. Pick up.
6811838 6814668 F'Nale, tell me<br />something good.
6814674 6817244 I've got a drone on their tail.<br />I'm close.
6817245 6818510 Send me coordinates.
6818511 6820751 Maybe you should<br />leave this to me, Nolan.
6822515 6825185 Nolan? Nolan.
6826586 6827746 Out.
6836663 6839203 Give me that.
6842836 6844596 What's goin' on out there?
6848942 6851442 - The game is over for them.<br />- What are they watching?
6853880 6856250 The final key!<br />It's being broadcast.
6858284 6859952 You see,
6859953 6862838 Warren Robinett<br />was proud of Adventure.
6862839 6865724 He wanted people to know<br />who was behind it.
6865725 6868455 That's why he created<br />the first digital Easter egg
6868461 6871161 and to find it,<br />you didn't even have to win.
6871164 6875344 You just had to blindly play,<br />searching around
6875345 6879465 in rooms for an invisible dot.
6879472 6882040 You took the dot<br />back to the main screen
6882041 6886681 and that's when you found the first<br />Easter egg ever put in a video game.
6886682 6887979 The creator's name.
6912605 6914705 What's going on, man?<br />I can't see shit.
6914707 6916137 Parzival just got<br />the Crystal Key!
6931391 6933161 Do you want it or not?
6936429 6938529 Aech,<br />what the hell's going on?
6938531 6940531 Just practicing Mario Kart.<br />What do you think?
6940533 6942643 IOI's trying to kill us, man!
6956816 6959146 Everyone watching,<br />if you're in the Columbus stacks,
6959152 6961219 this is Parzival.
6961220 6963420 My real-world name is Wade Watts,<br />and we're gonna need your help.
6963423 6964993 Aech, head for the stacks!
6964994 6967261 Okay, hold on!
6991918 6993918 Stick the key in,<br />how hard is it?
6999592 7000832 Come on.
7008201 7010271 Yeah! Yes!
7026452 7027722 That's it?
7028488 7030355 Yeah, that's it.
7030356 7034856 Now, you just sign these papers,<br />and the OASIS is yours.
7034861 7039171 You will be<br />its sole proprietor.
7039172 7040695 That ain't so bad, is it?
7062488 7063588 I'm gonna need a second.
7092218 7094848 This is wrong.
7094854 7097794 This pen, this contract.
7100960 7102730 This is the moment<br />that Halliday made Morrow
7102731 7105297 sign over his shares<br />in Gregarious.
7105298 7107968 That was the biggest mistake<br />of his life.
7107969 7110167 He knew that.
7111871 7113971 This can't be the end.
7115108 7116878 It's a test.
7121380 7124120 I won't make<br />the same mistake you did.
7129755 7131685 Oh, good.
7134327 7137827 I just needed to be sure.
7151777 7154047 This is where you grew up.
7163256 7166186 Oh, that's just me<br />a long time ago.
7166192 7169802 I like to have him around<br />from time to time.
7169803 7172095 Hey, I have<br />to show you something.
7172098 7173798 This, uh... Come on.
7173799 7175634 This is the button.
7175635 7178935 If you push it,<br />the whole simulation shuts down
7178938 7182538 and a tapeworm program will<br />erase all of the backup servers.
7182542 7186312 So you now have the power<br />to turn the OASIS off forever.
7186313 7187952 Do you understand?
7193319 7194486 Yeah,
7194487 7196454 try not to accidentally erase
7196455 7199185 the whole of the OASIS<br />on your first day.
7208501 7210271 The stacks are straight ahead!
7226018 7228987 Well, I expect you have to go.<br />I know I do.
7228988 7231518 So, now is the time for you<br />to receive your prize
7231524 7234059 because you won<br />all three keys.
7234060 7238760 Once you take this egg,<br />the game will be over.
7238764 7241904 The egg, the egg...
7249275 7251705 We know what you did here.
7251711 7255081 You turn around and walk out<br />of here while you still can.
7267627 7270195 I created the OASIS
7270196 7274926 because I never felt at home<br />in the real world.
7274934 7279414 I just didn't know how to<br />connect with the people there.
7279415 7282905 I was afraid<br />for all of my life.
7282908 7285708 Right up until the day<br />I knew my life was ending.
7291284 7296371 Now, that... That was when<br />I realized that,
7296372 7301459 as terrifying and painful<br />as reality can be,
7302261 7306331 it's also the only place
7307933 7309643 that you can get<br />a decent meal.
7316242 7317812 Because
7319478 7321148 reality
7326252 7327919 is real.
7327920 7329690 You understand<br />what I'm saying?
7331457 7334157 Yes. Yes, I do.
7343869 7345199 He did it.
7346839 7348369 He got the egg.
7349141 7350441 Hooray.
7351544 7353254 - No!<br />- No! Please!
7386746 7388076 Hold it!
7390082 7393852 Drop the gun! Now!<br />On the ground!
7393853 7396593 Turn around!<br />Hands on your head.
7396594 7398219 Walk back towards me.
7413873 7419113 Mr. Halliday.<br />Something I don't understand.
7419114 7421911 You're not an avatar, are you?
7422448 7424148 No.
7425618 7427688 Is Halliday really dead?
7429288 7430958 Yes.
7436629 7438459 Then what are you?
7441634 7443674 Goodbye, Parzival.
7445271 7446441 Thanks.
7447907 7450177 Thanks for playing my game.
7479138 7480508 Wade?
7481841 7483781 - Ogden Morrow?<br />- Ogden Morrow?
7483782 7485944 You can call me "Og."
7485945 7488905 Now, there are some people out here<br />that would very much like to meet you.
7488914 7492150 Wow, this is incredible.
7492151 7494991 It's an honor to meet you,<br />Og, but I...
7499124 7500864 There's something<br />I need to do first.
7504697 7506527 I'm not like Halliday.
7510202 7512342 I'm taking the leap.
7528721 7531856 We're looking for Wade Watts.
7531857 7534127 We need you to make a statement<br />about the clip you sent in
7534128 7536326 of Nolan Sorrento's<br />confession.
7536328 7539058 Uh, that was me.
7539064 7541704 What? I record everything<br />in my workshop.
7548040 7549980 Help me out of this.
7556248 7558548 Who are you guys?
7558551 7562921 The people you need right now, lawyers.<br />From Gregarious Games.
7565691 7567391 They want<br />your signature, Wade.
7575267 7577336 I'm splitting it with my clan.
7577337 7579406 We're gonna<br />run things together.
7583876 7586076 That's a good choice.
7613872 7617482 F'Nale, listen to me<br />very carefully.
7626118 7629048 Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,
7629054 7630555 how'd you get here so fast?
7630556 7633256 I flew from the stars<br />on my magic sleigh.
7633258 7635827 Everyone's been watching.
7635828 7639128 Of course, I've been watching<br />a little closer than most.
7643102 7645002 You?
7645004 7646314 You're the Curator?
7649975 7653444 Well played, Parzival.
7653445 7655475 Jim told me nothing<br />about the contest,
7655481 7658851 so there was no rule about me<br />losing a bet to a smart kid.
7658852 7661486 Not that you needed my help.
7661487 7665817 You figured out that Kira<br />was the key on your own.
7665824 7668534 Yeah, but...<br />Kira wasn't the key.
7669795 7671725 It was you, Mr. Morrow.
7673799 7675629 You were the Rosebud.
7675634 7677904 And Halliday's<br />biggest regret was
7679538 7681208 losing his only friend.
7685377 7687707 You know,<br />Jim used to say the OASIS
7687713 7690253 was never supposed to be<br />a one-player game.
7693886 7696686 Now, who do we have here?
7696689 7699357 Oh. Well, look who it is.
7699358 7701125 It's my heroes, the High Five.
7701126 7702925 - You must be Art3mis.<br />- Samantha.
7702926 7704725 The High Five<br />took over the OASIS,
7704730 7706630 and the first thing we did
7706632 7709872 was sign Ogden Morrow to<br />a non-exclusive consultancy.
7709873 7712868 The salary, per his demand,
7712871 7716141 was 25 cents. One quarter.
7719344 7722280 With his guidance,<br />our second move was to ban
7722281 7725498 any loyalty centers<br />from accessing the OASIS.
7725499 7728717 IOI had no choice.<br />They shut 'em all down.
7731423 7734425 The third thing we did<br />wasn't as popular.
7734426 7738426 We closed the OASIS<br />on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
7738430 7740930 I know, it sounds<br />like a weird move,
7740933 7743903 but people need to spend<br />more time in the real world.
7745504 7748573 'Cause, like Halliday said,
7748574 7752984 reality is the only thing<br />that's real.
