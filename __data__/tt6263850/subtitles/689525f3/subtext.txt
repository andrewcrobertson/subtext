37470 38644 Right?
38668 42484 I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited to be here.<br />It's been a while.
42508 43385 You know, for a long time,
43409 45619 I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.
45643 46388 Disney bought Fox,
46412 48457 there was a whole boring rights issue,
48481 49259 blabbity-blabbity-blah.
49283 51822 But then, it turned out, they wanted me.
51846 55233 The one guy who shouldn't<br />even have his own movie,
55257 56596 much less a franchise.
56620 59632 Marvel's so stupid.
59656 61602 Look, we know the title of this thing.
61626 63670 So, I know what you're wondering.
63694 64538 How are we gonna do this
64562 68345 without dishonoring Logan's memory?
68369 70436 And I'll tell you how.
70634 71634 We're not.
72934 75616 I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
75640 77111 Wolverine is not dead.
77135 81226 Sure, it made for a perfect<br />ending to a very sad story.
81250 81984 But that's not how
82008 84086 regenerative healing factors work.
84110 85295 You think I wanna be out here
85319 87121 in beautiful downtown North Dakota,
87145 90532 digging up the one and only<br />Wolverine? No, thank you.
90556 93304 But the fate of<br />my entire world is at stake.
93328 95130 He may not be living his best life,
95154 97517 but he sure as hell ain't
97541 99927 dead.
104437 105867 Bingo.
106307 107704 Yahtzee.
110201 113842 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
117109 118394 Damn it!
118418 122246 Son of a bitch!
123456 124588 You...
126625 129537 Christ. Motherfucker!
129561 131375 My world is fuck...
131399 134576 That was weird.
134600 135600 I'm much calmer now.
137031 139943 Look, I'm not a man of science.
139967 143476 But you seem incredibly passed away.
146357 147357 But it's good to see ya.
147381 151296 I gotta be honest,<br />I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.
151320 152219 You and me getting into it.
152243 156191 Deadpool and Wolverine<br />just fuckin' shit up.
156215 160096 Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...
160120 161536 the residuals?
161560 162669 "G'day, mate."
162693 164936 "There's nothing that'll<br />bring me back to life faster"
164960 167575 "than a big bag of Marvel cash."
167599 171206 Me too, Hugh.
171230 173581 But, no. No, no, no.
173605 178213 You had to get all noble and die for real.
178237 180546 Goddamn it!
181008 184385 I could really use your help right now.
194725 196340 Wait!
196364 198442 I'm warning you, I'm not alone.
198466 200036 Wade Winston Wilson,
200060 203139 you are under arrest by<br />the Time Variance Authority...
203163 204007 Oof.
204031 205271 ...for too many crimes to list.
205295 206397 Come out...
206421 207861 ...and we'll extend you the courtesy
207885 210520 - of taking you in one piece.<br />- Death by day-player.
210544 211619 Last chance.
211643 212389 Throw out your weapons
212413 214523 and come out peacefully.
214547 216658 I'm not gonna give you my weapons,
216682 219253 but I promise not to use them.
219277 221739 There are two hundred and six<br />bones in the human body.
221763 224249 Two hundred and seven<br />if I'm watching Gossip Girl.

400349 403637 I am soaking wet right now.
405364 408261 To be clear, I'm not proud of any of this.
408285 411182 The wanton violence,<br />the whiff of necrophilia.
411206 412215 It isn't who I am.
412239 414020 It isn't who I wanna be.
414044 414690 Who I wanna be?
414714 416924 Well, to help you understand that,
416948 417825 I've gotta take you back.
417849 420323 A little joyride I took<br />through space and time,
420347 423591 to the day that changed everything.
435262 436943 I can't believe I'm finally here.
436967 440806 I've waited for this moment for so long.
441169 444347 Thank you, sir, for seeing me.
444371 446381 I... I firmly believe
446405 448202 that my services could be of
448226 450023 great use to your organization.
450047 450627 Now, I know
450651 452894 I was caught smashturbating<br />in the lobby of Stark Tower,
452918 454798 - but I can assure you that...<br />- Smashturbating?
454822 456142 I'm sorry, what... what was that?
456166 459527 No, I'm sorry. That...<br />That's when you get those toy,
459551 460230 Hulk hands, right?
460254 462815 And then you just, you look<br />down, and you just...
462839 465400 you brace yourself,<br />and you ravage the midsection.
465424 467584 - Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.<br />- I get it. Okay, thank you.
467608 469405 - The picture's painted.<br />- You get the gist.
469429 472111 Uh, what exactly brings you here today?
472135 475576 Why am I... Wow. Okay. Uh...
475600 476477 I... I care.
476501 480604 I know I turn everything<br />into a joke, but I...
481473 485345 I care, and I wanna use that feeling...
485510 487274 for something important.
487298 489084 I... I wanna matter.
491549 494585 I need to show my girl that I matter.
495431 496431 And...
496455 498038 You know, I feel like I'm wasting
498062 498774 the good stuff here.
498798 500469 Is the man not gonna be joining us?
500493 501238 - The man?<br />- Yeah.
501262 503075 I should save this if he's gonna...
503099 505683 Uh, as far as you're concerned<br />right now, I'm the man.
505707 507046 - No.<br />- The man is me.
507070 510314 I am the man in this circumstance.
510338 511512 - Mm.<br />- He doesn't do
511536 513218 this kind of thing anymore.
513242 513987 - Cameos?<br />- Meetings.
514011 516122 - Meetings.<br />- Entry-level meetings.
516146 516726 Entry-level?
516750 518486 Aren't you the chauffeur...
518510 520896 - maybe?<br />- I... Common misconception.
520920 522491 - Okay.<br />- I did begin my career
522515 524063 as Mr. Stark's driver.
524087 525287 - Okay.<br />- Quickly pivoted to...
525311 526831 - Chauffeur.<br />- ...the Head of Security.
526855 528596 The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.
528620 531433 And why I am vetting your resume.
531457 533975 You seem to have left out<br />whether or not you had
533999 536109 any experience as a member of a team.
536133 536845 Could you maybe add
536869 538229 a little bit of perspective there?
538253 540575 Oh. No, yes, of course.<br />I was Special Forces...
540599 541928 - Okay.<br />- ...but I was...
541952 543072 Mainly, I was team leader...
543096 544216 founder, really, of X-Force.
544240 546416 Sadly, they... they all<br />perished in action though.
546440 547720 Oh. How exactly did that happen?
547744 549550 Well, the police say gravity, but if...
549574 551520 Just between us, they didn't test well
551544 553274 - in the focus group.<br />- I see.
553298 555029 - Particularly Cable.<br />- X-Force.
555053 555732 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
555756 557276 Look, I can see this isn't going well.
557300 559057 Please stop writing. Look, I... I...
559081 561223 I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.
562125 564622 I wanna be an Avenger.
565359 567238 Why do you wanna be an Avenger?
567262 569010 Look around you. I mean, they're the...
569034 570841 they're the best of the best.
570865 572673 And... And what they do matters.
572697 574575 I need to be an Avenger.
574599 577414 Sir, my girl has kinda had it<br />with my shtick,
577438 578315 and I... if I don't, you know,
578339 580867 turn things around and<br />do something with my "gifts,"
580891 583420 I don't think it's gonna<br />really work out for me,
583444 585454 and I wouldn't blame her.
585478 590361 Avengers are a very unique<br />group of superheroes
590385 591097 that stand for something
591121 594232 more than just fighting<br />and wearing costumes.
594256 597368 I mean, people look up to us.<br />Kids look up to us.
597392 598368 - They...<br />- I'm sorry. "Us"?
598392 601174 I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.
601198 602438 Avengers-adjacent, technically.
602462 603742 Oh, wow. What's your superpower?
603766 606751 Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.
606775 607344 That was cruel.
607368 610183 I lash out when I'm nervous.<br />Won't happen again.
610207 611646 - Let's cut to the chase.<br />- Please.
611670 612888 You just said moments ago
612912 616354 that you wanted to be<br />an Avenger because
616378 617520 you need it.
617544 618685 Yes, sir, I do.
618709 620490 But the Avengers don't do the job
620514 621556 because they need it.
621580 624825 They do the job<br />because people need them.
625188 627520 Do you see the distinction?
628653 630721 Yes, sir.
630963 632006 Please, Mr. Hogan.
632030 633590 I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
633614 636748 like an annoying one-trick pony.
638971 640443 All right.
640467 642049 Oh, my God, you're standing.
642073 644217 Yeah, now's the time that we stand.
644241 644678 Damn it.
644702 646515 Now, the problem might be that you're
646539 648352 reaching a little... little too high.
648376 651092 Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.
651116 652556 Right? I think you got a good heart.
652580 654061 I believe what you're saying.
654085 656196 But not everybody's<br />the world-saving type.
656220 658533 I'm not, and I'm happy.
658557 660894 Right? I found my place.
661224 663136 Find your place.
663160 665171 All right? Get back out there.
665195 667273 - We'll keep an eye on you.<br />- Okay.
667297 668792 Good luck.
668968 671661 - Mm. Mm-hmm.<br />- Mm-hmm.
671685 674379 Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.
674403 676701 Rejection makes me hungy.
676976 678652 - No, no. Please.<br />- No?
678676 680352 - Yeah, no, no, no.<br />- Okay.
680376 682179 Okay, thank you.
683081 685027 You know what they say.
685051 687316 When one door closes,
687514 689999 your locker at work opens.
698998 700641 Now let's go sell some certified
700665 702331 pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...
704036 708502 Technically, the...<br />the Carnival's not a minivan.
708710 709710 It's an MPV.
709734 712318 So how does the Kia compare<br />to the Honda Odyssey?
712342 713822 The Odyssey? That's a great question.
713846 715650 Um, it doesn't fucking suck.
715674 718192 You know, you can answer<br />the question without swearing.
718216 721162 I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't...<br />I don't have kids.
721186 723664 Not that I haven't dreamt of that,
723688 726190 but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.
728324 729524 You'll get 'em next time, pal.
729548 730632 - Yeah.<br />- And look,
730656 732216 you can always go back<br />to superhero-ing.
732240 734774 I mean, I know I'd like<br />to see you back in the suit.
734798 737408 I don't keep it in my locker<br />so that I can wear it.
737432 740346 I keep it in my locker in case<br />we need to saddle up again.
740370 744218 Hey, hey, hey.<br />What is that doing in there?
744242 745836 I'm done.
747112 748551 I'm done.
748575 750603 And I'm fine with being done.
750627 752655 Look, is sales the best match?
752679 753292 Probably not.
753316 757231 Is this the life that I always<br />imagined for myself? Fuck no.
757255 761004 But this is the right fit<br />for me, Sugar Bear, it is.
761028 762367 Okay, Mr. Wilson.
762391 764188 I'm just saying, once a month,
764212 766008 we could go on a little mission.
766032 769177 We're human beings. We crave purpose.
769201 770474 After all, we're Deadpool.
770498 773412 Please stop saying that.<br />We're not Deadpool.
773436 775281 I'm not even Deadpool anymore.
775305 778582 Well, if you're gonna have<br />a midlife crisis, go big.
778606 780253 A few years ago, a friend of mine
780277 783306 got his nipples pierced<br />with a titanium chain
783330 786382 that goes down and attaches<br />to his Van Johnson.
789990 792266 Are... Are you feeling grumplestiltskin
792290 794489 'cause it's your birthday?
795622 797261 What?
797525 798922 No.
799560 801166 No.
803201 806026 Surprise!
806050 808899 Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.
809108 809678 Get in here.
809702 812187 If this were six years ago,<br />you'd all be dead.
812211 814123 So then, he gets out of the cab,
814147 815123 and you will not believe it.
815147 817004 I turn around, and what do I find?
817028 818886 - AirPods. His AirPods.<br />- His AirPods!
818910 819820 - Come on.<br />- Crazy story.
819844 823716 - Every time. Come on.<br />- Every single time.
825091 826316 Make any sales today?
826340 827564 You know I didn't.
827588 829468 Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy
829492 831073 or whatever it is that you do?
831097 833043 Our rent's due in three days, Wade.
833067 834357 I can't keep carrying you.
834381 835671 Relax. I have the money.
835695 838609 I sold some old<br />blood pressure medication
838633 839543 I found lying around.
839567 841149 You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?
841173 843053 I'm not the one<br />dousing everything in salt,
843077 845682 - motherfucker.<br />- I pray every day
845706 847485 that fire finds your body
847509 849504 and finishes the job God didn't have
849528 851448 - the nuts to do.<br />- That's hurtful.
851472 853393 If you could hear the look on my face,
853417 854861 you'd smell how sad I am.
854885 856596 You watched anything good?
856620 858332 Great British Bake Off.
858356 858958 Oh, goddamn.
858982 861582 That show stood between me<br />and suicide for 10 years.
861606 864206 Those are my feelings on<br />abortion, religious freedom,
864230 866372 animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines,
866396 869155 free-market capitalism,<br />global climate change.
869179 871939 Yeah, duh-duh-duh.<br />No, no speaking lines, Buck.
871963 874161 - Hi, Yukio.<br />- Hi, Wade.
874185 876382 Nice fake o'clock shadow.
876406 879220 It's a summer balayage.<br />From the French.
879244 883291 It's meant to mimic<br />the natural highlights of the sun.
883315 885326 - It's a toupee.<br />- It's a hair system.
885350 888032 I love your hair system, Wade.
888056 889197 Thank you. Heh.
889221 889956 Wanna do some cocaine?
889980 893433 Hey, cocaine is the one thing<br />that Feige said is off limits.
893457 895071 What about Bolivian marching powder?
895095 897371 They know all the slang terms.<br />They have a list.
897395 899670 - Even snowboarding?<br />- Even disco dust.
899694 900439 White girl interrupted?
900463 901863 - Even Forrest Bump.<br />- Booger sugar?
901887 903367 I wouldn't even try powdered go nuts.
903391 908050 - Do you wanna build a snowman?<br />- Yes. But I can't.
908966 910086 Pull here.
910110 911143 - Here?<br />- Yeah.
912112 914807 - What happened?<br />- That's the fun part.
915511 917061 Thanks for coming.
917085 918094 Yeah.
918118 919128 How's work?
919152 921220 Oh, I got a promotion.
921583 922021 No way.
922045 925927 Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle<br />management, but I'm happy.
925951 927589 That's great.
928359 930823 - You, uh, seeing anyone?<br />- How about you?
931329 933142 Um... Yeah.
933166 936080 A guy from work. Dermot.
936104 937003 Dermot.
937027 938543 - He's kind.<br />- Good.
938567 940083 Likes to go hiking.
940107 942063 Hasn't gotten me shot yet.
942087 944067 Well, it's the early days.
947576 950050 What about you? You seeing anyone?
950074 950654 Mm...
950678 952459 No, no, I live<br />in a one-bedroom apartment.
952483 954814 I share a bed with Blind Al.
955551 957430 Okay.
957454 959753 - All right.<br />- All right.
960050 962716 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
962740 965562 - Speech! Speech!<br />- Yes!
965586 968432 All right. Okay, okay, okay. Uh...
968465 969442 Birthdays.
969466 971313 Boy, every spin around the moon
971337 972181 is a new adventure indeed.
972205 975439 - Sun, dumb-ass.<br />- Okay, round-earther.
975736 978386 - Where was I?<br />- The adventure of life.
978410 979078 Right. Um...
979102 980816 It's been a challenging few years.
980840 982554 Haven't seen you guys in a while.
982578 985040 Been through a lot, uh, change of life.
985064 987527 - Menopause?<br />- Bitch, are you improv-ing?
987551 989297 - Mm-mm.<br />- Sorry.
989321 991201 I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.
991225 994194 - It's okay.<br />- Yeah.
994590 996238 But I'm happy.
996262 997462 You know, and that's... that's
997486 999824 because of each and every one of you.
999848 1002019 I guess, what I'm trying to say is
1002043 1004214 how proud I am, how grateful I am
1004238 1005280 to be standing in a room
1005304 1008736 with every single person I love.
1013642 1016183 I'm the luckiest man alive.
1017788 1018788 Make a wish, buddy.
1018812 1021990 Ten-four, good buddy.
1022014 1023652 Going down.
1029338 1030338 Wade Wilson?
1030362 1031438 Oh, yeah. Dancers.
1031462 1033209 Dopinder must have ordered you.
1033233 1035509 Are those supposed<br />to be cop costumes?
1035533 1036377 Never mind.
1036401 1039073 Take your clothes off<br />but leave the helmets.
1039097 1040662 And this isn't Pretty Woman.
1040686 1042251 We're kissing. All right?
1042275 1045288 What song do you guys<br />normally dance to?
1045312 1048687 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1048711 1049871 Is that supposed to be scary?
1049895 1052152 Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.
1052176 1053604 But it is for Disney.
1053628 1055055 Ah, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
1055079 1057074 Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,
1057098 1059255 so we're gonna take things real slow.
1059279 1061436 And I want some crazy eye contact.
1061460 1062095 Not you. You.
1062119 1064439 Can't see your eyes through the mask,<br />but I can feel them.
1064463 1066000 We're gonna move on down the hallway
1066024 1068135 so we can spare a cleanup<br />on aisle asshole.
1068159 1070038 How's everyone feel about this plan?
1070062 1070741 I don't like you.
1070765 1073074 Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.
1073098 1075308 And we're gonna do it angry.
1093051 1094888 Mr. Wilson...
1095262 1098605 you appear to have soiled<br />yourself while unconscious.
1098629 1101509 I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?
1101533 1103070 I go by the name of Paradox.
1103094 1107141 Mr. Paradox. And you're<br />sitting here at the TVA.
1107165 1109076 The Time Variance Authority.
1109100 1111111 We're really a watchdog organization,
1111135 1114049 except we're more lighthearted<br />than that sounds,
1114073 1117525 with a sort of throwback, ironic twist.
1117549 1119428 And we're in charge of defending
1119452 1121330 what's known as the Sacred Timeline.
1121354 1125060 Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton<br />of exposition for a threequel.
1125084 1127216 Is this because<br />I used Cable's time machine?
1127240 1129372 Brought a couple of people back to life,
1129396 1130130 then I destroyed it.
1130154 1131474 - That was a long time ago.<br />- Yes,
1131498 1134222 we're aware of your abuse<br />of your timeline.
1134246 1137132 And you were so abusive of it.
1137156 1140042 Uh, no, it has nothing to do with that.
1140066 1141704 Walk with me.
1146346 1149557 I brought you here,<br />Mr. Wilson, to tell you
1149581 1151052 that you're special.
1151076 1154463 In fact, you've been chosen<br />for a higher purpose,
1154487 1157026 a purpose unclear even to me.
1157050 1158763 But one that could
1158787 1161436 save the entire Sacred Timeline
1161460 1164407 from a possibly grisly fate<br />sometime in the future,
1164431 1167707 which may very well need to be...
1167731 1169268 avenged.
1169292 1171701 This Sacred Timeline,
1171965 1174648 I assume I'm going to marvel
1174672 1176176 at how
1176200 1177749 cinematic it feels?
1177773 1179322 Gratuitous cameos,
1179346 1182183 indiscriminate use of<br />Variants, the whole package?
1182207 1184043 Well, you tell me.
1191424 1192821 Cap!
1199091 1201652 You are no longer lost, Wade.
1201676 1204237 You can be a hero among heroes.
1204261 1206647 We've been surveilling you<br />for quite a while.
1206671 1210740 - Subway station.<br />- A TVA outpost, yes.
1211037 1213204 - And what is that?<br />- Hmm?
1215272 1217549 Is that me? Is that Thor?
1218011 1219555 - Is he crying?<br />- Uh, let's not
1219579 1221010 get ahead of ourselves.
1221034 1222601 That happens in the distant future.
1222625 1224191 Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.
1224215 1226226 Do not speak to her.<br />Stop that. Eyes on me.
1226250 1228262 I brought you here<br />to offer you an opportunity.
1228286 1230181 The opportunity you sought years ago,
1230205 1232101 but for which you were not ready.
1232125 1233332 We believe you're ready now.
1233356 1235373 Ready for a chance<br />to leave your timeline
1235397 1237413 and join the greatest universe of all.
1237437 1239944 I am about to give you the thing<br />you've always wanted.
1239968 1241577 Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.
1241601 1243211 The power in the Marvel Universe
1243235 1245269 is about to change forever.
1246710 1248205 I am the Messiah...
1250550 1253220 I am...
1253244 1255917 ...Marvel Jesus.
1256247 1258061 Can you excuse me for just a moment?
1258085 1260383 I'm just gonna go over here.
1262990 1264297 Suck it, Fox!
1264321 1266019 I'm going to Disneyland.
1266043 1267764 Get fucked!
1270337 1271337 Where do I sign?
1271361 1273306 Oh, there's no need for paperwork.
1273330 1275276 Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.
1275300 1275913 Oh.
1275937 1278907 There is one thing I will need, though.
1282373 1285055 Oh, fuck off!
1285079 1287652 Adorn me, Beardo.
1307640 1309012 Fuckin' A!
1309036 1310618 Uhh! It's perfect! FYI,
1310642 1314590 your tailor is a predator,<br />but I love it. Snug.
1314614 1315282 No camel toe.
1315306 1319254 New car smell<br />and adamantium katanas?
1319278 1320909 You shouldn't have.
1320933 1322564 Go ahead. Take it in.
1322588 1325502 And yes, your underwear<br />is getting tighter.
1325526 1327300 That guy knows what I'm talking about.
1327324 1329668 His clothes says middle management,
1329692 1332036 but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.
1332060 1334038 Yes. You look very nice.
1334062 1334741 "Nice"?
1334765 1336975 Your buddy here is ready<br />to throw it all away for me.
1336999 1338159 - You callin' your wife?<br />- HR.
1338183 1339223 Does your wife work in HR?
1339247 1342013 I'm really glad you're taking this so well.
1342037 1343486 Oh, I'm taking it well.
1343510 1346149 I have never had a problem<br />traveling for work.
1346173 1348183 That said, we should talk vacation days.
1348207 1350989 I'm more of a one-week-on-<br />one-week-off kind of guy.
1351013 1352493 I think it's what they do in Denmark.
1352517 1354597 You know, you'll never see<br />a Danish flag on the moon,
1354621 1355993 but goddamn it, they're happy.
1356017 1359360 Now, let's power up your<br />little Amazon Fire phone there
1359384 1360162 and zip me back home
1360186 1362968 so I can let my friends know<br />that they've been upgraded
1362992 1363605 to disciples.
1363629 1366405 Yeah. I don't think you...<br />quite understand.
1366429 1369389 Um, you will not be returning<br />to your home
1369413 1372373 because there will be<br />no home to return to.
1372397 1373274 Come again?
1373298 1375234 This time in my ears.
1378303 1382472 This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.
1382582 1383416 That
1383440 1385452 is what happens when a universe
1385476 1387420 loses their Anchor Being.
1387444 1389389 See how it decays from the inside?
1389413 1392343 - This is how a reality dies.<br />- What's an Anchor Being?
1392367 1395297 An Anchor Being is an entity<br />of such vital importance
1395321 1396033 that when they die,
1396057 1399102 their whole world slowly<br />withers out of existence.
1399126 1401825 You've just won the lottery<br />because I didn't die.
1401849 1404548 It was just a little midlife<br />crisis. I'm better now.
1404572 1407706 Oh, no, no, no.
1410500 1413182 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, I love to laugh.
1413206 1416054 Can you imagine<br />if you were the Anchor Being?
1416078 1418875 - Yeah.<br />- Oh!
1418899 1421697 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.
1421721 1422829 Your Anchor Being died
1422853 1425733 in an act of self-sacrifice so epic
1425757 1428638 that it sent shivers down the Timeline.
1428662 1432665 I am referring, of course, to...
1433292 1437769 Logan. The Wolverine.
1440002 1443670 Don't be what they made you.
1452410 1456282 Ah, so this is what it feels like...
1457316 1459153 Logan.
1459384 1460891 Of course.
1461122 1462552 Logan.
1464791 1466004 Logan?
1466028 1467907 The guy with forks for hands?
1467931 1470041 That Wolverine?
1470065 1472175 Yeah, I got it. You can turn your
1472199 1474618 retro graphics of death<br />off now. Make it stop.
1474642 1476345 We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.
1476369 1478403 We certainly can't stop it.
1479470 1480513 How long have we got?
1480537 1482499 In most cases, couple thousand years.
1482523 1484746 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases
1484770 1486452 aren't fast enough. Not for me.
1486476 1488323 What does that mean?
1488347 1490193 It means that I have been tasked
1490217 1493065 with overseeing the end of your universe.
1493089 1493834 And regardless of what
1493858 1496167 the pencil pushers upstairs would prefer,
1496191 1496738 I will not
1496762 1500303 waste my life watching it die<br />slowly of natural causes.
1500327 1502420 We used to just prune<br />these things. Simple.
1502444 1504700 Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA
1504724 1506824 doesn't like to do that<br />anymore. Well, I do.
1506848 1509421 And no matter what<br />my so-called superiors say,
1509445 1512018 the multiverse does not<br />need a babysitter.
1512042 1513684 We need a mercy killer.
1513708 1515350 And in this instance,
1515374 1519378 I am the mercy killer. Ha!
1522821 1524326 What in the MacGuffin is that?
1524350 1527363 That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.
1527387 1528462 An accelerant.
1528486 1531235 Once completed,<br />it will allow me to destroy
1531259 1533638 the space time matrix of your universe.
1533662 1536042 You see, I don't want<br />to work for the TVA.
1536066 1537273 I want to be the TVA.
1537297 1540442 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization
1540466 1542394 how much more efficient it can become.
1542418 1544347 To wit, I will be giving your universe
1544371 1546447 a swift and compassionate end.
1546471 1548391 And don't worry, your friends<br />won't feel a thing.
1548415 1552180 It'll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what's that?"
1552279 1553819 Trust me.
1565259 1568041 You're gonna Old Yeller<br />my fucking universe?
1568065 1570042 Mm... In your parlance, yes.
1570066 1571426 Two in the heart, one in the head.
1571450 1573243 Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.
1573267 1575311 You can either rejoin your loved ones
1575335 1577380 and collectively cease to exist in,
1577404 1580283 I'd say, 72 hours. Or...
1580307 1582549 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1582573 1585553 And you end your days of insignificance
1585577 1587929 and mediocrity.
1587953 1589259 Wade.
1589283 1591328 Wade, you can finally,
1591352 1594420 finally matter.
1603066 1605782 That's all I've ever really wanted.
1605806 1607598 I know.
1607697 1608949 I know.
1608973 1611447 And you know I'm... I'm nothing if not
1611471 1613604 morally flexible.
1615540 1617245 Yep, yep.
1618619 1619619 I'll do it.
1619643 1620554 Wise choice.
1620578 1622138 The Sacred Timeline's happy<br />to have you.
1622162 1624179 I was actually talking about finding
1624203 1626353 the Wolverine and breaking<br />your fucking nose.
1629797 1633573 ♪ And I'd give up forever to touch you ♪
1633597 1637397 ♪ 'Cause I know<br />that you feel me somehow ♪
1639366 1641344 Find him. Find him!
1641368 1643975 And boy, did he ever.
1645240 1647671 Which brings us back to this.
1648441 1650574 The desecration of the sacred corpse.
1655283 1657714 Oh, my God!
1658055 1661157 Oh! My own fucking arm!
1663621 1665633 Now we're talkin'!
1665657 1667305 Not like this!
1667329 1668943 No, dear God! No!
1668967 1671540 I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!
1671564 1672926 Make it stop!
1672950 1674335 Mangold tried.
1677206 1678733 You sick fuck!
1678757 1680284 Logan was a hero.
1680308 1682056 And the only thing worth a shit
1682080 1684114 to ever come out of Canada.
1691022 1693463 Get my country's name
1693487 1696456 out of your fuckin' mouth.
1696555 1699228 And my sword. Give me that.
1701560 1704672 Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.
1704696 1705474 An alive one.
1705498 1708236 Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.
1716146 1717576 Logan!
1720117 1722889 I'm gonna need you to come with me.
1723450 1725221 Who's asking?
1726090 1728201 Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.
1728225 1731138 Did you stick the landing, little guy?
1731162 1732006 Yes, you did!
1732030 1734041 Comic-accurate short king.
1734065 1735724 Such a cute wittle Wolvie.
1735748 1737407 Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.
1737431 1739410 Ahoy!
1739434 1741984 Everything seems to be on fire.
1742008 1743083 You have a dragon?
1743107 1746407 Ooh, you have Anchor Being<br />written all over...
1749773 1754062 ♪ Make a one man weep,<br />make another man sing ♪
1754086 1756229 ♪ Change a hawk... ♪
1756253 1756723 Patch!
1756747 1760927 Oh, now we're talkin'.
1761125 1762201 Oh, yeah.
1762225 1765492 That's the whole goddamn<br />package right there.
1765535 1766535 Howdy!
1766559 1769687 I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.
1769711 1772862 Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need<br />some coconut oil.
1776971 1778646 What in the fuck?
1778670 1780990 Are you okay?
1781014 1781616 Oh, yes, yes.
1781640 1783387 Classic John Byrne brown and tan.
1783411 1785512 Now, you fought the Hulk<br />in this outfit. No?
1788015 1790494 I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,
1790518 1791518 and I will not...
1800461 1804696 It's not you. We're just going<br />in a different direction.
1806983 1807983 You know, from behind,
1808007 1809407 you look a little bit like Henry...
1809431 1811457 Oh, my fuck!
1811481 1813648 The Cavillrine. The legends are true.
1813672 1817224 And may I say, sir,<br />on behalf of all humanity,
1817248 1818961 this just feels right.
1818985 1820358 We will treat you so much better
1820382 1821902 than those shit fucks down the street.
1821926 1824126 - You were just leavin'.<br />- No, sir.
1824150 1826619 Not while the fate of my universe is at...
1830557 1832338 This one looks promising.
1832362 1834198 Down you go.
1835067 1836440 Again.
1836464 1838938 I told you. You're not welcome here.
1838962 1840109 You're not welcome anywhere.
1840133 1841373 Now get the fuck out of my bar.
1841397 1844152 Just give me one more drink<br />and then I'll leave.
1844176 1845944 That's not how it works.
1845968 1848750 It does now. Leave the bottle.
1848774 1849684 I know you, bub?
1849708 1852071 Nope. But I know you.
1852095 1854482 Everybody knows me.
1855318 1856527 I'm the Wolverine.
1856551 1858231 Yes, you are.
1858255 1861621 And I'm gonna need you<br />to come with me right now.
1861951 1863533 Look, lady, I'm not interested.
1863557 1865140 Really gettin' into your cups here.
1865164 1867363 Why would I go with you?
1867660 1869672 Because, unfortunately,
1869696 1870276 I need you,
1870300 1875513 and even more unfortunately,<br />my entire world needs you.
1875537 1877901 You two gonna fuck or fight?
1881047 1882586 You gonna take that from him?
1882610 1883652 Yep.
1883676 1885952 I can tell you have a sort<br />of don't-get-too-close-
1885976 1888097 I'll-only-break-your-heart vibe going here,
1888121 1889064 but every other Wolverine
1889088 1890214 would've really hurt me by now.
1890238 1891558 And I'm sort of on the tick-tick.
1891582 1893300 - So, upsy-daisy. Here we go.<br />- Whoa, whoa.
1893324 1894400 - Up you go.<br />- Hey, hey!
1894424 1896293 I got you, big guy.
1897195 1898592 Oh.
1899068 1900108 Whiskey dick of the claws.
1900132 1902144 It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.
1902168 1902869 You don't want this.
1902893 1905543 You're right. I don't.<br />And you don't want this.
1905567 1907281 Unless you wanna take a deep breath
1907305 1908579 through your fuckin' forehead,
1908603 1910944 I suggest you reconsider.
1910968 1912672 Let's go, peanut.
1916346 1919128 Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
1919152 1920680 Watch this.
1921010 1923660 All right. That... Whoa.
1923684 1925322 Easy.
1928302 1929302 Good God.
1929326 1932428 Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?
1932659 1933999 It's okay. Keep goin'.
1934023 1937202 Audiences are accustomed<br />to long run times.
1941701 1944417 Guess you'll have to do.
1944441 1946178 Okay, here we...
1946376 1949157 Oh! Look at those jammies.
1949181 1952105 That only took 20 fucking years.
1952129 1955054 One Anchor Being coming right up!
1955078 1956577 On your left, baby girl.
1956601 1958100 This Logan has the same
1958124 1960317 he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.
1960341 1962534 And bonus, he's actually<br />wearing a costume
1962558 1964035 like he's not embarrassed to be
1964059 1965537 in a superhero movie for once.
1965561 1967032 I don't understand.
1967056 1967934 You said my universe is dying
1967958 1970443 because this sack of nuts<br />got himself killed.
1970467 1973005 - Well, problem solved.<br />- My God.
1973029 1978187 You actually think you can<br />replace an Anchor Being
1978211 1979319 with this?
1979343 1982455 I wouldn't have accepted<br />any other Wolverine, BT dubs.
1982479 1984291 But you have outdone yourself
1984315 1986277 and brought me the worst Wolverine!
1986301 1988263 What do you mean, the worst one?
1988287 1989197 Mr. Wilson.
1989221 1993091 This Wolverine let down his entire world.
1993115 1996172 He's the stuff of legend,<br />but not in a good way.
1996196 1997536 And what he did,
1997560 1998239 well,
1998263 2001695 some things are just beyond forgiveness.
2003036 2004036 Okay.
2004060 2007282 How do I... How do I make<br />this right? I'll do anything.
2007306 2010108 I gave you a chance at greatness.
2010132 2012947 Because my superiors<br />deemed you "special."
2012971 2014751 Clearly not special in a good way.
2014775 2015520 Apparently you have some
2015544 2018018 important future purpose to serve.
2018042 2019162 With Thor. He holds me.
2019186 2020525 But I did my duty.
2020549 2022693 I gave you the opportunity<br />to be somebody.
2022717 2024463 And instead of accepting my offering
2024487 2027533 with humility and gratitude,<br />you broke my nose.
2027557 2028269 It looks great.
2028293 2029936 And you decimated dozens of my men
2029960 2031602 with the exhumed corpse of a hero.
2031626 2034441 Dishonoring not only<br />his remains but his memory.
2034465 2035937 What are you, the Internet?
2035961 2037708 Your world is dying!
2037732 2039478 Thank you very much.
2039502 2041603 And there's no stopping it.
2042637 2044682 The humane thing to do
2044706 2045418 is to make it quick.
2045442 2047718 Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
2047742 2048735 making you peckish?
2048759 2049752 I'm eating my feelings.
2049776 2051936 I'm about to lose everything<br />that I've ever cared about
2051960 2055088 because that hairy thundercunt<br />from down undercunt
2055112 2055725 finally dies,
2055749 2058267 and he's standing<br />right behind me, isn't he?
2058291 2060268 Welcome to the MCU, by the way.
2060292 2062386 You're joining at a bit of a low point.
2062410 2064176 As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.
2064200 2066089 I want you to get him on the phone
2066113 2068001 and you tell him, her, or them,
2068025 2071336 that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.
2076132 2077615 Holy shit.
2077639 2079221 I just heard a symphony
2079245 2081686 of butt holes clenching all at once.
2081710 2082290 You're off grid.
2082314 2084150 Your bosses don't know<br />what you sick fucks
2084174 2085117 are doing down here.
2085141 2086052 Well, I'll tell you what.
2086076 2088264 I have a black belt in Karen...
2088288 2089187 And I'm gonna go upstairs
2089211 2092631 and I'm gonna tell 'em<br />all about you and your...
2092655 2094534 Oh, silence is nice, isn't it?
2094558 2095369 Where the fuck did he go?
2095393 2098055 To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.
2099359 2100638 Whew.
2100662 2102895 That was close.
2122486 2125631 Don't just stand there, you ape.
2125655 2127269 Give me a hand up.
2127293 2128930 Nope. I'm actually okay.
2128954 2132440 Thank you very much.
2132464 2133539 Where the hell are we?
2133563 2136037 I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.
2136061 2138611 But that would be IP infringement, right?
2138635 2139635 Fucking jokes.
2143232 2144352 Fuck! Fuck.
2144376 2145776 Were you even listening back there?
2145800 2149017 If we don't make it back<br />to that Mr. Paradox asshole,
2149041 2150557 everyone I know is gonna die.
2150581 2152240 Not my fuckin' problem.
2152264 2153922 Oh, is that all you got?
2153946 2157300 Is that what you said<br />when your world went to shit?
2157324 2159615 Come again?
2159639 2161856 Yeah, I heard all about you.
2161880 2164098 How you screwed up everything.
2164122 2164933 You should be thankin' me
2164957 2167287 for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.
2167311 2169665 You back-stabbing son of a bitch!
2175231 2177304 Are you ready to be calm now?
2183712 2185515 Rest in pieces, Fox.
2200729 2203501 I don't want to fight you, peanut.
2203666 2205270 Doesn't matter what you did.
2205294 2207934 I just need your help.
2208506 2210871 I don't fuckin' care.
2211575 2213477 Uh... Uh-oh.
2218714 2222146 Fuck. This is gonna hurt.
2225589 2226896 All right.

2313612 2314588 Those... Those
2314612 2318020 pricks in the TVA. You heard him.

2342101 2345015 The superhero equivalent<br />to comfort food, or Molly.
2345039 2348216 White guys' answer<br />to all the disappointments.
2348240 2349283 And another A-lister.
2349307 2350349 Fair warning, gorgeous.
2350373 2352923 You're going to encounter<br />some indelicate language,
2352947 2355498 a smidge of ass play,<br />but we've been prohibited
2355522 2357026 from using cocaine. On camera.
2357050 2359970 - They're coming.<br />- Who's "they"?
2366389 2368699 Oh, they're driving angry.
2373737 2376189 Now that's a superhero landing.

2414041 2419211 Cassandra is gonna be giddy<br />when she sees what we caught.
2419419 2420419 You can't run.
2420443 2421354 Everybody knows that.
2421378 2423675 You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?
2423699 2425996 You're not gonna love<br />what happens next.
2426020 2428362 Oh. Oh, my God.
2428386 2431035 Oh, my God.<br />Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.
2431059 2432267 - Ah! Fuck.<br />- Ha!
2432291 2433498 Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!
2433522 2435605 - Say what?<br />- Avengers, assemble...
2435629 2437735 - Flame on!<br />- I'm sorry, what now?

2478435 2482284 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Time!
2482308 2483482 You look ridiculous.
2483506 2486255 People have waited decades<br />for this fight.
2486279 2488257 It's not gonna be easy. Baby Knife.
2488281 2490259 Shoot the double, you take him down.
2490283 2492558 Side control, then full mount,
2492582 2493492 and you ground and pound
2493516 2495445 till he makes no sound<br />because he's dead.
2495469 2497398 - Shut the fuck up!<br />- Oh, my God!
2497422 2500160 Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.
2511677 2513083 What is it, girl?
2513107 2516308 Is there trouble at the well?

2537019 2539804 you come for her.
2540266 2542464 So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."
2542488 2544687 I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.
2544711 2546017 Who's next?
2546041 2547349 Toad!
2547373 2549176 You're up.
2555390 2556390 Uh-oh.
2556414 2558185 - Oh, holy sh...<br />- Fuck.
2568993 2571429 God of Thunder.
2574531 2575976 How long was I asleep?
2576000 2577444 Not all of you was asleep.
2577468 2579381 Don't bother.
2579405 2581316 They're very thorough.
2581340 2584551 If you know where we are, start talking.
2584575 2586156 You're in The Void.
2586180 2587993 Think of it as purgatory.
2588017 2590590 Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.
2590614 2591964 Where anything useless goes
2591988 2593966 before it gets annihilated forever.
2593990 2597102 And where the TVA sends<br />people that don't play nice
2597126 2598532 with the rest of the multiverse.
2598556 2599939 - Like you?<br />- And you.
2599963 2602536 What does the annihilating?
2602560 2603107 Alioth.
2603131 2604807 Alioth is in this thing?
2604831 2606506 From Loki, Season 1, Episode 5?
2606530 2609675 Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.
2609699 2611214 Most don't make it.
2611238 2612985 There's a resistance, though.
2613009 2616088 Other people like us<br />that managed to survive.
2616112 2618238 They're hidin' out in the borderlands,
2618262 2620389 trying to find a way the fuck outta here.
2620413 2621940 Then that's where we go.
2621964 2624184 "We"? Us? A team?
2624208 2626428 The answer is yes. Shake on it.
2626452 2627197 Fuck! You nicked it.
2627221 2629584 Just got the tip with<br />your little steak knife.
2629608 2631972 These "others" can help us<br />get back to the TVA.
2631996 2633612 Make 'em fix things.
2634971 2636305 Something funny, bub?
2636329 2638671 She might have somethin'<br />to say about that.
2638695 2640498 Who's "she"?
2641146 2642146 In The Void,
2642170 2644677 you're either food for Alioth
2644701 2646536 or you work for her.
2718675 2721005 Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.
2721029 2723233 Oh, you must be this year's Juggernaut.
2723257 2725461 - Thank you.<br />- I'd keep your voices down.
2725485 2727001 She don't like the chatter.
2727025 2728927 She's gonna love you.
2743975 2745987 Is it... Is that Charles?
2746011 2748418 Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!
2748442 2749925 That's not Chuck.
2749949 2751642 Ah, shit.
2752181 2753191 Oh, ableism. Great.
2753215 2756492 That's not gonna go over well<br />with the woke mob.
2756516 2758097 A Wolverine.
2758121 2761464 I wondered when I'd get one of you.
2761488 2762266 You're one of Xavier's.
2762290 2764566 You-You know him? You know Chuck?
2764590 2765737 Oh, I knew him.
2765761 2766908 We shared a womb.
2766932 2769571 Tried to strangle the sly little fellow
2769595 2770307 with my umbilical cord.
2770331 2774378 Amen. I've never<br />loved roommates. Mine's blind.
2774402 2776215 Except she can see cocaine.
2776239 2777017 For some... reason.
2777041 2780989 You want to chime in,<br />Your Majesty? I'm dying here.
2781013 2781582 Who are you?
2781606 2784052 Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.
2784076 2786522 - Bullshit!<br />- I was an anal birth.
2786546 2788963 Hmm. You two are cute.
2788987 2791550 I have a good feeling about this.
2793552 2795547 And I've been trying to catch
2795571 2797566 this little firefly for years.
2797590 2798632 Haven't I, Johnny?
2798656 2802175 Aw... You picked the wrong<br />time to make new friends.
2802199 2804243 Oh, Johnny told us all about you.
2804267 2806311 - Maybe shut up now.<br />- Yeah, maybe don't...
2806335 2807708 We're just talkin' here.
2807732 2808444 Yeah, Johnny told us
2808468 2810281 you're a psychotic<br />megalomaniacal asshole.
2810305 2815409 His words, not mine.<br />Hellbent on domination and pain.
2815574 2817322 You said all that about me?
2817346 2818322 No! No! I don't...
2818346 2821910 - I didn't say any of that!<br />- Sticks and stones, Johnny!
2822581 2824427 Don't let her intimidate you.
2824451 2826297 It's like you said in the convoy.
2826321 2828167 This finger-lickin' dead-inside
2828191 2831171 pixie slab of third rate<br />dime-store nut-milk
2831195 2833156 can eat your delicious cinnamon ring
2833180 2835117 and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
2835141 2837077 Okay. I have never said<br />any of those words
2837101 2839542 - in my entire life!<br />- Ha! The modesty.
2839566 2842017 People think I'm a shit talker.
2842041 2842984 But this guy...
2843008 2844431 Next level.
2844455 2845877 What? This... I... We...
2845901 2847615 I don't even know<br />what half of that means!
2847639 2849354 - This... I...<br />- My hat's off to you, sir.
2849378 2850222 - Truly.<br />- What? This...
2850246 2852621 I didn't... He's... That's... I...
2852645 2853908 I... I don't...
2858881 2860233 Not my favorite Chris.
2860257 2861464 You stupid piece of shit.
2861488 2862801 You just got him fucking killed!
2862825 2864137 Hey! We're all grieving!
2864161 2867230 PS, do you know what<br />he was doing to the budget?
2869595 2871639 Alioth is hungry.
2871663 2873477 There's been some kind of mistake.
2873501 2875346 Big yellow is a back-up Anchor Being,
2875370 2878416 and I'm Marvel Jesus.<br />MJ, if you're nasty.
2878440 2879251 This may be hard to hear,
2879275 2880852 but there's another British villain
2880876 2882453 who's gonna destroy my universe,
2882477 2883222 and I'm gonna stop him.
2883246 2885060 Oh, honey, you don't really strike me
2885084 2887447 as the world-saving type.
2889220 2890493 Did I hit a nerve?
2890517 2893398 I didn't want it to come to this.
2893422 2894101 Either you help us
2894125 2895883 or my friend here is gonna sing
2895907 2897666 the entire second act of Music Man
2897690 2899469 with zero warm-up.
2899493 2900533 Where'd you get the chair?
2900557 2901604 Well, once in a while,
2901628 2904002 I do get a Charles through here.
2904026 2905277 Never mine, though.
2905301 2908082 No. He didn't care to find me.
2908106 2911481 Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!
2911505 2915057 Can't you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment
2915081 2916822 or cancer like the rest of us?
2916846 2918588 But I'm not like the rest of you.
2918612 2920193 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2920217 2923329 Now, we could be<br />truly terrifying together.
2923353 2924494 You're that scary, huh?
2924518 2926562 The TVA certainly thought so.
2926586 2929302 They sent me here before I could walk.
2929326 2931073 And you know, it's the best thing
2931097 2933108 that ever happened to me.
2933132 2933701 I love it here.
2933725 2934867 You live in a garbage dump.
2934891 2938641 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2938665 2940114 The Void is a paradise.
2940138 2943381 I can wield my power here<br />without shame.
2943405 2946649 Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier
2946673 2948651 to teach me temperance.
2948675 2950653 What about your Charles?
2950677 2952489 Did he protect you?
2952513 2954491 Did he make you feel safe?
2954515 2957083 We're mutants. We're never safe.
2964360 2965569 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
2965593 2967054 I don't... I don't want the smoke.
2967078 2968715 I don't have any beef with you.
2968739 2970013 I just want to save my friends.
2970037 2971310 I just... I want to go home.
2971334 2973478 Well, the thing is, I could get you home.
2973502 2975947 - Good.<br />- But I don't want to.
2975971 2978440 Not good.
2980002 2982079 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2982103 2985226 Your... fingers are inside me,
2985250 2985984 but not in a good way.
2986008 2989329 My brother could enter<br />one's mind with a thought.
2989353 2991518 I have to get my hands dirty.
2994984 2996821 I've got you.
2998328 3000561 I've got you...
3001925 3004202 What do you mean?
3004598 3008150 I can't... I can't reach you.<br />You're not here.
3008174 3009183 I'm right here.
3009207 3012352 - No, you're not. I can't...<br />- I'm right here.
3012376 3015609 Then show me. You got to do something.
3016015 3017015 Show you what?
3017039 3021536 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3021560 3026058 Ever since they turned you<br />down, you took a knee.
3026082 3028853 Baby, you never got back up.
3029986 3032064 I know you're going through something.
3032088 3034340 Let me go through it with you.
3034364 3038236 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3040799 3042728 Where'd you go?
3042752 3044704 Oh, my God.
3047004 3048685 You just say it. Okay?
3048709 3050389 Say, "I don't want you."
3050413 3052325 "I don't want to be with you."
3052349 3054086 Go ahead. Say it. Say... Say, "I don't..."
3054110 3055675 Say it. You don't wanna be with me.
3055699 3057265 Tell me that and I'll walk away.
3057289 3058289 Say, "I don't want you."
3064757 3066163 Fuck...
3066187 3069630 You'll never fucking matter.
3073095 3074138 What?
3074162 3077275 - You'll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3082841 3085986 - You'll...<br />- You'll...
3086010 3087570 - never...<br />- never...
3087594 3090199 - fucking...<br />- fucking...
3090223 3092851 - matter.<br />- Matter...
3093918 3095099 She never said that.
3095123 3096303 No.
3096327 3098692 But I bet she thought it.
3099429 3101490 You are so mean!
3101514 3103575 My brain could taste your fingers,
3103599 3105246 and they tasted like hate!
3105270 3108448 And where in God's name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3108472 3111467 You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3111491 3114510 And long before you came here.
3114949 3115949 This is Baby Knife.
3115973 3117589 She's gonna fuck you in the face now.
3117613 3118358 If you want to kill me,
3118382 3120625 it's going to take more than a little blade.
3120649 3122153 How about six?
3122177 3126334 My boy's wicked strong.
3126358 3128061 That's my big boy.
3128085 3129756 Yes, you are.
3135190 3136475 Well, this has been fun.
3136499 3139095 But the big guy needs to eat,<br />and the rent is due.
3142967 3144010 By the way,
3144034 3145541 you're the rent.
3164153 3166351 Come on! Fuck!
3166375 3168574 You comin' or what?
3168598 3170434 Coming!
3189463 3190463 What you thinkin' 'bout?
3190487 3192328 - Get the fuck off of me!<br />- Shh, shh, shh.
3192352 3194193 - Almost done.<br />- Almost done what?
3194217 3196404 Getting my knife out of your buttocks,
3196428 3198163 - pervert!<br />- Aah! Fuck!
3198187 3200616 Get your mind out of my pants!
3200640 3203070 - I'm telling Blake.<br />- New rules.
3203094 3203674 I talk now.
3203698 3205446 That's gonna be very hard<br />on the audience.
3205470 3207112 Shut the fuck up!
3207136 3208778 Let me fuckin' think.
3208802 3211838 Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?
3213080 3214080 Right?
3214104 3216985 Je m'excuse. Am I allowed<br />to speak now or...
3217009 3219912 Just nod, asshole.
3220626 3221626 Right.
3221650 3223012 Then we find the others<br />that poor kid, Johnny,
3223036 3224756 was talking about<br />before you got him killed!
3224780 3225862 "Poor kid." He's, like, 50!
3225886 3227380 Yeah, if there's a chance they know
3227404 3229305 how to get out of here, we find 'em.
3229329 3231230 And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit
3231254 3232781 like you fucking promised!
3232805 3234355 I smell quest.
3237061 3238634 I smell food.
3240361 3245443 So what made you finally wear<br />an honest-to-God costume?
3245905 3247916 Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.
3247940 3251052 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3251076 3253285 Have you been checked for ADHD?
3253309 3254252 Mm-mm.
3254276 3256188 But I've had several STDs,
3256212 3258928 which were probably caused by ADHD.
3258952 3260458 Fuck!
3260590 3262503 What are you looking for?
3262527 3264471 Oh. Thank fuck.
3264495 3266441 No, no, no, no, no.<br />That's rubbing alcohol.
3266465 3268201 You don't want to drink... Oh, yeah.
3268225 3270358 There you go. Fuck that liver.
3271194 3273801 Good. Okay.
3274164 3275935 What the fuck are those?
3276166 3276615 Oh.
3276639 3278618 Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,
3278642 3280676 but nobody knows.
3283041 3285175 Everybody knows.
3286576 3288056 Wanna talk about what's haunting you,
3288080 3290762 or should we wait<br />for a third act flashback?
3290786 3293557 Ah... Go fuck yourself.
3296285 3297825 You know...
3298353 3301730 in my world, you're...
3302258 3304005 You're well regarded.
3304029 3305776 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3305800 3308175 They don't like me much in mine either.
3308199 3309109 You don't say.
3309133 3312179 I wanted to be something, you know. I...
3312203 3314082 Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.
3314106 3315984 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3316008 3319616 I didn't make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3320551 3321631 When my girlfriend left me,
3321655 3324092 - and I just...<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3324116 3325313 Yeah.
3325337 3326533 Vanessa.
3326557 3328922 When we met, she was a dancer.
3329417 3331287 We had a whole life.
3331991 3333298 It was good.
3333322 3336358 But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.
3336732 3339229 Fucked that right up.
3339437 3340437 But you,
3340461 3341372 you were an X-Man.
3341396 3344542 Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...
3345708 3347611 The Wolverine.
3349140 3351549 He was a hero in my world.
3352748 3354475 Yeah, well...
3354948 3356785 he ain't shit in mine.
3361086 3364826 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3365321 3366729 He died.
3366993 3367431 How?
3367455 3370369 Well, technically,<br />you were chest-fucked by a tree, but,
3370393 3372272 really, you just ran out of batteries
3372296 3374428 - trying to save someone.<br />- Who?
3374452 3376584 The shit heels that grew her in a lab
3376608 3378906 called her "X-23." But...
3379038 3380114 she was just a kid.
3380138 3384284 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3384308 3386253 You died trying to save her.
3386277 3387220 It was beautiful.
3387244 3390157 Look, mijo, I know you're hurtin'.
3390181 3392423 My blind, elderly,<br />African-American roommate,
3392447 3395933 Blind Al, always says that<br />pain teaches us who we are.
3395957 3397968 Sometimes we need to listen to that pain
3397992 3398869 instead of running from it.
3398893 3400233 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she's wise.
3400257 3403501 No, no, no. That's her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al"?
3403525 3405229 Well, she's blind.

3444268 3446379 - No, she's not. Fuck no!<br />- Oh, yes, she is.
3446403 3447544 - Oh, yes...<br />- Sorry!
3447568 3450625 Sorry about that!
3450649 3453155 Come here, girl!
3453179 3454320 Who are you?
3454344 3455321 Oh, I'm Deadpool.
3455345 3456960 And I guess you're Deadpool too.
3456984 3459177 But in here, everybody<br />calls me "Nicepool."
3459201 3461394 Oh, my goodness.<br />Wait till you see Ladypool.
3461418 3462163 She is gorgeous.
3462187 3464969 She just had a baby too. And...
3464993 3465562 Can't even tell.
3465586 3467433 I don't think you're supposed to say that.
3467457 3468675 That's okay.
3468699 3470645 I identify as a feminist.
3470669 3472296 Right.
3473231 3474241 Are those gold-plated,
3474265 3477014 ...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?
3477038 3477783 'Course.
3477807 3479280 To match my ear huggie.
3479304 3480346 Can I have 'em?
3480370 3482382 Over my dead body.
3482406 3483151 You're fun.
3483175 3486320 And I guess you've<br />already met Mary Puppins.
3486344 3487551 AKA Dogpool.
3487575 3488895 Careful where you put your hands.
3488919 3492061 She's ninety percent g-spot,<br />and she'll let you know it.
3492085 3495461 You let this little flirt out<br />of your sight for one second
3495485 3497496 and she starts shopping for a new papa.
3497520 3499530 If you can't be a responsible pet owner,
3499554 3502567 then maybe you don't deserve<br />this little unicorn.
3502591 3505207 Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.
3505231 3506323 Shan't happen again.
3506347 3507439 Why are you so nice?
3507463 3509227 Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.
3509251 3511015 Shutting the fuck up is also free.
3511039 3512720 - Caliente.<br />- This is Logan.
3512744 3513445 He's usually shirtless,
3513469 3516472 but he's let himself go since the divorce.
3517110 3519376 Where's your mask?
3521345 3522345 Come on, guys.
3523555 3524555 Ugh, this guy.
3524579 3526360 We're looking for a group of survivors.
3526384 3527195 Oh, they're out there.
3527219 3529164 Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope
3529188 3531134 that you don't run<br />into the Deadpool corps.
3531158 3531870 Yeah, they're crazy.
3531894 3533532 They will chop you up<br />into a thousand pieces
3533556 3534565 and hide you all over The Void.
3534589 3536601 If they could only process<br />their childhood trauma,
3536625 3538438 they'd go on one heck<br />of a healing journey.
3538462 3540275 Look, we're headed for the borderlands.
3540299 3541143 You know where it is?
3541167 3543431 Yeah, that... that's 12 klicks due west.
3543455 3545720 I can lend you my ride, if you like.
3545744 3548504 It would be my honor.
3550946 3553255 Oh, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
3553279 3555521 Uh-uh. What the... No! No!
3555545 3556555 Just get in the car.
3556579 3557588 This isn't a car.
3557612 3559909 This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.
3559933 3562231 Throttle response sucks a cock.
3562255 3563198 Dated infotainment system.
3563222 3565300 When Honda saw<br />that untreated chlamydia
3565324 3566069 was makin' a comeback,
3566093 3569271 they invented<br />the Honda Odyssey to compete.
3569295 3572075 Get in the fucking car.
3572099 3574342 She'll get you there safe and sound.
3574366 3576046 Old Betsy always does.
3576070 3578984 You're gonna have to<br />give me my dog back, though.
3579008 3580116 I know. Listen.
3580140 3581216 Yes, child.
3581240 3583956 If you ever wanna give her up,<br />or if she needs a new home,
3583980 3586354 or if something should happen to you,
3586378 3587090 I'd love to be her papa.
3587114 3589896 What would ever happen to me?
3589920 3591822 Lots of stuff.
3594649 3595912 - Jesus.<br />- No!
3595936 3597199 We're running away.
3597223 3599400 - Give me that.<br />- The corn was too dense, girl!
3599424 3600466 - There.<br />- Come here!

3635262 3636382 - I took mine off.<br />- Drop it.
3636406 3637338 It's not that ugly.
3637362 3639602 - Stop talking about my suit.<br />- Did you make it yourself?
3639626 3640536 - Been there.<br />- Quit. Now.
3640560 3643609 The X-Men make you wear it?<br />Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

3651079 3653421 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch<br />your frown lines, angel baby.
3653445 3654925 I'm just trying to bond a little bit.
3654949 3656930 Yeah, well, then talk<br />about somethin' else.
3656954 3658383 Fine.

3663455 3664365 Pshew!
3664389 3666433 - Stop it.<br />- Pshew.
3666457 3668417 If they can fix your world,<br />what's the first thing
3668441 3669748 you're gonna do<br />when you get out of here?
3669772 3671175 Get some rubbing alcohol shots,
3671199 3672472 maybe a wiper fluid chaser?
3672496 3674442 - What did you say?<br />- I said when you get back,
3674466 3676081 what's the first thing you're gonna do?
3676105 3678337 No, no, no. Before that.
3678502 3681274 If... they can fix your world?
3684508 3686486 What do you mean, "if"?
3686510 3687454 - I mean...<br />- You lied to me.
3687478 3688422 You don't have a fucking clue
3688446 3690722 if they can help me fix things, do you?
3690746 3692162 No. I mean... Ow!
3692186 3694461 Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!
3694485 3698654 - You lied!<br />- No! I made an educated wish!
3699688 3701822 Because I need you.
3701965 3705439 This. This is why. Right here.
3705463 3707744 'Cause if we don't do<br />something, they die.
3707768 3710049 I don't know anything<br />about saving worlds.
3710073 3711113 And why would I even care?
3711137 3715186 Because my entire world<br />is right here in this picture.
3715210 3716582 It's only nine people,
3716606 3719860 and I have no idea how to save it alone.
3719884 3722556 I know how to fuck people up<br />for money. But you,
3722580 3725219 you know how to save 'em!
3725351 3726671 At least the other Wolverine did.
3727518 3730938 Fuck! I guess I'm stuck<br />with the worst one.
3730962 3733005 Did you say you made
3733029 3736041 an educated fucking wish?
3736065 3738258 They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."
3738282 3740868 They don't call me "Truthful Timmy",
3740892 3743501 "the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."
3746636 3748218 One more word.
3748242 3752279 Please give me one.
3754050 3755775 Gubernatorial.
3755799 3757548 Oh, fuck!
3757988 3760584 You know what? You're a fucking joke.
3761149 3762709 No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.
3762733 3766039 Or the X-Men. And they'll take<br />fucking anyone.
3766063 3767006 I mean, you are
3767030 3771605 a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.
3771629 3773541 I have never met

3777371 3778182 in my entire life.
3778206 3780449 And that says a lot, 'cause I've been alive
3780473 3783518 for more than 200 fuckin' years,
3783542 3784353 and I'll tell ya,
3784377 3786422 that bald chick was right about one thing.
3786446 3788852 You will never save the world!
3788876 3791999 You couldn't even save a relationship
3792023 3793230 with a goddamn stripper!
3793254 3796349 And motherfucker, I wish<br />I could say you'd die alone,
3796373 3799468 but it's one of God's<br />best jokes that you can't die,
3799492 3801889 except that's on all of us!
3805002 3807730 Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?
3816112 3818444 I'm gonna fight you now.

4031427 4032601 Okay.

4036959 4037705 Terrific.
4037729 4039790 So just to refresh, you are.
4039814 4041874 - Wonder...<br />- Elektra.
4041898 4044745 Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?
4044769 4047617 And you. I was not expecting<br />to see you here.
4047641 4049520 I thought you were, you know,
4049544 4051743 retired.
4051941 4053448 Retarded?
4054019 4055019 "Retired."
4055043 4055921 I'm already in The Void.
4055945 4057425 I'm not trying to get canceled again.
4057449 4060555 - I don't like you.<br />- You never did.
4060587 4063402 And who's this succulent reminder
4063426 4065129 of my own inadequacies?
4065153 4065997 Look at you.
4066021 4068902 You look like the<br />superhero version of Hawkeye.
4068926 4072444 The name's Remy LeBeau,<br />Le Diable Blanc.
4072468 4073708 But you can call me the Gambit.
4073732 4076140 It's been a while<br />since I've seen Sling Blade.
4076164 4077712 Hit me again.
4077736 4078515 They call me the Gambit.
4078539 4079979 Do they? Are you sure you didn't
4080003 4081783 just really, really want them to,
4081807 4083610 but it never quite worked out?
4085139 4088592 You know, we never had<br />a Wolverine up in here.
4088616 4089361 But I can tell you now,
4089385 4091176 it's just a common courtesy to ask
4091200 4092991 before you drink up all of my liquor.
4093015 4095589 Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.
4099296 4100726 Fuck.
4101958 4104829 So embarrassing.
4104971 4105971 Boo, boo, boo.
4105995 4107435 Well, now that that's settled, look,
4107459 4108939 we came a long way to find you three.
4108963 4110548 - There's four of us.<br />- There's four...
4110572 4112175 Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?
4112199 4114486 Dear sweet God in heaven,<br />let it be Magneto,
4114510 4115830 - because with him...<br />- He's dead.
4115854 4117422 Fuck! Now Disney gets cheap?
4117446 4119474 It's like Pinocchio jammed<br />his face in my ass
4119498 4121814 - and started lying like crazy.<br />- Ooh, you nasty!
4121838 4124502 Mon pet it rouge. Laissez<br />les bons temps rouler, huh?
4124526 4127191 Not a single word.<br />What do you do exactly?
4127215 4129698 Charge the playing cards<br />and make 'em go boom!
4129722 4132339 Your power's<br />close-up magic. That's good.
4132363 4134275 We're not totally fucked at all.
4134299 4135941 So who brought us here?
4135965 4137631 That would be me.
4147234 4149170 Don't make me regret it.
4149511 4153294 Holy shit. Logan. That's her. That's X-23.
4153318 4155880 She's the one I told you about.
4159147 4161665 Hey, how did you all get stuck<br />in The Void?
4161689 4163535 There was a knock at the door.
4163559 4164899 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4164923 4166262 Well, maybe I was born here.
4166286 4168616 It's... It's hard to know for sure.
4168640 4170970 TVA decided our universe was dying.
4170994 4174338 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4175900 4178176 People like us don't go quietly.
4178200 4180530 TVA knows that, so they took us out.
4180554 4182884 The answer is yes. I'm in.
4182908 4184654 - In what?<br />- A team.
4184678 4186469 Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.
4186493 4188361 Let's get the fuck out of this place.
4188385 4190254 Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!
4190278 4192223 It was an educated wish!
4192247 4194688 - Ha!<br />- Look.
4195051 4196963 We've been inside Cassandra's lair.
4196987 4199571 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4199595 4201771 She can get us home. She told us.
4201795 4203970 Wait a minute, you've been inside?
4203994 4205609 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4205633 4208343 - Nobody's ever done that.<br />- We did.
4208367 4211077 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her,
4211101 4211648 they die.
4211672 4214355 The Punisher, the Quicksilver,<br />the Daredevil.
4214379 4216439 Daredevil? I'm so sorry.
4216463 4218547 - It's fine.<br />- Okay.
4219339 4223023 Even that sweet, baby angel,<br />Johnny Storm.
4223047 4224629 He up and gone missing like,
4224653 4226432 what, two days ago?
4226456 4228291 Ugh. That's so sad.
4228315 4231725 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I'm sure he's thriving.
4232462 4235266 Look, there's...<br />there's strength in numbers.
4235290 4235936 All right? Us...
4235960 4237003 plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra
4237027 4239479 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4239503 4241103 I know what it means to feel self-doubt.
4241127 4242647 - I don't feel that at all.<br />- I'm good.
4242671 4244880 Gnawing at your gut<br />like a coked-up tapeworm.
4244904 4246784 It's like you're holding up<br />a mirror to my soul.
4246808 4248422 You guys may not have been able
4248446 4250253 to save your universes.
4250277 4252084 But you can avenge them.
4252108 4253691 It's what Johnny would have wanted.
4253715 4257421 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4257464 4258464 Oh, yeah.
4258488 4260092 Dickhead here talked him into a team-up,
4260116 4262931 and Johnny came down with<br />a little case of the deads.
4262955 4264195 No, no, no. We don't know that.
4264219 4266747 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4266771 4269333 If he survived that,<br />he is prayin' for death.
4269357 4271373 Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!
4271397 4273414 - Spill it!<br />- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?
4273438 4274718 Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.
4274742 4277209 Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
4277233 4277780 Look.
4277804 4280179 He ran his fat-ass mouth<br />about Cassandra.
4280203 4281553 Then she zip-zapped his skin,
4281577 4283617 leaving his organs to splash<br />crudely onto the ground
4283641 4287153 while the soil greedily drank his blood.<br />It was horrible.
4287177 4288297 He was like a brother to me.
4288321 4291828 Look, he died before he could<br />make a difference. But...
4291852 4293291 Look, maybe you couldn't
4293315 4294434 save your worlds, but...
4294458 4297030 but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!
4297054 4299296 I don't give a shit about your world, but
4299320 4302608 if these two made it out of<br />there alive, maybe together,
4302632 4304301 we can get back in and take her down.
4304325 4306974 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, Chere.
4306998 4309648 If we can block her psychic powers,
4309672 4311716 we can get a leg up. I know it.
4311740 4313453 Now, I know Magneto's dead.
4313477 4315851 But I'd venture to guess<br />that his helmet is lying
4315875 4318151 - around here somewhere...<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4318175 4319460 - Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4319484 4321176 - Fuck!<br />- She don't play.
4321200 4322765 She knows that helmet was the only way
4322789 4324354 to protect anyone from her powers.
4324378 4326698 The only other helmet that<br />strong is Juggernaut's,
4326722 4327566 but he works for Cassandra.
4327590 4328930 Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.
4328954 4331074 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain't comin' off
4331098 4332698 without that dome gonna come off wit'it.
4332722 4333969 I'm so sorry, beautiful.
4333993 4334804 I want this to be gentle.
4334828 4336674 Who is your dialect coach?<br />The Minions?
4336698 4341207 I feel like we are missing<br />critical exposition here.
4341231 4344463 I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of hiding.
4344487 4347719 Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.
4347743 4349655 Or never learned about us.
4349679 4351074 The heroes we were.
4351098 4352366 Lives we saved.
4352390 4353658 Or wanted to save.
4353682 4356080 Maybe these two are our chance.
4357279 4358993 To be remembered.
4359017 4360755 The way we deserve.
4361349 4362459 Yes.
4362483 4364064 An ending.
4364088 4365363 - Legacy.<br />- Yes!
4365387 4366572 Yes! Let this man cook.
4366596 4368420 This is what I'm talking about.
4368444 4370269 Big slow-motion fights, sad music.
4370293 4371137 Everybody working together.
4371161 4373173 Who knows if you live or die?<br />That sorta thing.
4373197 4375615 - Who's ready?<br />- I was born ready.
4375639 4376665 Yes! Gambit?
4376689 4377715 I ain't know my daddy,
4377739 4379481 but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.
4379505 4381246 Jesus Christ, that is graphic.
4381270 4383430 Yeah. He was layin' them<br />buttery nuts all up in my mama
4383454 4385508 and I shot out there<br />and I said, "What's up, Doc?"
4385532 4388221 Johnny must have loved you.
4388245 4390663 X-23, what's it gonna be?
4390687 4391355 The name's Laura.
4391379 4394568 - Let's fucking go.<br />- Let's fucking go!
4394592 4395792 It's on like chicken and corn.
4395816 4397538 - Yeah!<br />- We're doing this.
4397562 4398296 You're all fuckin' dead.
4398320 4401664 My God! Read the room.
4411102 4415645 Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'<br />for company. Get out of here.
4417108 4418536 You remind me of him.
4418560 4419988 Angry. Drunk. Mean...
4420012 4423345 - Sounds like a great guy...<br />- Wasn't finished.
4424148 4426755 Showed up when it mattered the most.
4428350 4430660 Couldn't help it.
4433157 4435324 You might not know it, but...
4435456 4437194 you're a good man, Logan.
4438668 4440713 You might not know it, but apparently,
4440737 4442804 I'm the worst Logan.
4443640 4446533 I got to have a life because of you.
4448502 4451175 I got to grow up because of you.
4452539 4453593 A lot of kids did.
4453617 4456884 A lot of kids didn't grow up<br />because of me.
4458281 4460690 Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.
4461251 4463196 That suit says different.
4463220 4466256 - Yeah. Do you like it?<br />- Mm.
4467125 4469831 Scott used to beg me to wear it.
4471327 4474704 So did Jean, Storm, Beast.
4476233 4477441 All of them.
4477465 4481665 They wanted me to be part<br />of the team, but I wouldn't.
4481689 4485913 Told 'em they all look<br />fucking ridiculous. I mean...
4486441 4490478 I couldn't have 'em thinkin'<br />I wanted to be there.
4494955 4497561 And then one day,<br />while I was off on my own,
4497585 4499364 the humans came...
4499388 4501489 and went mutant hunting.
4502061 4503588 I can guess the rest.
4503612 4505163 No, no, let me...
4505735 4507594 Let me say it. I...
4509563 4511400 I need to say it.
4512599 4516019 By the time I stumbled home<br />shitfaced from the bar,
4516043 4517879 it was too late.
4520640 4523346 They were dead. Every...
4528087 4532586 This suit's all I got to<br />remind me of who they were.
4534060 4535622 And what I did.
4547502 4550406 We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.
4550538 4553244 Have fun. Not my fight.
4555378 4558183 We won't pull this off without you.
4563650 4568457 Hey. Whoever you think I am,<br />you got the wrong guy.
4570393 4572901 You were always the wrong guy.
4597661 4598661 What?
4598685 4600498 Alioth didn't get them.
4600522 4603942 Cassandra wanted to<br />play with them herself first.
4603966 4604568 They got away.
4604592 4606340 - Did they find the others?<br />- No.
4606364 4607373 Good. All right. Phew.
4607397 4609293 - The others found them.<br />- Oh, very cute.
4609317 4611213 Well done, Pyro. Classic bait and switch.
4611237 4613885 - You really got me there.<br />- Relax.
4613909 4616350 If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.
4616374 4618153 Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.
4618177 4620420 Why do you think we put her<br />there in the first place?
4620444 4623192 Thank God she's never chosen<br />to leave The Void.
4623216 4625964 The Time Ripper is hours away<br />from completion.
4625988 4627328 I cannot take any chances.
4627352 4628461 Well, maybe not.
4628485 4629511 But I can.
4629535 4630561 For a price.
4630585 4632465 Why do you have to<br />say it in that silly voice?
4632489 4633102 It's so icky.
4633126 4635600 - You want it done or not?<br />- All right. Your price.
4635624 4637371 Take her out.
4637395 4639164 Ugh. Mutants.

4766026 4768105 I don't think you guys<br />walk away from this.
4768129 4770421 You just make sure people know<br />what happened here today.
4770445 4772805 And when you get out of here,<br />you have a drink for me, yeah?
4772829 4775426 You just stay on our six and get inside.
4775450 4778116 We'll make sure you get the package.
4778140 4780405 And we'll get our ending.
4849936 4850936 And boom!
4881242 4884542 Heh. Some motherfuckers still<br />trying to ice skate uphill.
4891153 4893561 You two escaping, I could live with.
4893585 4897324 But coming back? Willingly?
4898193 4899566 Boys are so silly.
4899590 4900600 I just need to get home.
4900624 4903075 Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.
4903099 4907003 It's death or enslavement.<br />A la carte, of course.
4907027 4909435 Upsy-daisy.
4913680 4914680 Finally,
4914704 4917156 it's nice to give someone else<br />a chance to talk.
4917180 4919329 Not my strong suit.
4936594 4938761 You shouldn't have done that.
4957945 4959782 Adios, pendejo.
4961080 4963927 You are an interesting one, aren't you?
4963951 4967724 I do feel like you get lost<br />behind all of his...
4970232 4974269 Deadpools are a dime a dozen<br />here in The Void.
4974533 4976247 But you...
4976271 4979934 What's going on in here?
4988581 4990846 Logan!
4992584 4994652 Interesting...
4994949 4997688 Not what I expected back here.
4998161 5000163 Behind the anger.
5003430 5004506 You're hiding.
5004530 5006277 From them.
5006301 5009238 From all the ones you let down.
5011207 5012934 So much pain.
5015035 5016980 I walked away.
5017004 5019016 They called after me and I...
5019040 5020744 I walked away.
5021084 5022084 I always do.
5022108 5024220 - Logan!<br />- I know.
5025617 5027784 That's not all you did.
5028114 5029114 Is it?
5032294 5034329 You found them.
5034626 5036331 The X-Men.
5041238 5042238 Dead.
5044736 5046638 Piled like wood.
5047342 5049608 What did you do?
5051478 5052950 I started killing.
5052974 5056681 And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.
5057011 5060289 All those bad men.
5063589 5066262 It's not just the bad ones.
5067153 5068924 My little animal.
5070398 5074511 And I turned the whole world<br />against the X-Men.
5074535 5076162 Blade!
5081101 5082806 Just once...
5083345 5087415 I wanna be the man<br />that Charles thought I was.
5088174 5089648 Logan...
5090110 5094851 in The Void, you can be what you are.
5096490 5098749 I just wanna be free.
5098773 5101055 I can set you free.
5111472 5117280 I can silence all those voices.
5124045 5125618 I've got you.
5127554 5129325 I've got you.
5129490 5130887 No.
5131657 5133395 I got you.
5140336 5142479 Get it off!
5142503 5144047 You're gonna send us home,
5144071 5145711 or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.
5145735 5148079 Why are you laughing?
5148103 5148980 I can't send you home
5149004 5152292 unless you get this thing off my head.
5152316 5153149 And as soon as you do that,
5153173 5156136 I'm going to boil your brains<br />on an atomic level
5156160 5159123 whilst flicking my bean<br />to the Enya box set.
5159147 5160663 There's an Enya box set?
5160687 5162395 Either you kill me
5162419 5164151 or I kill you.
5164360 5166030 Both wonderful options.
5166054 5167736 You want me to do it?
5167760 5168340 No, I'll do it.
5168364 5169572 I have her neck right here.
5169596 5171443 - It's really no problem.<br />- You'll screw it up.
5171467 5173346 Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,
5173370 5174203 except the last one!
5174227 5177230 What the fuck?
5177340 5180177 You have no idea
5180201 5180913 what it's like!
5180937 5184247 Day after day. Shovel the shit.
5184271 5185654 Fetch the meats.
5185678 5189484 I have spent my entire exis...
5190452 5191891 Not everyone gets a speech.
5191915 5194399 She's gonna die.
5194423 5196336 Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off,
5196360 5197920 do you promise you won't kill us?
5197944 5199504 - Fuck!<br />- I promise...
5199528 5200933 I will kill you first thing.
5200957 5203343 Oh! Why are you like this?
5203367 5204233 I wish I knew.
5204257 5205421 - Take it off.<br />- What?
5205445 5206609 - Take it off.<br />- Why?
5206633 5208393 - Just take it off.<br />- This is our only chance
5208417 5211551 - to fix our shit!<br />- Take it off!
5212408 5214078 I am wearing this suit.
5214102 5217743 And that means a lot of things,<br />but most of all...
5218447 5220449 it means I'm an X-Man.
5220680 5222847 And I know your brother.
5223973 5225493 As much as I want to fucking kill you,
5225517 5228912 every bone in my body<br />wants to fucking kill you,
5228936 5232593 he would not let me stand here<br />and watch you die!
5234287 5236322 Take your hands off.
5237323 5239259 This is for him.
5240326 5242405 This is for Charles.
5251040 5252920 Hey, no, no, no!
5252944 5255550 Don't you dare do me like Johnny!
5261149 5262920 My brother loved you.
5264152 5265890 He loved all of us.
5266187 5267595 Hmm.
5268387 5270224 Must be nice.
5270323 5272567 He would've loved you, too.
5274602 5276604 If he knew about you...
5277473 5278516 if he knew where you were,
5278540 5281311 he would've torn a hole<br />in the fucking universe
5281335 5283204 to bring you home.
5286339 5287921 This is my home.
5287945 5291377 Well, then at least let us save his.
5294457 5296921 You want to hear something crazy?
5297350 5301794 An amateur magician rolled<br />through here a while back.
5302058 5303607 I killed him, of course.
5303631 5307261 Wore his skin around for four days.
5307447 5308447 But
5308471 5310246 I found this
5310270 5312044 little trinket
5312068 5314178 on his lovely fingers.
5314202 5316336 Strange!
5317975 5321494 - Marvel sparkle circle.<br />- What is that?
5321518 5323253 This is your way home.
5323277 5325123 I do owe you for saving my life.
5325147 5327109 But let's keep things interesting.
5327133 5329095 I'd say you have about four seconds
5329119 5331417 before you're Alioth's food.

5429635 5430635 Whoa.
5430659 5432637 That feels like a Kia.
5432661 5436599 It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?
5436962 5440041 Holy shit. That's Deadpool.
5440065 5440876 And that's Wolverine.
5440900 5442538 You're damn straight it is.
5442562 5443472 Fox killed him.
5443496 5444209 Disney brought him back.
5444233 5446906 They're going to make him<br />do this till he's 90.
5447038 5448312 Let's go.
5448336 5450018 I'll clock you out!
5450042 5451878 Forever!
5452241 5453748 Forever.
5460094 5461094 Wakey-wakey.
5461118 5463791 God?
5463890 5467563 Now, you put all these bullets in my belly,
5467587 5470203 and I'm gonna find out why.
5470227 5471832 Whoa, whoa!
5471931 5473271 I'll just say it.
5473295 5475505 You don't have to stick<br />your fingers in me.
5475529 5478651 Jesus, just ask sometimes.
5478675 5480335 Fine.
5481105 5482379 Really?
5482403 5483821 Hands in pockets.
5485351 5486856 Guy named Paradox.
5486880 5488924 He said he'd get me out of The Void.
5488948 5490993 All I know is he works for the TVA.
5491017 5491663 The TVA.
5491687 5492961 We had an agreement.
5492985 5495162 I don't think this guy cares.
5495186 5496663 Huh. He will.
5496687 5498164 Hey, people!
5498188 5500563 How much longer before<br />the Time Ripper is active?
5500587 5502107 We're running the final safety checks.
5502131 5505139 Oh, okay. All right.<br />Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.
5505163 5506679 - Take your time.<br />- Really?
5506703 5507944 No, you drooling boob!
5507968 5509208 No! We have company.
5509232 5513147 Cancel the safety checks.<br />We need to be live now!
5513171 5515469 Oh, I hate you so much.
5516612 5517612 No! Stop!
5517636 5519086 Piss off! You're too late.
5519110 5521386 - You're fuckin' done.<br />- Why was Thor crying?
5521410 5522287 How dare you!
5522311 5524994 No one comes back from The Void.
5525018 5527382 Tell that to Cassandra Nova.
5535258 5538195 Paradox. We have a problem.
5540296 5542331 Paradox.
5543134 5546378 Well, you are doughier than<br />you looked in Pyro's head.
5546402 5547830 You tried to kill me.
5547854 5549281 I literally have no I...
5549305 5551350 You come for the king,
5551374 5553418 you better kill the king.
5553442 5554154 Oh-ho-ho!
5554178 5556640 Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.
5556664 5559127 You know she doesn't wash that hand.
5559151 5560964 Oh.
5560988 5562615 What's this?
5563247 5564247 A Time Ripper?
5564271 5565198 Naughty boy.
5565222 5566232 Oh, no. We're on it.
5566256 5568399 We're gonna head down<br />and dismantle that thing now.
5568423 5570567 We got ya, boo.<br />You just keep playing those keys.
5570591 5573075 I don't want to destroy it.
5573099 5574075 I want to use it.
5574099 5577696 Now, shoo. Mummy and Daddy<br />are having a conversation.
5583977 5586088 You know, the funny thing is,
5586112 5587583 I was happy in The Void.
5587607 5591522 You sent your trash to me.<br />Alioth and I cleaned it up.
5591546 5593391 Everyone was happy.
5593415 5597264 And then you had to<br />go and piss on my side of the fence.
5597288 5600167 And so now the fence must come down.
5600191 5602521 I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.
5602545 5605079 And I'm going to destroy this universe
5605103 5608376 and the next and the next and the next
5608400 5611674 until all that's left is The Void.
5611698 5613983 And I get to play God.
5614007 5615546 Come on.
5615570 5616447 Now you're going to show me
5616471 5618350 how to use this fancy gadget of yours.
5618374 5620254 And don't worry, I've called some friends
5620278 5622884 to make sure we're not disturbed.
5625018 5626194 Sorry to bother, madam,
5626218 5627964 but there's something you need to see.
5627988 5631067 We're getting indications<br />of an unsanctioned Time Ripper
5631091 5634192 activating on Earth-10005.
5635160 5637195 Whose district is that?
5637393 5638801 Paradox.
5649141 5651516 Well, thank you so much<br />for your help, darling.
5651540 5654156 God. Good to get out of that head.
5654180 5656852 Whew! What a mess!
5663330 5664330 Stop!
5664354 5666465 Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.

5717979 5719583 What's Cafe Gratitude doing here?
5719607 5721569 Sorry about that.
5721593 5723555 Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.
5723579 5724908 I'll handle him.
5724932 5726260 Come here, girl. Papa's here.
5726284 5729561 Hey, do not insult<br />this animal's autonomy.
5729585 5731282 She can decide who her papa is.
5731306 5733003 What's it gonna be, girl, huh?
5733027 5735137 Original recipe or Van Milder here?
5735161 5739978 Ah, that's funny. I can gently<br />tap the fourth wall too.
5740002 5741761 The Proposal.
5742343 5743343 The fuck was that?
5743367 5745379 Bitch, you think that's what I do?
5745403 5746346 Both of you shut up.
5746370 5748679 You smell somethin'?
5748703 5749382 Yeah, you.
5749406 5751572 A lot of you.
5766588 5769228 Told you there were<br />a lot of Deadpools over there.
5781075 5782901 That's bad.
5804296 5806044 I take it they're not friendly.
5806068 5806769 Goodness, no.
5806793 5808441 Sorry about this, boys. Mission over.
5808465 5812248 Cause of death, one hundred<br />kill-thirsty Deadpools.
5812272 5812874 They're dumb.
5812898 5814298 But they can fight. Not me, though.
5814322 5817253 Would love to get in the mix,<br />but I have low bone density
5817277 5818804 and I have to keep my face safe.
5818828 5820354 Hold, please.
5820378 5823325 - Oh, God.<br />- All right. Look.
5823349 5824844 Guys!
5825350 5826591 Deadpool Prime here.
5826615 5828561 - Our fight isn't with you...<br />- Hey!
5828585 5829594 When I want your opinion,
5829618 5832169 I'll take Wolverine's dick<br />out of your mouth.
5832193 5833604 That's Kidpool. She's the dirtiest.
5833628 5835039 Can we just be done?
5835063 5837240 Ooh, we're just getting started.
5837264 5839423 No, no, no, no, no.
5839447 5841630 With the whole multiverse thing.
5842037 5843564 It's not great.
5843588 5845116 It's just been miss
5845140 5846529 after miss
5846553 5847942 after miss.
5847966 5850418 Look, The Wizard of Oz<br />did the multiverse first,
5850442 5853718 and they did it best. The gays knew it.
5853742 5854619 But we didn't listen.
5854643 5857358 Let's just take the I and move on.
5857382 5860164 I think it's been<br />steadily great since Endgame.
5860188 5862199 What are you talking about?
5862223 5863430 The multiverse is over.
5863454 5864927 Cassandy gonna destroy
5864951 5866532 the fuck outta every timeline.
5866556 5868172 Heh. Y'all can't do shit about it.
5868196 5869073 Do you not get it?
5869097 5870438 If we don't go down to the subway
5870462 5871306 and stop her, we all die.
5871330 5872605 Say, the boss lady
5872629 5873605 don't want no disturbances.
5873629 5875740 You wanna get down to the subway,
5875764 5877181 you gotta go through us.
5877205 5878214 Uzi time, baby.
5878238 5879782 Uzi time, baby.
5879806 5881373 Look alive!
5889744 5891690 - I think I'm hit.<br />- No shit.
5891714 5892459 You did that on purpose.
5892483 5894528 I did no such thing!
5894552 5895264 Listen to me, gorgeous.
5895288 5897333 How long does it take<br />for you to regenerate?
5897357 5899292 Regenerate?
5903989 5906144 You really are<br />God's perfect idiot, aren't you?
5906168 5907772 - I'm okay.<br />- How dare you!
5907796 5909443 You insensitive son of a bitch!
5909467 5912150 How was I supposed to know<br />he doesn't regenerate?
5912174 5913150 I'm not a medicine woman.
5913174 5915945 Look. A donut cart.<br />They're practically hospitals.
5915969 5916879 - What?<br />- They sell
5916903 5918383 - portable triage units.<br />- They don't.
5918407 5920212 I'm gonna get you to safety.
5920236 5922315 - He's not.<br />- Deep breath.
5929619 5931399 Hey, why are we stopping?
5931423 5932565 I'm just catching my breath.
5932589 5935965 What, are your legs on<br />vacation? You're dead weight!
5935989 5937149 That's because I'm paralyzed.
5937173 5940112 We all have problems. Listen to me.
5940136 5941763 You're gonna live.
5942170 5943918 Look at me, Nicepool.
5947406 5949375 You're gonna live.
5949540 5951221 Say it!
5951245 5952354 I'm gonna live.
5952378 5954654 Say it with me. You're gonna live.
5954678 5956556 I'm gonna live!
5956580 5960627 Ha-hah! Say it louder!
5960651 5962520 I'm gonna live...
5970726 5972794 Hold your fire!
5974059 5976171 Sweet little puppy.
5985180 5987158 God damn it!
5987182 5989161 I don't think he's gonna make it.
5989185 5990656 God, he loved his face.
5990680 5993495 I can taste his final thought.
5993519 5994727 He was so afraid.
5994751 5995958 But he died a hero.
5995982 5997861 He died from murder, you dumb fuck.
5997885 6000921 And all I have to remember him by
6001086 6002602 are these two gold-plated,
6002626 6005375 ...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.
6005399 6006927 This is for him.
6007059 6008377 Are you ready?
6008401 6010446 I get to kill a hundred yous?
6010470 6012282 Fuck yeah, I'm ready.
6012306 6014109 Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.

6179067 6181706 is that God-awful dismount!
6185237 6187458 What you laughing at, you little fucker?
6187482 6188723 Uh-oh.
6188747 6190429 Uh-oh.
6194015 6196523 I guess these ones regenerate.
6197425 6200405 Come on. We don't have time for this.
6200429 6201571 Deadpools!
6201595 6203497 Stand down.
6213232 6214683 This Deadpool's with me.
6214707 6215948 Oh, no.
6215972 6217212 Holy shit.
6217236 6219172 That's fuckin' Peter!
6221581 6223152 Wait, you... You guys know Peter?
6223176 6225562 You kidding me?<br />Every Deadpool has a Peter.
6225586 6228323 Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend
6228347 6230061 in every Deadpool's world.
6230085 6232393 Peter-san. Hai.
6239159 6241775 Peter. Peter. Peter.
6241799 6244630 Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter.
6244654 6247485 Peter. Peter. Peter.
6247509 6249839 Enjoy my Peter.
6276338 6277338 Oh, now you're here.
6277362 6279275 Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.
6279299 6279978 Not yet, it's not.
6280002 6282047 Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.
6282071 6283449 Homestretch, folks. Promise.
6283473 6284851 Quick, let's up the stakes.
6284875 6286435 If she steals the Time Ripper's energy,
6286459 6288889 she has the power to shred<br />the fabric of all realities
6288913 6291155 until there is nothing left but The Void.
6291179 6292530 How do we shut it down?
6292554 6293652 I don't know.
6294994 6295994 How about now?
6296018 6298046 The mask is really intimidating, huh?
6298070 6300098 It's like Batman,<br />except he can move his neck.
6300122 6302231 Okay, look, look, look.
6302255 6305284 The Ripper is fed from<br />a secure chamber below ground.
6305308 6308337 It is powered by twin matter<br />and anti-matter feeds
6308361 6309976 converging inside the device.
6310000 6310778 Now, Cassandra Nova
6310802 6312122 is redirecting the Ripper's power
6312146 6314277 to eliminate all timelines,<br />starting with this one.
6314301 6315621 Theoretically, you could stop her
6315645 6317645 by short-circuiting the feeds<br />in the chamber below.
6317669 6320085 One of you were to create a<br />circuit between the two feeds,
6320109 6322703 then the released power<br />would destroy the machine.
6322727 6325321 - But, well... But...<br />- Come on, man.
6325345 6327322 If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.
6327346 6331294 Whoever formed the bridge<br />would be annihilated.
6331318 6332030 I could live with that.
6332054 6333814 Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.
6333838 6335214 You know, we survive anything.<br />We're like cockroaches.
6335238 6336266 Not this time.
6336290 6338476 This is matter and anti-matter.
6338500 6340302 They do not play nicely with each other.
6340326 6343107 When they mix in your body,<br />you will be atomized.
6343131 6345912 Trust the laws of physics<br />if you don't trust me.
6345936 6348718 Even if you lived long enough<br />to make the circuit,
6348742 6352239 you will die down there.
6376538 6377911 Hold off. Hold.
6377935 6379215 You heard that asshole upstairs.
6379239 6384116 Even if we pull this off,<br />we're dead. Permanently.
6384140 6387439 - That's why it's got to be me.<br />- What?
6390442 6392288 Look, man...
6392312 6395028 you didn't ask for any of this.
6395052 6396535 You were right.
6396559 6398063 I lied.
6398087 6399394 I lied right to your face
6399418 6402663 just to get you to help me. And you did.
6403059 6405160 You didn't lie.
6406194 6408460 You made an educated wish.
6411133 6412506 Come on.
6412530 6415533 You got a whole world to go back to.
6416468 6418239 I got nothin'.
6419614 6421374 I got nothin'.
6425653 6427413 Give me this.
6434057 6435630 Hey.
6438930 6441900 I waited a long time for this team-up.
6443462 6445398 You know something?
6446333 6449022 You were the best Wolverine.
6456574 6459445 Say hi to your friends for me.
6471104 6472104 No!
6472128 6472742 Open the door!
6472766 6475438 I can't hear you<br />over all the noble sacrifice.
6475462 6477010 Why are you fucking doing this?
6477034 6481203 Because I'm Marvel Jesus.
6482270 6483777 Or Spock.
6484437 6485905 Hard to say.
6490047 6492141 Wade!
6492165 6494282 You fucking idiot!
6496955 6499968 Sorry, I'm just stalling.
6499992 6502895 I think I'm nervous about dying.
6503126 6504169 This should be me.
6504193 6506601 Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.
6506625 6507304 Wade!
6507328 6509439 You want to be an annoying prick,<br />do it this side!
6509463 6512201 You're gonna die in there,<br />you dumb fuck!
6518603 6520449 Hey! You don't need to do this.
6520473 6523519 I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.
6523543 6526347 I'm doing it because they do.
6537193 6538799 No!
6567388 6569654 He's not gonna make it.
6577739 6579499 It's over.

6757985 6759292 You've been busy.
6759316 6760128 Well, somebody had to be.
6760152 6762296 We had some strange readings<br />from this location.
6762320 6763600 You wouldn't know anything about
6763624 6765480 an unsanctioned Time Ripper,<br />would you?
6765504 6767408 Uh, no. No. I wouldn't know anything
6767432 6769389 about an unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6769413 6771371 Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.
6771395 6772140 Because I was assured
6772164 6774539 that she was safely held<br />in The Void. But no,
6774563 6776474 she was here. And she fondled my brain.
6776498 6779214 - How did you let this happen?<br />- You weren't involved at all?
6779238 6782283 In stopping her, yes! Yes, I was.
6782307 6783217 But not nearly enough.
6783241 6786948 Not as much as the men<br />who went down there after her.
6787278 6788741 My men.
6789016 6790545 My friends.
6790885 6791885 I warned them.
6791909 6794069 That they would be completely<br />obliterated if they went.
6794093 6796666 But they went anyway. Like...
6797387 6798486 Like heroes.
6800654 6802821 Because that's who they were.
6804493 6807265 They just did what they had to do.
6807364 6810268 With no concern for their own safety.
6812435 6816185 The fact that we are all still standing here
6816209 6819937 is a testament to their heroism.
6822511 6824259 Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
6824283 6826185 to bring them back now.

6855347 6856092 Fine indeed.
6856116 6859624 All right. Put your greasy tits away,
6859648 6860492 you preening slut.
6860516 6862208 I don't understand.
6862232 6863924 How are you two still alive?
6863948 6866301 You were right. One<br />of us would have been killed.
6866325 6868303 But you put a Deadpool
6868327 6869138 and a Wolverine together,
6869162 6872010 make 'em hold hands<br />while listening to Madonna...
6872034 6874077 indestructible, motherfucker.
6874101 6876410 Let's get this Deadpool<br />Variant back to The Void.
6876434 6877972 Wait, hold on. What?
6877996 6878972 Nope. Actually...
6878996 6881052 This one's homegrown, like me.
6881076 6882014 He belongs here.
6882038 6882976 And you are?
6883000 6886740 Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.
6887576 6889545 And I hope that you do.
6894649 6896595 What the fuck is happening here?
6896619 6897991 You are under judgment
6898015 6900203 for operating<br />an unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6900227 6901587 - Take him.<br />- I was just doing what
6901611 6903414 you don't have the guts to do.
6904131 6907926 Get your insolent hands off me! Get off!
6908465 6910863 I'm grateful, gentlemen.
6911072 6911774 Let's hold the bows.
6911798 6914316 You led an Omega-level mutant<br />to this timeline.
6914340 6915933 - You're welcome.<br />- And you
6915957 6918012 shouldn't even be near this timeline.
6918036 6920091 - He's welcome.<br />- And you
6920115 6922192 look damn good in that suit.
6922216 6923876 I'm so sorry.
6927451 6929882 I wanna show you something.
6929991 6930991 Something huge.
6931015 6934227 That's what<br />Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.
6935195 6936469 Do you see that?
6936493 6939199 Your universe is regenerating.
6939364 6941001 Whatever you did here,
6941025 6943179 you not only saved your world.
6943203 6946701 You spared your timeline from extinction.
6947613 6948613 I'd rest up.
6948637 6951221 I have a feeling your work<br />is only just getting started.
6951245 6954048 Till you're 90.
6954072 6954916 Wait! Um...
6954940 6958789 We couldn't have made it out<br />of The Void without some help
6958813 6962397 from some people<br />that the world kind of...
6962421 6962990 kind of forgot.
6963014 6966236 Is there any way that<br />you could maybe find a way
6966260 6968261 to bring them home?
6968964 6969964 I'll see what I can do.
6969988 6972984 And, um, I promised my friend here
6973008 6976004 that the TVA could undo<br />some pretty awful shit
6976028 6976641 in his timeline.
6976665 6978413 What would you say to that?
6978437 6979347 Change the past?
6979371 6981614 Well, he did help me save the world.
6981638 6985255 And his past made him<br />the man who did it.
6985279 6988677 There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.
6989612 6991284 Logan.
6993451 6996487 - Shawarma? Yeah.<br />- I could eat.
7004990 7008575 You know, the Avengers<br />discovered shawarma.
7008599 7011304 They'd be lucky to have you.
7017640 7020224 - Oh.<br />- Oh, come on.
7020248 7021776 Fuck off!
7022073 7023358 Come here, my little cunchkin.
7023382 7025229 Yes, it's you.
7025253 7027462 You're a survivor.
7027486 7028121 Mwah.
7028145 7030818 Oh, all is right in the world.
7031522 7033260 Yes, it is.
7034052 7036230 So what are you gonna do next?
7036527 7039728 I'll figure it out. I always do.
7040025 7041607 All right.
7041631 7042928 So I'll probably see you around?
7048407 7050167 Probably not.
7052675 7054446 See you, bub.
7063356 7065182 Logan.
7071023 7072534 Al. I'm back.
7072558 7074068 About damn time.
7074092 7077105 You holdin'? I'm all outta devil's dandruff,
7077129 7079415 and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.
7079439 7082220 Thank you, Al. We have company.
7082244 7083721 Althea, this is...
7083745 7085222 This is Logan.
7085246 7088137 - Nice to meet you, Logan.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
7088161 7091053 And this little ancient anal<br />shit-knot is Mary Puppins.
7091077 7093329 Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.
7093353 7096431 You want to treat yourself<br />to a little stroke?
7096455 7100232 - Get the tongue. There it is.<br />- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!
7100256 7104033 Right? It's like an armadillo<br />fucked a gremlin, angrily,
7104057 7105605 - in a bed of gonorrhea...<br />- Wow.
7105629 7109193 ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.
7109402 7111039 Everyone wants to matter.
7111063 7114648 Turns out that you don't need<br />to be Marvel Jesus to do it.
7114672 7118421 You just need to open<br />your eyes and look around.
7118445 7120323 And if you're lucky,
7120347 7122458 you'll find a few friends.
7122482 7124360 Old friends,
7124384 7126914 and some new ones too.
7130390 7133657 Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.
7143479 7144479 Oh, hi.

7299658 7303540 I was there for three weeks<br />before I shot a single thing.
7303564 7305938 At our first day of shooting,
7305962 7307268 I was so nervous, man.
7307292 7309480 Everyone was sort of going,<br />"Who's this guy?"
7309504 7311344 You know, there was a lot of that and,
7311368 7313827 you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"
7313851 7316310 You can feel all that kind of pressure.
7316334 7320910 It's always the suit's fault.<br />Never the actor.

7345864 7347374 For medical research.
7347398 7349972 - Bye-bye, video.<br />- Bye.
7603027 7606304 I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors
7606328 7608395 that I got Johnny killed.
7608593 7610496 Let's look at the tape.
7611045 7612045 In The Void,
7612069 7614246 you're either food for Alioth
7614270 7616238 or you work for her.
7618405 7619514 Go on, Johnny.
7619538 7621649 And I'll tell you who "her" is.
7621673 7622253 Cassandra Nova.
7622277 7624173 A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.
7624197 7626092 A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab
7626116 7628491 of third rate dime-store nut-milk.<br />And I'll tell you
7628515 7630245 - what she can do.<br />- I'm listening.
7630269 7631949 She can lick my goddamn<br />cinnamon ring clean
7631973 7633573 and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
7633597 7635971 In fact, I don't give a shit<br />if she removes all my skin
7635995 7638567 and pops me like some<br />nightmarish blood balloon.
7638591 7639336 If the last thing I do
7639360 7641471 in this godforsaken cum-gutter existence
7641495 7643407 is light that fuck-box on fire,
7643431 7644143 I still won't die happy.
7644167 7645441 Holy shit, girl. You crazy.
7645465 7648676 That's right, Wade.<br />I won't be happy until I've urinated
7648700 7650331 on her freshly barbecued corpse
7650355 7652127 and husk-fucked the charred remains
7652151 7654092 while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.
7654116 7656057 - Wow!<br />- And you can quote me.
7656081 7657756 'Kay.
7657780 7659479 Got you, fuck face.
