1376 3754 CON LI : <i>Welcome to<br />our audio commentary</i>
3837 6173 <i>on our film</i> Treasure Planet.
6256 8509 <i>My name's Roy Conli.</i><br /><i>I'm the producer of the film.</i>
9301 10427 <i>And I'm Ron Clements.</i>
10511 13847 <i>I'm the co-director and co-writer<br />of the film.</i>
13931 17684 <i>And this is John Musker,<br />the other co-director/co-writer.</i>
17768 21063 <i>Hi. I'm Glen Keane.<br />I'm a supervising animator at Disney,</i>
21146 26401 <i>and my job on this film was to design<br />and animate the character John Silver.</i>
26944 31281 <i>Hi. I'm John Ripa, and I was<br />supervising animator on Jim Hawkins.</i>
31365 35369 <i>Hi. I'm Ian Gooding. I'm the associate<br />art director on</i> Treasure Planet,
35452 40207 <i>and hopefully I can give you<br />some insight into how color is done</i>
40290 44378 <i>on a Disney animated feature<br />during the course of this commentary.</i>
45587 47005 MUSKER: <i>The entire prologue here,</i>
47089 50217 <i>we actually changed around<br />during the course of production,</i>
50300 51760 <i>in that it used to take place...</i>
51843 56056 <i>The story used to be told first-person.</i><br /><i>Jim was the adult narrator of this story,</i>
56139 58684 <i>and he sort of pulled us into it,<br />but we discovered through the course</i>
58767 61645 <i>of some previews and whatnot<br />that it was playing kind of dark,</i>
61728 63647 <i>and we didn't have Jim<br />as a character involved in it,</i>
63730 66942 <i>so fairly late into production,<br />we reworked this opening</i>
67025 69736 <i>such that we see young Jim as a child.</i>
69820 72322 <i>We don't hear Jim<br />as an adult narrator anymore,</i>
72406 74032 <i>we hear Tony Jay who is...</i>
74116 77953 <i>Those of you voice recognition experts<br />from the FBI know</i>
78036 82082 <i>he was the voice of Frollo<br />in</i> Hunchback,
82165 84001 <i>in which Roy worked closely with Tony</i>
84084 85961 <i>and knew him from theatrical days<br />as I understand it.</i>
86044 87879 CLEMENTS: <i>Great voice.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>Exactly.</i>
91174 94761 CLEMENTS: <i>Now we see young Jim,<br />little five-year-old Jim Hawkins.</i>
95596 98348 <i>Voices of Laurie Metcalf<br />and Austin Majors,</i>
98432 103186 <i>who is the little kid on</i> NYPD Blue,<br /><i>he plays Dennis Franz's son.</i>
103270 104271 CONLI: <i>You should talk<br />about the recording.</i>
104354 105355 MUSKER: <i>Yes, he was recording</i>
105439 107065 <i>in the same room<br />that we're in right now, actually,</i>
107149 109860 <i>and he was funny 'cause we had<br />Glen Keane in here working with him</i>
109943 112487 <i>'cause Glen really works well<br />with children</i>
112571 114114 <i>and was gonna animate some of this,</i>
114197 115741 <i>and we wanted to get him involved<br />in the recording,</i>
115824 118160 <i>and so Austin was all over the place,</i>
118243 120996 <i>so they had to put tape on the floor,<br />"Austin, stay by the tape, "</i>
121079 124625 <i>and it was an interesting<br />recording session.</i>
125000 126251 KEANE: <i>This was fun for me</i>
126335 130088 <i>because after doing Long John Silver<br />for the whole film,</i>
130172 134009 <i>to get a chance to do something cute,</i>
134092 136595 <i>it wasn't supposed to<br />look mean and ugly.</i>
136678 138138 <i>It was a nice change.</i>
138221 140849 RIPA: <i>Yeah, well,<br />we certainly appreciated</i>
140932 142893 <i>and needed your help at the time.</i>
142976 144436 MUSKER: <i>Jim's mother, Sarah,</i>
144519 146229 <i>it was an interesting<br />acting challenge for us</i>
146313 148982 <i>because we wanted to find someone<br />whose voice was old enough</i>
149066 150567 <i>that you bought as his mother,<br />and yet young enough</i>
150651 153195 <i>because she had Jim at an early age.</i>
153570 157824 <i>And Laurie Metcalf was special to us in<br />that she could play the maternal thing,</i>
157908 162037 <i>but she could get this sort of weariness<br />of being the single mother</i>
162120 164164 <i>who really had to make ends meet<br />on her own,</i>
164247 168752 <i>and yet a kind of vulnerability<br />underneath the kind of toughness</i>
168835 171338 <i>that she had to acquire to be<br />her own woman.</i>
171421 174841 <i>Sarah's clean-up,<br />that is the refined drawings done</i>
174925 178178 <i>over the rough animator's drawings<br />was done by Vera Pacheco,</i>
178261 181640 <i>a wonderful draftsperson<br />and the woman who, in fact,</i>
181723 185352 <i>supervised all of the clean-up<br />animation on the entire movie.</i>
185435 187020 <i>And Vera did a wonderful job</i>
187104 191608 <i>of really giving us<br />such a rich-looking, well-drawn film.</i>
192317 194695 <i>It had to be crafted particularly well.</i>
194778 197739 <i>It's being blown up<br />to large format systems,</i>
197823 201243 <i>and every little nuance<br />shows up on those big screens,</i>
201326 204329 <i>and we've been delighted to see<br />how solid the drawing is,</i>
204413 208625 <i>and our hats are off to Vera<br />for the great job she did on this movie.</i>
212921 214673 CONLI: <i>This was actually...</i><br /><i>As we said we changed the story.</i>
214756 218218 <i>John had this idea of doing this<br />whole thing with the storybook,</i>
218301 221638 <i>making this pop-up book,<br />which wasn't part of the original thing,</i>
221722 224391 <i>and then we take this into<br />the transition to Jim Hawkins.</i>
224474 226226 <i>He's now 15-years-old.</i>
226309 228979 <i>We added that title<br />just in case you didn't know</i>
229062 231398 <i>that it was several years later.</i>
231898 233984 RIPA: <i>This section was a lot of fun.</i>
234067 237112 <i>Jin Kim, who was one<br />of the animators on the character,</i>
237195 239322 <i>did such an outstanding job.</i>
239740 241408 <i>These scenes were very difficult.</i>
241491 244411 <i>They dealt<br />with a three-dimensional board,</i>
244494 247622 <i>which, a lot of times,<br />he had to indicate beforehand,</i>
247706 249583 <i>3-D moving backgrounds.</i>
250375 253545 <i>He just really took to it<br />and did such a fun job.</i>
253962 257382 <i>The sequence, overall,<br />was just a lot of fun to design</i>
257466 260552 <i>and come up with movements<br />and poses, it really uses a lot of things.</i>
260635 265932 <i>It kind of went X Game crazy, I guess,<br />where there's sky surfing,</i>
266016 269811 <i>there's windsurfing, there's<br />skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing.</i>
269895 272773 <i>It kind of incorporates<br />a little bit of everything.</i>
272856 276651 <i>Also, Anthony Wong, Mike Cedeno,<br />John Pomeroy</i>
276735 278195 <i>did these few scenes here.</i>
278528 281198 <i>Um, Danny Galieote,<br />some of the other animators</i>
281281 282449 <i>that worked on the character</i>
282532 284659 <i>and just did a nice job,<br />everybody matching each other,</i>
284743 286536 <i>and clean-up did a nice job</i>
286620 288413 <i>because everybody does draw<br />a little bit different.</i>
288497 291708 <i>No matter what you do, everybody<br />has their set way of drawing.</i>
291792 295837 <i>And did a nice job pulling the character<br />into a consistent range.</i>
295921 299633 GOODING: <i>Establishing shot of the<br />Benbow Inn, painted by Carl Jones.</i>
300342 304095 <i>Really interesting 70/30 rule<br />that we had,</i>
304179 310143 <i>which was 70% 18th century mostly,<br />and 30% science fiction,</i>
310227 314481 <i>so we have half-timbered houses<br />with all sorts of techie stuff on them.</i>
316650 320737 CONLI: <i>And here we introduce<br />Doctor Doppler, David Hyde Pierce.</i>
320821 324157 <i>This part was written<br />with David Hyde Pierce in mind.</i>
324241 326493 MUSKER: <i>Ironically, then we tested<br />a bunch of other actors</i>
326576 328036 <i>before coming back<br />to David Hyde Pierce.</i>
328119 329871 <i>Why we did that, I don't know exactly.</i>
329955 332415 CONLI: <i>Because it's your prerogative.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>I know.</i>
332499 336336 CONLI: <i>Well, we wanted to make sure,<br />but he was definitely right for the part.</i>
336419 339089 <i>Although, we struggled a little bit<br />trying to get the right feeling,</i>
339172 341007 <i>and this bit here with the little girl,</i>
341091 344302 <i>this was added, actually,<br />fairly late in the game.</i>
344386 346763 <i>We felt we needed<br />a better introduction to Doppler.</i>
346847 348098 (SCREAMS)
348557 350141 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we had a meeting<br />with some other writers</i>
350225 353687 <i>and story people to kick around<br />ideas for punching up his introduction.</i>
354437 356189 <i>Baird and Gerson,<br />if I've got their names straight,</i>
356273 358400 <i>they did some writing in this area,<br />some of which is here.</i>
358483 360986 <i>And David certainly was<br />a great improv guy,</i>
361069 363238 <i>so some of his funniest dialogue<br />throughout the film,</i>
363321 365824 <i>and even in this section,<br />were things that he winged in,</i>
365907 368785 <i>and he was just great,<br />great to work with, funny.</i>
369119 370453 Ooh. . . Wrong turn.
370537 373290 - Okay. Thanks for the lift, guys.<br />- Not so fast.
373373 379713 RIPA: <i>Joey Gordon-Levitt did the voice<br />of Jim, and that was just really a treat.</i>
379796 381715 <i>He did such a good job.</i>
382340 384467 <i>One of the things, as supervising<br />animator that you get to do,</i>
384551 386845 <i>which is really cool, is you get to go<br />to the recording sessions,</i>
386928 391933 <i>and watching Joey record the lines<br />was really inspiring.</i>
392017 394644 <i>He has a good, strong range,</i>
394728 397606 <i>and I always felt like<br />he put a lot of emotion into it.</i>
397689 401693 <i>There were some scenes that he did<br />that were so explosive,</i>
401776 405322 <i>and you're just chomping at the bit.</i><br /><i>You really can't wait to get to them.</i>
405405 411036 <i>And another thing that he did<br />that I really was inspired by</i>
411828 413330 <i>was you felt he believed<br />in the character,</i>
413413 417751 <i>and he had a certain take<br />on the character,</i>
417834 423173 <i>and if lines came up that he wasn't<br />comfortable or sure about,</i>
423256 426718 <i>where it didn't feel like the character,<br />he'd try and improve them,</i>
426801 429679 <i>and come up with lines<br />that he could believe</i>
429763 431264 <i>were coming from this character.</i>
431348 435018 <i>And that's kind of what we do as a<br />supervisor when we approach a scene,</i>
435101 437395 <i>is to try and find something<br />that's true to the character,</i>
437479 440190 <i>and something that you believe in<br />and feels right.</i>
440273 443902 <i>And to watch him doing<br />the same things at the voice level,</i>
443985 449074 <i>really helped to set up and inspire me<br />and our team, I think,</i>
449157 451868 <i>for the scenes that we<br />were going to do.</i>
452869 454204 Jim?
454621 456206 Jim, look at me.
457791 460585 CONLI: <i>We added this bit<br />with Jim helping clear the tables</i>
460669 462796 <i>just to make him<br />a little more sympathetic.</i>
462879 466049 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, this was John Ripa's<br />idea to make Jim a little more active.</i>
466174 467884 <i>He's actually helping his mother out<br />in the end, here,</i>
467968 469302 <i>rather than just standing there<br />kind of moping.</i>
469386 473306 <i>We wanted to make him more active<br />to build a little sympathy for him.</i>
473390 475767 <i>In the earlier versions of the story,<br />he used to just sort of walk out</i>
475850 478311 <i>in the middle of their conversation.</i><br /><i>She'd turn around and he was gone.</i>
478395 480855 <i>That seemed maybe a little</i> too <i>rude,</i>
480939 484317 <i>so we reworked it where he stayed<br />there in the scene.</i>
489114 493368 CONLI: <i>Lot of discussion about this<br />and the off-screen conversation</i>
493451 495161 <i>and what Sarah would say.</i>
495245 499082 MUSKER: <i>I thought it was more<br />emotional to have Jim be listening,</i>
499165 500291 <i>and hear himself discussed.</i>
500375 503169 <i>It just seemed like that if you're a kid<br />and you're hearing your parents</i>
503253 505922 <i>talk about you or adults talk about you,<br />they're not aware of it,</i>
506006 508800 <i>and you're overhearing this,<br />and they can speak frankly</i>
508883 510802 <i>about what they feel about you,<br />but you're on...</i>
510885 513013 <i>We sort of see his face<br />as he's hearing this,</i>
513096 515056 <i>we just thought this was a way<br />of getting inside his head</i>
515140 517183 <i>and feeling a little more<br />sympathy for him.</i>
517267 520061 <i>This dialogue used to be played<br />in a scene where he wasn't there,</i>
520145 523690 <i>and we just felt it was good<br />to play the dialogue off his face.</i>
523773 526484 CONLI: <i>There was also a question,<br />like the father thing,</i>
526568 531114 <i>this was the first real reference<br />to the father and that he's not there.</i>
531197 534200 <i>It was a big question about how much<br />to say at this point,</i>
534284 537287 <i>how much to reveal, and how much<br />to reveal in the course of the story</i>
537370 542959 <i>because Jim's loss of his father<br />is a big part of his problem,</i>
544544 547464 <i>but we didn't want to say it all</i> too <i>early.</i>
548048 549632 MUSKER: <i>We've got<br />Billy Bones' entrance here,</i>
549716 551134 <i>who is voiced by Patrick McGoohan,</i>
551217 553762 <i>who those of you fellow boomers know</i>
553845 556723 <i>from</i> The Prisoner<br /><i>and</i> Secret Agent Man.
556806 558558 Braveheart, <i>more recently.</i>
558641 559768 <i>And</i> The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh.
559851 562062 <i>So, it was a big geek fest for all of us<br />baby boomers</i>
562145 566191 <i>to be recording Patrick McGoohan,<br />who came in and was actually having</i>
566274 570695 <i>a very bad cold, was very phlegmy<br />and coughy, and it worked well</i>
570779 572947 <i>with things like this,<br />with his coughs of...</i>
573031 574157 CONLI: <i>He loved doing that coughing.</i>
574240 575325 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, 50 different coughs.</i>
575408 577994 CONLI: <i>I think he did... We could have<br />10 minutes of. that cough.</i>
578078 582707 KEANE: <i>Nancy Beiman, who did<br />this Billy Bones character,</i>
582791 585001 <i>she researches everything.</i>
585085 591508 <i>This character was truly a believable,<br />organic character.</i>
591591 594928 <i>She developed his whole planet<br />where he had come from.</i>
595011 596304 <i>He's kind of from a turtle planet.</i>
596387 600100 <i>The way the neck comes out,<br />she had worked on all the anatomy.</i>
600183 604312 <i>Everything that she put into him,<br />there's nothing by chance on this guy.</i>
604395 607440 <i>And she's a pretty good example<br />of all the animators,</i>
607524 612403 <i>how everybody takes these characters<br />so seriously. These are real to them.</i>
612487 614823 And there he'll be, just the way he was.
614906 618284 A smiling, happy little boy,<br />holding a new pet
618368 620745 and begging me to let him keep it.
621162 623414 CONLI: <i>We used to have a line here<br />when Doppler opened the door</i>
623498 625875 <i>where he said,<br />"In the dream, is the pet dead?"</i>
625959 628545 <i>Which was John's line,<br />but as it played,</i>
628628 632715 <i>it almost seemed like the audience was<br />ahead of it, and we didn't need the line.</i>
632799 634634 MUSKER: <i>And this is funny<br />'cause some people thought</i>
634717 635802 <i>when Billy said, "My chest!"</i>
635885 638054 <i>Like you got shot in the chest,<br />and if you look at the chest,</i>
638138 640682 <i>that spelling almost spells "Ron"<br />backwards and upside-down.</i>
640765 642475 CONLI: <i>Not deliberately,<br />it just sort of came out that way.</i>
642559 644435 MUSKER: <i>I think there will be<br />several lawsuits involving that</i>
644519 646146 <i>by the time you hear this commentary.</i>
646229 647313 CONLI: <i>By Ron?</i>
647397 648940 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. By someone.</i><br /><i>I don't know.</i>
649315 652819 CON LI : <i>This was where we had our<br />first</i> Star Trek <i>joke in the movie.</i>
652902 656156 <i>There used to be Doppler examine<br />Bones and then he said the line,</i>
656239 657323 <i>"He's dead, Jim."</i>
657407 659826 <i>And it was a funny line<br />and some people really liked it,</i>
659909 662787 <i>but it felt like it wasn't right<br />for what was going on there,</i>
662871 666124 <i>the emotion was</i> too <i>serious,<br />so we took the line out.</i>
666207 669627 MUSKER: <i>These holo-blinds here<br />that sort of work like venetian blinds,</i>
669711 672380 <i>but they show off a different scene.</i>
672463 674924 <i>Tina Price,<br />our assistant artistic coordinator,</i>
675008 679053 <i>was involved in developing this idea,<br />as was Ian Gooding and Andy Gaskill,</i>
679137 681764 <i>and Dave Tidgwell on effects,</i>
681848 687103 <i>and it really was a fun visual way<br />to mask the bleak planet outside.</i>
687187 688980 <i>And I'll tell you, at one point<br />we had more different scenes</i>
689063 690064 <i>that they went through, I think,</i>
690148 692483 <i>where again, in the interest of time,<br />we don't have as many,</i>
692567 695320 <i>but we just liked the idea<br />that it was sort of</i>
695403 697697 <i>an analogous thing to a phenomenon<br />people know,</i>
697780 700283 <i>venetian blinds<br />with sort of a sci-fi twist to it.</i>
700366 701993 CONLI: <i>I like to call them<br />Venutian blinds.</i>
702076 703620 MUSKER: <i>Venutian blinds, right.</i><br /><i>Venutian blinds.</i>
703703 705872 CLEMENTS: <i>We also used to have<br />a scene, a kind of dramatic scene</i>
705955 709375 <i>where the window<br />was blown to pieces,</i>
709459 712754 <i>shattered by the pirates<br />as they're bursting in the Benbow.</i>
712837 715215 <i>We took that out for various reasons,<br />but you will notice</i>
715298 721387 <i>that the window is there in the one<br />Doppler shot, and now it's shattered,</i>
721471 724390 <i>but we never actually<br />saw it shatter on screen.</i>
724474 726893 CONLI: <i>He's been bellyaching<br />about this for three months now.</i>
726976 730146 CLEMENTS: <i>I always liked that shot.</i><br /><i>I always liked that shot.</i>
731814 734192 MUSKER: <i>Doppler's observatory.</i>
735318 737946 <i>A lot of the interior is based<br />on drawings that Michael Spooner did,</i>
738029 741407 <i>and they were really just trying to<br />set up this sort of eccentric bachelor,</i>
741491 744994 <i>but it had to serve different masters<br />in that we wanted Doppler</i>
745078 747080 <i>to be wealthy enough that he could<br />finance the expedition,</i>
747163 749791 <i>so we wanted a certain opulence<br />and scale to the place,</i>
749874 754045 <i>but also this sort of eccentricity and<br />this sort of scientific overlay to it all,</i>
754128 756589 <i>and we went through<br />a number of stages,</i>
756673 757799 <i>and yet we didn't want it to seem...</i>
757882 760426 <i>Some of the earlier drawings were<br /></i>too <i>cartoony, and we wanted it to fit</i>
760510 763096 <i>the rest of the style of the film<br />and not make it stand out.</i>
763179 765598 <i>So that was a bit of a struggle<br />for us to come up with something</i>
765682 771562 <i>that served all those ends, and<br />ultimately, I think it accomplished that</i>
771646 774023 <i>but it took a while to get there.</i>
774274 776693 <i>This is sort of a tour de force<br />of the effects animation</i>
776776 778528 <i>Dave Tidgwell<br />and his team supervised.</i>
778611 780029 <i>And Bill Konersman,<br />one of the effects guys,</i>
780113 783950 <i>worked on this for quite a while,<br />and just tried...</i>
784033 785952 <i>It was a fun sequence,<br />although it was one of those things,</i>
786035 787954 <i>in storyboards and in the script,</i>
788037 789289 <i>you're like,<br />"You have to take our word for it,</i>
789372 790832 <i>"it's gonna look really cool<br />when it's done.</i> <i>"</i>
790915 795586 <i>And people sometimes didn't realize<br />that, but it turned out really well, I think.</i>
795670 799215 GOODING: <i>Now, one of the interesting<br />things in the movie, color-wise,</i>
799299 802468 <i>is that we don't<br />use the color green a lot</i>
802552 805638 <i>because it associates<br />only with Treasure Planet,</i>
805722 809726 <i>so whenever you see green,<br />it represents good and moral,</i>
809809 814063 <i>and comfortable and, obviously,<br />exotic because Jim's home world</i>
814147 816149 <i>doesn't have any green,<br />so when you see the map,</i>
816232 819736 <i>it's all green<br />associating with Treasure Planet.</i>
820111 821988 This is the answer<br />to all our problems.
822238 824282 MUSKER: <i>There was a whole issue<br />of the flicker in the room,</i>
824365 826451 <i>we wanted this to feel<br />like it was a fire-lit room,</i>
826534 827618 <i>but the first pass on this,</i>
827702 830121 <i>it was so violent,<br />it seemed like the room was in flames,</i>
830204 833499 <i>and we had to go back several times<br />like, "</i>Too <i>much.</i> <i>" "Not enough.</i> <i>"</i>
833583 836461 <i>And Tom Baker<br />and his scene planning crew</i>
836544 839922 <i>had to really back up<br />and go through this.</i>
840006 844052 CLEMENTS: <i>People take things like the<br />flicker for granted, but it was not easy.</i>
844135 847305 <i>It had to be redone several times<br />for continuity.</i>
847930 850183 MUSKER: <i>We did have to rewrite<br />this scene sometimes, too,</i>
850266 851893 <i>because we... There was a question,</i>
851976 854979 <i>"Why does Sarah let him go<br />on this big expedition?"</i>
855063 857774 <i>And we were rewriting<br />a number of times.</i>
858316 859650 CONLI: <i>This particular joke...</i>

863279 866282 <i>Early on, we had this.<br />This was an adlib by David, right?</i>
866366 870203 <i>And it made the film, got great laughs,</i>
870286 874040 <i>but it really was split<br />in terms of "love it, " and "hate it.</i> <i>"</i>
874123 876876 <i>A lot of the staff didn't like it,<br />and said that it was</i>
876959 878211 -too <i>contemporary.</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Right, and so we wrote</i>
878294 880213 <i>ten different alternates<br />which we had David record,</i>
880296 883049 <i>and we tried out at various screenings,<br />and nothing ever got as big a laugh</i>

885885 887720 -'<i>'We got to go back to that.</i> '<i>'<br /></i>-CONLI: <i>Went with the original.</i>
887804 891307 MUSKER: <i>We went with the funniest<br />one, David's spontaneous adlib.</i>
891391 894936 CONLI: <i>I was one of the people who<br />thought that it was a little intrusive,</i>

898106 899440 <i>- It's so great.</i><br />- CONLI: <i>Go with the audience.</i>
899524 902693 CLEMENTS: <i>Great animation.</i><br /><i>Sergio Pablos, who did Doppler,</i>
902777 905238 <i>some great subtle animation.</i>
905321 906447 MUSKER: <i>Yes.</i><br /><i>All of the other animators</i>
906531 907573 <i>I think were in awe of Sergio.</i>
907657 911577 <i>He's a brilliant draftsman, animator,<br />and impeccable in his timing,</i>
911661 914872 <i>his overlap, his technical skills<br />as well as his acting skills,</i>
914956 917208 <i>and people would just<br />study his scenes.</i>
917291 918918 <i>He was tough on his crew,</i>
919001 921587 <i>people working with him<br />had a high standard to live up to,</i>
921671 924757 <i>but it was always a thrill for us<br />to see his scenes</i>

930263 932557 CONLI: <i>Here comes<br />the momma kahuna of all.</i>
932640 933766 CLEMENTS: <i>One of the<br />biggest shots in the movie.</i>
933850 934892 CONLI: <i>CGI shots.</i>
934976 937687 CLEMENTS: <i>Probably took,<br />how long to do this shot? Two years?</i>
937770 938771 CONLI: <i>Yeah, two years easy.</i>
938855 940189 CLEMENTS: <i>More than several days,<br />I think, yeah.</i>
940273 942692 MUSKER: <i>Peter Clarke really did<br />some great visual development on this,</i>
942775 944569 <i>one of our designers.</i>
947071 950825 GOODING: <i>Amazing model<br />built by Thomas Debitus.</i>
950908 952910 <i>Incredibly fun concept, I thought.</i>
952994 956164 <i>This was one of the earliest concepts<br />that the directors came up with,</i>
956247 960918 <i>and l just think it's a really fun,<br />magical storybook conceit</i>
961002 963796 <i>that the moon is really just a crescent,</i>
963880 967842 <i>and one of the things that really<br />attracted me to the movie, initially.</i>
967925 970636 KEANE: <i>Rick Maki<br />is a character designer</i>
970720 973431 <i>who worked on this movie<br />almost as long as we did.</i>
973514 975183 <i>Rick did, literally,<br />thousands of drawings.</i>
975266 978227 <i>He did aliens<br />of every possible persuasion.</i>
978311 981606 <i>And this spaceport sequence<br />was sort of a tour de force</i>
981689 986527 <i>where we tried to dig out as many<br />of these great Rick Maki concoctions.</i>
986611 989071 <i>Some have got tentacles, some fly,<br />some walk, whatever,</i>
989155 992158 <i>but Rick,<br />just a brilliantly inventive mind.</i>
992283 994869 Familiarity breeds,<br />well, contempt, but in our case...
994952 998748 Look, let's just find the ship. Okay?
999999 1002251 MUSKER: <i>This is our special<br />Hitchcockian cameo.</i>
1002335 1005046 <i>That skinny, frail robot up there<br />is me, John.</i>
1005129 1008466 CLEMENTS: <i>And the little, hairy,<br />red-haired guy is me, Ron.</i>
1008549 1011677 <i>It started with</i> Aladdin <i>accidentally.</i><br /><i>We did a little cameo in</i> Aladdin,
1011761 1013012 <i>and then we did one in</i> Hercules,<br /><i>so we felt</i>
1013095 1014847 <i>-we had to do one in this,</i> too.<br />- MUSKER: <i>We did the dialogue</i>
1014931 1015973 <i>here, as well, as we did in those.</i>
1016057 1018601 -'<i>'Second berth on your right.</i> <i>"<br /></i>-'<i>'You can't miss it.</i> <i>"</i>
1018684 1020353 MUSKER: <i>Boy. ls that acting?</i>
1020436 1022688 <i>- Don't answer that question.</i><br />- CLEMENTS: <i>Okay.</i>
1024398 1025733 MUSKER: <i>So, this is our ship,<br />the</i> Legacy,
1025816 1027109 <i>that went through many name changes</i>
1027193 1029612 <i>on the course of arriving<br />where it was here.</i>
1029862 1032782 CLEMENTS: <i>I think we had a contest<br />at some point to name the ship.</i>
1032865 1035701 <i>Originally, we toyed with the idea<br />of using the</i> Hispaniola,
1035785 1036744 <i>which is the name<br />of the ship in the book.</i>
1036827 1039038 MUSKER: <i>I wanted to use that name.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>John wanted to do that.</i>
1039121 1040289 <i>I didn't want to use that.</i>
1040373 1041457 MUSKER: <i>I wanted to.</i>
1041541 1044585 CLEMENTS: <i>Finally, we ended up<br />with</i> Legacy, <i>which I think</i>
1044669 1049715 <i>it was Glen Gagnon who came<br />up with the</i> Legacy.
1049799 1051801 MUSKER: <i>That was his legacy.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>Exactly.</i>
1051884 1054720 <i>And we should talk a little bit<br />about Mr. Snuff,</i>
1054804 1058599 <i>the voice of that and the animation<br />is done by Adam Dykstra.</i>
1058683 1061686 <i>One of the rare cases<br />where an animator actually</i>
1061769 1064647 <i>animates the character<br />and supplied the voice.</i>
1064730 1066232 <i>How he did it, we're not quite sure.</i>
1066315 1069068 <i>I think that he used this stuff called Gak</i>
1069151 1072488 <i>but he was always by himself<br />in the recording session,</i>
1072572 1074615 <i>so we don't know for sure.</i>
1075283 1077159 MUSKER: <i>Captain Amelia,<br />voiced by Emma Thompson.</i>
1077243 1080246 <i>Emma was great to work with,<br />and animated by Ken Duncan,</i>
1080329 1082582 <i>one of the best draftsmen at the studio.</i>
1082665 1085543 <i>We recorded all of her, I guess,<br />in London,</i>
1085626 1089088 <i>and she really came into the sessions,<br />having looked at the lines,</i>
1089171 1091757 <i>and with ideas for rewrites,<br />and it was always fun working with her,</i>
1091841 1095136 <i>because we sat down<br />and actually hashed out the lines.</i>
1095219 1097555 CLEMENTS: <i>She's a great writer<br />as well as an actress.</i>
1097638 1101100 CONLI: <i>Literally, we would sit down<br />each sequence at a time, go through it,</i>
1101183 1103644 <i>-and then go into the recording booth.</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
1103728 1104854 CONLI: <i>Always beplussed us.</i>
1104937 1107648 MUSKER: <i>Right. She came up<br />with a particular word or something</i>
1107732 1111110 <i>that would just make it<br />very British, very precise,</i>
1111193 1113696 <i>and very much in character for her.</i>
1115197 1117533 <i>Captain Amelia, the captain of the ship,<br />is based on Captain Smollett</i>
1117617 1119285 <i>from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel.</i>
1119368 1120620 <i>Of course, in the novel, he's a man,</i>
1120703 1123664 <i>as, I think, just about all ship captains<br />were in that era.</i>
1123748 1125499 <i>Ted and Terry,<br />Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio,</i>
1125583 1128461 <i>when they did their treatment<br />based on Ron's original treatment,</i>
1128544 1131172 <i>thought the captain could be a woman,<br />sort of a woman alien,</i>
1131255 1134091 <i>and I think they described her as a<br />bird-like alien in their original treatment</i>
1134175 1136636 <i>but we liked the idea<br />of a female captain.</i>
1136719 1138846 <i>It just gave a whole twist to the story,</i>
1138929 1142308 <i>and we then wrote the part<br />with Emma Thompson in mind,</i>
1142391 1143851 <i>never knowing whether or not<br />she would do it,</i>
1143934 1145353 <i>but her kind of wittiness,</i>
1145436 1148105 <i>and take-chargeness,<br />and authoritativeness</i>
1148189 1152318 <i>and intelligence, we thought would be<br />great coupled with this sort of..</i>
1152401 1154695 <i>And there's an element of Emma Peel<br />in there, slightly...</i>
1154779 1157114 CLEMENTS: <i>I remember in the<br />first draft of the script,</i>
1157198 1159033 <i>we described Amelia as a combination</i>
1159116 1161577 <i>between Emma Peel<br />and Mary Poppins.</i>
1162036 1165915 <i>And there's still a little of that, I think,<br />that comes through.</i>
1165998 1168334 GOODING: <i>This set<br />is Amelia's state room.</i>
1168918 1172672 <i>We tried to come up<br />with a very soft lighting situation,</i>
1172755 1175716 <i>so that the characters<br />would not require tones.</i>
1175800 1180179 <i>Tones are the shadows<br />on the actual characters</i>
1180262 1184850 <i>that render them more dimensional,<br />and they take a lot of time,</i>
1184934 1189522 <i>and since this movie had a lot<br />of very cool effects sequences,</i>
1189605 1193943 <i>we didn't want to tie up the effects<br />people with doing</i> too <i>many tones,</i>
1194026 1196112 <i>so we tried to come up<br />with lighting situations</i>
1196195 1198531 <i>that would be better without the tones,</i>
1198614 1201784 <i>rather than having a movie<br />that just looked cheap.</i>
1202618 1203828 <i>Um...</i>
1204120 1206914 <i>We have a nice sort of<br />photographic light effect</i>
1206997 1209959 <i>happening here on the characters,<br />which we called "overspill, "</i>
1210042 1214046 <i>which happens when you<br />take a picture into a light source.</i>
1214130 1216716 <i>The edges of the characters<br />and backgrounds</i>
1216799 1220010 <i>get chewed away a bit<br />by the light behind them,</i>
1220636 1224640 <i>which is that sort of nice haze you see<br />working around the edges.</i>
1225266 1227560 Mr. Arrow, please escort<br />these two neophytes
1227643 1228894 down to the galley straightaway.
1228978 1231647 Young Hawkins will be working<br />for our cook, Mr. Silver.
1231731 1233649 What? The cook?
1235276 1237611 CLEMENTS: <i>So this sequence,<br />which is actually</i>
1237695 1239488 <i>the introduction of John Silver,</i>
1239572 1242158 <i>was actually one of the first scenes<br />animated in the movie,</i>
1242241 1243492 <i>one of the first to come out of story,</i>
1243576 1246370 <i>Barry Johnson did the storyboards<br />on this sequence,</i>
1246454 1250833 <i>and so a lot of this is some<br />of the first animation that was done.</i>
1250916 1253669 <i>This is like the first scene<br />that was animated on Silver</i>
1253753 1256547 <i>'cause Glen Keane, who did Silver,<br />kind of went in order,</i>
1256630 1259717 <i>and I think that was the second scene<br />that was animated.</i>
1259800 1262720 KEANE: <i>Silver is a<br />very unique character</i>
1262803 1264430 <i>in that he's the first time<br />we've animated</i>
1264513 1270102 <i>a character that's traditional<br />hand drawn and computer generated</i>
1270186 1271812 <i>in the same character.</i>
1271896 1274106 <i>And we really wondered,</i>
1274190 1277109 <i>"ls the audience going to believe this<br />character is real?</i>
1277193 1280654 <i>"ls it going to look like he's got<br />metal pieces stuck onto him,</i>
1280738 1285075 <i>"and they don't belong, they're not part<br />of his being? Are they going to buy it?"</i>
1285159 1289747 <i>And I was very happy to find that<br />the biggest challenges with Silver</i>
1289830 1293584 <i>were not the technical,<br />sticking a CG part onto him,</i>
1293667 1294752 <i>but as it should be,</i>
1294835 1298547 <i>it was the acting, the performance.</i><br /><i>How do you make him real?</i>
1299340 1304720 <i>Right from the start, I knew that I could<br />do the hand-drawn part,</i>
1304804 1309099 <i>but I wasn't going to step into territory<br />that I wasn't comfortable with,</i>
1309183 1312436 <i>and Eric Daniels, who I had worked<br />closely with on</i> Tarzan,
1312520 1314647 <i>and he created the deep canvas look</i>
1314730 1317525 <i>with the jungle being able<br />to move in dimension.</i>
1317608 1320277 <i>And I just felt like<br />this guy is an inventor,</i>
1320361 1323322 <i>and we need somebody<br />doing the mechanical arm</i>
1323405 1327451 <i>who's not just a technician<br />and an animator, but an inventor.</i>
1328327 1331956 CONLI: <i>Probably good to note right<br />now the performance by Brian Murray,</i>
1332039 1333749 <i>which is just phenomenal.</i>
1333833 1337503 <i>It's probably one of the best voice<br />performances we've had at Disney.</i>
1338838 1340256 (LAUGHING)
1341590 1347346 KEANE: <i>Brian's voice, it comes from<br />somewhere way down inside of him,</i>
1347429 1353644 <i>and he can go from very light<br />and jovial, feels very sincere,</i>
1353727 1357606 <i>and just as easily switch<br />into a dark, ominous side</i>
1357690 1360651 <i>that you find just as believable,<br />which had to work for Silver,</i>
1360734 1365155 <i>that you had to genuinely believe that<br />this was a man who was torn</i>
1365239 1370119 <i>between the greed and lust<br />for this treasure</i>
1370202 1374456 <i>and a genuine compassion that he's<br />beginning to feel for Jim Hawkins.</i>
1375291 1378210 CLEMENTS: <i>Mike Show<br />did the animation on Morph,</i>
1378294 1379879 <i>and he studied lava lamps.</i>
1379962 1383841 MUSKER: <i>It was the cross between<br />a puppy dog and a lava lamp.</i>
1384758 1388012 <i>Mike didn't have a puppy dog,<br />but he actually has a little, at the time,</i>
1388095 1389513 <i>a little son, maybe a year old,</i>
1389597 1391974 <i>so he tried to get<br />some of his son's expressions in this.</i>
1392057 1394143 CONLI: <i>It's like a puppy dog.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, it is.</i>
1394226 1398272 <i>And Dane Davis, our sound designer,<br />who's a great sound designer,</i>
1398355 1400941 <i>he actually provided<br />the voice for Morph.</i>
1401108 1402735 MUSKER: <i>We're about to move<br />into this area now</i>
1402818 1405154 <i>where we tried to feature what's called<br />the virtual set,</i>
1405237 1407823 <i>where we built this whole<br />galley in the computer</i>
1407907 1410993 <i>and then rendered it and painted it<br />with deep canvas techniques,</i>
1411076 1412828 <i>such that we could move the camera<br />around and in it,</i>
1412912 1415039 <i>and this was sort of a unique use</i>
1415122 1418250 <i>because it wasn't<br />a bravura action scene,</i>
1418334 1420878 <i>it was more of a personality scene,<br />and we were trying to build tension</i>
1420961 1422463 <i>by the way the camera moves<br />in the scene.</i>
1422546 1425257 CLEMENTS: <i>There it starts to move,<br />and that is a three-dimensional set</i>

1427676 1430721 Who be a humble cyborg<br />to argue with a captain?
1430804 1433390 KEANE: <i>This moment,<br />I thought was, for me,</i>
1433474 1436977 <i>one of the most enjoyable acting<br />moments I've ever had</i>
1437061 1439146 <i>working at Disney,<br />working with you on this one.</i>
1439229 1442942 RIPA: <i>Yeah, this whole sequence<br />is interesting, but this scene actually...</i>
1443025 1447613 <i>Normally, the process is<br />you work on your characters yourself</i>
1447696 1450115 <i>in your room<br />at a separate time, usually,</i>
1450199 1454954 <i>and for that scene,<br />Glen and I actually worked</i>
1455037 1457539 <i>on the scene at the same time<br />at the same desk.</i>
1457623 1460918 <i>He would go up and do a drawing,<br />and he'd step back and we'd act it out,</i>
1461001 1463128 <i>and then I'd step up<br />and I'd do a drawing.</i>
1463212 1466382 KEANE: <i>Fortunately, John draws<br />at his desk standing up.</i>
1466465 1468425 <i>Everybody else sits in a chair,<br />but John stands up,</i>
1468509 1472721 <i>so we can actually do this<br />tag-team animating pretty easily.</i>
1472805 1475849 RIPA: <i>Yeah, it was pretty cool,<br />and this was some of the first</i>
1475933 1477685 <i>stuff that we did on the character,</i>
1477768 1481146 <i>and it's so huge<br />in terms of their relationship,</i>
1481230 1483440 <i>and the play back and forth.</i>
1483524 1486568 <i>Just the contact between them<br />and the interaction,</i>
1486652 1490531 <i>and keeping it going from this point<br />'cause it seemed like such a nice setup</i>
1490614 1493659 <i>between them<br />that trying to keep that in mind</i>
1493742 1498372 <i>whenever they're on screen and how<br />they relate and really working together</i>
1498455 1502251 <i>closely and knowing each other's<br />characters, I think, really helped.</i>
1504378 1506714 We're all clear, Captain !
1507756 1511677 CLEMENTS: <i>Early on, I think we've<br />always considered that these ships,</i>
1511760 1514221 <i>we would be using solar power a lot.</i>
1514304 1518017 <i>The technology of this universe<br />relies a lot on solar power</i>
1518100 1521603 <i>and artificial gravity.</i><br /><i>Those are two of their big things.</i>
1521687 1523647 MUSKER: <i>Well, we always said<br />we wanted this to feel almost like</i>
1523731 1528569 <i>if they had discovered solar power<br />like in the 17th century</i>
1528652 1531196 <i>on a major scale<br />and really developed it,</i>
1531280 1533282 <i>this was where<br />they would have gotten then.</i>
1533365 1535367 <i>I think Andy Gaskill did some<br />of the early drawings on this</i>
1535451 1537703 <i>where he did these sort of hexagonal<br />patterns in the sails</i>
1537786 1540372 <i>which we really liked<br />in terms of just feeling like there was</i>
1540456 1544334 <i>this sort of fiber filament that<br />was a conduit in these things.</i>
1545294 1548881 GOODING: <i>We did a lot of research<br />on the color of ships,</i>
1548964 1551884 <i>how they were painted<br />back in the 18th century,</i>
1551967 1554428 <i>and settled, eventually,<br />on a white hull for the ship</i>
1554511 1558057 <i>because, several reasons,<br />it shows up very nicely</i>
1558140 1562269 <i>against the dark-colored backgrounds,<br />and also it picks up color.</i>
1562352 1567399 <i>White is a very good reflector<br />of what's happening around it,</i>
1567483 1572529 <i>so when it's in a colorful Etherium<br />that actually reflects onto the hull,</i>
1572613 1574698 <i>and it's really attractive.</i>
1577826 1581997 MUSKER: <i>This shot of the ship<br />with the manta birds swooping by</i>
1582081 1584750 <i>was based on a painting<br />that Ian Gooding did of the ship,</i>
1584833 1587294 <i>and these birds going by,<br />and it was just a majestic image.</i>
1587377 1588754 CONLI: <i>It was one of the<br />really early paintings,</i>
1588837 1591924 <i>and it really set a tone<br />for the whole movie.</i>
1592007 1593717 MUSKER: <i>It was sort of an icon,<br />and it was just</i>
1593801 1595094 <i>based on a visual development thing,</i>
1595177 1596929 <i>and we said, "We've got to get that<br />image into the movie.</i> <i>"</i>
1597012 1598764 <i>So we really tried to duplicate<br />the feeling of that,</i>
1598847 1601100 <i>and I'm really happy<br />with the way it turned out.</i>
1601183 1604144 <i>The manta birds,<br />animated by Mark Austin.</i>
1604228 1605395 CLEMENTS: <i>I think there is one frame</i>
1605479 1608232 <i>that pretty much<br />matches the painting very closely.</i>
1608315 1610484 MUSKER: <i>It was really<br />Ian Gooding's vision of that image</i>
1610567 1612945 <i>that we really tried to duplicate on film.</i>
1613028 1614655 CLEMENTS:<br /><i>Deep canvas space whales.</i>
1614738 1617699 <i>These are the first characters that<br />Disney has ever done in deep canvas.</i>
1617783 1621578 CONLI: <i>Except for the manta birds,<br />but you don't notice them as much.</i>
1621662 1624998 <i>These take full advantage of that,<br />so they're painted like backgrounds</i>
1626041 1629128 <i>but animated as computer animation.</i>
1629211 1631463 MUSKER: <i>This scene was<br />a little bit of a struggle</i>
1631547 1634800 <i>because Doppler<br />was gonna be kind of slimed</i>
1634883 1636260 <i>by these whales and we discussed</i>
1636343 1639304 <i>what was the funny color<br />of this sort of slime</i>
1639388 1642224 <i>and went through various ones<br />and we wound up with...</i>
1642307 1644143 <i>This was our funny color.</i>
1644560 1648313 KEANE: <i>These scenes,<br />Marc Smith animated, who just became</i>
1648397 1651942 <i>my right hand man<br />on animating Long John Silver.</i>
1653402 1656446 <i>He has a natural appeal.</i>
1656530 1659575 <i>Appeal is something that I used to hear<br />all the time</i>
1659658 1662369 <i>from Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnson,<br />Eric Larson,</i>
1662452 1664872 <i>the old guys who did<br /></i>Pinocchio, Snow White.
1664955 1667583 <i>They were always talking about<br />appeal and sincerity.</i>
1667666 1670919 <i>And the word "appeal"<br />I haven't heard as much lately,</i>
1673255 1675674 <i>and looking at Marc's work,<br />it reminded me</i>
1675757 1677968 <i>of how important that is.</i><br /><i>It's a natural thing.</i>
1678093 1683432 <i>You're born with this ability to just draw<br />and all the parts are in the right place,</i>
1683515 1687269 <i>and you are attracted to that character.</i>
1687853 1691857 CONLI: <i>It's interesting to note that<br />in the development process,</i>
1691940 1694693 <i>both in terms of characters<br />and backgrounds,</i>
1694776 1699531 <i>that we have about 15, 000 pieces<br />of artwork that were developed</i>
1699615 1702951 <i>during the period<br />before we got into production.</i>
1703035 1705579 <i>So there's a lot of artwork<br />that gets generated</i>
1705662 1708415 <i>just in terms of spawning ideas</i>
1708498 1713712 <i>and massive amounts of character stuff<br />and background stuff</i>
1713795 1715214 MUSKER: <i>A lot of this<br />cast of characters,</i>
1715297 1717758 <i>we really wanted to get<br />a range of shapes and sizes</i>
1717841 1720636 <i>in this supporting cast<br />of pirates and species.</i>
1720719 1722721 <i>And Peter De Sève was<br />fairly instrumental in doing that,</i>
1722804 1725474 <i>the character designer who did these<br />really fun designs,</i>
1725557 1729019 <i>little tentacled people<br />and huge hulking people</i>
1729102 1731438 <i>and the spidery guy and all that.</i>
1731521 1734524 <i>He kicked off a lot of that stuff,<br />and much of what he did,</i>
1734608 1738570 <i>Andy adapted and we adapted<br />and the animators jumped off from.</i>
1739446 1742950 CLEMENTS: <i>And Mr. Scroop here,<br />voiced my Michael Wincott,</i>
1743033 1744743 <i>who has a terrific voice.</i>
1744826 1747579 <i>Actually, originally, we had<br />a different voice for Scroop,</i>
1747663 1754002 <i>a different actor who was doing more<br />of a raspy, insectoid kind of voice,</i>
1754419 1757089 <i>and it didn't quite work, I think.</i>
1757172 1759466 <i>It didn't quite feel right<br />and so we went with Michael Wincott</i>
1759549 1762928 <i>and we're not doing anything<br />to his voice. It's a great voice.</i>
1763011 1765973 <i>And another one of<br />the character designers</i>
1766056 1769434 <i>was Eric Pigors who did<br />a lot of these characters.</i>
1769518 1774481 <i>His style was a little bit reminiscent<br />of Big Daddy Roth.</i>
1774564 1776608 <i>People from the '60s<br />may remember that.</i>
1776692 1781363 <i>And he's particularly represented with<br />the one alien with the one eye</i>
1781446 1783282 <i>that sticks out.</i>
1783365 1785367 MUSKER: <i>That was Eric's design<br />and we called him Pigors</i>
1785450 1787953 <i>in honor of Eric himself</i>
1788870 1790330 CLEMENTS: <i>And we should<br />mention Mr. Arrow.</i>
1790414 1791790 <i>We haven't talked about Mr. Arrow,</i>
1791873 1793625 <i>voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne</i>
1793709 1795127 <i>who did a great, great job,</i>
1795210 1797296 <i>and T. Dan Hofstedt did the animation.</i>
1797379 1798547 MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
1799339 1802509 <i>Yeah, we really liked, sort of,<br />the reserve that he animated with</i>
1802592 1806096 <i>and gave him that kind of solidity<br />and stolidity</i>
1806179 1808348 <i>and really made him...</i>
1808432 1811101 CONLI: <i>T. Dan's a real genius<br />at understatement.</i>
1811184 1813979 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. Yeah, he did<br />the emperor in</i> Mulan
1814062 1816523 <i>and found a lot to work with<br />a little on that as well.</i>
1817190 1819526 Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...
1819609 1820610 Belay that!
1821695 1824656 CLEMENTS: <i>You mentioned Jim's<br />eye mask, which you just sort of notice.</i>
1824740 1827701 <i>I mean, he's had this little shadow<br />around his eyes</i>
1827784 1829786 <i>throughout the movie.</i><br /><i>It's kind of a trademark,</i>
1829870 1833332 <i>along with his jacket that<br />makes him feel kind of internalized</i>
1833415 1835625 <i>and gives that dark,<br />brooding sort of edge,</i>
1835709 1839338 <i>presumably, the eye mask<br />actually becomes a thematic element</i>
1839421 1840922 <i>in the movie.</i>
1844593 1847554 <i>This section actually<br />started out much longer,</i>
1847637 1849348 <i>had a lot more exposition in it.</i>
1850057 1851308 <i>Then it got taken out.</i>
1851391 1854978 <i>We cut it out of the movie<br />completely at one point</i>
1855062 1857147 <i>to sort of keep<br />more mystery about Silver.</i>
1857230 1860484 <i>And then we ended up putting it<br />back in, in a much shortened version.</i>
1861568 1863862 MUSKER: <i>Also our movies are always<br />running... They have</i> too <i>much story</i>
1863945 1866740 <i>or they run</i> too <i>long,<br />and we wind up having to look for cuts,</i>
1866823 1869743 <i>and it's always difficult for us<br />to figure out</i>
1869826 1872037 <i>what we can cut,<br />what exposition can you cut</i>
1872120 1874039 <i>and still make the audience<br />understand the story.</i>
1874122 1876208 CLEMENTS: <i>We cut a lot<br />of exposition from this.</i>
1876291 1878710 <i>Here he used to talk about Billy Bones,</i>
1878794 1880879 <i>he talked about<br />why they needed the Captain</i>
1880962 1882798 -to <i>run the ship.</i><br />- CONLI: <i>You really spelled it out.</i>
1882881 1886301 CLEMENTS: <i>And now it's pretty much<br />down to bare basics.</i>
1889388 1890931 (LAUGHING)
1891932 1896395 <i>This little bit with Morph here where<br />he turns into a little version of Scroop</i>
1896478 1898397 <i>was added just as a gag</i>
1898480 1902234 <i>and it just seemed a way of kind of<br />de-demonizing Scroop</i>
1902317 1904611 <i>to sort of make fun of<br />the bogeyman a little bit here.</i>
1904694 1908907 <i>So we added this and Mike Show<br />animated a very funny...</i>
1908990 1910575 <i>With his little Nijinsky move there.</i>
1910659 1913703 CONLI: <i>You can see Jim's<br />eye mask pretty clearly there.</i>
1913787 1915372 <i>Dark brooding eye mask.</i>
1915455 1919709 <i>And Silver's striped pants turned into<br />a little bit of a nightmare, too,</i>
1919793 1923130 <i>because they were<br />very difficult to draw.</i>
1923797 1924881 MUSKER: <i>So the clean-up people,</i>
1924965 1927092 <i>Vera Pacheco,<br />was pleading with us, "Please don't,</i>
1927175 1928927 <i>"let's not do the striped pants<br />through the whole movie.</i> <i>"</i>
1929010 1931930 <i>So we found a convenient spot<br />for him to go into a changing room,</i>
1932013 1934933 <i>and during the latter half of the movie,<br />he has remarkably unstriped pants,</i>
1935016 1937519 <i>which I don't think anyone ever notices.</i>
1937602 1939521 <i>But he has more than one<br />pair of pants, right?</i>
1940355 1941398 CONLI: <i>Sure.</i>
1941523 1943775 Your father not the teachin' sort?
1944693 1945735 No.
1945819 1948405 CLEMENTS: <i>Once again, there was<br />some rewriting on this scene,</i>
1948488 1953118 <i>just the question of how much to reveal<br />about Jim's father and what happened,</i>
1953201 1955912 <i>and how much to leave<br />for the song to reveal.</i>
1955996 1960125 <i>It's still leading into this father-son arc,<br />this surrogate father-surrogate son,</i>
1960208 1964754 <i>which is kind of what we're building<br />toward with Jim and Silver.</i>
1964880 1967966 The captain has put you in my charge,<br />like it or not.
1968133 1971845 MUSKER: <i>The montage<br />that we're entering into</i>
1972762 1975557 <i>was in the film for a long time,<br />but originally it had</i>
1975640 1978685 <i>a different temp song behind it.</i><br /><i>It had a U2 song behind it,</i>
1978768 1982397 <i>and it featured other sort of visuals,<br />and we went through a lot on that.</i>
1982481 1985150 <i>Ultimately, Glen Keane<br />went and re-boarded it</i>
1985233 1987944 <i>and really changed it around<br />into what you see now.</i>
1988028 1989988 <i>We delved more into Jim's back-story.</i>
1990071 1993158 CLEMENTS: <i>And even before he<br />re-boarded it, I think it was Glen's idea</i>
1993241 1996161 <i>to actually put the song<br /></i>Iris <i>by the</i> Goo Goo <i>Dolls</i>
1996244 2000207 <i>in as a temp track instead of<br />the U2 song, which we did.</i>
2000290 2002000 CONLI: <i>Glen really brought<br />Johnny Rzeznik to our attention.</i>
2002083 2003168 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Johnny Rzeznik</i>
2003251 2004252 <i>who's the lead singer<br />of the</i> Goo Goo <i>Dolls</i>
2004336 2007506 <i>and kind of its central core member,<br />came in, we met with him.</i>
2007589 2010217 <i>We discovered that he actually<br />had a lot in common with Jim,</i>
2010300 2012677 <i>just in terms of his background,<br />growing up in Buffalo,</i>
2012761 2017265 <i>and his relationship with his father,<br />and just a guarded and troubled youth</i>
2017349 2019309 <i>who sort of came out of it<br />on the other side.</i>
2019392 2022145 CLEMENTS: <i>With a mentor's help.</i><br /><i>I mean, a lot of parallels.</i>
2022229 2023355 MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
2023438 2026775 <i>And so he performed the song<br />that he wrote here for us in a room</i>
2026858 2029486 <i>before he had lyrics,<br />so he would just lean over Roy, and,</i>
2029569 2032405 <i>"Hey, " you know, just sort of..<br /></i>(MUMBLING)
2032489 2034783 CLEMENTS: <i>He did this sort of<br />Bob Dylan thing.</i>
2034866 2036243 MUSKER: <i>A little Bob Dylan-y,</i>
2036326 2038453 <i>and Angela Lepito<br />was filming the whole thing.</i>
2038537 2040789 <i>You can talk to her<br />about the tape, yeah.</i>
2040872 2043166 CONLI: <i>The whole idea here<br />of the flashbacks</i>
2043250 2044793 <i>was actually Glen Keane's idea.</i>
2044876 2046545 <i>That wasn't part of the original story.</i>
2046628 2050382 <i>This was originally just sort of<br />a Disney mentoring sequence,</i>
2050465 2053927 <i>but Glen had the idea of,<br />"Let's take this into Jim's past</i>
2054010 2056137 <i>"and kind of show<br />what really happened.</i> <i>"</i>
2056221 2057514 CONLI: <i>I think it's a testament to Glen</i>
2057597 2060433 <i>because here's the guy<br />who's the lead animator for Silver,</i>
2060517 2063311 <i>and then he's able to kind of<br />get into Jim's mind as well.</i>
2063395 2064771 MUSKER: <i>Well, the core<br />of this whole movie</i>
2064854 2066898 <i>is Jim and Silver, their relationship,</i>
2066982 2071319 <i>and I think Glen and John were both<br />intimately involved in developing that.</i>
2071403 2074990 KEANE: <i>I remember,<br />I had to storyboard this</i>
2075073 2076783 <i>and it just wasn't working,</i>
2076866 2080620 <i>but I felt in my gut<br />that we had to do these flashbacks.</i>
2081329 2084583 <i>So I left the studio<br />and went up to Lake Arrowhead,</i>
2084666 2088128 <i>about two hours from here,<br />and just sat up there and thought,</i>
2088211 2093008 <i>"Okay, if I was just going to do this<br />just the way Rzeznik wrote it,</i>
2093091 2094759 <i>"this is what it would be."</i>
2094843 2096428 <i>But I wasn't sure if this<br />was gonna work,</i>
2096511 2100265 <i>so I called my wife<br />and I started to describe this,</i>
2100348 2102058 <i>and there was this silence<br />on the phone.</i>
2102142 2104144 <i>I said, "What, you don't like it?"</i>
2104227 2106229 <i>She said, "No, I'm crying."</i>
2107314 2110358 <i>"Well, then I'm gonna do it.</i><br /><i>That's how it has to be.</i> <i>"</i>
2112068 2115113 CLEMENTS: <i>I think it's interesting,<br />Johnny is just amazing</i>
2115196 2119576 <i>in terms of being able to interpret<br />the dramatic structure of a film</i>
2119659 2120785 <i>into the music.</i>
2120869 2124623 <i>I mean, he really gets the concept<br />of what the story is about</i>
2124706 2128126 <i>and he's able to kind of<br />transfer that pretty easily into...</i>
2128209 2132505 <i>And his lyrics are very strong, I think,</i>
2132589 2135967 <i>and really express a lot<br />of the underlying things</i>
2136051 2139095 <i>that we wanted to get through<br />in the character of Jim.</i>
2141389 2144434 MUSKER: <i>We're about to get into<br />this whole sequence where they...</i>
2144517 2148563 <i>After Jim sees his father<br />leaving for the last time,</i>
2149606 2150982 <i>now Silver invites him on board,</i>
2151066 2152984 <i>where he's going to<br />show him the ropes of driving,</i>
2153068 2155403 <i>and then Jim takes over.<br />And I think it was Glen's idea</i>
2155487 2157072 <i>to really work in<br />something with a comet</i>
2157155 2159449 <i>or something that just had<br />a spectacular visual to it.</i>
2159532 2163161 <i>So that became the basis for this<br />last little movement within the song</i>
2163244 2165747 <i>where Jim really takes Silver<br />kind of on this joy ride</i>
2165830 2168249 <i>and shows him that<br />he really knows what he's doing.</i>
2169709 2171544 CLEMENTS: <i>Sky continuity<br />was a nightmare.</i>
2171628 2173546 MUSKER: <i>Maybe we should also<br />talk about the size of stars,</i> too.
2173630 2176925 CLEMENTS: <i>Stars and sky.</i><br /><i>We've said many times on this,</i>
2177008 2180804 <i>"If we ever do another movie again,<br />we don't want to have any sky,</i>
2180887 2182764 <i>"or any clouds, or any stars.</i> <i>"</i>
2182847 2185392 <i>It's just</i> too <i>complicated.</i>
2186267 2188019 <i>And there again,<br />people take it for granted,</i>
2188103 2190230 <i>like, if they look the same in every shot,</i>
2190313 2192982 <i>and they're moving<br />at the same speed in every shot...</i>
2193066 2195235 <i>And it doesn't always happen,</i>
2195318 2200532 <i>because somehow continuity<br />is very, very difficult to keep going.</i>
2200615 2203284 <i>And this movie, I think, is probably<br />one of the most complicated</i>
2203368 2206705 <i>in terms of continuity<br />and trying to match from shot to shot.</i>
2206788 2208665 <i>And we had to redo a lot of these skies.</i>
2208748 2211459 CONLI: <i>Well, basically, you're<br />just sticklers on continuity.</i> (LAUGHS)
2212293 2214087 MUSKER: <i>No one will ever notice.</i>
2215296 2216506 GOODING: <i>Now, this scene<br />ends up having</i>
2216589 2220844 <i>a very Brandywine School<br />of Illustration look to it</i>
2220927 2225140 <i>because of the pool of light that we use<br />to stage the two characters in.</i>
2225223 2228101 <i>It's a very nice balance<br />of warm and cool here.</i>
2228184 2231354 <i>It sort of spotlights the two characters</i>
2231438 2234357 <i>and focuses your attention<br />on them nicely.</i>
2234441 2236317 CONLI: <i>Well, this is, I think,<br />some of the best acting</i>
2236401 2238111 <i>-in the film.</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2238194 2239904 <i>Rick Hoppe did a number<br />of these scenes</i>
2239988 2241072 <i>of Silver and Jim at the beginning</i>
2241156 2243283 <i>and then Dean Wellins<br />did the latter half</i>
2243366 2248747 <i>And really just some great<br />acting moments, I think, from Dean.</i>
2248830 2252083 <i>This was a subtlety in thought process.</i>
2252167 2255211 <i>Yeah, Dean Wellins was an animator<br />who worked at Warner Brothers,</i>
2255295 2259632 <i>and was a schoolmate of<br />John Ripa's and Sergio Pablo's,</i>
2259716 2262719 <i>and this is the first Disney film<br />he's worked on,</i>
2262802 2266014 <i>and he just was an outstanding talent.</i>
2266097 2270810 CONLI: <i>The whole Silver team<br />and the Jim unit was just amazing.</i>
2270894 2272812 CLEMENTS: <i>That scene of Jim<br />was just beautifully acted.</i>
2272896 2276357 <i>And this scene of Silver, I think,<br />is one of the best scenes in the movie</i>
2276441 2278902 <i>in terms of how well the acting...</i>
2278985 2281029 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. It's amazing.</i>
2281529 2283239 KEANE: <i>And something that we tried<br />on this picture</i>
2283323 2287410 <i>was to have a crew, a shared crew,<br />between John and I</i>
2287494 2290830 <i>where some of the animators<br />would do both characters,</i>
2290914 2294959 <i>just so that they would understand<br />the relationship that much better.</i>
2295043 2296920 RIPA: <i>And that, hopefully, yeah,<br />that that would make</i>
2297003 2299672 <i>the relationship on screen<br />come across better.</i>
2301424 2303301 CONLI: <i>The storm sequence<br />is a real showcase</i>
2303384 2308264 <i>for our head of layout, Rasoul Azadani,<br />and head of effects, Dave Tidgwell.</i>
2309224 2311893 <i>It was great, in terms of doing<br />an action-adventure movie,</i>
2311976 2314979 <i>I think it was exciting for Rasoul<br />to work with virtual sets.</i>
2315063 2317273 <i>This is the first movie<br />where we were really able</i>
2317357 2319943 <i>to move the camera<br />through environments.</i>
2320026 2323905 <i>And Rasoul is sort of the equivalent<br />of a live-action cinematographer,</i>
2323988 2326658 <i>so it was really a freeing thing for him</i>
2326741 2329744 <i>to be able to move the camera<br />wherever we wanted it,</i>
2329828 2332789 <i>and I think we really take advantage<br />of it in some of these shots.</i>
2332872 2335917 <i>And certainly this is<br />a big, big effects movie,</i>
2336000 2338753 <i>probably one of the biggest<br />that Disney's ever done.</i>
2338837 2344008 <i>And Dave and his staff really<br />responded to that challenge,</i>
2344092 2346928 <i>and did just sort of magnificent work.</i>
2347011 2350765 <i>I think we were really blown away<br />by the work of the effects department</i>
2350849 2352100 <i>on this film.</i>
2357981 2359983 CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the reason<br />for the Etherium</i>
2360066 2361526 <i>and being able to breathe<br />in outer space</i>
2361609 2364153 <i>is so you could do something<br />like this on an open-deck ship</i>
2364237 2366656 <i>and it just made it<br />a lot more fun and visceral</i>
2366739 2368408 <i>than if they were in<br />some kind of a spaceship.</i>
2368491 2370869 CLEMENTS: <i>What would a space<br />sea adventure be without a storm?</i>
2370952 2372120 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2376875 2379502 <i>Peter De Mund did<br />some of the effects here</i>
2379586 2383464 <i>with the explosions and all the smoke<br />trailing off this giant meteor.</i>
2383548 2385300 <i>I guess the idea for this,<br />Francis Glebas...</i>
2385383 2387760 CLEMENTS: <i>Francis Glebas came up<br />with the giant star shard</i>
2387844 2390013 <i>that reverses direction</i>
2390096 2393182 <i>and kind of breaks the sequence<br />into part one and part two.</i>
2393266 2397020 <i>Part one being the star shards,<br />part two being the black hole.</i>
2398396 2400481 CONLI: <i>This sequence really was<br />a tent pole for us.</i>
2400565 2402442 <i>We were able to get this<br />into production really early</i>
2402525 2403818 <i>because we knew<br />we wanted this storm.</i>
2403902 2405403 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it was one of<br />the first sequences begun,</i>
2405486 2408990 <i>although it took a long time<br />because it had all these special effects.</i>
2409073 2412076 CLEMENTS: <i>Very.</i><br /><i>And it's an effects tour de force</i>
2412160 2416456 <i>with a combination of<br />2-D effects and 3-D effects.</i>
2416706 2418833 No, Captain. They're not erratic at all.
2419667 2421169 CLEMENTS: <i>Those screens are cool.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2422378 2424756 ...followed by the biggest<br />magilla of them all !
2424839 2426090 MUSKER: <i>We were told<br />by Nancy Beiman</i>
2426174 2427759 <i>that we misused<br />the word "magilla" here,</i>
2427842 2430678 <i>but we took our lives<br />in our hands and said,</i>
2430762 2432597 <i>"Nancy, we're keeping 'magilla. "'</i>
2432680 2435224 <i>And she moved to<br />Savannah, Georgia after.</i>
2437352 2440021 Aye, Captain. You heard her, men.
2440188 2442148 Unfurl those sails.
2442398 2444817 CON LI : <i>Nice little piece of acting<br />for Arrow back there.</i>
2444901 2446110 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2446819 2448947 <i>Birdbrain Mary, the little bird on legs,</i>
2449030 2450573 <i>that was John Mahoney's, I think,<br />character design.</i>
2450657 2452408 <i>One of our designers.</i>
2452492 2453993 CLEMENTS: <i>Although<br />not originally a female,</i>
2454077 2455620 <i>I think Ellen Woodbury, the animator...</i>
2455703 2457121 MUSKER: <i>She saw<br />something female there.</i>
2457205 2458706 CLEMENTS: <i>... wanted to have<br />one female pirate.</i>
2458790 2461459 <i>And we agreed it would be nice<br />to at least have one female pirate.</i>
2461542 2463753 MUSKER: <i>To have the allure<br />of that woman there, yes.</i>
2463836 2466422 CLEMENTS: <i>Some people find her<br />attractive, which is really scary.</i>
2466506 2468049 MUSKER: <i>Ron, you do.</i>
2468132 2469801 CLEMENTS: <i>That's pretty scary.</i>
2470385 2471803 (SCREAMING)
2474722 2476224 <i>Now we've started to kill off</i>
2476349 2478476 <i>some of the more complicated<br />characters in the movie.</i>
2478559 2480853 <i>Arrow was very difficult to draw<br />and clean up.</i>
2480937 2482939 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there are some<br />pirates that die during this movie,</i>
2483022 2485149 <i>and they die in order of<br />how complicated they are, I think.</i>
2485233 2486985 <i>The hardest ones to draw<br />went first,</i>
2487068 2490363 <i>so once the characters actually<br />realized they were hard to draw,</i>
2490446 2492824 <i>they started trying to erase<br />their own lines, but it didn't...</i>
2493574 2495743 Captain, the last wave!
2496035 2497745 Here it comes!
2497912 2499998 Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
2500081 2502417 It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
2504168 2506421 MUSKER: <i>As the ship descends down<br />into the black hole,</i>
2506504 2508798 <i>this scene actually was quicker<br />at one time,</i>
2508881 2510758 <i>and Michael Kelly felt strongly<br />we needed a beat</i>
2510842 2513302 <i>that really said,<br />"They're gone. This is over.</i> <i>"</i>
2513386 2516806 <i>And so he expanded that time,<br />and I think that really to its benefit,</i>
2516889 2518850 <i>that you really have this moment<br />of suspension</i>
2518933 2520601 <i>where you're not sure<br />what's going to happen.</i>
2520685 2522645 <i>And he really let that hang there<br />and play out.</i>
2522729 2528192 <i>So all this movement decrescendoed<br />down into this rest,</i>
2528276 2531320 <i>and then suddenly exploded out<br />and made the next part more powerful.</i>
2531404 2534532 <i>And I think Michael really sort of<br />went to the wall on that,</i>
2534615 2538453 <i>retiming that and really trying<br />to give that its maximum impact.</i>
2539787 2541456 CLEMENTS: <i>And Michael's<br />a brilliant editor,</i>
2541539 2543249 <i>and I think did a great job on this film.</i>
2543332 2547128 <i>And the most easy-going guy<br />you could possibly work with.</i>
2547211 2550631 <i>I mean, just unflappable, really.</i>
2550715 2552550 <i>MUSKER: It's that lighthearted<br />Irish thing.</i>
2552717 2555261 Thank you. Thank you very much.
2555511 2557722 Well, I have a lot of help<br />to offer anatomically...
2557805 2560141 Amanamonically. . . Astronomically.
2560767 2562977 CLEMENTS: <i>That's a great line,<br />a very funny line,</i>
2563061 2566230 <i>written by Rob Edwards,<br />who joined us fairly early</i>
2566314 2568316 <i>in the writing process on this film.</i>
2568399 2572487 <i>He's actually one of the writers<br />from the sitcom</i> Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
2572570 2578493 <i>And he worked on this movie with us,<br />writing the script for quite a bit of time,</i>
2578576 2581204 <i>and did a great job<br />and was a really big help</i>
2581287 2582622 <i>in the writing of the movie.</i>
2584165 2585249 MUSKER: <i>We had to cheat, sort of,</i>
2585333 2588002 <i>that Arrow's hat hung around<br />even though he went away</i>
2588086 2590421 <i>so we'd have a little prop<br />for them to react to here.</i>
2590505 2592715 CONLI: <i>Nice editing<br />by Michael Kelly with the...</i>
2592799 2595259 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Michael Kelly devised<br />some of this, the pacing of this,</i>
2595343 2599347 <i>and the round robin of looks<br />that come up in terms of Jim's guilt.</i>
2599430 2604268 <i>Michael really had a fine eye for just<br />the pace and the length of these shots,</i>
2604352 2606521 <i>and who you go to when.</i>
2606604 2610900 <i>Right, coming up,<br />he cooked this relationship up here.</i>
2612193 2615780 CLEMENTS: <i>And Emma did a great job<br />on this little...</i>
2615863 2617657 <i>Eulogy for Mr. Arrow.</i>
2617782 2618783 A fine spacer,
2619867 2622954 finer than most of us<br />could ever hope to be.
2623037 2624455 CLEMENTS: <i>It used to be<br />a little longer,</i>
2624539 2628417 <i>and we actually followed her<br />all the way back into her...</i>
2628501 2630503 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there was a scene<br />where she went into her quarters</i>
2630586 2632630 <i>and was sort of leaning against<br />the wall like she was overcome.</i>
2632713 2634173 CLEMENTS: <i>There was a bit<br />with Doppler offering to help</i>
2634257 2637426 <i>and she just can't talk to him,<br />and goes and closes the door.</i>
2637510 2641556 <i>It was very emotional, but it seemed<br />like it took away from Jim's emotion.</i>
2643391 2646727 MUSKER: <i>Ian Gooding design<br />of that big nebula.</i>
2646811 2648437 CLEMENTS: <i>This is a very key<br />sequence of the movie,</i>
2648521 2650189 <i>storyboarded by Ken Harsha</i>
2650273 2653025 <i>who did a beautiful job<br />on the storyboards of this.</i>
2653109 2656237 <i>And the animation by<br />Glen Keane and John Ripa</i>
2656320 2659073 <i>pretty much reflects a lot<br />of what was in those boards.</i>
2659157 2660741 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it's almost<br />shot for shot.</i>
2661909 2665913 Why, half the crew would be<br />spinning in that black abyss...
2665997 2669083 Look, don't you get it? I screwed up!
2669167 2670668 CLEMENTS: <i>This was<br />a pivotal sequence,</i>
2670751 2672336 <i>I think, that we always<br />pictured this moment</i>
2672420 2674338 <i>as the bonding moment<br />between the two,</i>
2674422 2677633 <i>and that from this point in the movie,<br />actually that Silver and Jim</i>
2677717 2680720 <i>have become father and son.</i><br /><i>At least, surrogate father and son.</i>
2680803 2684348 <i>And that that will remain.</i><br /><i>That sort of can't be taken away.</i>
2684432 2687602 <i>So, this is the moment<br />where that happens</i>
2687685 2691689 <i>and that's going to play off a lot<br />in terms of what happens later.</i>
2691981 2696652 James Hawkins.<br />You got the makings of greatness in ya.
2696736 2700865 KEANE: <i>If there was ever<br />a sequence that I would love to go</i>
2700948 2706245 <i>and keep trying to make it reach<br />its potential, it's this sequence.</i>
2706746 2711959 <i>Because it's so deep,<br />and the emotions that I felt with this</i>
2712043 2717006 <i>were so much tied into my own history<br />and what happened to me as a...</i>
2717423 2721928 <i>When I was 18 years old<br />and my football coach comforted me</i>
2722011 2725348 <i>in the parking lot one night<br />after a football game</i>
2725431 2729894 <i>where I had completely lost<br />the starting position,</i>
2729977 2732980 <i>and I felt unjustly treated.</i>
2733064 2736234 <i>And he came out, and put his hand<br />on my shoulder and said,</i>
2736317 2737902 <i>"Glen, you're gonna do great things,</i>
2737985 2741030 <i>"I'm gonna be there<br />when you're making that touchdown.</i> <i>"</i>
2741113 2744700 <i>And, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,<br />and I had tears in my eyes.</i>
2744784 2747245 <i>And looked a lot like Long John Silver.</i>
2747328 2751666 <i>It was one of those soul inspirations<br />for me in this character.</i>
2751749 2756587 <i>And when you're drawing on<br />an emotion like that, that's so real,</i>
2756671 2758339 <i>you're setting yourself up for a fall.</i>
2758422 2763261 <i>You're never going to be able<br />to capture how you felt.</i>
2763344 2765930 <i>I think we both probably animated<br />every scene in this</i>
2766013 2768432 <i>at least two or three times.</i>
2770476 2774772 Next thing ya know,<br />they'll be saying I've gone soft.
2774855 2776607 CLEMENTS: <i>The softer side of Silver.</i>
2777692 2780987 <i>It was tricky, Silver was a very complex<br />character to deal with</i>
2781070 2783447 <i>'cause he's part bad guy,<br />part good guy,</i>
2783531 2787368 <i>and we were always walking<br />that tightrope as far as...</i>
2787451 2789120 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. If he was</i> too <i>nice,<br />that hurt the story.</i>
2789203 2790913 <i>If he was</i> too <i>dark,<br />that seemed to hurt the story.</i>
2790997 2793499 <i>We really struggled to find<br />a balance between the two.</i>
2794959 2797586 <i>This is a very complicated shot,<br />although it doesn't look like it.</i>

2803134 2804802 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />Adam Dykstra doing stuff</i>
2804885 2807930 <i>And Dean Wellins did Jim here,<br />did some really fine attitudes.</i>
2808014 2810975 CLEMENTS: <i>Some of the first<br />animation that Dean did on the movie.</i>
2811058 2812977 MUSKER: <i>And Mike Show did Morph<br />through all this.</i>
2813060 2815521 <i>Mike Show and Jay Jackson<br />did all of Morph pretty much,</i>
2815604 2816981 <i>I guess there's a scene here<br />that other people did,</i>
2817064 2820234 <i>but Mike really did most of him,<br />which was great.</i>
2820318 2822820 <i>Joey Gordon-Levitt<br />who did a great job on Jim's voice,</i>
2822903 2824488 <i>he had to say,<br />"You little squidge, " here,</i>
2824572 2826198 <i>and somehow he didn't like<br />the word "squidge"</i>
2826282 2827992 <i>and we had to talk him into it,<br />but Joey...</i>
2828075 2830119 <i>He loosened up in the course<br />of the acting process.</i>
2830202 2831996 <i>In the initial going,<br />he was kind of reserved.</i>
2832079 2835082 <i>"What is this all about? I've never acted<br />without other actors.</i> '<i>' And all this.</i>
2835166 2836459 <i>But he eventually came<br />to embrace this,</i>
2836542 2839670 <i>and just did a wonderful job,<br />and did improv stuff as well.</i>
2839754 2841172 CLEMENTS: <i>With Joey,<br />it was very much like Jim,</i>
2841255 2842548 <i>that he started out very cautious</i>
2842631 2845343 <i>and reserved, and then he sort of<br />opened up more and more</i>
2845426 2847720 <i>in the course of, like,<br />several years of recording.</i>
2847803 2850556 <i>- These things take so long to do.</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2853142 2854310 (GRUNTS)
2854518 2857730 GOODING: <i>Now here we see<br />the 3-D virtual set</i>
2857813 2859982 <i>relit with a completely different look.</i>
2860358 2862610 <i>With a sort of nice green light.</i>
2862693 2865571 <i>Now, everything has turned green<br />at this point,</i>
2865654 2868532 <i>so you know you're approaching<br />Treasure Planet.</i>
2868616 2871118 CLEMENTS: <i>This whole scene is one<br />of the tent-pole scenes</i>
2871202 2872203 <i>from the novel</i> Treasure Island.
2872286 2874330 <i>Of course, we haven't mentioned<br />Robert Louis Stevenson</i> too <i>much,</i>
2874413 2876207 <i>but he was the whole reason<br />for this going.</i>
2876290 2878542 <i>And there's the famous<br />apple barrel scene in there</i>
2878626 2881545 <i>where Jim Hawkins learns the truth<br />about Long John Silver,</i>
2881629 2883047 <i>and this is sort of our homage to that.</i>
2883130 2886592 <i>And we just felt it was important for Jim<br />to realize how he's been betrayed,</i>
2886675 2888552 <i>and we wanted to hang on<br />to that scene,</i>
2888636 2892223 <i>so this is sort of our adaptation<br />of Stevenson's scene.</i>
2893599 2896560 CONLI: <i>I mean, with the adaptation,<br />we were fairly faithful</i>
2896644 2900606 <i>to several tent poles in the book,<br />to kind of maintain that through-line.</i>
2902483 2903901 CLEMENTS: <i>And you<br />children at home,</i>
2903984 2905236 <i>we'd recommend<br />turning off the tape now</i>
2905319 2908197 <i>and going and reading the book<br />because it is actually a great book,</i>
2908280 2911283 <i>and well-worth reading,<br />and holds up to this day.</i>
2911367 2913077 CONLI: <i>It's worth noting<br />that the three of us</i>
2913160 2914245 <i>read the book when we were kids</i>
2914328 2917373 <i>and we fell in love with it,<br />and that's why the film is what it is.</i>
2918207 2919417 GOODING: <i>Towards the end<br />of this sequence,</i>
2919500 2921710 <i>you'll see that<br />everything's transitioning</i>
2921794 2925047 <i>towards a more golden-orange light.</i>
2926048 2928551 <i>Another difficult sequence to do,</i>
2929260 2931053 <i>as transitions always are.</i>
2932805 2935641 <i>Because we have our mutiny<br />coming up,</i>
2935724 2940438 <i>and that, we had originally keyed<br />the mutiny with orange light,</i>
2940521 2942773 <i>so we needed to somehow<br />transition to that,</i>
2942857 2945151 <i>so you see it gradually happening.</i>
2945234 2949530 <i>And it helps to highlight the characters<br />getting more and more angry, also.</i>
2951824 2954743 MUSKER: <i>We're coming up on<br />the reveal of Treasure Planet,</i>
2954827 2956745 <i>which, again, was one of those<br />slight nightmare shots,</i>
2956829 2958789 <i>but David Krentz did some drawings.</i>
2958873 2961792 <i>David Krentz was in layout, and<br />did these beautiful charcoal drawings</i>
2961876 2963461 <i>that showed how the planet<br />might be displayed.</i>
2963544 2964795 <i>And then Uma Thumrugoti,</i>
2964879 2967131 <i>that was one of the more difficult<br />names to pronounce on the movie,</i>
2967214 2970176 <i>really worked for months in terms of<br />just getting all that cloud animation</i>
2970259 2972553 <i>and the reel of the planet<br />working just right.</i>
2973721 2976015 CLEMENTS: <i>Originally,<br />we had Silver set down</i>
2976098 2978184 <i>his spyglass in the earlier sequence,</i>
2978893 2981479 <i>but the way it was staged,<br />there really wasn't any way to show it.</i>
2981562 2983606 <i>But, of course, the bigger question is<br />why does Silver</i>
2983689 2986650 <i>need a spyglass anyway<br />since he's got this cyborg eye?</i>
2986734 2988152 MUSKER: <i>We did record this scene</i>
2988235 2989487 <i>with Joey Gordon-Levitt<br />and Brian Murray</i>
2989570 2990988 <i>in the same room at the same time,</i>
2991071 2992656 <i>which we also did<br />in that earlier sequence.</i>
2992740 2995326 CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the stuff we did<br />with the two of them together...</i>
2995409 2998329 MUSKER: <i>I think Joey felt strongly<br />he could play off another actor better,</i>
2998412 3000122 <i>and felt less like he was in a void.</i>
3000206 3002333 <i>And he was right, it really<br />brought a lot to the scenes</i>
3002416 3005085 <i>to have them both in the same room<br />and playing off each other.</i>
3005169 3006754 CLEMENTS: <i>And they bonded.</i>
3006837 3010674 <i>You had the sort of older actor<br />and the younger actor,</i>
3010758 3012259 <i>and they became good friends.</i>
3012343 3014428 MUSKER: <i>This scene through<br />Silver's eye we had to retake</i>
3014512 3017681 <i>because the first version of this,<br />it was all green and obscure.</i>
3017765 3018849 <i>You couldn't tell what was going on.</i>
3018933 3021185 <i>And we had to sort of rework it.</i><br /><i>Dave Tidgwell sort of reworked it</i>
3021268 3023103 <i>to make it clear.</i>
3025147 3026899 <i>Now we're getting into<br />pirates as pirates here,</i>
3026982 3029860 <i>so we really wanted our homage to...</i><br /><i>You know, classic things.</i>
3029944 3033239 <i>So pirates start swinging into camera<br />and storming down,</i>
3033322 3034949 <i>and we have a shot coming up of Silver</i>
3035032 3037201 <i>with the Jolly Roger<br />rising up behind him.</i>
3037284 3039828 <i>Very iconic images<br />we were going for here.</i>
3039912 3042206 <i>Brandishing the weapons,<br />I mean, all these...</i>
3042289 3043290 <i>Racing around the deck.</i>
3043374 3044708 CLEMENTS: <i>You might notice here</i>
3044792 3047336 <i>that Mr. Hands is also<br />very difficult to draw.</i>
3047419 3049380 MUSKER: <i>Here's one of the icons.</i><br /><i>That pirate flag was designed</i>
3049463 3051799 <i>by Andy Gaskill, our art director.</i>
3052216 3053467 I'll see they all hang.
3053842 3054969 Doctor, familiar with these?
3055052 3057513 Oh, I've seen. . . Well, I've read...
3059056 3060599 Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.
3061308 3063143 MUSKER: <i>The shot of Morph looking<br />at his reflection, I think,</i>
3063227 3065396 <i>was based on a Roy Disney comment,<br />where he needed to,</i>
3065479 3068399 <i>or wanted to get that set up<br />more clearly, why Morph was...</i>
3068482 3070651 <i>That it was a playful thing<br />and not a malicious thing.</i>
3071860 3073404 CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, the idea of Morph</i>
3073487 3076740 <i>is that he is just<br />all feelings and emotions</i>
3076824 3081036 <i>and no intellect, and really has no idea<br />of anything that's going on.</i>
3083914 3085165 Stop them !

3093632 3097219 <i>Shawn Keller had handled Jim<br />and most of those running ones,</i>

3105519 3107771 MUSKER: <i>This is an example<br />of interactive lighting,</i>
3107855 3111442 <i>where there's a light source outside<br />that changes the lighting of the set.</i>
3111525 3113611 CLEMENTS: <i>I think Emma<br />really enjoyed the fact</i>
3113694 3115821 <i>that she could play action-adventure.</i>
3115904 3119366 <i>She's never really done<br />an action-adventure movie before,</i>
3119450 3125289 <i>and she was actually pregnant through<br />most of the Amelia recording.</i>
3125914 3128042 CONLI: <i>She was very happy<br />she didn't have to get buff</i>
3128125 3131003 CLEMENTS: <i>So, we lost several<br />complicated characters there</i>
3131086 3132546 <i>that were very difficult to draw.</i>
3132630 3136800 CONLI: <i>So it's a lesson to you, kids,<br />don't ever be a complicated character.</i>
3136884 3138552 MUSKER: <i>You notice Silver's eye</i>
3138636 3139803 <i>changing color<br />through these sequences.</i>
3139887 3142890 <i>He sort of had a mood eye.</i><br /><i>When he was in his normal mode,</i>
3142973 3144391 <i>and kind of full of blarney, it's yellow.</i>
3144475 3148604 <i>But as he gets angrier, or more<br />incensed or whatever, it gets redder.</i>
3148687 3151523 <i>So you'll see through<br />some of this section, it's a red eye,</i>
3151607 3154485 <i>and as he softens,<br />it goes back into the yellow mode.</i>

3415120 3420083 <i>and of Basque Spanish descent<br />and very difficult-to-pronounce name,</i>
3420167 3421710 <i>but he did a great job.</i>
3421793 3424880 <i>We were concerned<br />'cause B.E.N. is a 3-D character,</i>
3424963 3426757 <i>but we wanted him to integrate<br />with the 2-D characters,</i>
3426840 3430260 <i>so his animation was meant to be<br />as cartoony as the other characters.</i>
3430344 3433138 <i>And we tried to design him<br />so he had a line around him</i>
3433221 3434264 <i>so he'd fit with the other characters,</i>
3434348 3438602 <i>but Oskar animated him in a way<br />that really kept him loose,</i>
3438685 3440312 <i>and the guys who built the rig<br />and all that</i>
3440395 3443482 <i>made it very squashy and stretchy<br />so that it would integrate</i>
3443565 3445525 <i>with the other characters.</i>
3445609 3447027 <i>That was the goal here, really,</i>
3447110 3449529 <i>not to make him feel like he was<br />from another planet, so to speak.</i>
3449613 3451823 CONLI: <i>Yeah, the whole idea<br />of doing him in 3-D</i>
3451907 3455285 <i>was to be able to get the amount<br />of detail on the character</i>
3455369 3457412 <i>but still try and maintain<br />the squash-and-stretch</i>
3457496 3458538 -of <i>the actual...</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
3458622 3461833 <i>Given that he was a robot,<br />it seemed like a natural fit for 3-D.</i>

3464378 3467089 I've lost my mind.<br />You haven't found it, have you?

3470926 3471927 Look, B. E. N...
3472719 3475806 CLEMENTS: <i>We get into<br />the missing piece idea here,</i>
3475889 3478141 <i>which was a little controversial<br />for a while,</i>
3478225 3480519 <i>but is actually thematic.</i>
3480602 3484856 <i>Wanted to sort of keep it because<br />it really ties into the whole movie</i>
3484940 3488610 <i>in that sort of every character has<br />a missing piece in some sense.</i>
3488694 3490404 <i>B.E.N.'s is fairly literal,</i>
3490487 3494783 <i>but Silver has one in terms of<br />that he lost his arm.</i>

3504251 3508797 CONLI: <i>The fact that whenever you're<br />doing a 2-D and 3-D combination</i>

3513885 3515637 <i>Touching and talking,<br />those are the two big no-no's.</i>
3515721 3519182 CLEMENTS: <i>Ironically, that B.E.N.</i><br /><i>is such a touchy-feely guy,</i>
3519266 3520642 <i>and that's the hardest thing to do.</i>
3520726 3522185 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />every time a 2-D drawing,</i>
3522269 3524396 <i>something that someone drew<br />on a piece of paper,</i>
3524479 3526481 <i>interacts with something<br />created in a computer,</i>
3526565 3528525 <i>it becomes a very difficult task.</i>
3528608 3531987 <i>And yet, B.E.N. is a compulsive<br />sort of grabber and toucher</i>
3532070 3535490 <i>and wants to be...</i><br /><i>ls desperate at being left alone again.</i>
3535574 3537451 <i>So we really wanted him<br />to be hanging on Jim,</i>
3537534 3539619 <i>so that made their jobs<br />much, much harder</i>
3539703 3543165 <i>to make that work together.</i>

3559431 3561808 <i>and something that read as underwear,</i>

3627916 3630168 CLEMENTS: <i>This is<br />very much from the book.</i>
3630252 3632129 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />another tent-pole scene.</i>
3632212 3635382 <i>The negotiation scene between Silver<br />and in the book, the captain, actually.</i>
3635465 3637467 <i>And in our earlier versions,<br />we had him negotiating with Amelia</i>

3639052 3640887 <i>But Jim is our central character,<br />it seemed that</i>
3640971 3643223 <i>the key relationship was between<br />Silver and Jim,</i>

3686099 3690478 CLEMENTS: <i>We adjusted this scene<br />a little bit in terms of the acting.</i>

3771518 3773311 Oh, blast it!
3773478 3775522 MUSKER: <i>We went back<br />and sort of adjusted this end</i>

4074320 4076573 <i>whether Jim should shoot Scroop...</i>
4076656 4077907 MUSKER: <i>And not have<br />the violence questioned.</i>
4077991 4079409 CLEMENTS: <i>Which he did at one point.</i><br /><i>He did shoot him.</i>
4079492 4081035 MUSKER: <i>There did seem<br />to be something poetic</i>
4081119 4083705 <i>about seeing Scroop<br />sail off into the distance</i>
4083788 4087959 <i>à la what he did to Mr. Arrow.</i><br /><i>Poetic justice sort of thing.</i>
4088042 4089377 B. E. N. : Laser cannons disconnected,
4089460 4091170 Captain Jimmy, sir!
4091337 4093381 Gee, that wasn't so tough.
4096175 4099429 GOODING: <i>The lighting in this<br />sequence was really interesting.</i>
4099512 4105310 <i>The very strong under-light<br />coming up from that air vent.</i>
4106102 4108438 Fine work, Jimbo.
4108521 4111107 GOODING: <i>That was a very, very<br />difficult scene to do</i>
4111190 4113109 <i>where Silver comes<br />out of the darkness.</i>
4113192 4116613 <i>Just the balance of what you see<br />and what you don't see</i>
4116696 4118531 <i>was hard to achieve.</i>
4118615 4122118 <i>And this whole sequence<br />had to be really dark</i>
4122201 4123578 <i>so it would be believable</i>
4123661 4127957 <i>that Jim didn't see all these pirates<br />when he first came in,</i>
4128041 4131127 <i>but not so dark that the audience<br />couldn't see what was going on.</i>
4131210 4133212 You're just like me, Jimbo.
4133880 4135506 Ya hates to lose.
4136257 4138676 MUSKER: <i>I think Glen really wanted<br />to do more of a tour de force scene.</i>
4138760 4142472 <i>This is actually animated by Jin Kim<br />but sort of devised by Glen, I think,</i>
4142555 4146017 <i>where Silver really struggles<br />to make this thing open</i>
4146100 4149479 <i>to build up his frustration with Jim<br />and to give Jim the upper hand here.</i>
4149562 4151272 <i>The fact that he can do it effortlessly</i>
4151356 4154817 <i>where Silver can't possibly<br />do it without Jim's help.</i>
4155568 4158446 CLEMENTS: <i>Once again,<br />we played this at one point</i>
4158529 4161240 <i>that Jim was completely demoralized</i>
4161324 4165536 <i>by giving the map directly to Silver<br />after he thought he'd won.</i>
4165620 4167580 <i>But that scene,<br />Jim seemed</i> too <i>passive</i>
4167664 4171042 <i>so we kind of tried to give him<br />a little more defiance here</i>
4171125 4173169 <i>that he's not giving up,<br />even though he has to.</i>
4173252 4175213 CONLI: <i>We had to keep him alive<br />through the rest of the film.</i>
4175296 4176547 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, he receded</i> too <i>much.</i>
4176631 4177882 CONLI: <i>Receded<br />into his eye mask thing.</i>
4177965 4179050 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
4179967 4182220 KEANE: <i>These are some of<br />the most difficult scenes to animate.</i>
4182303 4187100 <i>Chris Hubbard did a lot of<br />these scenes where Silver is in awe.</i>
4187725 4190645 <i>And when you animate<br />a character that's in awe of something,</i>
4190728 4193856 <i>it's the other thing<br />that's really amazing,</i>
4193940 4197652 <i>and they're just responding to it<br />and all you have to do is</i>
4197735 4204409 <i>a slow, gradual opening of the eyes<br />and the mouth and a fascination.</i>
4204617 4206452 <i>And you don't have much to work with.</i>
4206536 4208037 <i>It's very subtle.</i>
4208121 4211165 <i>And I think he did<br />an incredible job with it.</i>
4212709 4215920 MUSKER: <i>And Ian Gooding concocted<br />those centipede trees.</i>
4216003 4217547 <i>They only appear really<br />in that one shot,</i>
4217630 4220383 <i>but it was so great, we had to use it.</i>
4220967 4223136 <i>And this sequence was<br />originally much longer</i>
4223219 4225513 <i>and it was based, again, sort of on<br />the book and on the movie where</i>
4225596 4227640 <i>they were going through<br />this dark, spooky place</i>
4227724 4229225 <i>in anticipation of finding the treasure.</i>
4229308 4231686 CLEMENTS: <i>And some complicated<br />characters got killed.</i>
4231769 4233730 MUSKER: <i>We had killed off<br />a few people</i>
4233813 4237108 <i>in traps that Flint had set for people<br />as they were coming and it just...</i>
4237191 4239110 <i>We needed to get to<br />the treasure sooner</i>
4239193 4240653 <i>so we wound up<br />tightening this sequence.</i>
4241946 4244240 GOODING: <i>Of course,<br />we had this pulsing</i>
4244323 4247076 <i>lime green light in the background</i>
4247160 4249287 <i>that just keeps going<br />through the whole sequence,</i>
4249370 4251748 <i>and that was a continuity nightmare.</i>
4251831 4253666 <i>To try and get it just right.</i>
4253750 4256836 <i>It also changes speed<br />which was difficult to track.</i>
4256919 4259464 <i>So that the further along you go,<br />the faster it gets</i>
4259547 4261591 <i>right up to the end.</i>
4261674 4264427 KEANE: <i>It's at this point that you start</i>
4264510 4267430 <i>relying on all the pipe work<br />that you've laid on</i>
4267513 4269766 <i>how the characters relate<br />to each other.</i>
4269849 4272643 <i>That you can just,<br />in a very quick moment,</i>
4272727 4277190 <i>have a look between Jim and B.E.N.</i><br /><i>that says enough.</i>
4277273 4279942 <i>You don't have to go<br />really far and develop it</i>
4280026 4282320 <i>'cause now we've got<br />a lot of story to tell.</i>

4287408 4290828 CONLI: <i>This whole area that<br />we're going into is really kind of</i>
4290912 4293748 <i>a testament to Ron<br />in terms of his persistence</i>

4298961 4301964 MUSKER: <i>Frank Nissen sort of helped<br />design this controller,</i>
4302048 4303716 <i>that little green sphere that comes up</i>
4303841 4307303 <i>and then gets the whole portal<br />opening here.</i>
4307386 4311432 CLEMENTS: <i>We were able to get the<br />dimension and the size of this thing.</i>
4311516 4314101 CONLI: <i>This is where we get<br />more into science fiction</i>
4314185 4315311 <i>than we had before.</i>
4315394 4320066 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Andrey Brandl, one of<br />our Hungarian conceptual designers,</i>
4320149 4321484 <i>concocted a whole bunch of worlds,</i>
4321567 4323694 <i>which we see very much<br />quickly in passing here</i>
4323778 4325112 <i>and not in Hungarian.</i>
4325196 4331285 <i>And Dave Tidgwell actually,<br />using Bryce and other programs,</i>
4331369 4333329 <i>concocted some of these<br />3-D environments</i>
4333412 4334747 <i>that we see through the portal.</i>
4334831 4336666 CONLI: <i>We used to have<br />more exposition here</i>
4336749 4337959 <i>and actually we used to have</i>
4338042 4341587 <i>these zaftwing, these birds that<br />actually flew out of one of the worlds.</i>
4341671 4344006 MUSKER: <i>And interacted with<br />Jim and Morph and everything,</i>
4344090 4346175 <i>but, again, we were trying to<br />pace it a little more briskly</i>
4346259 4348553 <i>so it got shortened.</i>
4348636 4352932 CONLI: <i>The key idea,<br />which we hope is clear, is that</i>
4354892 4358604 <i>the planet is actually a machine<br />that works these portals.</i>
4360690 4364235 CLEMENTS: <i>We took a lot of time<br />working this and trying to craft it so that</i>
4364318 4366654 <i>-you could get a lot of exposition in...</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Trying to rewrite...</i>
4366737 4370324 <i>To get the least exposition you could<br />and yet get it clear.</i>
4370408 4372535 <i>That was a real struggle.</i>
4374996 4377206 KEANE: <i>I like it when Silver<br />starts to get frustrated.</i>
4377290 4379458 <i>- There's this volcano inside.</i><br />- RIPA: <i>He looks good yelling.</i>

4384463 4386048 RIPA: <i>Yeah, he does.</i>
4389677 4393347 GOODING: <i>So, here we get the idea<br />that the planet,</i>
4393431 4397393 <i>which was really good on the surface<br />and covered with natural green stuff,</i>
4397476 4399478 <i>is actually quite rotten at the core.</i>
4399562 4403149 <i>It's filled with gold,<br />which you'll see in a second.</i>

4407945 4410323 <i>with the green<br />and the gold storytelling.</i>
4410448 4414160 The loot of a thousand worlds.
4414368 4418539 <i>This big idea here actually<br />was one of mine,</i>
4418623 4423461 <i>where the core of the planet is like<br />a huge spherical computer floating</i>
4423544 4426422 <i>at the gravitational center of the planet.</i>

4428841 4431802 <i>with the rest of the planet<br />that works the portal</i>

4461499 4462667 <i>So he had a plan.</i>
4462750 4464043 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, and in earlier versions,</i>

4471550 4474679 -to <i>keep active and this became...</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>Right. Right.</i>
4474762 4476806 <i>There used to be<br />a sequence here where...</i>
4476889 4478891 <i>I mean, B.E.N. used to have<br />more flashbacks</i>

4481394 4485314 <i>and the pirates, and a gunfight,<br />and that all went away.</i>
4485398 4488442 CLEMENTS: <i>The original idea was that<br />B.E.N. would get his missing piece back</i>
4488526 4490569 <i>as he's about to right now.</i>
4490653 4491737 <i>And when he got it back,</i>

4734980 4737524 <i>we described a scene that<br />demonstrated this idea,</i>
4737608 4739610 <i>and that was something,<br />through the course of the film,</i>
4739693 4741153 <i>no matter what we did,<br />we tried to hang on to,</i>
4741237 4743197 <i>just that this was a pivotal moment.</i>
4743280 4744865 CLEMENTS: <i>There was one point<br />we had here</i>
4744949 4747493 <i>when Silver finally made the decision<br />to let go, he couldn't let go.</i>
4747576 4749662 <i>The arm was sort of clasped<br />on to the treasure</i>
4749745 4751413 <i>-and wouldn't let go.</i><br />- MUSKER: <i>That was Glen's idea. Yeah.</i>
4751497 4753249 CLEMENTS: <i>So he had to<br />actually release his arm.</i>
4753332 4754333 <i>His whole arm.</i>
4754416 4755668 CONLI: <i>Pulled the pin<br />and his arm came off</i>
4755751 4758837 MUSKER: <i>So we had Silver, through<br />the climax of the film being one-armed</i>
4758921 4760256 <i>and he had lost that mechanical side.</i>
4760339 4761382 CLEMENTS: <i>Which would<br />have been simpler.</i>
4761465 4763592 <i>It just reminded us<br /></i>too <i>much of Richard Kimble.</i>
4763676 4765594 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i><br /><i>There was a</i> Fugitive <i>aspect of it</i>
4765678 4768430 <i>that we weren't sure<br />that was a good thing.</i>
4768681 4770182 Silver, you gave up?
4770266 4773519 Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.<br />I'll get over it.
4773602 4775646 MUSKER: <i>Now we're moving<br />into sort of this</i>
4776272 4779108 <i>action-adventure chock-full<br />of 3-D effects</i>
4779191 4783779 <i>and just very dense<br />and, again, got heavily reworked.</i>
4783862 4785864 <i>We had things in<br />at one point where Jim</i>
4785948 4788534 <i>remained on the ship<br />and piloted them to safety.</i>
4788617 4790202 <i>He became the captain of the ship.</i>
4790286 4792079 CLEMENTS: <i>It was always Jim's<br />sort of sequence.</i>
4792246 4794456 MUSKER: <i>It was.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>And his chance to really</i>
4794540 4795958 <i>show what he could do.</i>
4796041 4797835 MUSKER: <i>Right,<br />but what he was demonstrating</i>
4797918 4799628 <i>went through<br />at least 10 different variations</i>
4799712 4801422 <i>before we arrived at this one.</i>
4801505 4803799 CLEMENTS: <i>Which ended up bringing<br />the solar surfer back</i>
4803882 4806552 <i>which seems fitting.</i>
4806635 4808345 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />we sort of concocted this thing</i>
4808429 4810180 <i>so Jim would actually be surfing</i>
4810264 4811890 <i>and we had to sort of make it plausible.</i>
4811974 4814727 <i>And I think John Ripa felt, "It should<br />have some form of propulsion.</i> <i>"</i>
4814810 4817688 <i>And at one point he was just<br />riding a piece of sheet metal</i>
4817771 4818814 <i>down to what was going on.</i>
4818897 4820733 <i>- Just kind of riding the waves.</i><br />- CLEMENTS: <i>With a solar sail.</i>
4820816 4822943 MUSKER: <i>With a sail,<br />but that seemed</i> too <i>contrived</i>
4823027 4826822 <i>and the idea came up, use the cannon<br />as a form of propulsion for this thing.</i>
4826905 4828657 <i>And I think we reworked it to...</i>
4828741 4830159 <i>And then I think Glen had the idea,</i>
4830242 4832494 <i>it can have a certain amount of<br />canisters of energy</i>
4832578 4835080 <i>so there's sort of<br />a ticking clock that way.</i>
4838083 4840336 CLEMENTS: <i>I don't know<br />if everyone gets it</i>
4840419 4844173 <i>but basically this cannon<br />has these three canisters</i>
4844256 4848719 <i>and Jim uses them all up<br />in his course to try to save the day.</i>
4848802 4852264 CONLI: <i>Yeah, the propulsion device is<br />basically like a chamber for a pistol.</i>
4854266 4857186 <i>The little canisters go in<br />and shoot off the power.</i>
4857269 4860105 CLEMENTS: <i>It's where you get into<br />what has been referred to at Disney</i>
4860189 4862733 <i>as the "plausible impossible."</i>
4865694 4866904 There you go.
4867613 4868739 There you go.
4870282 4872034 Okay. Now, no matter what happens...
4872117 4873202 MUSKER: <i>They used<br />to have a little more</i>
4873285 4874578 <i>dialogue between them as they left</i>
4874661 4876955 <i>where they sort of said goodbye<br />or, "If I never come back</i>
4877039 4879124 <i>"tell my mother I love her.</i> '<i>'<br />I mean, practically like that.</i>
4879208 4880876 <i>And it seemed</i> too <i>much at this moment</i>
4880959 4883295 <i>so we went with<br />the more understated...</i>
4883379 4884880 CLEMENTS:<br /><i>There was the first canister.</i>
4884963 4886006 <i>So there's only two left.</i>
4886799 4890010 Get this blasted heap turned 'round !
4891428 4893847 GOODING: <i>This shot you actually<br />see the ship tacking</i>
4893931 4895557 <i>as a real sailing ship might,</i>
4895641 4899436 <i>where the sails transfer<br />from one side of the ship to the other.</i>
4899520 4903440 <i>That was animated by Ian Coony.</i><br /><i>A nice little touch that he added.</i>
4903524 4906735 RIPA: <i>These scenes coming up<br />with Jim on the surfer,</i>
4906819 4910239 <i>again, went to Jin Kim,<br />just because of how well</i>
4910322 4911907 <i>he was able to do these scenes,</i>
4911990 4913909 <i>and how much he was<br />able to put into them.</i>
4913992 4916036 <i>I mean, they're so difficult as it is</i>
4916120 4919331 <i>that you can get lost in<br />trying to figure out how to do them.</i>
4919415 4922334 <i>That he was able to do them<br />and focus on the performance,</i>
4922418 4924002 <i>which is one of the hardest things to do</i>
4924086 4925796 <i>when you have something<br />that's very technical.</i>
4925879 4928799 <i>And he just was<br />the right person for that.</i>
4928882 4932052 <i>There were also scenes... Bobby Rubio<br />had done a couple of scenes in there.</i>
4932136 4933303 <i>Really nice match.</i>
4933387 4935514 <i>And John Pomeroy has some<br />scenes coming up</i>
4935597 4940269 <i>that really, I think, match the intensity<br />that Jin was able to get into his work.</i>
4940352 4942521 MUSKER: <i>And this was our attempt<br />to get the slight James Bond thing.</i>
4942604 4943772 <i>This came up fairly late<br />in the thing,</i> too.
4943856 4947109 <i>We wanted to give Jim a way<br />of sort of cleverly coming up with</i>
4947192 4950404 <i>some way of saving the day<br />and restarting his engine,</i>
4950487 4953282 <i>so we came up with this thing<br />of him grinding the dead engine</i>
4953365 4956452 <i>against this metal wall<br />and the sparks reigniting it</i>
4956535 4958036 <i>and that was our attempt<br />to do a little reversal</i>
4958120 4961707 <i>at the end of this thing<br />as we head toward the finish line.</i>
4961915 4964126 DOPPLER: Three, two...
4965544 4966962 CLEMENTS: <i>And if anyone<br />was keeping track</i>
4967045 4968130 <i>as far as B.E.N.'s countdown,</i>
4968213 4970716 <i>if that was all accurate, it's not.</i>
4973051 4975554 MUSKER: <i>This was one of the most<br />complicated shots we did in this ending.</i>
4975637 4977973 <i>This turnaround of the ship.</i><br /><i>Trying to make the sky work behind it</i>
4978056 4980309 <i>because it was 2-D, it was 3-D.</i>
4980392 4982811 <i>I don't even know what it is now,<br />but it was complicated.</i>
4984730 4986064 (CHEERING)
4989067 4991653 <i>Amelia and Doppler used to<br />have a longer thing between them</i>
4991737 4994406 <i>where she sort of talked to him<br />about becoming first mate on the ship</i>
4994490 4995616 <i>and it was a great scene<br />between them.</i>
4995699 4998744 <i>But it seemed like it may have pulled<br />away from Jim a little bit</i> too <i>much</i>
4998827 5000704 <i>so we simplified that.</i>
5000996 5003749 AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you<br />to the interstellar academy.
5003832 5005626 CLEMENTS: <i>The proud father.</i>
5006418 5008795 Just wait until your mother<br />hears about this!
5009421 5011131 Of course, we may downplay<br />the life-threatening parts.
5011215 5013175 MUSKER: <i>Again with Martin's<br />goodbye here,</i>
5013258 5015177 <i>or his congratulatory thing here,</i>
5015260 5016720 <i>we had longer versions,<br />we had shorter versions,</i>
5016803 5019223 <i>I think we were much shorter,<br />but we wound up reinstating stuff</i>
5019306 5022684 <i>'cause Martin just did some funny stuff<br />with this crying bit at the end.</i>
5022768 5025646 <i>It just seemed kind of<br />comic that we liked.</i>
5025729 5028690 CLEMENTS: <i>And if people notice,<br />his eyes are now blue.</i>
5028774 5033695 <i>When he got his memory chip,<br />it turned his eyes from green to blue.</i>
5033779 5035531 CONLI: <i>I thought you were going to<br />talk about the eye mask.</i>
5035614 5037032 CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah,<br />I was going to get to it.</i>
5037115 5040202 <i>And Jim's eye mask is gone for good.</i>
5040285 5042120 <i>It's gone for good.</i>
5042621 5044498 JIM: You never quit, do you?
5045207 5048210 MUSKER: <i>And for us, this scene,<br />in this interior,</i>
5048293 5050712 <i>despite all the changes in the story,</i>
5050796 5053840 <i>most of this stayed relatively<br />as it was just in that</i>
5053924 5058512 <i>we wanted to get this sort of<br />moment where Jim lets Silver go,</i>
5058595 5062266 <i>and also, though, that Silver<br />beckons Jim to come with him</i>
5062349 5064226 <i>and Jim having found his newfound<br />maturity,</i>
5064309 5068188 <i>he really says, "No, I think<br />I got a future back home.</i> <i>"</i>
5068814 5072901 <i>And it's, again, sort of a tent-pole<br />for us in the movie anyway.</i>
5076071 5080284 KEANE: <i>There's an emotional chord<br />that you know you have to hit</i>
5080367 5081702 <i>in these scenes.</i>
5081785 5085163 <i>And Morph plays such<br />an important moment in this,</i>
5085831 5089418 <i>because Morph has always<br />represented that inseparable</i>
5089501 5091461 <i>element to Silver.</i>
5093547 5095841 <i>And when he's given this choice</i>
5098218 5103098 <i>of hanging on to Morph<br />or giving Morph to Jim,</i>
5103181 5106810 <i>it's such a real gift.</i>
5106893 5110188 RIPA: <i>Yeah, it's really heartfelt<br />because by this time,</i>
5110272 5113400 <i>you know how much<br />Morph means to Silver.</i>
5113525 5116028 I would've taken you up<br />on that offer in a second,
5117279 5120574 but I met this old cyborg...
5121992 5124453 MUSKER: <i>And this shot was added<br />late in the game of Silver</i>
5124536 5126913 <i>because we felt that<br />we were on Jim so long</i>
5126997 5128707 <i>and it's really the relationship<br />between the two of them,</i>
5128790 5130250 <i>so we cut away from Jim<br />during part of it</i>
5130334 5131460 <i>to feature Silver just as he said,</i>
5131543 5132836 <i>"I met this guy<br />who kind of changed my life.</i> <i>"</i>
5132919 5136340 <i>It just seemed more emotional<br />to be on Silver for that line.</i>
5136423 5138467 <i>And this line, where he says,</i>
5138550 5141678 <i>"I have a future, "<br />he used to say, "Greatness, "</i>
5141762 5144222 <i>alluding back to where he said,<br />"You have the makings of greatness, "</i>
5144306 5146308 <i>but it seemed a little bit comic</i>
5146391 5148143 <i>and it was a question,<br />"Does it seem</i> too <i>swell-headed?"</i>
5148226 5149645 <i>- And the future...</i><br />- CONLI: <i>Perhaps glib.</i>
5149728 5152564 MUSKER: <i>Glib, and "future" tied into<br />his earlier line where he says,</i>
5152648 5155150 <i>"Yeah, what future?" and it just<br />seemed to round out the thing.</i>
5155233 5158362 CLEMENTS: <i>Beautiful music here by<br />James Newton Howard.</i>
5158445 5161239 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, the theme between<br />Jim and Silver that he stated earlier</i>
5161323 5162491 <i>really sort of comes back around here</i>
5162574 5166870 <i>and he added these violin overdubs,<br />the just really sweet, tender thing.</i>
5166953 5169039 <i>Again, this was Barry Johnson's idea<br />to sort of have</i>
5169122 5171333 <i>Morph dissolve into<br />a puddle of tears here.</i>
5171416 5173418 <i>But it was Tom Schumacher<br />who encouraged us,</i>
5173502 5177130 <i>toward the end of the film, to say,<br />"I think Jim should...</i>
5177214 5180759 <i>"Or Silver should actually<br />give Morph to Jim as a gift.</i> <i>"</i>
5180842 5181843 <i>And that was controversial</i>
5181927 5183762 <i>'cause it was a question,<br />can you give a pet away?</i>
5183887 5184971 CLEMENTS: <i>The pet owners in the...</i>
5185055 5186598 CONLI: <i>Me, being a dog person,<br />I seriously questioned it</i>
5186682 5188642 <i>because I couldn't imagine<br />giving my dog to somebody.</i>
5188725 5189810 MUSKER: <i>Right,<br />but me not being a dog person,</i>
5189893 5191144 <i>I just thought it would<br />really be emotional</i>
5191228 5192396 <i>that the thing Silver cared about most,</i>
5192479 5194648 <i>he actually found it<br />in the grace of his heart</i>
5194731 5197609 <i>to bestow it and it became<br />more powerful on Silver's part.</i>
5197693 5199194 <i>And I think Glen,<br />even though he is a dog owner,</i>
5199277 5202239 <i>said, "Hey, I can see that.</i> '<i>'<br />So we reworked this ending.</i>
5202322 5204241 CLEMENTS: <i>What made it work<br />was Silver realizing</i>
5204324 5207202 <i>that Morph would actually<br />be happier with Jim.</i>
5207285 5208787 <i>So then he gives him the order.</i>
5209788 5211790 This is for your dear mother,
5211873 5214000 to rebuild that inn of hers.
5217796 5220298 Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
5221800 5225053 MUSKER: <i>Neil Eskuri was our<br />artistic coordinator and he really helped</i>

5229933 5234521 <i>between effects and color models<br />and layout,</i>

5239776 5242404 <i>as we go back to the space port,<br />he peopled that.</i>

5244656 5246616 <i>The exposure sheets<br />are the roadmap of these scenes,</i>

5266219 5268597 CONLI: <i>He came to us from</i> Dinosaur.
5268680 5272267 <i>So he had this rich background in 3-D<br />and we were using so much 3-D</i>
5272350 5275103 <i>in terms of the virtual sets<br />and deep canvas stuff,</i>

5341837 5344840 KEANE: <i>So,<br />seeing Silver in the clouds here,</i>
5344923 5348426 <i>it's an image that you know<br />that is always gonna be with Jim.</i>
5348510 5351429 <i>That Silver's always<br />going to be watching over his shoulder.</i>

5411364 5415410 <i>it just reminds you<br />of what a great opportunity</i>
5415493 5418330 <i>and incredible experience it was<br />doing a film like this.</i>
5418413 5423752 <i>And really feeling like<br />everybody worked very hard</i>
5423835 5426838 <i>and tried to do something<br />that they believed in</i>

5431301 5432427 CON LI : <i>Four years.</i>
5432510 5435597 CLEMENTS: <i>Four years?<br />Seventeen years!</i>
5436640 5439434 CONLI: <i>I was very lucky because<br />I got pulled in</i>
5439517 5441102 <i>in the last four and a half years.</i>
5441186 5443563 <i>Whereas you guys have been really<br />looking at this thing...</i>
5443647 5445732 <i>I mean, Ron,<br />you should talk about this.</i>
5445815 5450904 <i>The fact that you pitched this in 1985<br />is a phenomenal...</i>
5450987 5452405 MUSKER: <i>Same meeting<br />with</i> Little Mermaid.
5452489 5455158 CLEMENTS: <i>Yes,<br />I originally pitched this at</i>
5455241 5456785 <i>what they called a gong show,</i>
5456868 5460789 <i>which was sort of a meeting, actually,<br />with Michael Eisner</i>
5460872 5463124 <i>when we gathered a group of people</i>
5463208 5466795 <i>and pitched</i> The Little Mermaid<br /><i>and I pitched this.</i>
5466878 5469923 <i>Originally, they were both gonged,<br />although</i> The Little Mermaid
5470006 5472008 <i>actually got going pretty quickly</i>
5472092 5475261 <i>and this has been<br />on the back burner for a long time</i>
5475387 5476680 <i>so it's nice to finally see it.</i>
5476763 5480225 CONLI: <i>A great lesson in<br />persistence on this one.</i>
5480350 5482102 <i>But it's truly, for me,</i>
5482185 5485480 <i>it is a piece of literature that I loved<br />ever since I was a kid.</i>
5485563 5487524 <i>It was kind of the book<br />that got me into reading</i>
5487607 5489985 <i>and so the opportunity to work on it</i>
5490068 5493571 <i>and the vision that I was able<br />to share with these guys,</i>
5493655 5497450 <i>it was... These guys are brilliant.<br />It's been an amazing team.</i>
5497534 5502163 CLEMENTS: <i>It's been just<br />an incredible group of people.</i>
5502247 5503498 MUSKER: <i>In terms of the technology,</i>
5503581 5505333 <i>had this movie gotten going<br />17 years ago</i>
5505417 5506584 <i>when it was proposed,</i>
5506668 5509337 <i>both the people that worked on it,<br />and the technology that we used</i>
5509421 5511089 <i>were not necessarily available then,</i>
5511172 5513341 <i>so it's been to the movie's<br />good fortune, I would say,</i>
5513425 5515427 <i>that it's taken this long<br />to get off the ground.</i>
5515510 5518179 CONLI: <i>Had we started five years<br />earlier, we couldn't have got there.</i>
5518263 5520181 <i>Had we started 17 years ago,</i>
5520265 5522517 <i>we couldn't have dreamt of<br />where we would end up.</i>
5522600 5525687 CLEMENTS: <i>And the intention was<br />even like, when we were...</i>
5525770 5529274 <i>I mean, John and I have been working<br />on this for a long period of time.</i>
5529357 5531735 <i>Even between<br /></i>Little Mermaid <i>and</i> Aladdin,
5531818 5532861 <i>we worked on it a little bit.</i>
5532944 5536072 <i>Between</i> Aladdin <i>and</i> Hercules<br /><i>we worked on it a little bit.</i>
5536156 5539743 <i>And even then, we conceived it<br />as a big action-adventure movie</i>
5539826 5543830 <i>and really wanted to get that<br />kind of action-adventure</i>
5543913 5545415 <i>cinematics into it,</i>
5545498 5549461 <i>and had no idea<br />how that would be possible,</i>
5549544 5554049 <i>and it turned out that by the time<br />we were actually able to do the film,</i>
5554132 5557385 <i>technology had developed<br />that actually made it possible,</i>
5557469 5560638 <i>but even then, a lot of stuff was<br />developed in the course of the movie</i>
5560722 5563224 <i>that didn't exist when we began.</i>
5563308 5566895 CONLI: <i>And that's a testament to<br />the team, 'cause the team was really...</i>
5566978 5570565 <i>Everyone embraced this film,<br />everyone embraced the story,</i>
5570648 5572817 <i>and everyone embraced<br />the technology that was there.</i>
5572901 5574652 MUSKER: <i>And took it into these<br />uncharted territories,</i>
5574736 5577405 <i>technologically speaking<br />and artistically speaking,</i>
5577489 5583244 <i>in terms of character design,<br />acting choices, virtual sets, 3-D, 2-D,</i>
5584120 5585497 <i>you name it, all the way down the line,</i>
5585580 5588333 <i>we were doing things<br />we hadn't really done before.</i>
5588416 5592337 <i>And, yeah, it was a testament<br />to the team that they really...</i>
5592420 5596883 CLEMENTS: <i>We decided to go for this<br />kind of classical look to the movie</i>
5596966 5601346 <i>and a very sort of dimensional,<br />classical look to the characters,</i>
5602180 5605225 <i>which really put a big emphasis,<br />not only on</i>
5605308 5610105 <i>that you needed superb acting,<br />but draftsmanship was so important.</i>
5610188 5613566 <i>And we had just such amazing<br />animators on this film</i>
5613650 5617987 <i>who were not only terrific actors,<br />wonderful actors,</i>
5618071 5620490 <i>but could draw so beautifully</i>
5620573 5625787 <i>and the quality of draftsmanship,<br />I think, is a little bit unprecedented.</i>
5625870 5628456 CONLI: <i>I think a nod also goes<br />to the performers themselves.</i>
5628540 5630625 <i>Because I think,<br />from an acting standpoint,</i>
5630708 5633586 <i>there are incredible performances<br />in this thing.</i>
5633670 5637173 <i>I think it's one of the best<br />vocal performances</i>
5637257 5638800 <i>I've seen in an animated film.</i>
5638883 5641010 CLEMENTS: <i>By the way,<br /></i>Treasure Planet <i>was a</i>
5641094 5643763 <i>controversial title for this movie.</i>
5643847 5646558 <i>There were many other<br />titles considered,</i>
5646641 5648643 <i>I think, for various reasons,</i>
5648726 5651855 <i>but</i> Treasure Planet<br /><i>seemed to be the title that stuck.</i>
5651938 5654983 <i>It was the title we always wanted to<br />go with because this really is</i>
5655066 5657193 <i>Robert Louis Stevenson's<br /></i>Treasure Island
5657277 5661281 <i>told in an outer space setting<br />and that title seemed to</i>
5661364 5664826 <i>express that probably<br />better than any other title.</i>
5664909 5667996 <i>If you don't know that<br />it's Robert Louis Stevenson's</i>
5668079 5670456 <i>story translated into science fiction,</i>
5670540 5673418 <i>maybe the title doesn't have<br />the same meaning, I don't know.</i>
5674377 5677088 <i>I guess that sums it up.</i>
