211212 212964 [Man grunting]
218261 220138 [Horse nickering]
234319 236863 - Whoa.<br />- [Horses snorting]
237030 239699 [Gentle metallic rattling]
243161 244329 Whoa.
258760 261971 Who's that stumblin'<br />around in the dark?
262138 265934 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged!
266100 268686 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
268853 271189 I mean you no harm.
271356 276194 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<br />Whoa, boy.
277528 279197 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
279364 281699 I'm looKing for a pair of slave traders
281866 283534 that go by the name<br />of the Speck brothers.
283701 285536 Might that be you?
286913 289666 - Who wants to know?<br />- Well, I do.
289832 291709 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
291876 292794 [Snorting]
292961 296464 - What kinda doctor?<br />- [Schultz] Dentist.
296631 298424 Now, are you the Speck brothers?
298591 301386 And did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville slave auction?
301552 304138 - So what?<br />- So I wish to parley with you.
304305 307642 - Speak English.<br />- [Chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.
307809 310019 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
310186 313481 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
313648 316067 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
316234 317694 Hello, you poor devils!
319028 321614 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident
321781 325076 of the Carrucan plantation?
325827 328037 [Man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
329664 331040 Who said that?
338589 339841 [Schultz lighting match]
378254 379630 What's your name?
383801 385678 Django.
385845 388598 Then you are exactly<br />the one I'm looKing for.
390475 392685 Do you know who<br />the Brittle brothers are?
396314 397315 Who are they?
399734 401360 Big John.
402153 403488 Ellis.
404906 408826 Roger.<br />Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
410203 412413 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
412580 413664 Not anymore.
416751 417794 Tell me...
418377 421172 ...if you were to see<br />any of these three gentlemen again,
421339 424008 - would you recognize them?<br />- [Man] Hey.
424175 426636 - Stop talkin' to him like that.<br />- Like what?
426803 428346 Like that.
428513 430807 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain...
430973 433017 Speak English, goddamn it.
433184 434936 Everybody calm down.
435103 438815 I'm simply a customer<br />trying to conduct a transaction.
438981 441984 I don't care. No sale.<br />Now, off with ya.
442151 445154 [Scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
445988 447448 Move it.
447615 452537 My good man, did you simply get carried<br />away with your dramatic gesture
452703 456499 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457583 459460 Last chance, fancy pants.
460878 463214 Oh, very well.
463881 464924 [Horse whinnying]
466509 468845 [Man screaming]
472974 474642 [Scream echoing]
487530 490241 [Screaming continues]
491993 494412 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
494579 496497 but I didn't want you<br />to do anything rash
496664 498958 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
499125 502545 You goddamn son of a bitch!
502712 505506 - You shot Roscoe!<br />- Well...
505673 507383 And you killed ace!
507550 510219 I only shot your brother once<br />he threatened to shoot me.
510386 513222 And I do believe I have...<br />One, two, three, four...
513389 516350 ...five witnesses<br />who can attest to that fact.
516517 519395 - Damn leg's busted!<br />- No doubt.
519562 522106 Now, if you could keep your<br />caterwauling down to a minimum,
522273 525610 I'd like to finish my line<br />of inquiry with young Django.
525776 527778 [Screaming resumes]
529614 533075 - [Man] God-fuckin'-damn it!<br />- As I was saying...
533242 536954 ...if you were to see the Brittle<br />brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
537622 539332 Yeah.
539498 540791 Sold American!
540958 544921 So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
550218 552845 That iron is nasty business.
558059 560186 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
561687 561854 Thank you. Django?
563731 563898 Get up on that horse.
565691 565858 Also, if I were you,
569862 577862 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
587880 595880 Nigger!<br />Don't you touch my brother's coat.
598391 598558 [Screaming]
603479 605148 Goddamn it! Oh!<br />[Moaning]
610319 610486 One hundred... ten... 20...
612321 613573 ...and five...
614740 614907 ...for young Django here.
617076 617243 And since he won't<br />be needing it anymore,
619745 620454 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
625418 625585 Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid<br />I will require a bill of sale.
627170 627336 Do you have one?
630256 630423 - You go to hell, dentist.<br />- [Scoffs]
632425 632592 I thought not.
636095 640433 No worries. I come prepared.
642018 642185 Thank you.
645771 650693 This will serve nicely<br />as a bill of sale.
652278 658117 [Nickering]
659118 663289 Whoa.
666751 666918 Now, as to you poor devils.
671964 672131 So, as I see it, when it comes to<br />the subject of what to do next,
674967 675134 you gentlemen have two choices.
680264 680431 One: Once I'm gone, you could lift<br />that beast off the remaining Speck,
682350 682516 then carry him to the nearest town.
686103 686270 Which would be at least<br />37 Miles back the way you came.
691943 692109 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,<br />take that rifle,
694654 694820 put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep,
698366 699450 and then make your way to a<br />more enlightened area of this country.
700618 700785 Choice is yours.
705164 705331 Oh, and on the off chance there are<br />any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
708334 709794 the north star is that one.
712964 720964 Ta-ta. [ClucKing]
731857 732108 Now wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this!
735319 735486 - [Lantern crashing]<br />- [Chains rattling]
738906 740366 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this!
743369 743536 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doin' my job!
747123 747290 Blueberry, didn't I<br />give you my last apple?
750251 750418 Tell you what, boys:<br />Take me to the Doc in El Paso,
752461 752628 - I'll get you your freedom.<br />- [Gun cocKing]
756382 764382 - No. No, please...<br />- [Gunshot echoing]
773941 781941 [Dogs barKing nearby]
801052 801719 [SqueaKing]
803095 803262 All right, now.
805264 805431 I'd like you to<br />take two of these tonight...
807641 809769 - [Coughing]<br />- ...And then in the morning...
811562 819562 That's a nigger on a horse.
838964 839131 What's everybody staring at?
841634 842843 They ain't never seen<br />no nigger on a horse before.
845096 853096 [Goats bleating]
854939 862939 Whoa.
866992 868327 Good morning, innkeeper!
870788 870955 Two beers for two weary travelers.
872706 872873 It's still a bit early.
875292 875459 We won't be open for another hour.
877294 877461 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
882883 883050 [Gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what<br />the hell you think you're doing, boy?
885136 888681 Get that nigger outta here!
892685 892852 - [Panting] Help! Help!<br />- Innkeeper!
896021 896188 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
898065 898232 [Man] Sheriff! Help!
899859 901235 Alas.
903779 906198 Now we must act as our own bartender.
907950 915950 Sit down, my boy.
920504 921338 - What kind of dentist are you?<br />- [Chortles]
925926 930556 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
933851 936061 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession...
937438 944028 ...Bounty Hunter.
945863 946572 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
947615 947781 No.
948991 950618 Well...
954747 954914 ...the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
957249 957416 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
959627 963380 [TsKing] Hat
964924 972924 prost.
975768 975935 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
978604 978771 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
982733 982900 After I've killed him, I transport that<br />man's corpse back to the authorities.
985611 985778 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
988572 988739 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving yes, indeed,
990449 990616 I truly have killed him,
993619 993786 at which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
997122 998749 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh for cash business.
999750 1003546 What's a bounty?
1005005 1005172 It's like a reward.
1008551 1008717 You kill people?<br />And they give you a reward?
1010594 1010761 Certain people, yeah.
1011887 1012054 Bad people?
1016016 1016183 Ah! Badder they are,<br />bigger the reward.
1018477 1018644 Which brings me to you.
1022898 1023065 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1025484 1025651 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1028779 1028946 On the other hand, I need your help.
1032324 1033200 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1035869 1036036 So, for the time being, I'm gonna<br />make this slavery malarkey
1038247 1038414 work to my benefit.
1043085 1044753 Still, having said that, I feel guilty.
1050009 1057057 So, I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1058892 1063564 I'm looKing for the Brittle brothers.
1064898 1065065 However, at this endeavor,
1070195 1071447 I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar<br />as I don't know what they look like.
1074325 1074491 But you do. Don't ya?
1076702 1076869 I know what they look like all right.
1080372 1080539 Good. So here's my agreement.
1083959 1084126 - You travel with me until we find them.<br />- Where we goin'?
1086754 1086920 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1089089 1089256 but I don't know where.
1093552 1093719 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
1098974 1100017 And when we find them,<br />you point them out, and I kill them.
1103395 1103562 You do that, I agree<br />to give you your freedom,
1107691 1107858 $25 per Brittle brother. That's $75.
1111570 1115407 And, as if on cue,<br />here comes the sheriff.
1116659 1119328 [Scoffs]
1124833 1127461 Ok, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.
1132049 1133092 - [Overlapping chatter]<br />- All right, folks, calm down.
1134802 1135594 Go about your business.
1137971 1139932 These jokers will be gone soon.
1145354 1145521 Now, why y'all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1148774 1149942 And scare all these nice people.
1152611 1152778 You ain't got nothing better to do
1155989 1156156 than to come into bill sharp's town
1158409 1158575 and show your ass?
1160327 1160494 - [Metal springing noise]<br />- [Sheriff screaming]
1163455 1163622 - [Crowd gasping]<br />- [Groaning]
1164998 1166750 [Woman screams]
1170671 1172131 - What'd you just do to our sheriff?<br />- [Groaning]
1174007 1174174 - [Yelling]<br />- [Shot echoing]
1175384 1175551 [Woman gasps]
1177511 1181974 [Crowd screaming]
1184309 1185811 Now you can get the marshal.
1188147 1188313 [Man] Marshal! Marshal!
1190566 1190733 - Should we wait inside?<br />- Can we just leave?
1191942 1194403 After you.
1198615 1198782 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1201660 1201827 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1203996 1204163 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1206498 1206665 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1209626 1209793 All the barrels aimed<br />at that front door.
1212796 1213964 Somebody get poor bill<br />outta the goddamn street.
1216133 1216300 You in the saloon!
1219636 1220345 We got a hundred rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that buildin'.
1223515 1224349 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1226852 1227019 You and your nigger come out right now<br />with your hands over your head,
1228979 1230105 and I mean right now.
1233525 1233692 [Schultz] Is this the marshal<br />I have the pleasure of addressing?
1235486 1235652 Yes, it is.
1237738 1237905 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1240199 1240699 [Schultz]<br />Na wunderbar, marshal.
1244286 1244453 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1247372 1247539 and just as you have instructed,
1250209 1250375 I am ready to step outside
1254463 1255547 with my hands raised above my head.
1257966 1258133 I trust as a representative
1261512 1261678 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America,
1267518 1267684 I shan't be shot down in the street<br />by either you or your deputies
1270521 1270687 before I've had my day in court.
1273023 1273190 You mean like you did our sheriff.
1274983 1275150 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1277486 1277653 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1283325 1286662 Do I have your word as a lawman not to<br />shoot me down like a dog in the street?
1289915 1290082 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1293085 1294127 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1297089 1298924 Fair enough, marshal.<br />Here we come.
1301093 1301260 They're a little tense out there.
1304721 1305055 So don't make any quick movements,<br />and let me do the talKing.
1307724 1314773 - [Doors squeaKing open]<br />- Come ahead.
1316024 1316191 You unarmed?
1317901 1318652 [Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.
1321989 1322155 Marshal Tatum, may I address you<br />and your deputies,
1324116 1324283 and apparently the<br />entire town of Daughtrey,
1326618 1327953 as to the incident that just occurred?
1330414 1330581 - Go on.<br />- Thank you.
1332708 1332875 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1336128 1336295 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1339715 1339882 The man lying dead in the dirt,<br />who the good people of Daughtrey
1343969 1344136 saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br />who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1348724 1348891 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck,
1351476 1351643 with a price on his head of $200.
1354605 1354771 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1356106 1356273 The hell, you say!
1360319 1360485 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1363655 1363822 But I'm willing to wager<br />this man was elected sheriff
1366325 1367242 sometime in the past two years?
1368243 1368410 Yeah.
1371830 1371997 [Schultz] I know this because three<br />years ago, he was rustling cattle
1375459 1375626 from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1379421 1379588 Now, this is a warrant<br />made out by
1385260 1385427 circuit court judge Henry Allen<br />Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1387137 1387304 You're encouraged to wire him.
1392351 1392517 He'll back up who I am and<br />who your dear departed sheriff was.
1396480 1400525 [Guns uncocKing]
1404446 1404613 In other words, marshal,<br />you owe me $200.
1407532 1413121 [Medium-tempo song plays]
1414623 1422623 I'll be damned.
1446238 1446405 After this Brittle business<br />is behind us,
1451952 1454746 you'll be a free man, with a horse,<br />$75 in your back pocket...
1456164 1458417 What's your plan after that?
1462254 1464506 Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
1469386 1469886 Django, I had no idea<br />you were a married man.
1472180 1472347 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1475934 1476101 Oh, me and my wife do.
1480272 1481481 Old man Carrucan didn't.<br />That's why we, uh... we run off.
1483108 1483775 [Man] Django.
1486361 1486528 Django, Django-
1489239 1489948 you got sand, Django.
1491825 1493618 Boy's got sand.
1496747 1498457 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1501960 1502127 I want you to burn a runaway "r"<br />right here on his cheek.
1503170 1503336 And the girl, too.
1505130 1505297 [Groaning]
1510093 1510927 And I want you to take 'em to<br />the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
1512804 1512971 Both of 'em.
1514723 1517184 Separately.
1518518 1521146 And this one...
1523857 1525817 ...you will sell him cheap.
1527319 1529863 In Greenville...
1532824 1540040 ...there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1542250 1543710 You know when she was sold...
1546671 1546838 ...you know where she came from,
1548673 1549466 and you know her name.
1551009 1551176 What is her name?
1552844 1554429 Broomhilda.
1557682 1557849 - What?<br />- Broom-hilda.
1559810 1561895 - Broomhilda?<br />- Hm-mm.
1564898 1565774 - Were her owners German?<br />- Yeah, how you know?
1567192 1567359 She wasn't born on<br />the Carrucan plantation.
1569903 1570070 She was raised by a German mistress,<br />the Von Shafts.
1572197 1572364 She speak a little German, too.
1574116 1574282 - Your wife?<br />- Hm-mm.
1576118 1576284 When she was little, her mistress<br />taught her so she'd have somebody
1577869 1580455 to speak German with.
1580622 1585210 Well, let me get this straight.
1585377 1586503 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1590549 1593301 Yep.
1601893 1603812 They call me Hildi.
1609985 1615574 [Rooster crowing nearby]
1616908 1619661 When we gain access to these<br />plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
1626543 1627669 You'll be playing a character.
1628378 1629796 Hm?
1636803 1641266 No?
1642350 1643893 During the act, you can<br />never break character.
1644644 1647188 Do you understand?
1649524 1653445 Yeah. Don't break character.
1654195 1655697 And your character<br />is that of the valet.
1656615 1658992 What that is?
1659159 1660410 That's a fancy word for servant.
1660577 1661745 - Valet?<br />- Hm-mm.
1661911 1666416 [Chuckles]
1668835 1670670 And now, Django, you may choose<br />your character's costume.
1670837 1671796 Youse gonna let me<br />pick out my own clothes?
1671963 1675634 But of course.
1700575 1701785 [Medium-tempo song<br />resumes playing]
1706081 1709668 Whoa.
1709834 1713213 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1713380 1717258 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1717425 1720220 - I said niggers on horses...<br />- [Schultz] His name is Django.
1720387 1723848 He's a free man.<br />He can ride what he pleases.
1724516 1729521 Not on my property.<br />Not around my niggers, he can't.
1729688 1732148 My good sir,<br />perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
1732315 1736152 Allow me to unring this bell.
1736319 1738446 My name is Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my valet, Django.
1738613 1740448 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1741825 1741992 - [Snorting]<br />- [Women giggling]
1746204 1746371 Mr. Bennett?
1750333 1750500 I've been led to believe that you<br />are a gentleman and a businessman.
1752419 1753253 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
1757549 1759092 to parley with you now.
1762178 1762345 I wish to purchase<br />one of your nigger gals.
1764139 1764306 You and your jimmie<br />rode from Texas to Tennessee
1765974 1766141 to buy one of my nigger gals?
1768059 1768226 No appointment, no nothin'?
1770645 1770812 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1772480 1772647 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you?
1774858 1775025 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
1776985 1780322 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
1782240 1782407 Now what you got to say about that?
1785660 1785827 Mr. Bennett.
1790999 1792417 If you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1793460 1795211 I have 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1798673 1800675 [Chuckles softly]
1801760 1805430 Well, come on inside and get<br />yourself somethin' cool to drink.
1806514 1813188 Hm-mm.
1815148 1815315 [Chuckles]
1817859 1818026 Oh, maybe while we discuss business,
1820403 1820570 you could provide one of<br />your loveliest black creatures
1822739 1822906 to escort Django here<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1824658 1824824 Oh, well, absolutely!<br />Uh, betina.
1826701 1826868 - Yessir, Big Daddy?<br />- Uh...
1828370 1828536 What's your jimmie's name again?
1830705 1830872 ' Django.<br />' Django.
1834084 1834250 Betina, sugar, could you<br />take Django there
1835543 1835710 and take him around the grounds here<br />and show him all the pretty stuff.
1839631 1839798 As you please, Big Daddy.
1843134 1843301 Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,<br />Django is a free man.
1845804 1845971 He cannot be treated like a slave.<br />He... within the bounds of good taste,
1848974 1849140 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1853770 1855105 - Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?<br />- Yes'm?
1857273 1857440 Django isn't a slave.<br />Django is a free man, you understand?
1860360 1860527 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1863405 1863571 'cause he ain't like any of the<br />other niggers around here. You got it?
1866700 1866866 You want I should<br />treat him like white folks?
1869411 1869911 No. That's not what I said.
1874416 1874582 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1879045 1879212 Yes, I can see that. Uh...
1881172 1881339 What's the name of that peckerwood boy<br />from town that works with the glass?
1884092 1884259 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1885760 1885927 - Oh, you mean Jerry.<br />- That's the boy's name. Jerry!
1889055 1889222 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
1892183 1892392 - Yes'm, Big Daddy.<br />- Well, that's it, then.
1895687 1899149 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1901860 1902027 [Playing medium-tempo tune]
1904946 1906114 That house we just left from<br />is the big house.
1908283 1908450 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
1911953 1912120 That there is the pantry.
1914164 1915874 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1918293 1918460 Po' little squirrels.
1920211 1920378 What you do for your Massa?
1922797 1922964 Didn't you hear him tell you<br />I ain't no slave?
1925300 1927135 - So you really free?<br />- Yes, I's free.
1929596 1929763 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1932849 1933016 - Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.<br />- What you want?
1934476 1934642 I'm lookin' for three white men.<br />Three brothers. Overseers.
1936519 1936686 Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?
1940982 1941149 - Brittle?<br />- Yes, Brittle.
1942984 1943568 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
1945403 1945570 I don't know them.
1947822 1947989 They could be usin' a different name.
1950617 1950784 They woulda come to the plantation<br />this past year.
1952911 1953078 - You mean the Shaffers?<br />- Maybe.
1954829 1954996 - Three brothers?<br />- Uh-huh.
1956748 1956915 - They here?<br />- Uh-huh.
1959209 1965173 Could you point one of 'em out to me?
1968009 1973306 Well, one's over in that field.
1974891 1975058 [Medium-tempo song plays]
1976017 1976184 [Django] Old man Carrucan ain't<br />gonna appreciate this, now.

1988988 1989155 Now, your Bible say...
1990782 1990949 [Django] Look, I told you<br />that I was one that made her do it.
1993243 1993409 You ready?
1994786 1994953 She didn't wanna run off with me. If<br />anybody should be gettin' whupped now,
1997914 1998081 it should be me. It should be me, John.
2000667 2007674 Now, I been here long enough, you know<br />me, you know me a long time, now.
2009634 2009801 [Dogs barKing in distance]

2054429 2056264 [Whip cracKing, echoing]
2057432 2058725 Is that who you was lookin' for?
2058892 2062645 Yep.

2093092 2094052 - [CracKing]<br />- "...And the dread of ye
2094218 2095595 shall be on every beast<br />of the earth."'
2095762 2098848 [cracKing]
2116032 2117784 Come here now, woman!
2119869 2122163 - You'd better give me that arm!<br />- [Screaming]
2131881 2135885 Ok, she's ready!
2139305 2141224 [Whimpering]
2161786 2164455 And after this, we'll see<br />if you break eggs again.
2175383 2177760 John Brittle!
2183516 2186060 - You remember me?<br />- [Metal springing noise]
2195111 2196904 I like the way you die, boy.
2197530 2198948 Goddamn son of a bitch!
2199657 2200742 [Grunting]
2204120 2205580 [Whip cracKing]
2209459 2211169 [Groaning]
2220219 2221804 - Keep it funny!<br />- [Grunting]
2231147 2232607 [Yelling]
2233399 2234859 [Man groaning]
2236110 2237779 Y'all wanna see somethin'?
2242283 2243701 [CocKing pistol]
2247914 2249457 No! [Groans]

2253336 2254837 Who were they?
2255004 2257340 That's big John,<br />and that's Lil Raj.
2262178 2263679 Where's Ellis?
2263846 2265765 He's the one hightailin' it<br />across that field right now.
2265932 2268184 - You sure that's him?<br />- Yeah.
2268351 2269602 - Positive?<br />- I don't know.
2269769 2272063 - You don't know if you're positive?<br />- I don't know what "positive" mean.
2285284 2286869 - It means you're sure.<br />- Yes.
2291916 2292917 - "Yes," what?<br />- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2294710 2297130 I'm positive he dead.
2297296 2299549 Django!
2299715 2301259 Everybody calm down.
2301425 2304428 We mean no one else any harm.
2304595 2307265 Who are you two jokers?
2307431 2312019 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative
2312186 2314147 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America.
2314313 2318401 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2318568 2322446 In my pocket is a warrant,
2322613 2327618 signed by Circuit Court Judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,
2327785 2329871 for the arrest and capture,<br />dead or alive,
2331289 2335418 of John Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2335585 2337253 They were goin' by the name Shaffer.
2337420 2338880 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
2339046 2343176 These are wanted men.
2343342 2346637 The law wants 'em for murder.
2346804 2350266 Now, I reiterate, the warrant<br />states dead or alive,
2351392 2355771 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2355938 2359984 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2360151 2362528 I realize passions are high,
2362695 2366616 but I must warn you,<br />the penalty for taKing deadly force
2369493 2374373 against an officer of the court<br />in the performance of his duty
2376459 2377585 is you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2394143 2395478 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2401984 2404278 Gimme.
2409992 2412995 Satisfied?
2413663 2418084 May I have that back, please?
2421170 2423631 - Get off my land.<br />- Posthaste.
2443943 2447446 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can<br />and let's get outta here.
2455329 2458708 [Schultz whistling indistinctly]
2460543 2464839 Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
2472680 2475725 [Galloping hoofbeats]
2487486 2488738 - [Dramatic choral music]<br />- [Horses snorting, whinnying]
2490948 2494452 [Men yelling, whooping]
2503669 2508090 Come on, men!
2508257 2510468 - [Man 1] We're coming for you, nigger!<br />- [Man 2] Hee-haw!
2511218 2513846 Now, unless they start shootin' first,<br />nobody shoot 'em.
2514013 2519060 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2522938 2524148 We're gonna whup that<br />nigger-lover to death.
2525483 2528110 And I'm gonna personally<br />strip and clip that garboon myself.
2529028 2530321 Damn.
2530488 2532865 I can't see fuckin' shit<br />outta this thing.
2533032 2535409 We ready or what?
2535576 2537787 [Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,<br />I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
2537953 2539997 - [Fabric ripping]<br />- Oh... oh, shit.
2540164 2543125 I just made it worse.
2543292 2546879 Who made this goddamn shit?
2547046 2549632 - Willard's wife.<br />- Well, make your own goddamn masks!
2549799 2551467 Look, nobody's sayin'<br />they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
2551634 2554428 Well, if all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2554595 2555805 I coulda cut it better than this!
2555971 2560309 What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2560476 2563979 Not too good.
2564146 2566232 I mean, if I don't move my head I can<br />see you pretty good, more or less.
2566774 2568442 But when I start ridin', the bag's<br />movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
2569276 2570403 - Shit.<br />- [Man] Yeah.
2570569 2572113 I just made mine worse.
2572279 2575241 Oh, God.
2575408 2577034 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2577201 2578994 No, nobody brought an extra bag!
2579161 2580371 I'm just askin'.
2580538 2583624 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
2583791 2585751 Oh, well, shitfire!
2585918 2588629 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,<br />that just defeats the purpose!
2588796 2591215 Well, I can't see<br />in this fuckin' thing!
2591382 2595177 I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing<br />and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
2595344 2597346 Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!
2597513 2601267 Now, I watched my wife work all day<br />gettin' 30 bags together
2601434 2604603 for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,
2605896 2608774 and all I can hear is<br />criticize, criticize, criticize!
2608941 2612027 From now on, don't ask me<br />or mine for nothin'!
2612194 2613529 Now, look, let's not forget<br />why we're here.
2613696 2617533 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill there!
2617700 2622496 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2622663 2623622 Ok, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2623789 2627877 I think we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2628836 2632548 - Yeah.<br />- [Mumbling agreements]
2632715 2637720 But, not pointin' any fingers,<br />they coulda been done better.
2637887 2639889 So how 'bout no bags this time,
2640055 2643392 but next time we do the bags right<br />and then we go full regalia.
2643559 2645561 - I like that idea a lot.<br />- You get my vote, Robert.
2645728 2646812 Wait a minute!<br />I didn't say no bags.
2646979 2648856 But nobody can see.
2649023 2653777 So?
2653944 2659325 So it'd be nice to see.
2659492 2662286 Goddamn it! This is a raid!<br />I can't see, you can't see!
2663078 2664788 So what? All that matters is can<br />the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!
2664955 2668584 - [Overlapping shouts]<br />- [Man] Sons of bitches!
2669418 2671420 I can't see shit!
2671587 2673214 [Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger<br />out from under that wagon!
2673380 2674798 And get that nigger-lover<br />outta the wagon!
2674965 2676008 That nigger ain't down here,<br />Big Daddy!
2676175 2677593 - What?<br />- They tricked us!
2679053 2681347 Well, where are they?
2683307 2685100 Auf wiedersehen.
2685267 2686310 - [All shouting]<br />- [Horses whinnying]
2686477 2689146 Oh! [Chuckles]
2689313 2692608 Bull's-eye.
2695236 2697821 - [Men yelling]<br />- [Horses whinnying]
2697988 2699949 - [Django] Look at 'em run.<br />- [All shouting]
2706080 2707331 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
2711961 2713671 Goddamn it!
2720469 2722304 [Big Daddy] Goddamn it!
2722930 2725099 Would you care to?
2727142 2728602 Can't see shit outta this!
2728769 2730020 - He's getting away.<br />- I got him.
2734483 2736986 [Schultz]<br />Big Daddy's getting away.
2745286 2746328 I got him.
2751166 2754169 - [Slow-motion impact sound]<br />- [Big Daddy grunting]
2758841 2760509 Got him.
2764847 2768642 [Chuckles] The kid's a natural.
2768809 2771061 [Animal yipping nearby]
2771228 2773939 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2774106 2776358 Broomhilda is a German name.
2777151 2780112 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2780279 2784199 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2784366 2786327 Broomhilda is the name of a character
2786493 2788203 in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2794251 2797713 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2804136 2805512 Oh, yes, there is.
2807014 2813020 - Do you know it?<br />- Oh, every German knows that story.
2814855 2818942 Would you like me to tell you?
2819985 2823197 Well, Broomhilda was a princess.
2823364 2824615 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />God of all gods.
2825574 2827034 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2827201 2829870 What she do?
2830037 2833207 I can't exactly remember.
2833874 2835000 She disobeys him in some way.
2835167 2836418 So he puts her on top of the Mountain.
2836585 2839380 Broomhilda's on a Mountain?
2839546 2843592 It's a German legend,
2845260 2850349 there's always going to be<br />a Mountain in there somewhere.
2851809 2856146 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the Mountain.
2857439 2862736 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2863821 2865406 And there, Broomhilda shall remain.
2865572 2868534 Unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2868701 2870744 Does a fella arise?
2871453 2872454 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,<br />he does.
2874623 2877251 A fella named Siegfried.
2878293 2882423 Does Siegfried save her?
2883132 2887302 Quite spectacularly so.
2887469 2889972 He scales the Mountain,<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2892307 2894685 He slays the dragon,<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2898814 2900482 And he walks through hellfire...
2901942 2904820 ...because Broomhilda's worth it.
2910325 2914496 I know how he feel.
2917416 2921462 I think I'm just<br />starting to realize that.
2922588 2926175 Now, look, Django...
2927217 2931680 ...I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2931847 2934725 ...but I can't let you go to<br />Greenville in a good conscience.
2937686 2939855 A slave auction town in Miss.issippi<br />isn't the place for you to visit.
2947362 2949782 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2951283 2953619 But let me ask you a question.
2954453 2955788 How do you like the<br />bounty hunting business?
2955954 2958373 Kill white folks<br />and they pay you for it?
2958540 2961376 What's not to like?
2961543 2963629 Now, I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2963796 2965756 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
2966548 2968759 Yeah, on that occasion<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2968926 2970928 but normally, that's a good thing.
2971094 2975390 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2976391 2978393 What you mean "partner up"?
2979603 2983524 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2983690 2986610 ...I give you a third of my bounties.
2986777 2989988 So we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts,
2994243 2995994 I'll take you to Greenville myself
2997746 2999706 and we'll find<br />where they sent your wife.
2999873 3001250 Why you care what happen to me?
3002543 3005420 Why you care if I find my wife?
3005587 3009424 Frankly...
3010676 3014388 ...I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3016932 3019810 And now that I have,<br />I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3019977 3022604 Plus, when a German meets a real life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3029361 3032531 As a German, I'm obliged<br />to help you on your quest
3151900 3152901 to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
3159700 3164621 [Medium-tempo song plays]
3164788 3167499 [Man] You got her.
3167666 3169251 Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I wanna<br />shoot white folks for money"?
3169418 3171920 - His son's with him.<br />- Well, good.
3173922 3175966 He'll have a loved one with him.
3176133 3178427 Maybe even share a last word.
3186601 3187936 That's better than most of them get.
3190939 3192649 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3193442 3195777 Put down the rifle.
3199740 3201241 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3202117 3203910 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3206329 3208999 Read it aloud.
3209958 3213879 Consider that today's lesson.
3214046 3216298 "Wanted. Dead or alive.
3216465 3220135 Smitty Bacall and the<br />Smitty Bacall
3221553 3223096 - [schultz] Gang.<br />- "Gang."

3237360 3239154 "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
3240197 3242199 $1,500 for each of his...
3242908 3247537 ...
3247704 3249456 - mem...<br />- "Members.
3249623 3253335 Known members of the Smitty Bacall<br />gang are as follas:"
3254461 3256379 - Follows.<br />- "Follows."
3257380 3259633 "Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."
3259800 3262677 Crazy Craig Koons.
3262844 3264805 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3265514 3268934 If Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to start a farm at 22,
3269101 3271520 they would never have printed that.
3272187 3275524 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches
3276775 3278235 and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3278401 3281947 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3282864 3286660 This is what I do.
3286827 3289037 I kill people and<br />sell their corpses for cash.
3293834 3295836 This corpse is worth $7,000.
3297003 3298380 Now quit your pussyfooting<br />and shoot him.
3299172 3300549 [Horse whinnying]

3310517 3312227 Pa?
3312394 3314479 Pa!
3314646 3316731 Here.
3316898 3319693 You need to keep this<br />Smitty Bacall handbill.
3329452 3332205 - Why?<br />- It's good luck.
3367616 3369034 You always keep the handbill<br />of your first bounty.
3383715 3385592 [Up-tempo guitar music plays]
3396311 3397687 That's accurate.
3403693 3406655 - [Horses whinny]<br />- [Overlapping gunshots]

3441523 3443692 [Bellowing]
3443858 3445819 Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?
3445986 3448989 Who the hell-a you got there?
3449698 3454244 [Schultz] The Wilson-Lowe gang.
3454411 3458039 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe gang?
3458206 3460583 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner<br />Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
3460750 3462585 Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,<br />they ain't going nowhere.
3462752 3465297 Why don't you come in then<br />out of the snowy snow
3465463 3466881 and get yourselves some coffee.
3486151 3488862 We had a birthday yesterday.<br />Got some cake.
3489029 3491364 Pretty good.
3496703 3498788 [Chains rattling]
3500332 3501583 [Man 1] Move along!

3505253 3507630 [Man 2] Keep movin'.
3524064 3525315 Get on up on that auction block.
3527776 3531696 Don't let that mud slow you down.<br />Keep going.

3537369 3541790 'R' on right cheek."
3541956 3543291 Calvin Candie.
3543458 3544542 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Miss.issippi: Candyland.
3544709 3546795 Candyland?
3546961 3549631 Oh, so you've heard of it.
3549798 3551466 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3551633 3555178 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3555345 3557472 - [Sighs]<br />- ...And that's the repellant gentleman
3557639 3559641 who owns her. Let's just hope she<br />works in the house, not in the field.
3560308 3562227 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3563812 3565605 She... she pretty.
3566815 3568983 And she talk good, too.
3570402 3571569 But when they tore her back up<br />and then they...
3572195 3573321 ...burned that runaway "r"<br />on her cheek...
3573488 3575031 ...they goddamned her.
3576282 3577659 [Yells]
3577826 3579828 - [Sizzling]<br />- [Screaming]
3579994 3581287 She ain't no field nigger<br />but she ain't good enough
3581454 3583331 for the house no more either.
3584249 3585542 They gonna try to<br />make her a comfort girl.
3587127 3588920 What's a comfort...? Oh.
3592006 3593716 Not while I got freedom.
3596344 3597720 Not while I got my gun.
3599305 3600974 So do we offer to buy her?
3603143 3606354 So...
3606521 3608565 ...say...
3609524 3612485 ...a man wants to buy a horse.
3612652 3614320 Needs to buy a horse.
3614487 3616281 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />and he knocks on the farmer's door
3616448 3618658 and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
3620160 3625123 And do you know what the farmer says?
3625290 3629419 The farmer says no.
3629586 3631713 Well, I say fuck that farmer,<br />and I'm stealin' that horse.
3631880 3633506 Fair enough. But now you're a horse<br />thief, and they hang horse thieves.
3633673 3637552 Not to mention the horse<br />goes back to its original owner
3637719 3640013 because the horse is still his property.
3641097 3644684 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
3644851 3646352 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />then how we gonna get her?
3646519 3651065 May I offer an alternative<br />plan of action?
3651232 3652775 Go ahead.
3653485 3658531 So... the man walks up<br />to the farmer's farm,
3658698 3662076 he knocks on the farmer's door...
3662243 3665038 ...and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3665914 3668666 And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3668833 3672086 the farmer is forced to say yes.
3673546 3675590 - We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />- No, it's far too big.
3675757 3676758 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3676925 3679761 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3679928 3681596 What?
3681763 3682805 Can you convincingly<br />masquerade as someone
3682972 3686601 who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
3686768 3690188 Why?
3690355 3694275 [Schultz] Because my character is that<br />of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,
3694442 3696402 here in Greenville to buy my way<br />into the Mandingo fight game.
3699489 3700949 And your character is a Mandingo expert<br />I hired to help me do it.
3701199 3703868 [Django]<br />They call that "One-Eyed Charley."
3704035 3706955 Bonjour.
3707121 3708706 [Speaks French]
3711209 3712669 We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.
3713711 3716339 Entraz.
3716506 3719175 - Thank you.<br />- Hm-mm.
3719342 3722804 You want me to play a black slaver?
3723471 3725598 Ain't nothin' Lower than a black slaver.
3726724 3728726 A black slaver is Lower<br />than the head house nigger...
3728893 3732939 ...and, buddy,<br />that's pretty fuckin' low.
3733648 3735441 Then play him that way.
3735608 3740572 Give me your black slaver.
3740738 3743074 [People singing<br />medium-tempo song]
3744325 3746202 Â... along came the 219<br />toot! Toot! Peanut butter!
3746369 3749581 [Singing continues indistinctly]
3749747 3752542 Dr. Schultz!
3752709 3755503 - Good to see you again!<br />- Mr. Moguy.
3755670 3758506 Thank you for your assistance<br />in creating the opportunity
3758673 3761092 - for this appointment.<br />- Nonsense, it's my job.
3761259 3763928 So this is the One-Eyed Charley<br />I've heard so much about.
3764095 3766055 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
3766222 3769392 Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,<br />Leonide Moguy.
3769559 3771853 Just call me Leo.
3772020 3774480 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.<br />You all wanna follow me?
3774647 3776441 [Schultz] How long have you been<br />associated with Mr. Candie?
3776608 3779694 [Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I<br />were about 11
3779861 3782864 when we went to<br />boarding school together.
3783031 3784782 Calvin's father's father<br />put me through law school.
3785658 3787076 One could almost say<br />I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
3787243 3789996 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3790538 3794959 What did you say?
3795126 3797128 - I said...<br />- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3797295 3799088 Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3799255 3801507 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3801674 3804135 [Chuckles]<br />What civilized people aren't?
3804302 3808306 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3809557 3811059 [Speaks French]
3811225 3813478 He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br />French to him, it'll embarrass him.
3813645 3815146 [Men fighting, grunting]
3815313 3816939 [Man] Get back on top, now!<br />Turn around!
3818816 3821069 There you go.
3823905 3827659 There you go.
3828409 3830286 Why do you want to get in<br />the Mandingo business?
3830453 3831788 You don't intend to allow your second<br />to make the proper introductions?
3834457 3837877 Quit stalling, now.
3838044 3840421 Answer the question.
3845343 3847345 The awful truth? I'm bored.
3847512 3850223 This seems like a good bit of fun.
3852392 3854102 Well, come on over.
3854268 3855728 We got us a fight goin' on<br />that's a good bit of fun.
3855895 3858022 [Man speaks foreign language]
3864987 3866989 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
3876541 3877959 [Grunting, punches continue]
3878126 3879544 You don't wear a hat in the house,<br />white man. Even I know that.
3879711 3882505 - Dr. Schultz.<br />- What a rare pleasure.
3882672 3884590 Keep fighting, niggers.
3884757 3888261 - And I might add, an honor.<br />- Honor to meet you.
3888428 3890722 Please have a seat,<br />the pleasure's all mine.
3901274 3903860 Get free man Django here<br />whatever he wants.
3907321 3910199 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
3910366 3913411 [Grunting from fighters continues]
3913578 3915830 - [Man yelling]<br />- [Grunting]
3915997 3917582 [Calvin] Use your weight, boy,<br />use your weight! There you go.
3917749 3920251 He's much bigger and stronger!
3920418 3922336 Come on, now!
3924338 3927133 He's not doing what I told him,<br />for God's sakes.
3927300 3930386 [SpeaKing foreign language]
3930553 3931846 Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3934932 3937185 - [Grunting]<br />- You either hit him or are you ain't?
3938394 3941481 [Yelling]
3941647 3943191 [SpeaKing foreign language]
3946986 3951324 - Big Fred, come on!<br />- [Grunting]

3963211 3965254 There you go! Look at that.
3965421 3966881 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3967048 3969342 Do what I told you, boy!
3969509 3972553 - There you go!<br />- [Bones cracKing]
3972720 3974806 - No!<br />- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!
3974972 3977475 Blind him black, boy!<br />Blind him black!
3980686 3984607 [Man screaming]
3985233 3986400 - Oh, no, Luigi.<br />- [Screaming]
3986567 3989403 - Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br />- [Screaming]
3993533 3994492 Oh...
3994659 3996786 - [Panting]<br />- [Man continues screaming]
3996953 3998246 [Playing pool]
4002542 4004293 [Screaming continues]
4006003 4007255 Finish him.
4008798 4010508 Go on, boy, finish him!
4010675 4014095 [Screaming halts]
4014262 4016472 [Moguy] That's why they<br />call him big Fred.
4016639 4019642 - Worth every penny.<br />- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
4020268 4021978 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4043082 4044292 You did a fine job.<br />A real fine job.
4054302 4055803 Mercedes.
4057972 4059473 Tequila.
4061893 4063561 What's your name?
4065688 4069734 Django.
4071235 4072737 Can you spell it?
4072904 4074488 D-j-a-n-g-o.
4081203 4082288 The d is silent.
4082455 4085958 I know.
4086125 4087835 [Speaks foreign language]
4088002 4090588 [Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to<br />take care of my new boy here.
4090755 4093507 You find him a room<br />with a soft bed,
4093674 4094675 then you bring him up<br />a pony to lick his pole.
4094842 4098721 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
4102558 4105561 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
4105728 4107021 Before you go,<br />Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
4116530 4120326 You enjoy that, boy.<br />You've earned it.
4120493 4121702 Yessir.
4123871 4125498 - What's your name, boy?<br />- His name is Django Freeman.
4125665 4128918 [Calvin chuckles]
4130628 4132713 Where'd you dig him up?
4133464 4136217 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4136384 4138511 I've heard tell about you.
4138678 4142890 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
4144850 4147269 Ain't nothin' nobody<br />is sellin' is worth buyin'.
4150564 4152650 I'm curious... what makes you<br />such a Mandingo expert?
4153693 4155027 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4155861 4157071 - What did you say, boy?<br />- Calm down, Butch.
4157238 4158948 No offense given...
4159115 4162618 ...none taken.
4162785 4164245 [Schultz] Monsieur Candie...
4164870 4167999 ...I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4168165 4171002 One...
4171168 4173004 ...you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4173170 4175006 - Yes! I'll have a beer.<br />- Wunderbar.
4175172 4177258 Roscoe, a beer<br />for the man with the beard,
4177425 4180928 and I will have a<br />Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4181095 4182805 Do not spare the rum.
4182972 4188102 Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.
4189562 4192773 You are, well, you are a neophyte.
4193482 4195359 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this<br />cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
4195526 4197653 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
4197820 4200364 ...I didn't seek you<br />out for your advice.
4200531 4203075 I sought you out to<br />purchase a fighting nigger
4203242 4205619 at above top-dollar market price.
4208330 4210791 Now I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4210958 4213294 it would be to discuss business.
4215588 4216589 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
4216756 4219467 We were discussin' my curiosity.
4221469 4224930 Thank you.
4225097 4226640 [Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,<br />go outside and play.
4228392 4230895 Sheba... you stay right there.
4231812 4235608 I know you didn't mean me.
4235775 4237818 - Prost!<br />- German.
4237985 4240404 Now, according to Moguy,<br />if I do business with you,
4240571 4244325 I'm doing business with both y'all.
4244492 4245659 He does the eyeballin',<br />you the billfold? Is that it?
4246952 4247953 Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4248120 4250039 Hm.
4250206 4252166 So...
4252333 4254502 ...bright boy...
4254668 4256170 ...Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh
4258339 4260382 and you was<br />none too impressed, huh?
4260549 4262676 Not for top dollar.
4262843 4265096 Well, then,<br />we got nothin' more to talk about.
4265262 4267223 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4268182 4271352 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell so...
4271519 4275815 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4278067 4281737 He wants the nigger<br />you don't wanna sell.
4281904 4284323 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4284490 4288160 Well, you won't sell your best.
4288327 4292248 You won't even sell your second best.
4293040 4295084 But your third best...?<br />You don't want to sell him either.
4297419 4299713 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4300714 4304802 [Chortles]<br />...Who knows what could happen?
4306554 4308597 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4311976 4313686 For a truly talented specimen,<br />the right nigger?
4314395 4316063 How much would you say, Django?
4318232 4322236 Twelve thousand dollars.
4322403 4324321 [Straw slurping]
4338002 4343674 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,
4343841 4346260 but now you have my attention.
4346427 4350347 Willie. Willie.<br />Hold up! Hold up. Ah!
4350514 4353392 - Good morning, gentlemen.<br />- Good Dr. Schultz.
4353559 4355102 - Beautiful morning, isn't it?<br />- You couldn't have picked a better one.
4355269 4357396 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the Victoria.
4365613 4366906 [Schultz]<br />Oh, thank you very much.
4371702 4375331 You can tie your horse up back there.
4375497 4380669 [Calvin] Django.
4380836 4384965 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4385132 4389803 is I believe there is a level<br />above bright, above talented,
4389970 4391472 above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
4392473 4394516 Say, one nigger that<br />just pops up in 10,000.
4395643 4396810 The exceptional nigger.
4397978 4399855 Bright day, huh, bright boy?
4404610 4407529 Sun is up.
4407696 4408989 Shining on all of us.
4409156 4410866 - [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.<br />- [Schultz] Thank you.
4411033 4414411 Quite an honor.
4414578 4417539 - The honor is all ours.<br />- Thank you.
4418499 4420334 [Calvin] But I do believe that,<br />given time,
4421585 4423212 exceptional niggers<br />like bright boy here...
4424964 4429551 ...become if not frequent...
4429718 4432596 ...more frequent.
4433180 4435266 Bright boy,<br />you are that one in 10,000.
4445484 4446860 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4448362 4451782 [Men laughing]
4451949 4453867 - Whoa!<br />- [Whinnying]
4454034 4455077 - Touch your guns, you die.<br />- Everybody, calm down!
4455244 4457246 Now I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4457413 4459957 Are you kidding me?
4461041 4463836 - This nigger just...<br />- I said no harm done!
4465045 4468048 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4469550 4471760 Butch, that means you too.
4472511 4474054 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4474221 4478517 Hoot! Get back up on your horse.
4478684 4481729 He broke my collarbone!
4483105 4483272 For God's sake, somebody please help<br />Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
4485733 4485900 - [Man] Yessir, boss.<br />- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
4487693 4488527 You better listen to your boss,<br />white boy.
4490154 4490321 Oh, I'm gonna go<br />walKing in the moonlight with you.
4492323 4492490 You wanna hold my hand?
4494116 4494283 [Chuckling]
4496953 4499205 [Rap song playing]
4501207 4507588 [ClucKing]
4508839 4516839 Willie, take us home.
4556012 4556178 [Man] Start moving!
4557430 4557596 Head 'em out!
4559098 4560307 You got a problem<br />with your eyeball, boy?
4561267 4561434 No, sir.
4564478 4564645 You want a boot heel in it?
4567773 4567940 No, sir.
4569483 4570026 Then you keep your<br />goddamn eyeballs off me.
4571444 4571610 You flash that bad look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4573738 4573904 Now move, nigger!
4575781 4575948 [Horse snorting]
4579535 4579702 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something about me.
4582747 4582913 I'm worse than any of these<br />white men here.
4584248 4586751 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4590129 4590296 He is a rambunctious sort,<br />ain't he? [Chuckles]
4594008 4594175 Indeed.
4597261 4597428 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4601807 4604769 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4606604 4606771 so before that moment,<br />it would be good if I could have
4608814 4612860 a confidential strategy meeting<br />with my confidant.
4615446 4615613 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4618991 4619158 I confirmed that Broomhilda's<br />at Candyland.
4621035 4621202 - You're sure it's her?<br />- He didn't call her by name,
4623662 4623829 but she's a young lady, whip marks<br />on her back and speaks German.
4628459 4628626 Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4630586 4630753 in this instance,<br />I think it's pretty safe.
4632546 4632713 Point being, don't get so<br />carried away with your retribution.
4635216 4635382 You lose sight of why we're here.
4640346 4640513 - You think I lost sight of that?<br />- Yes, I do.
4645184 4645351 Stop antagonizing Candie.
4648354 4648521 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or more than likely get us both killed.
4651065 4652066 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Miss.issippi, USA.
4657488 4657655 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4659448 4660866 You're yelling abuse<br />at these poor slaves.
4661992 4664245 I recall the man who had me<br />kill another man in front of his son
4665579 4665746 and he didn't bat a eye.
4669208 4670167 You remember that?
4672169 4673170 Yeah, of course I remember.
4676048 4679718 What you said was that<br />this is my world...
4682888 4684348 ...and in my world you gotta get dirty.
4686433 4686934 So that's what I'm doing.<br />I'm gettin' dirty.
4688102 4690187 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4691689 4699405 ...that was the general gist.
4701991 4703284 [Sighing]
4705327 4713327 See you at Candyland.
4716797 4724797 [Django]<br />All right, niggers, back at it.
4744116 4752116 That means you too, moonlight.
4755586 4755753 [Dogs barKing nearby]
4759006 4759173 [Dogs barKing loudly]
4761258 4761425 [Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!
4762718 4762885 Now, boy, why do a<br />fool thing like run off?
4766430 4766597 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4769016 4769183 [Calvin] Yes, you can.
4771810 4771977 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4774021 4774188 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4775731 4775898 - I cannot hear myself think!<br />- Quiet down, Marsha!
4778525 4778692 Marsha, hush up! Marsha!
4780945 4788035 Hush up! Hey!
4791497 4791664 Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4793332 4793874 [Dogs whining]
4795542 4799797 Come on now, boy...<br />Get on out that tree.
4801173 4809173 Yessir.
4818023 4818190 [Dogs resume barKing]
4821443 4821610 [BarKing stops]
4823237 4824363 How long was he loose?
4825906 4826073 [Speech slurred]<br />A night. Day.
4827783 4827950 Half the other night.
4830077 4830244 How far he get off the property?
4831620 4832871 'Bout 20 Miles off the prop.
4836208 4836375 Pretty far considering<br />that limp he got.
4838002 4839169 Hm.
4841880 4842047 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4844550 4844717 One-a this new lot.
4846218 4846385 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4848804 4848971 [D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur<br />Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.
4851432 4854893 - Now, now, now, now, now.<br />- I can't...
4857438 4860357 Now, no beggin'.
4863902 4864069 No playin' on my soft heart.
4868949 4869116 - You in trouble now, son.<br />- Yessir.
4871493 4871660 I done paid $500 for you.
4875539 4875706 When I pay $500, then I expect<br />to get five fights out of a nigger
4878417 4878584 - 'fore he roll over and play dead.<br />- Sir.
4880085 4880252 You got to understand<br />that I'm runnin' a business here.
4883255 4883422 - You fought three fights.<br />- But I won every one.
4884465 4887134 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
4889178 4889345 But that last one, you muddled the line<br />between winnin' and losin'.
4892973 4893140 Yessir.
4895684 4897561 Still, the fact remains:
4899480 4901023 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
4907029 4909406 So what about my $500, huh?
4909573 4911617 What about my $500?
4913410 4915913 You gonna reimburse me?
4917915 4919625 You even know what "reimburse" means?
4923379 4924588 - [Laughing]<br />- [Calvin] Huh?
4925798 4927341 [Laughter continues]
4930094 4932805 I'll reimburse you!
4932972 4936433 You will?
4936600 4937726 Yep.
4939979 4942064 You'll pay $500
4942982 4944942 for practically a One-Eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4945109 4947570 No, he won't.
4947736 4949530 He just tired of you<br />toyin' with him is all.
4951282 4952491 Matter of fact, so am I.
4961667 4965421 But we ain't payin' a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4965588 4969258 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4970050 4972011 You heard him.
4974263 4975723 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4976724 4978058 He ain't never seen a<br />nigger like you ever in his life.
4979351 4980936 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4987026 4988193 That right.
4989361 4992489 [Calvin] For that matter...
4994992 4998329 ...nor have I.
4999455 5000998 Now...
5004752 5006837 ...seein' as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5007630 5011592 ...you won't mind me handlin'<br />this nigger any way I see fit?
5011759 5016555 He's your nigger.
5018015 5020225 Mr. Stonesipher?
5021268 5023771 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5023938 5025356 - Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!<br />- [Barks echoing]
5030569 5033197 Get 'im, get 'im!
5053717 5055761 - Yeah!<br />- Whoo!
5055928 5058097 Whoo-ee!
5058263 5062893 - [Dogs snarling]<br />- [Screaming]
5063477 5064770 Your boss looks a little<br />green around the gills
5065854 5067231 for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5067398 5070359 Nah, he just ain't used to seein'<br />a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5070526 5075239 Hm.
5075406 5077032 You are used to it?
5077199 5080577 I'm just a little more<br />used to Americans than he is.
5080744 5082371 - Hm.<br />- Now, Monsieur Candie...
5083580 5087960 ...whenever you're ready.
5090170 5091588 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5104059 5105894 Let's get to it.
5111734 5113152 'Cause as of now,<br />if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
5113318 5114528 Follow me.
5208872 5211583 [Snarling]
5213210 5214586 [ClucKing]

5297294 5300839 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5301006 5304927 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?<br />What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?
5305093 5308931 - You Miss. me, huh?<br />- Oh, yessir. [Laughs]
5309097 5311183 I Miss. you like a hog Miss. slop!

5318857 5322444 [Laughing]
5322611 5325447 Now, I axed you:<br />Who this nigger on that nag?
5325614 5327282 Hey, Snowball?
5327449 5328825 Wanna know my name or<br />the name of my horse, you ask me.
5328992 5331078 Just who the hell you callin'<br />"Snowball," horse boy?
5331245 5335540 I'll snatch your<br />black ass off that nag there
5335707 5338085 - and in the mud so fast...<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5338252 5340504 - ...make your head spin.<br />- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5340671 5344466 Let's keep it funny.<br />Django here's a free man.
5344633 5347886 - This nigger here?<br />- That nigger there.
5348053 5352057 Let me at least<br />introduce the two of you.
5352224 5356144 Django, this is another cheeky<br />black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5356311 5357688 Stephen, this here's Django.<br />You two oughta hate each other.
5357854 5361358 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5361525 5363902 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5364069 5365737 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5365904 5368532 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />oughta show them every hospitality.
5369533 5371034 - You understand that?<br />- Yessir. Him I understand.
5371201 5373662 But I don't know why<br />I got to take lip off this nigger.
5373829 5375956 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5377124 5378792 Yessir. I understand.
5378959 5381169 Well,good.<br />They're spendin' the night.
5381336 5383922 Go up in the guest bedrooms<br />and get two ready.
5384089 5386383 He gonna stay in the big house?
5386550 5388593 Stephen, he's a slaver.<br />It's different.
5388760 5391096 - In the big house?<br />- Well, you got a problem with that?
5391263 5393515 Oh, no.<br />I ain't got no problem with it,
5393682 5395892 if you ain't got no problem<br />with burnin' the bed, the sheets,
5396059 5397978 the pillowcases, everything else when<br />this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
5398145 5399771 That is my problem!<br />They are mine to burn!
5401898 5403817 Now your problem right now<br />is makin' a good impression!
5405277 5406445 And I want you to start solvin'<br />that problem right now
5407362 5409781 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5409948 5411283 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
5411450 5414995 Go on, now.
5415162 5416330 Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in the big house.
5416496 5421168 Your daddy rollin' over<br />in his goddamned grave.
5421335 5424421 Man, the lip on him. Whoo!<br />He's gettin' worse and worse.
5424588 5429634 Now...
5429801 5433805 Where is my beautiful sister?!
5435057 5438435 There she is!<br />Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5438602 5441980 Dr. Schultz, this attractive<br />Southern belle is my widowed sister.
5442147 5444274 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5444441 5445484 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
5445650 5447402 Chester, Rodney, chicken charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5448612 5451365 - Come on, Charly. Come on, now!<br />- Let's go.
5452074 5455077 You know where it is.
5455243 5459039 Like you on a rope!
5459206 5460165 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run!
5460332 5463335 - Monsieur Candie?<br />- Hm?
5463502 5466088 Yeah. About that matter about the<br />nigger girl you were talKing about?
5466254 5470425 Nigger gal?
5470592 5474763 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5474930 5478308 Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?
5478475 5480310 Do you think before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5480477 5481895 [Laughs] You little dickens, you.<br />I don't see why not.
5482062 5483730 Stephen, when you get through showin'<br />them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,
5483897 5486566 get her cleaned up<br />and smellin' real nice,
5486775 5490445 and sent over to<br />Dr. Schultz's room here.
5491947 5493115 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5493281 5496034 there's-a somethin'<br />I ain't told you 'bout yet.
5496201 5497661 - What?<br />- [Stammers] Uh, Hildi in the hot box.
5497828 5500163 [Calvin] What's she doin' there?
5500330 5502999 [Stephen] What you think she<br />doin' there in the hot box?
5503166 5505669 She bein' punished.
5505836 5508338 - [Calvin] What she do?<br />- [Stephen] She run off again.
5508505 5511174 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5512092 5515595 - Two.<br />- When did she go?
5515762 5520058 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5520225 5523145 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5523311 5524521 [Stephen] Lucky for her,<br />they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
5524688 5526356 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5526523 5529317 Now, she a little beat-up.<br />But she done that to her own damn self
5529484 5532154 runnin' through them<br />damn bushes and shit.
5532320 5535365 [Calvin]<br />How long she been in the box?
5535532 5539453 [Stephen] How long you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5539619 5540579 And the little bitch<br />got ten more days to be in there.
5540745 5543915 - Still, take her out.<br />- Take her out? Why?
5544082 5547294 Because I said so, that's why.<br />Dr. Schultz is my guest.
5547461 5549880 Hildi is my nigger.
5550046 5552507 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5552674 5556845 - But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />- Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557012 5558180 What is the point of havin'<br />a nigger that speaks German
5559473 5562058 if you can't wheel 'em out<br />when you have a German guest?
5562225 5565604 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5565770 5567147 Yessir.
5567314 5572194 [Calvin] Lara Lee!<br />Will you and Cora be responsible
5572360 5575238 for gettin' Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
5577699 5579910 [Lara lee] Of course, darlin'.
5580076 5582829 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am<br />weary from our travels beyond words.
5582996 5585540 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5585707 5588752 [ClucKing]
5588919 5591296 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up outta there!
5591463 5593924 Cora! Come here!
5594090 5597469 Get over there and get her cleaned up,<br />bring her back over here to Dr...
5638343 5640220 - What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />- Schultz.
5641054 5643765 Schultz. Get her back over here.<br />Hurry up, girl.
5644975 5646351 - Yessir.<br />- [Soft guitar music plays]
5646518 5650063 [Hildi screams]
5651356 5653817 Come on, girl. Stand up.
5673795 5677340 [Hildi yelling]
5680051 5682721 [Gasping screaming]
5686266 5688893 [Sobbing]
5764594 5765762 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5772519 5773978 [Slow-tempo song plays]
5774145 5777524 [Woman sings in foreign language]
5781695 5784155 [Exhales]
5785615 5787742 Hello, ladies.
5788785 5791121 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5791287 5794082 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5794249 5796167 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5797335 5799337 I've heard a lot of<br />good things about you.
5799504 5804467 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't ya know.
5807804 5810140 - [Chuckles]<br />- [Forced chuckle]
5812142 5814102 As I look at you now, Broomhilda,
5815645 5817814 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5819941 5823570 The doctor here speaks German.
5824362 5825989 And I've been informed you do as well?
5826156 5828158 Go ahead, girl.<br />Speak a little German.
5828324 5829993 [Speaking German]
5835123 5837333 Ha! [Laughs]
5846843 5847969 Astonishing.
5868615 5870200 [Speaking German]
5871367 5872827 - And I shall bring you...<br />- [Schultz] Much obliged.
5910907 5913409 Ja.
5921000 5922293 [Speaks German]
5966129 5967755 Don't be afraid.
6010548 6012592 Hm. Pardon.
6027732 6029317 Danke.
6029901 6031486 [Chuckling]
6033905 6035073 [Repeats German phrase]
6037909 6041204 Hey, little trouble maker.
6042789 6044123 [Gasping]
6044290 6045541 [Moaning]
6045708 6048670 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6048836 6051589 - Hurry up, girl.<br />- These ready, Miss. Cora.
6051756 6053967 No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.
6054133 6056719 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the<br />red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
6056886 6062684 - Get your big pretty ass out the way.<br />- You know you like it.
6062850 6067230 [Laughs] That's 'cause<br />you knows what I like.
6068606 6070191 Ooh!<br />Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6070358 6073695 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were<br />all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
6073861 6076447 But the best three by far were samson...
6076614 6079701 - What's that other one's name?<br />- Goldie.
6079867 6082453 Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
6082620 6084622 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6086124 6091462 [Chuckles] You never know how<br />these nigger nicknames get started.
6091629 6095341 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6095508 6099262 [All laugh]
6099929 6102015 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.<br />We all know that.
6102181 6103975 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why. He's a champion.
6105268 6106769 Hm-hm.<br />All three are champions.
6106936 6108062 Samson's the champion.
6108229 6110314 Them other two pretty good.
6110481 6113860 Calvin, now what's<br />this nigger you let...
6114027 6118322 It's all right.
6118489 6119574 You have to understand,<br />Monsieur Candie,
6119741 6123828 while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger fight game,
6123995 6124954 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6125121 6127582 Is that right?
6129333 6131544 Hence, I have big ideas<br />when it comes to presentation.
6131711 6134797 Hm.
6134964 6137717 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6137884 6141095 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6141262 6142889 - Need to have what? What?<br />- Panache. Uh...
6143056 6144432 - A sense of showmanship.<br />- Showmanship, yes.
6144599 6145600 I want to be able to bill him<br />as the black Hercules.
6145767 6147894 [All chuckling]
6148061 6153441 The black Hercules,<br />isn't that clever?
6153941 6156736 More like nigger-les.
6156903 6161199 [Laughing]
6161365 6164077 I said, and I quote:<br />"I would pay top dollar for...
6165328 6166746 ...'the right nigger."'
6166913 6170708 now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6170875 6172794 But is he right as rain?
6172960 6174712 Oh, Dr. Schultz,
6174879 6175880 I will have you know there<br />is no one in the nigger fight game
6176047 6177882 that appreciates<br />the value of showmanship
6178049 6179425 more than Monsieur<br />Calvin j. Candie here.
6179592 6181594 Nobody.
6181761 6182970 But one must not forget<br />the most important thing
6183137 6187350 - in the nigger fight game.<br />- Hm-mm.
6187517 6189560 And that is a nigger<br />that can win fights.
6189727 6193689 Hm-mm.
6193856 6196400 Now that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth, and fifth concern.
6196567 6198027 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6202865 6204492 then you can start<br />to implement a grand design.
6205701 6209080 In other words, first thing is first.
6209247 6211124 First thing's first.
6211874 6214544 [Whispers in German]
6214710 6218047 Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.
6218214 6220049 Famously.
6220216 6222301 Oh, Monsieur Candie,<br />you can't imagine what it's like
6222468 6224512 not to hear your<br />native tongue in four years.
6224679 6227473 Well, hell,<br />I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
6227640 6229350 [Laughing]
6229517 6234730 Two weeks in Boston!
6234897 6238985 - Monsieur Candie, you a mess!<br />- [Coughing]
6239152 6241028 [Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!
6241195 6242530 I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6242697 6243948 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6244115 6246200 [Calvin] Well, be careful now,<br />Dr. Schultz.
6246367 6248369 You might-a caught yourself
6248536 6250163 - a little dose of nigger love.<br />- Hm!
6250329 6253291 [Calvin] Nigger love's<br />a powerful emotion, boy.
6253457 6255001 - [Stephen] Hm!<br />- It's like a pool of black tar.
6255168 6257420 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
6257587 6262091 Yessir, you stuck. [Laughs]
6263217 6263384 [Lara lee] I don't know, doctor.
6265845 6266012 You can lay on all the<br />German sweet talk you want,
6269640 6269807 but it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6272602 6272769 [Lara Lee giggles]
6275271 6275438 Well, naturally.
6277356 6277523 It is the soaring eagle<br />that attracts her attention,
6278566 6278733 - not the plucked chicken.<br />- [All chuckle]
6280735 6280902 [Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be<br />so down on yourself.
6283112 6284030 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6285323 6285490 [Cora] You got to clean these dishes,
6288576 6290328 you got to put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear me?
6292330 6292497 You know that nigger, don't you?
6293748 6293915 - Who?<br />- "Who?"
6296959 6297126 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talkin' about.
6299962 6302048 At the table?
6303132 6304592 I don't know him.
6307053 6311265 - You don't know him.<br />- No.
6312475 6313726 - "No," what?<br />- No, sir.
6316854 6323319 [Chuckles]
6326739 6328116 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
6333287 6333454 Ok.
6335790 6335957 Yeah. If you say so.
6337917 6338084 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6341546 6342505 But if it was my money,<br />I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
6345758 6347009 What would your price be?
6352807 6352974 Well, if I was inclined<br />to be generous...
6355143 6355309 ...and I don't know why<br />I would be inclined to be generous...
6356269 6356435 ...9,000. Maybe.
6358146 6358312 Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how<br />this whole negotiation came about.
6360481 6360648 You see, it wasn't me<br />who came to you to sell a nigger.
6363067 6363234 Sure wasn't.
6364861 6365027 It was you who approached me to buy one.
6367989 6368156 - Sure was.<br />- Now, that $9,000 figure
6372410 6373035 bright boy's been bandyin' about,<br />that ain't too far off from right.
6377039 6377206 And if I wanted to sell<br />Eskimo Joe for that,
6380042 6384714 - I could do so any day of the week.<br />- Any day.
6388050 6388217 But, like you said in Greenville,<br />doctor... I don't want to sell him.
6392305 6392471 It was only your ridiculous<br />offer of $12,000
6393764 6396225 - that made me even consider it.<br />- Hm-mm.
6398644 6398811 [Deep inhale]
6402148 6402315 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6404442 6404609 [Chuckles]
6408154 6408321 [Slamming table] Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6411490 6411657 - Eskimo Joe, $12,000.<br />- [Banging table] Hooray, doctor.
6413451 6413618 Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6416704 6416871 However, that is<br />a tremendous amount of money.
6419916 6420082 And the way you have<br />your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
6421083 6421250 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6422919 6423085 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6425713 6425880 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6430593 6432762 Hm-mm.
6435056 6435223 Not to mention having<br />Eskimo Joe examined
6436474 6436641 - by a physician of my choosing.<br />- [Calvin] Naturally.
6438684 6438851 So, say I return in about...
6441812 6442647 - ...five days time.<br />- Five days?
6445691 6446442 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6447610 6448611 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy
6450613 6452990 can hash out the finer<br />details between themselves.
6457870 6458037 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6460706 6460873 Gentlemen...
6462250 6462416 ...may I propose a toast.
6463834 6464001 To Eskimo Joe.<br />Or shall we call him the black Hercules?
6467838 6468005 - [All chuckling]<br />- To the black Hercules.
6469423 6469590 [Stephen] The black Hercules.
6472843 6475930 [Speaks low]<br />To the black Hercules.
6480977 6481143 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have pan-ass. [Chuckles]
6484355 6484522 Hm.
6487275 6487441 Hildi, top my drink off.
6490194 6490361 So, Hildi, how you like servin'<br />at the big table in the big house, huh?
6491696 6491862 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6494949 6495116 - I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br />- Hm-mm.
6496701 6496867 It's a lot better than sizzlin'<br />in that hot box or draggin' your ass
6498035 6498202 through a bramble bush.
6499662 6499829 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br />gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6501163 6501330 - huh, sugar bear?<br />- Oh, lord, she like them niggers.
6505001 6505167 - Sure do.<br />- Like samson? Huh?
6508421 6508587 [Hildi] No, sir.
6510715 6510881 You know, Monsieur Candie,
6513926 6514093 the doctor here might be interested<br />in seein' Hildi's peeled back,
6515845 6516012 seein' as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6518389 6518556 Dr. Schultz,<br />when you was alone with Hildi, here,
6520349 6520516 did you just speak German<br />or did you get to take her clothes off?
6522560 6522727 No, we just talked and...
6525813 6525980 [Calvin] Oh, so you<br />haven't seen her back?
6527940 6528107 - I haven't...<br />- No, no, no, no.
6530484 6530651 Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6533571 6533738 Hildi, go on, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
6536741 6536907 - Go on.<br />- [Lara lee] Uh, Calvin.
6539493 6539660 I just got her all dressed up<br />and lookin' nice.
6543247 6543414 [Calvin] But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.
6545583 6545750 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6547668 6547877 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6548961 6549128 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6551380 6552173 Hildi's got somethin'<br />like four lashes on her back.
6555217 6556886 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6559305 6559472 - [Stephen] Sure would.<br />- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.
6562141 6563351 - It's like a paintin'. Look at that.<br />- Calvin!
6565144 6571525 We are eating. Ain't no one wanna<br />look at her whipped up back.
6573069 6573235 - [Exhales]<br />- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
6574904 6576530 After dinner, then, Stephen.<br />After dinner.
6579742 6579909 During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
6582370 6582536 [Lara lee]<br />Cora, come get this girl!
6583871 6590378 [Approaching footsteps]
6594173 6594340 - [Lara lee] She a mess.<br />- Yes, ma'am. [Gasps] Oh!
6596300 6597426 Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up.
6598511 6598677 Come on in here.
6604266 6605434 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6608813 6610981 You say you ain't know him.
6612608 6613609 Huh?
6613776 6616278 I said, you said you ain't know him.
6618656 6619990 - I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6620157 6622660 Mr. Stephen...
6622827 6624995 ...I don't.
6625162 6629083 Why is you lying to me?
6630751 6633838 I ain't.
6634004 6637133 Then why is you crying?
6637299 6640177 You scarin' me.
6640344 6643180 - Why is I'm scaring you?<br />- Because you scary.
6648519 6653023 [Schultz] To speak German<br />this afternoon with Hildi
6653190 6656026 was positively soul-enriching.
6658028 6663993 [Calvin] Doctor,<br />that warms my heart to hear that.
6664160 6665536 You stay right here.
6665703 6667413 [Schultz] You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6668038 6669623 Why,yes.<br />Yessiree Bob, I did.
6670666 6673127 In that case, allow me<br />to propose another proposition.
6674253 6676380 I'm all ears.
6676547 6679258 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6679425 6680551 - Monsieur Candie...<br />- [Calvin] Stephen!
6680718 6684472 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6684638 6686557 [Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6686724 6690060 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6690227 6694064 Excuse him.
6694231 6696859 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6697026 6698903 You mean get up out of my chair?
6699069 6701405 - If'n you could manage it.<br />- Why?
6701572 6705910 - It's about dessert.<br />- What about dessert?
6706076 6707870 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6708037 6711123 We're having white cake!
6711290 6713167 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing back there?
6713334 6718339 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6718506 6719673 [Whispers] Meet me in the library.
6720591 6724261 I just can't understand why you<br />won't come talk to these niggers.
6724428 6726180 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6726347 6729975 Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I will be along momentarily.
6730142 6731435 Yessir.
6732978 6734772 Well, gentlemen, as you can see,
6740945 6742738 talented as they are,<br />no doubt, in the kitchen,
6744198 6747576 from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6747743 6753165 [All chuckle]
6753332 6756001 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6756168 6757670 [Calvin] You may clear<br />the dinner service.
6762466 6764260 [Cora] You heard him. Go on!<br />Get! Hurry up, girl.
6769515 6774603 So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you<br />regale us with a tale of the circus.
6774770 6778315 [Chuckles] The circus?
6778482 6781235 [Fire crackling]
6781402 6784572 What is the matter?
6784738 6788409 Them motherfuckers<br />ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
6788576 6790744 - They wants that girl.<br />- [Chuckling]
6790911 6793539 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talKing about? Hm?
6793706 6797334 They playing your ass for a fool<br />is what I'm talKing about.
6799044 6800629 They ain't here for<br />no musclebound jimmie.
6800796 6803173 They here for that girl.
6803340 6805801 Wh... what girl? Hildi?
6805968 6808220 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,<br />them niggers know each other.
6808387 6811599 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6811765 6814768 - Did he give you any money?<br />- No! Not yet. But...
6820190 6822192 Then he ain't bought diddly.<br />Not yet, nohow.
6823319 6825112 But he's just about to buy
6825279 6827781 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6827948 6832244 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />You're welcome, Calvin.
6832411 6834246 Where you gettin' all this?
6834413 6837207 Why would they go through<br />all that trouble for a nigger
6837374 6840461 with a chewed up back,<br />ain't worth $300?
6843047 6845007 They doin' it 'cause that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hildi.
6845591 6849887 She probably his wife.
6850054 6853557 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch
6853724 6859188 is in love with,<br />I'm sure I don't know.
6861899 6863567 If she's who they want...
6866904 6868530 ...why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos, then?
6872409 6876121 You wouldn't pay no<br />never mind to no $300.
6876288 6877706 But that 12,000? That made you<br />real friendly, now, didn't it?
6879416 6881418 Yes, it did.
6882252 6888258 His wife, huh?
6890469 6891637 If it had been a snake,<br />it would have bit me.
6892262 6897059 [Chuckles]
6898310 6899770 Those lying...
6899937 6902731 ...goddamn time-wastin'<br />sons of bitches.
6902898 6904358 Sons of bitches!
6904525 6906694 ...out of New Orleans, so I have quite<br />a bit of practice with theater types.
6906860 6909947 Oh, there you are.
6910114 6913158 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6913325 6914410 [All chuckling]
6914576 6918455 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6918622 6920874 Lara Lee, I was just<br />looKing out the big window.
6934138 6937850 Billy crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver
6939893 6942813 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6942980 6946984 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?
6947151 6950070 - Of course, brother.<br />- Thank you, darling.
6950237 6952364 - Yeah. Business never sleeps.<br />- Hm-mm.
6968839 6970883 Apropos, before your exit,
6973260 6974303 we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6975846 6977347 Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6978682 6983687 And we will again. In a moment.
6983854 6986273 Who's your little friend?
6987357 6991111 [Clearing throat]
6991987 6994031 This is Ben.
6994198 6996784 He's a old Joe that<br />lived around here for a long time.
6999620 7001288 And I do mean a long damn time.
7003874 7007669 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7007836 7013717 ...and my daddy's daddy.
7015344 7020641 Till he up and keeled over one day...
7021892 7025687 ...old Ben took care of me.
7027731 7030067 Growing up the son of a huge<br />plantation owner in Miss.issippi
7030234 7033403 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lotta black faces.
7037115 7039576 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7042579 7047751 ...surrounded by black faces.
7047918 7052840 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out,
7053006 7058136 I only had one question:
7058303 7061723 - Why don't they kill us?<br />- [Laughs]
7064268 7065769 Now, right out there on that porch,<br />three times a week for 50 years,
7067646 7068939 old Ben here would<br />shave my daddy with a straight razor.
7070315 7075112 Now, if I was old Ben, I woulda<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7075279 7080367 and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7082202 7085914 But he never did.
7086081 7088208 Why not?
7088375 7093881 You see, the science of phrenology
7094965 7096633 is crucial to understanding<br />the separation of our two species.
7109396 7111356 In the skull of the African here,
7112733 7114902 the area associated<br />with subMiss.iveness
7121199 7124786 is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet earth.
7128498 7128665 [Sawing]
7129916 7130083 If you examine...
7135088 7135255 ...this piece of skull here...
7137758 7137924 ...you will notice<br />three distinct dimples.
7141261 7141928 Here, here and here.
7143764 7144389 Now...
7146516 7146683 ...if I was holding the skull<br />of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7148977 7149144 these three dimples would be<br />found in the area of the skull
7153315 7154441 most associated with... creativity.
7155776 7156777 But this is the skull of old Ben.
7158528 7159446 And in the skull of old Ben,
7161615 7164076 unburdened by genius,
7166161 7168288 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7170624 7171625 ...servility.
7176963 7178215 Now, bright boy...
7179674 7180801 ...I will admit you are pretty clever.
7184388 7184554 But if I took this hammer here...
7187516 7187682 ...and I bashed in your skull with it...
7190936 7192020 ...you would have the same<br />three dimples in the same place...
7195148 7195315 ...as old Ben.
7197651 7197818 Hey! Now lay your palms<br />flat on that tabletop!
7200612 7200779 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7203156 7207869 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7210288 7214835 There have been a lot of lies said<br />around this dinner table here tonight,
7216211 7220674 but that you can believe!
7222092 7226096 Mr. Moguy, would you be<br />so kind as to collect the pistol
7227597 7227764 hanging off these boys' hips here?
7230517 7230684 - Thank you ever so much.<br />- Doctor.
7233145 7233311 Where were we?
7234688 7238692 Jackass.
7240026 7242446 Ah, yes.
7243947 7246700 I do believe you were<br />just getting ready to make me
7248243 7249703 a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
7251955 7252122 Am I right?
7253373 7253540 Right.
7255083 7259379 Bring out Hildi!
7261965 7262132 Get over there yonder.
7264885 7265051 - [Screams]<br />- Sit your ass in that goddamn...
7269389 7269556 [Stephen] Lay your hand<br />flat on that tabletop.
7272601 7272767 [Calvin] Now shut your mouth!
7276730 7277522 Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,
7279274 7279441 you yourself said that<br />for the right nigger
7281401 7281568 you'd be willin' to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7285530 7285697 To which me myself said,<br />"what is your definition of ridiculous?"
7288116 7288283 To which you said, "$12,000."
7294247 7294414 - [Yells]<br />- Now, considering y'all
7298168 7298335 have ridden a whole lot of Miles,
7303965 7304132 went through a whole lot of trouble,<br />and done spread a whole lot of bull
7307928 7310180 to purchase this<br />lovely lady right here,
7311723 7312557 it would appear that Broomhilda is,<br />in fact... the right nigger.
7315560 7315727 And if y'all want to leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda,
7319272 7319439 the price is $12,000.
7324569 7325654 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7327948 7328615 Yes, I do, doctor.
7331326 7331493 You see,<br />under the laws of chickasaw county,
7334955 7338875 Broomhilda here is my property.
7342003 7342170 And I can choose to do with<br />my property whatever I so desire!
7344297 7344464 And if y'all think my price...
7348969 7349135 ...for this nigger here<br />is too steep...
7353306 7353473 - [Grunts]<br />- ...What I'm gonna desire to do is...
7354808 7354975 ...take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7358853 7360063 - Right in front of both y'all!<br />- Easy, big fella.
7361398 7369398 Then we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7376371 7380417 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?<br />Huh?
7382294 7382460 - [Hildi whimpering]<br />- What's it gonna be?
7385005 7385171 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7388508 7394347 Yes, you may.
7396641 7396808 That 12.
7400478 7400645 - Sold!<br />- [Screaming]
7402397 7405525 To the man with the exceptional beard
7407694 7408570 and his unexceptional nigger.
7410322 7411531 - Mr. Moguy.<br />- Yes, Calvin?
7413408 7414367 Will you make these gentlemen<br />a receipt for $12,000, please?

7419331 7427331 It was a pleasure doing<br />business with y'all.

7506501 7509003 ...we will be serving white cake.
7511881 7513341 [Beethoven's "fur elise"<br />played on harp]
7517011 7521266 - [Screaming]<br />- [Dogs snarling]
7522350 7522517 [Screaming]
7525145 7525311 Well done, Calvin.
7526479 7526646 Excuse me.<br />Excuse me, ma'am?
7527981 7528148 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?<br />Take your hands off the harp!
7530066 7530233 [Stephen] Doctor!
7531651 7539651 - Doctor, you can't go in there!<br />- Stephen, Stephen.
7558803 7559804 He ain't got no business<br />going in there.
7562056 7563099 Let it be.
7564309 7569063 He's just a little upset, that's all.
7570064 7572025 I'll handle this.
7574736 7575445 White cake?
7580200 7580366 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7582202 7582994 Hm.
7586790 7586956 [Calvin chuckles softly]
7588416 7591503 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7595548 7595715 Actually, I was thinKing of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7597383 7597550 D'Artagnan.
7599093 7599260 And I was wondering what<br />Dumas would make of all this.
7603681 7603848 Come again?
7607560 7607727 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote the three musketeers.
7609687 7611731 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613566 7615777 I figured you must be an admirer.
7620949 7623243 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7625036 7626913 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7629123 7632961 I wonder what<br />he would have made of it.
7635755 7635922 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7637590 7637757 Yes. His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7639133 7641261 Soft-hearted frenchie.
7644222 7644389 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7646558 7646724 - Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br />- Yes, they are.
7648935 7650186 - May I?<br />- Of course.
7653106 7661106 Thank you.
7675628 7679215 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7681509 7683761 and, of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7686139 7694139 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7700028 7701988 - Right over there on that little table.<br />- Thank you.
7705783 7705950 Thank you.
7710413 7710580 Broomhilda Von Shaft...
7712916 7713082 ...consider yourself a free woman.
7717754 7721633 Mr. Candie...
7722926 7723885 ...normally,<br />I would say auf wiedersehen.
7725428 7727138 But since what auf wiedersehen actually<br />means is "till I see you again"
7729223 7731100 and since I never<br />wish to see you again,
7732143 7736856 to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."
7738983 7739484 Let's go.
7744864 7745698 Come on.
7747742 7747909 One more moment, doctor!
7750954 7751120 What?
7753414 7754290 It's a custom here in the South...
7757210 7757377 ...once a business deal is concluded<br />that the two parties shake hands.
7759379 7759545 It implies good faith.
7762840 7763466 - I'm not from the South.<br />- But you are...
7766469 7766636 ...in my house, doctor.
7768429 7770098 - So I'm afraid I must insist.<br />- Insist?
7775311 7775478 On what?<br />That I shake your hand?
7780441 7780608 Oh, then I'm afraid<br />I must insist in the opposite direction.
7783236 7784112 - You know what I think you are?<br />- What you think I am?
7786948 7787907 No, I don't.
7791411 7792370 - I think you are a bad loser.<br />- And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7798042 7798209 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw<br />County, a deal ain't done
7799961 7800962 until the two parties<br />have shook hands.
7802130 7803965 Even after all that paper signin',<br />don't mean shit...
7808678 7808845 ...you don't shake my hand.
7810596 7813516 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7814851 7822851 I don't think so.
7835955 7837623 Mr. pooch?
7839208 7840293 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand,
7842962 7845298 you cut her ass down.
7846507 7854507 [Cocking shotgun]
7862565 7863649 You really want me to shake your hand?
7865234 7865401 I insist.
7867737 7871574 If you insist.
7874077 7876913 [Metal springing noise]
7878664 7886339 No! Calvin!
7888508 7888674 Calvin!
7890468 7890635 [Slow heartbeat rhythm]
7892345 7896432 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

8363357 8369863 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />'bout snipping Django.
8371657 8371824 She gonna give him<br />to the Lequint Dickey people.
8373158 8381158 [Django moaning]
8387631 8389300 Well, she didn't<br />waste a minute telling me.
8392344 8395723 How disappointing.
8399184 8399351 [Hissing]
8402771 8402938 [Chuckles]
8406650 8406817 [Stephen] You leavin'.
8409528 8409695 This here what you take with you.
8414992 8415159 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at the big house
8420706 8422291 could talk about<br />for the last few hours.
8424543 8424710 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life
8428922 8429089 was coming up with all<br />kinds of ways to kill your ass.
8430674 8430883 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
8434053 8434803 Now, that may seem like a good idea,<br />but truth is...
8440643 8440809 ...when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8444813 8445856 most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about, hm... seven minutes.
8448567 8448734 Most of 'em.
8452029 8452196 [Chuckles]<br />Well, more than most.
8455407 8455574 Then I says: "Shitfire.
8457701 8457868 The niggers we sell to Lequint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8463749 8464875 And they still sayin',<br />"let's whip him to death."
8467586 8467753 Or "throw him to the Mandingos."<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8472591 8472758 And I said,<br />"what's so special about that?
8476220 8478597 We do that shit all the time.
8483727 8483894 Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to<br />Lequint Dickey got it worse than that."
8487439 8487606 Lo and behold,
8490734 8490901 out of nowhere, Miss. Lara<br />come up with the bright idea
8493737 8493904 of giving your ass to the<br />Lequint Dickey Mining Company.
8498534 8498701 And as a slave of the<br />Lequint Dickey Mining Company,
8503288 8503455 henceforth, till the day you die,

8508961 8509128 you will be swinging<br />a sledgehammer,
8511547 8511714 turning big rocks into little rocks.
8514049 8514216 Now, when you get there,<br />they gonna take away your name,
8517886 8518053 give you a number<br />and a sledgehammer,
8519638 8519805 and say, "get to work!"
8524810 8524977 One word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8527563 8527730 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.

8579490 8584244 throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8585704 8587247 And that will be the story of you,<br />Django.
8589416 8589583 [Slow-tempo song plays]
8592669 8592836 [Man, Australian accent] And what's<br />the golden rule, Frankie, eh?
8595130 8595297 You don't root abos.
8596465 8596632 Hey, white boy.
8602429 8602596 I said, hey, white boy.
8604556 8604723 Shut up, black. You ain't got<br />nothing to say I want to hear.
8609394 8609561 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8612397 8613357 Do what, now?
8615067 8615234 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?<br />11,500, actually.
8619446 8619613 What the fuck are you talKing about?
8621031 8621198 Back there at that plantation,<br />Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,
8622866 8623826 just sittin' there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8625828 8625994 You be damned, Blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8629206 8629373 I ain't saying that. Nice thing<br />about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
8631500 8631667 You can't steal it.
8634002 8634169 You got to earn it, white boy.
8635629 8635796 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8639091 8639258 The $11,500 fortune waitin'<br />for you back at Candyland
8640843 8641009 is in the form of a<br />"wanted dead or alive" bounty
8644263 8644429 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall gang.
8647766 8647933 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8651186 8651353 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br />murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,
8654064 8654231 the Bacall gang.
8655649 8655816 There's a $7,000<br />"wanted dead or alive" bounty on him,
8657943 8658110 $1,500 for each<br />of his three accomplices:
8661780 8661947 Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,
8663490 8663657 and crazy Craig Koons.
8666952 8667119 Now, all four of them gentlemen,
8668203 8668370 they back there at Candyland<br />laughing their ass off.
8671874 8672040 You know why?<br />'Cause they just got away with murder.
8675294 8676378 But it ain't got to be that way.
8679381 8679548 You and your mates, y'all can ride back<br />there and y'all can go get that money.
8680716 8682467 What'd these jokers do again?
8687723 8687890 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8689224 8689391 Stagecoach robbery.<br />Innocent white people.
8691894 8692060 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8693312 8693645 Get it out.
8695105 8695272 [Man 1] "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty<br />Bacall and the Smitty Bacall gang."
8698066 8699484 - [Man 2] But you're a slave.<br />- [Man 1] "For murder..."
8702070 8702237 - [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.<br />- [Man 1] "...And stagecoach robbery."
8706783 8706950 Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
8708493 8708660 - [Man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."<br />- Hm?
8713415 8713582 - [Man 2] That's a shitload.<br />- I'm a bounty hunter.
8716501 8716668 Yesterday, as a free man,
8720172 8720339 I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German white partner,
8723675 8723842 Dr. King Schultz.
8728013 8730015 We tracked the Bacall gang all the way<br />from Texas to chickasaw county.
8731934 8732100 We finally found their ass<br />layin' low in Candyland.
8734895 8735062 We went in there to get 'em,<br />things went sour,
8738398 8738565 my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot,
8741860 8742027 then everybody there<br />decided to blame me, so here I am.
8744279 8744446 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8746198 8746365 And all y'all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8749826 8749993 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted,
8752871 8753038 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing they'd expect
8756541 8756708 is y'all ridin' back in there<br />and gettin' it.
8761213 8761380 [Man 1] What's the deal?
8763256 8763423 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?
8764466 8764633 No,no,no,no.<br />I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
8766718 8766885 But, you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses,
8772808 8777479 and $500 of that 11,500,<br />and I'll point 'em out to you.
8780273 8786613 This is a real handbill.
8790575 8791785 Now just 'cause it's a real handbill
8794413 8795122 doesn't mean that other<br />bunch of malarkey is.
8796957 8797124 Now why would a slave have a "wanted<br />dead or alive" handbill in his pocket?
8800919 8801086 Did that black ride<br />into Candyland yesterday?
8804756 8804923 All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
8807467 8808135 I want you to remember,<br />I don't like liars.
8812305 8812472 Is he a Candyland slave,
8813974 8814141 or did he ride in with a white man<br />on a horse yesterday?
8817978 8821940 Yeah. They walked us<br />from the Greenville auction,
8825485 8825652 and he rode in on a horse<br />with a white man.
