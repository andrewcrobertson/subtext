49383 53154 Simon Magus,<br />was a magician and a sorcerer...
53187 56056 ...in... Um...
56090 57991 In Sumeria.
59059 62496 And what happened<br />to Simon Magus, Bartolo?
62530 65466 Jesus' disciples<br />performed miracles.
65499 67968 When Simon Magus<br />saw the miracles,
68001 71639 he offered Peter<br />gold for God's powers.
71672 73407 And how did<br />Peter respond...
74842 76144 ...John Rossi?
78546 79813 Stand up!
85886 87488 Answer my question,<br />John Rossi.
89457 90891 That's not my name.
92593 94828 You and all<br />the other bastards
94862 96464 lucky enough to be here,
96497 98332 children of sin,
98366 100134 spawn of the damned,
100168 102703 are all named for saints.
103704 105806 Saints who are disciplined,
106507 108276 saints who are chaste.
109777 112746 You are named<br />for John Baptist Rossi,
112780 115849 a Capuchin priest who gave away all his possessions.
118619 121054 A man who had nothing,<br />like you.
122356 123391 Now what is your name,
124425 126494 you ungrateful cur?
139273 141275 Your name, boy!
143977 145413 Have you lost<br />your tongue?
146113 147948 What is your name?
155823 161329 All the girls will remain locked in their dormitory
161362 164732 and no food will be served to any boy
164765 169270 until you acknowledge<br />your namesake before God.
192993 195663 Food! Food! Food!<br />Food! Food! Food! Food!
237505 238739 Yes. Yes.
243210 246680 They should name you Simon Magus,<br />the magician.
247415 251084 No. Simon... Templar.
262896 263997 Agnes!
265866 267134 Agnes!
273641 274908 Agnes!
285018 286720 What are you doing?<br />- Agnes!
294595 296664 When they catch you,<br />they'll cane you.
296697 299032 Won't happen,<br />'cause we're leaving tonight,
299066 301735 this hearty brotherhood,<br />on a crusade.
301769 304605 That's why I risked everything, Agnes,<br />my love,
304638 305939 to bid you farewell.
305973 308442 I can't leave you behind<br />without a kiss, can I?
309076 311211 Hey, watch this.
327895 329763 We've lost<br />some girls!
329797 331164 The girls are missing!
331865 333834 There are girls missing!
333867 335068 Come on, boys!<br />Hurry up!
336269 337538 Come on.<br />Come on. Hurry.
344011 346279 Wait, John Rossi.<br />My kiss.
353086 354522 There he is!<br />Go on! Get him!
374141 375342 October 3rd.
375375 378211 Entering foyer<br />of Tretiak industries.
378245 382483 Heavy security on elevators.<br />Guards in uniform.
382516 386219 Elevator to vault on 26th floor requires separate pass key.
387354 388489 Maybe use stairs.
389423 390691 No traffic there.
392560 393661 October 4th.
394394 396329 Personal tidbits.
396363 400100 Tretiak's former partner<br />died suddenly in 1995.
400133 403036 It left Tretiak as sole owner of gas and oil empire.
405338 408341 Tretiak's first son killed in car crash five years ago.
410511 411779 Who are you?
411812 415516 Vehicle was driven by younger son Ilya,<br />now 27.
415549 419520 Wife now lives in Geneva following assassination attempt in 1996.
419553 422322 I am... Ivanovanovitch.
422823 424157 October 5th.
424191 427661 Ilya spent most of today in Café Eldorado with bandido buddies.
427695 431031 Gangster rap, coffee,<br />flirting with teenage girls.
431064 434001 Small firearms in coats,<br />machine pistols in cars.
513847 518852 There were three great empires that dominated the world
518886 521789 both culturally<br />and militarily,
521822 526459 Rome, Constantinople,<br />and Russia.
527227 529062 All three have fallen.
529730 532800 Only one can be restored
532833 536369 and only one man<br />can restore it:
536403 539339 Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!
563363 566099 Friends... countrymen,
566900 568035 Russians!
575575 578912 You people<br />here in this room
580147 582149 are the cream of Russia,
583283 588055 and the whole nation<br />is listening with us.
588088 591692 But why do you all<br />listen to me rave?
591725 593694 Set aside my oil company,
593727 596396 forget about<br />my best-selling book,
596429 601168 and all I am<br />is a lunatic
601201 605072 haunted by the fantasy<br />of an empire
605105 607808 that reclaims<br />her former might,
607841 609609 her former size.
613681 617117 All I am is a poet
617150 619720 spinning rhymes<br />of a Russia
619753 624792 not cut off at the knees,<br />but armed to the teeth.
627627 631431 Not ridiculed,<br />but revered.
633366 636436 No! More than revered!
636469 637771 Feared!
647347 651451 But who am I to dazzle you with this dream?
651484 652786 All I've done is...
652820 654788 How does it look<br />for the leader's son
655823 658458 to walk out<br />when the leader speaks?
658491 660060 You'd prefer<br />the leader's son
660093 663263 to piss his pants<br />on live TV? Hmm?
665098 668668 And still the people freeze to death!
687254 688555 I love this country.
787888 788889 (WHIRRING AND CLICKING
823223 824624 I don't speak Russian.
825392 826994 In that case, stand up,
828095 830330 put your hands<br />behind your head,
830363 832765 and turn around slowly.
837637 840740 Wrong place for a condom.<br />Take it off.
847514 850951 Listen, if I<br />give this to you,
850984 852519 you're gonna give it<br />to your daddy.
853353 855288 And what's he<br />gonna give you?
855322 857057 Not even a Christmas bonus.
857090 859993 The guy I'm stealing this for will give me $1 million.
860027 862295 If we go in partners,<br />we'll split 50/50.
862329 864464 That's half a million<br />hard currency.
864497 867200 Think of the drugs you can buy with that much cake.
867234 869569 You'll be discoing for a decade in Moscow, mate.
870637 872172 I don't need<br />your small change.
873106 874507 That's your<br />first problem.
875642 876977 Here is your second.
878111 880914 Microchip... please.
882749 884151 Freeze!
884184 886253 Sorry. Guns make me nervous.
887387 889756 Suck me... sideways.
925525 927794 Uh! My eyes! Oh!
946379 948948 Give it up!
955455 957124 You got<br />no place to go!
971871 973206 A god damn button!
982782 984551 Back of the building!<br />Come on!
997830 999566 Where is the body?<br />No body.
999599 1001000 Just some guy<br />in rags.
1066799 1068635 As the bitter chill<br />of winter
1068668 1070437 descends on Moscow,
1070470 1072872 Russians are warming<br />to the angry rhetoric
1072905 1075908 of former communist boss<br />Ivan Tretiak.
1075942 1077977 Now a billionaire<br />oil magnate
1078010 1080313 and leader of his own political party,
1080347 1083716 Tretiak predicted that the civil unrest engulfing Russia
1083750 1087454 will only worsen unless reformist President Karpov
1087487 1089656 can overcome<br />the heating oil shortage
1089689 1092959 that has already killed<br />scores of Russians.
1092992 1094727 In his speech today,
1094761 1097597 Tretiak called on elements<br />of the Russian army
1097630 1099999 who are opposed<br />to the elected government
1100032 1103736 to seize control and end<br />the heating oil crisis.
1103770 1105205 What beautiful work.
1113713 1115715 Ah. Cloisonné.
1116916 1118951 It is old.<br />Yes.
1118985 1120253 It belonged<br />to my grandmother.
1124324 1125392 Please.
1130897 1134033 Tonight I feel like the oldest person on this plane.
1135768 1139105 My husband,<br />he's sending me to England to live
1139706 1141241 until things change.
1141274 1145212 You are married<br />not even a year,
1145245 1147547 and already this bastard<br />has a girlfriend?
1148715 1151251 I am sorry.<br />It's not my business.
1154787 1157390 How come you know<br />so much about me?
1158225 1159626 It is a gift.
1162229 1165031 I'm Martin de Porres.
1165064 1168034 I am from Spain,<br />but I'm named for a Peruvian saint
1168067 1172339 who could cure the sick or the injured by the laying of hands.
1185252 1186553 Hmm.
1186586 1190056 He's the same build as the description the Russians gave us,
1190089 1191991 but he doesn't<br />sound like an Aussie.
1192024 1193159 No.
1196162 1197364 Could be faking it.
1205738 1208341 X-rays are clear.<br />He hasn't swallowed the microchip.
1208375 1209609 Anything?
1209642 1212111 You English with your chips,<br />your fish and chips.
1212144 1213746 On the airplane,<br />I have the chicken.
1213780 1215415 Van Gogh theft,<br />Netherlands.
1216148 1218351 Last year. Same eyes.
1218385 1219586 Different chin.
1263530 1265197 Halcyon Hotel, guv.
1274307 1275842 Stand up!
1275875 1277344 What is your name?
1278244 1279679 Answer the question!
1281948 1283850 What is your name? Hey!
1290089 1292124 Hey, Lou,<br />the microchip arrived.
1292158 1294026 I put the dough<br />in your Swiss account.
1294060 1295662 Sorry I didn't get back to you about that diamond thing,
1295695 1297564 but Moscow's like<br />Dodge City right now.
1297597 1299799 All them greedy commies have turned into crazy capitalists.
1299832 1302769 It's disgusting.<br />It's made them sloppy.
1302802 1304371 One or two more easy scores like this last one,
1304404 1305805 I top 50 mil,<br />I'm out of the game.
1305838 1307106 Yeah,<br />I heard that before.
1307139 1309676 Not from me.<br />I don't know nuttin'.
1309709 1311110 You don't believe me?<br />Try and find me.
1311143 1312479 Fuck you, Lou.<br />See youse.
1318451 1320186 Just can't seem<br />to break 50.
1371804 1373940 $1 million U.S. dollars,
1373973 1375207 nonrefundable,
1375241 1377710 reserves you a quiet table
1377744 1379879 at a romantic little spot<br />in Berlin
1380480 1382014 called Tempelhof,
1383082 1385852 which has<br />a cozy transit lounge.
1385885 1388621 To get inside,<br />you walk through the metal detectors,
1388655 1390790 and I walk through<br />the metal detectors.
1390823 1392692 And since you know<br />I'm not armed,
1392725 1394861 and I know<br />you're not armed,
1394894 1397597 we can both fall in love<br />and nobody gets hurt.
1411343 1412879 I can't see him.
1413480 1415482 Then look for him.
1415515 1418618 You have a long<br />and beautiful cane...
1418651 1420853 ...along with<br />your beautiful eyes.
1423723 1425792 That photograph<br />doesn't do you justice.
1426493 1427527 Who are you?
1427560 1429562 My name is<br />Bruno Hautenfaust.
1429596 1432899 I was named for a saint who was a very wealthy man.
1432932 1435034 Had the wine, the women,<br />the songs, the whole bit,
1435067 1438838 and then inexplicably took a vow of poverty and became a hermit,
1438871 1441508 went off to live in the forest in the nude.
1442041 1443476 Please leave.
1445144 1447146 I represent the professional you hired.
1448047 1449381 I'm his<br />business manager.
1449982 1451150 I speak for him.
1451984 1454153 We don't deal<br />with underlings.
1454186 1455588 Come on, Father.<br />Let's go.
1457389 1460459 Wait. Sit down.<br />Listen and learn.
1460493 1461828 Ah. Youth.
1466599 1468134 Who runs this thief?
1468768 1471771 CIA, MI-6, Libya?
1471804 1473673 He's not a race car.<br />Nobody runs him.
1473706 1475675 He's an independent<br />contractor.
1475708 1478444 Good. Then no one<br />will mind if I kill him.
1479846 1485217 Oh, yes.<br />I can have a man killed and stroll away like that,
1485251 1489321 even with metal detectors,<br />even in this transit lounge.
1490957 1494060 Oh, it's so early.
1494093 1496028 You guys wanna get some<br />coffee or something?
1497930 1498965 Sure.
1503169 1504771 Be quiet.
1504804 1507840 What is it<br />you request of my employer?
1507874 1510176 Do you know<br />what cold fusion is?
1510209 1512044 Of course.
1512078 1516583 It's the theory of nuclear fusion at room temperature.
1516616 1518050 Free energy forever.
1518084 1519351 Yes.
1519385 1521153 Kaffee?<br />Klein, bitte.
1523089 1526926 As far as science goes,<br />it ranks just above astrology.
1526959 1528961 Those who claim to have achieved the experiment
1528995 1530697 have never been able<br />to duplicate it.
1531263 1532565 Until now.
1534400 1538571 There is an electro-chemist working at Oxford.
1538605 1540807 We believe<br />that this good lady
1540840 1543943 made a breakthrough<br />in cold fusion.
1543976 1547479 Your employer will obtain<br />the formula for me.
1547980 1549582 He's very busy.
1549616 1550750 And you are<br />very boring.
1551784 1554153 Your offer<br />must inspire him.
1554186 1559525 This woman has repeatedly avoided my<br />agents' attempts to find the formula.
1560192 1562228 She's cagey, difficult.
1563930 1565932 Maybe your agents<br />are stupid.
1570169 1574506 I think this information<br />would cost you $3 million.
1574540 1576909 Ridiculous.
1576943 1581180 Why? You will have<br />the world market in energy.
1581213 1583850 Cost you a nickel<br />for every million you make.
1583883 1585618 His deposit should go... Hey...
1586185 1587353 It is not for me.
1588420 1590389 It is for Mother Russia.
1590422 1593826 But you want Mother Russia, too,<br />Mr. Tretiak.
1593860 1597529 Three million on deposit in a bank account in Zurich.<br />Agreed?
1599966 1601968 Yes.
1602001 1606405 And, uh, how long to get<br />your employer's agreement?
1606973 1608007 I'll ask.
1623756 1626158 Your offer has inspired her.<br />I'll do it.
1628294 1630062 Bank account number<br />in Zurich.
1631263 1633065 Auf wiedersehen.<br />Bye, sonny.
1634000 1635101 Bye-bye.
1636502 1639672 I really love this guy.
1643976 1645644 Too bad<br />we have to kill him.
1646145 1647446 Yeah, too bad.
1662795 1665664 When the electrochemists<br />Pons and Fleischman
1665698 1668134 announced in 1989
1668167 1671303 that they had discovered<br />cold fusion,
1671337 1674606 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy,
1675674 1679211 they were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses
1679245 1681680 and then condemned<br />as charlatans.
1683315 1688354 The protocols of cold fusion...<br />What are those? Drugs?
1688387 1690823 Could I have one?<br />My head's pounding.
1690857 1692825 She's boring<br />the life out of me.
1694927 1696662 They're for my heart.<br />Oh.
1698264 1701333 You have very pretty eyes.<br />You're a pretty lady.
1702234 1704136 Who are you?<br />Me?
1704170 1706906 I'm here to do an interview with that Dr.<br />Russell.
1706939 1709441 I'm gonna expose her<br />as a fraud.
1709475 1712144 You don't put any stock in this cold fusion mumbo jumbo,<br />do you?
1712879 1714613 Actually, I do.<br />Really?
1714646 1716783 Dr. Emma Russell.
1724757 1725825 Oops.
1730629 1731697 Well...
1732498 1735567 I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1736402 1738104 Um, I'm actually<br />more interested
1738137 1741908 in what questions you all have about cold fusion,
1741941 1743642 so I thought we would<br />start with those.
1744510 1745677 Any questions?
1749048 1750983 Please? Yeah.<br />Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.
1752284 1755454 Can you explain the actual process of fusion?
1755487 1756823 You know, the theory.
1757824 1759391 Yes. Oh, there it is.
1760793 1762829 This is the...<br />The apparatus.
1763963 1765097 And very simply,
1765865 1768600 when positively charged<br />deuterons
1768634 1770702 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode,
1771570 1773039 they cram together,
1773072 1776342 and there are millions and millions of them inside the cathode,
1776375 1780146 getting closer and closer,<br />and then they fuse,
1780179 1782581 and they create energy<br />in the form of helium.
1782614 1786085 But I read somewhere that the experiment couldn't be replicated,
1786118 1788654 so how do we know<br />it works?
1789588 1790722 Well, we don't.
1791790 1792859 Not yet.
1794060 1795962 But if you<br />remember Einstein,
1795995 1799231 he knew the theory<br />of relativity to be true
1799265 1800766 long before<br />he could prove it.
1800799 1803502 I mean,<br />he felt the truth.
1803535 1807940 And, uh,<br />some of us feel the same way about cold fusion
1807974 1810376 because it's there.<br />It's in nature.
1810409 1815114 The raw,<br />natural power just waiting to be harnessed.
1815147 1819551 And when we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire,
1819585 1821720 I mean, just imagine.
1823022 1827059 There's more energy in one cubic mile of sea water
1827093 1830362 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on earth.
1830396 1834233 I mean,<br />you could drive your car 55 million miles
1834266 1836802 on a gallon<br />of heavy water.
1836835 1838837 It would be<br />the end of pollution.
1839571 1842074 Warmth for<br />the whole world.
1843642 1846378 So why don't I, uh,<br />demonstrate for you
1847813 1851283 why other people in the past have been so unsuccessful.
1853119 1854486 They used very complex...
1856455 1858657 November 17th,<br />11:30 a.m.
1858690 1861460 entering flat of<br />Dr. Emma Russell.
1861493 1863662 High Street, Oxford.
1863695 1866865 No alarms on outer doors.<br />Strange.
1866899 1868500 No messages.
1873940 1875174 Shelley monument.
1878110 1879311 Entering bathroom.
1880146 1881213 Books.
1884216 1885384 More books.
1889421 1891657 Walls covered with<br />reminder notes.
1894226 1895294 Poetry.
1908774 1911110 Ah! Dad.
1943909 1946378 "Stop and talk to Shelley<br />every day.
1946412 1948647 "How can I love<br />a man named Percy?
1952718 1956488 "Isn't there someone in the world who can consume me like that?
1957656 1959958 "Magic. Romantic."
1968267 1969868 No recent applications.
1969901 1971070 Cold fusion notes.
1983049 1984983 "Although I pass the Shelley monument every day,
1985017 1987053 "its sadness strikes me<br />every time.
1988620 1991923 "For some reason,<br />I feel a very personal loss when I look at it.
1991957 1993925 "So much pain<br />and so much passion."
1999498 2003535 "To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.
2005604 2007673 Luke 1; verse 79."
2009075 2011043 Tretiak's wrong.<br />She's not cagey.
2012178 2014546 She's not difficult.<br />She's just...
2015481 2016615 Eccentric.
2017449 2018584 She's innocent.
2025924 2027226 Maybe it's in her head.
2029295 2032431 She needs a poet.<br />An artist.
2034032 2038637 Someone who<br />understands truth.
2046445 2048013 She needs Thomas More.
2095327 2096528 Do you like it?
2099531 2102534 What? The sculpture.<br />Do you like it?
2104703 2107139 Oh... yes.
2108374 2109908 What do you love<br />about it?
2119951 2123922 The way it... glows.
2125991 2128126 And how the light...
2129228 2131197 ...holds him in silence,
2132898 2134366 taking care of him.
2136602 2138404 Yeah, that's what<br />I like about it.
2143008 2144543 Are you an artist?
2144576 2149448 No, just a traveler,<br />searching for purity.
2150949 2152618 What do you search for?
2152651 2153752 Energy.
2153785 2155187 Yes.
2158290 2160259 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2161393 2163128 No, not really.
2165931 2169668 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home in Africa.
2171169 2175073 You should experience the energy of where all life began.
2181247 2184082 Sorry. I'm not<br />very good with people.
2188887 2190289 Me, neither.
2219084 2221687 "I see my angel<br />for the first time.
2221720 2224656 "Know my purpose,<br />feel my birth.
2226224 2229561 "Hear at first faintly,<br />then distinctly...
2229595 2231997 "The sweet strains<br />of our union...
2233265 2237102 "...Our love heats up<br />the cold universe,
2237135 2239805 "and gives my tired<br />desperate heart..."
2239838 2245577 "...Purified by our kisses,<br />are eternally healed."
2247646 2249247 Do you like it?
2249281 2250682 Who did you<br />write it for?
2251683 2252784 You.
2253685 2257122 You're following me<br />or it's destiny.
2257155 2258457 Either way, it's weird.
2259991 2261226 Very weird.
2263862 2265063 Destiny then.
2276408 2277743 This must<br />look strange.
2279778 2281212 It's, uh...
2281246 2283382 Something that I'm<br />working on...
2284650 2288119 ...a formula for...<br />Creating energy.
2289988 2291857 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2293759 2296862 Yeah, I do.
2310308 2311643 How did you do that?
2313845 2315013 Magic.
2315881 2316982 Give it back.
2318049 2319918 It looks like Sanskrit.
2319951 2320986 Give it back.
2323789 2326425 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2329260 2330862 What else do you<br />keep in there?
2332063 2333499 Nothing.
2333532 2334766 That's not true.
2336602 2338637 Can I get you<br />anything else?
2341407 2345744 Drink your wine.<br />Uh, Latour '57.
2347713 2351216 The Latour, sir,<br />is 400 pounds a bottle.
2355521 2357523 Then we'll have<br />two bottles.
2361359 2362661 There. You count it.
2368266 2372738 All these little tubes<br />and microbes and things.
2372771 2373905 Molecules?
2373939 2376007 Those, too.<br />Even better.
2376041 2377809 Can I tell you<br />something?
2378777 2381379 What? You must.<br />Everything.
2381413 2382748 It's a secret.
2383449 2384783 What is it?
2386718 2387886 I'm done.
2390856 2394726 My energy research...<br />I'm finished.
2394760 2397563 I mean,<br />I still have some sequencing that I have to work out
2397596 2400799 to make sure that<br />it's safe, but I did it.
2402067 2404402 It's just been you against the whole world,<br />hasn't it?
2405737 2408440 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2408474 2410075 The gift of faith.
2411977 2413845 To see...
2415714 2417048 Well...
2417082 2420519 To believe in something<br />that's all around us...
2421753 2424222 But hidden<br />from our sight.
2425591 2427759 That's a beautiful thought.
2427793 2430095 I can't believe I'm telling you all this.
2431262 2432664 I don't even know<br />your name.
2434099 2435300 Well, my name is...
2437235 2438970 I don't want to<br />tell you my name.
2439004 2440472 I don't want to do that.
2442641 2445310 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference does it make?
2448079 2451216 What's your name?<br />Emma.
2451249 2455053 Emma. Now I know<br />everything about you.
2456855 2459124 Your... genius.
2461860 2463428 You have a weak heart.
2466932 2470836 You have beautiful dreams,<br />great courage.
2472070 2473872 You're not afraid<br />in this world.
2474706 2475874 You get that<br />from your father.
2479144 2481112 You can't cook<br />to save your life.
2482781 2484082 And you love fish.
2486518 2487819 I do love fish.
2489120 2490488 That's weird.
2491657 2492858 I want to try that.
2493559 2494926 No.<br />Yes.
2494960 2496962 No, I don't want you to.<br />Drink your wine.
2499464 2500632 Yes, I do.
2501933 2503201 What's your name?
2504770 2506572 My name is Thomas More.
2507472 2510876 I was named<br />after a saint
2512410 2515914 who died for his faith.
2517683 2518850 Okay.
2521452 2525523 Your work<br />is very dangerous...
2526391 2527693 ...and alive.
2529194 2530829 And I love your poems.
2531663 2533198 They move me.
2534766 2536702 But that's not<br />who you really are.
2538604 2542040 You're running away<br />from your past...
2542841 2544643 Your pain.
2544676 2548279 And yet you keep it<br />so close to you.
2551216 2554519 So you don't have to be afraid of who you are...
2556922 2558657 Because you're beautiful.
2617816 2619017 What are you doing?
2637135 2638837 Oh, my God, you're...
2638870 2641773 You're bleeding.<br />What happened?
2641807 2643074 Don't know. I was...
2643942 2647212 Weeping and I slipped.
2647245 2649848 I was thinking of you.<br />I don't know.
2649881 2652083 Well, I...<br />I live right down the street.
2652117 2653651 I could clean you up.
2655386 2657188 Why do you cover your mouth when you laugh?
2657222 2658289 I don't know.<br />Wait.
2663194 2664662 I'm glad that<br />it stopped bleeding.
2666664 2668033 You don't<br />need stitches.
2674873 2676641 We're going to have<br />to disinfect it, though.
2677743 2679210 You really are an angel.
2680746 2681847 You are.
2684816 2686084 This is going to hurt.
2687052 2688253 Ahhh!
2688286 2689921 Oh, sorry.
2692590 2693658 I'm sorry.
2694726 2696027 Are you all right?<br />Yeah.
2697628 2699364 I'm sorry.<br />I was just joking.
2701332 2704335 I... I should go.
2704369 2707005 Oh, no.<br />Yes. You... You... I...
2708306 2709474 Take off your pants.
2710541 2711743 Pardon?
2711777 2713144 I mean, your sweater.
2716915 2719017 There's blood on it.<br />I'll wash it.
2724856 2726157 Very domestic.
2727725 2731362 There's blood<br />on your blouse as well.
2733899 2735166 I'll wash it.
2750448 2751582 Do you have any wine?
2764329 2768099 Um, I'm so overwhelmed<br />that you even noticed me.
2769500 2770668 How could I not?
2773104 2775440 You make me feel<br />so good.
2775473 2776842 I wish you...
2778243 2779811 I wish you<br />could understand.
2781880 2783048 I want you to know<br />who I am.
2801799 2803068 Oh, my heart.
2804435 2806804 Don't disappear.<br />I'll be right back.
2806838 2809140 * Calm me down
2810175 2812077 * Break it round
2812110 2816114 * Too way high off<br />your street
2818049 2820451 * I can see
2821052 2823221 * Like nothing else
2823254 2827158 * In me you're better<br />than I wanna be
2829660 2833098 * Don't think<br />'cause I understand
2834265 2835934 * I care
2835967 2838536 * Don't think,<br />'cause I'm talking
2838569 2840305 Oh, I can't do this.
2841306 2842673 She's so great.
2842707 2843875 I can't believe<br />this is happening.
2843909 2846377 I can't believe<br />this is happening.
2873538 2874605 Hi.
2878343 2880045 * Overground
2881512 2883481 * Watch this space
2883514 2885516 * I'm open
2886451 2889687 * To falling from grace
2891756 2893491 "To, Spider:
2893524 2896261 "Must fly.<br />Have better offer."
2897162 2899998 Greedy westerner.<br />Wants more money.
2900031 2903001 Who cares? Can't spend<br />hard currency in hell.
2906371 2908006 Send this message:
2908039 2911176 "Fly, don't buzz off.
2912710 2914445 "I'll double your fee.
2916481 2920385 "Or send my own boys to take care of the woman."
2928659 2929760 You okay?
2932297 2936367 Let's... Let's just...<br />Lie here.
2939470 2941606 Can't we just<br />be like this tonight?
2944242 2945443 Is that what you want?
2946877 2948279 It's so magic.
2948846 2950048 Hmm.
2954485 2956054 It just feels so perfect.
2987552 2989887 It's 7:00 a.m. And here are<br />the news headlines...
2999164 3000431 Thomas?
3077442 3079076 Lev Naumovitch,<br />it's here!
3079110 3081579 Good man!<br />It's revolutionary, sir!
3081612 3084682 She's boldly cast aside<br />a slew of stale ideas.
3084715 3087252 But I think the formula<br />is incomplete.
3087285 3089887 It will take months...<br />But that won't do!
3089920 3092690 Because now that the people are nicely beginning to freeze,
3092723 3094692 Tretiak must sweep in<br />from the wings
3094725 3096594 with a miracle<br />to save them.
3096627 3098696 How high do you want it,<br />Mr. Tretiak?
3098729 3100398 To the top.
3100431 3102867 Good morning, Yuri.<br />Good morning.
3102900 3107538 Perhaps they can confirm the validity of this formula more quickly
3107572 3111542 if I dispense with certain protocols.<br />But, Mr. Tretiak...
3111576 3113077 How long, Dr. Botvin,
3113110 3117582 since you received your last salary check from Moscow university?
3118649 3120485 Ukrainian Independence Day.
3122287 3123488 Last august.
3126123 3128092 Ivan... He's online.
3130628 3131696 Do it.
3135666 3137001 To spider...
3138269 3139637 You've got the recipe.
3140271 3141372 "Where's my dough?"
3141806 3143341 To human fly:
3144875 3147278 Recipe incomplete.
3148213 3150047 The cake won't rise.
3150715 3153251 Hence, no dough.
3160458 3162227 I am not the baker.
3162260 3164195 But don't make me<br />the butcher.
3166797 3168433 I like this guy.
3173037 3176006 No play, no pay.
3176040 3179310 I'm certain you kept<br />the cookbook.
3188419 3189454 Holland Park.
3205035 3206771 I'll check that for you.
3206804 3208606 Yes, that seems to be fine.<br />One moment.
3208639 3209807 Ah!
3219083 3220551 He's keeping me online.
3230961 3232162 You wait here.
3275873 3278075 You, beside the car.
3279344 3283213 Now, turn around.<br />Step away from the vehicle.
3283247 3284281 He's armed.
3307838 3309206 Come on, drive!
3318783 3321085 Go the other way.<br />Go, go, go!
3334031 3335132 What about him?
3340070 3341205 Hmm...
3343708 3345109 What about<br />this one?
3349680 3351048 Yeah.
3351081 3352282 That...
3352316 3354785 You see,<br />we believe they're all the same villain.
3360224 3361526 Oh, my God.
3364061 3365262 They're all him?
3366196 3368132 We believe so.
3368165 3370735 He eluded a hit squad this morning in Holland Park.
3373037 3375540 Then he fled the U.K.<br />out of Heathrow.
3375573 3378843 We've got a handful of false identities used on visas,
3378876 3380645 passports, leases.
3382279 3386383 Nicholas Owen,<br />Louis Guanella, Peter Damian,
3388285 3389654 Charles Borroneo.
3391321 3392457 Of course.
3393491 3394759 Thomas More.
3396093 3398128 All the names<br />of catholic saints.
3401832 3404301 Can you access Heathrow's<br />passenger lists
3404334 3406537 for the last,<br />uh, eight hours?
3408005 3409306 I think it might<br />be possible.
3409707 3410841 Good.
3419550 3420585 Go!
3421051 3422520 Come on, now!
3428058 3429393 Yeah!
3436701 3438302 Oh, yeah.
3451616 3452717 Yes!
3460257 3461892 Oh!
3465029 3466096 See, my friends,
3466931 3468733 you back<br />the biggest rats.
3490921 3492557 Hello.
3496293 3498062 Out, out.
3498095 3500230 Freeloaders, out.
3500264 3502099 I want<br />to drink alone.
3502132 3503801 Close the curtain.
3526724 3528125 What?
3530494 3531962 Don't look down.
3533097 3534665 You know who I am?
3535465 3536533 No.
3537434 3539403 I'm the thief,<br />you tried to cheat.
3541071 3543107 And this, your accountant.
3546010 3547411 Talk to him.
3550447 3552717 The phone goes the other way,<br />you moron.
3556286 3557855 Hello.
3557888 3559289 Tretiak speaking.
3560490 3563193 That money<br />to Zurich.
3563227 3565129 Send it now.
3565162 3566563 I said now.
3568198 3569266 Yeah.
3572069 3574304 Thank you.
3574338 3576774 You know what the hardest part about being you is?
3578175 3580544 Pretending to be<br />so bad in bed.
3583113 3585883 You son of the bitch.
3585916 3588418 There is an impostor in there.<br />Get him out.
3588452 3590921 Hey, hey, hey!
3590955 3594391 Take your hands<br />off me, you idiots.
3595525 3597227 Are you crazy?<br />It's me.
3597261 3600064 Go, go!<br />Catch him, go!
3600097 3602032 Ilya,<br />get the bastard!
3624855 3626657 Fifty million.<br />I'm out.
3630027 3631295 Mr. Ferrer<br />checking out.
3631328 3633230 Okay.
3643908 3645575 I'll have one, too.
3647712 3649013 Emma.<br />Hi.
3651381 3652717 I'm...
3652750 3653984 I'm overwhelmed.
3655820 3656821 You found me.
3657321 3658856 Wasn't very hard.
3660124 3662993 Two men with saint's names flew into Moscow yesterday.
3664094 3668032 Isadore Bakanja is a short,<br />bald African,
3668065 3670667 whereas Vincent Ferrer...
3670701 3672669 Was named after a saint who betrayed his best friend.
3672703 3674138 How could you do it?
3675205 3677007 Emma...
3677041 3679209 I had to.
3681211 3682546 I'm a thief.
3682579 3684749 I want my cards back.
3684782 3687117 You flew all this way because you want your cards back?
3687151 3688786 Yes, I did.<br />No.
3689453 3690988 It's because<br />you're in love.
3694792 3695993 I rest my case.
3696026 3697261 Who are you?
3697294 3699196 No one has a clue,<br />least of all me.
3700697 3704134 And why would<br />you steal cold fusion?
3704601 3706070 It's free.
3707004 3708505 Why would you do that?
3710240 3711441 Eight million reasons.
3711475 3714178 Oh, eight million.<br />Wow, that's all?
3716480 3718548 I would have<br />given them to you.
3719984 3721451 If you'd only asked.
3728025 3729426 You've got to<br />get away from me.
3729459 3732763 I'm not going anywhere until you tell me why you lied to me.
3732797 3733864 You lied to me.
3733898 3735432 I lied to you?
3735465 3736600 You almost<br />got me killed.
3736633 3737968 The guy I stole the stuff for says it doesn't work.
3738502 3740137 Well, screw him.
3740170 3742539 I don't think<br />you'd enjoy that.
3742572 3744274 Yeah, you're right.<br />I don't think I would.
3752249 3753650 Emma.
3753683 3755319 You don't know what<br />you're dealing with here.
3756921 3757988 What?<br />Why are you...
3767064 3768132 They took my pills.
3768165 3770835 No, they didn't.<br />I palmed them from your purse.
3770868 3773637 I need one or two.<br />I need...
3774604 3776240 I have a bad heart,<br />and...
3776273 3777975 I know.
3778008 3779176 It's starting<br />to pound.
3779209 3781478 It's okay.<br />I've got your pills.
3781511 3784448 Okay, I've got<br />two in my hand.
3784481 3786050 Just...<br />I'm gonna pass out.
3786083 3787684 Sit down<br />on the floor.
3789786 3792756 Just get down on the floor.<br />That's right.
3792789 3794258 That's right.<br />Eat two out of my hand.
3794925 3796126 That's right.
3796160 3797627 Mmm.<br />Okay?
3797661 3798863 Mmm.
3798896 3800497 While you're down there...
3803567 3805169 Get the pocket knife<br />out of my boot.
3808072 3811876 This formula makes<br />certain assumptions
3811909 3816180 which contradict all we know about cold fusion cathodes.
3816213 3818682 So testing<br />at any level becomes futile
3818715 3820484 without further<br />information.
3821085 3822419 Mr. Tretiak.
3822452 3824554 Don't despair,<br />Dr. Botvin.
3825489 3826790 Help is here.
3838302 3840137 The two came<br />very quietly.
3842506 3843540 Oh.
3848979 3851982 And they left<br />even more quietly.
3853683 3855552 Close the city.
3855585 3857922 Kill him,<br />and bring her.
3858956 3860124 Alive.
3874771 3877274 Why... Why are they<br />after me?
3877307 3879676 Tretiak, the guy I work for,<br />he owns this city,
3880177 3881645 cops and all.
3881678 3883280 We have to convince him
3883313 3886150 there's nothing more<br />he wants from you.
3886183 3887751 What do you want<br />from me?
3894891 3896526 Everything's<br />on those cards?
3896560 3897861 Yes.
3897894 3899163 So the formula works?
3900097 3901698 Oh, kiss me again.
3904134 3905970 No.<br />Make up your mind.
3906003 3910907 Oh, it's, uh,<br />I have to figure out the order
3910941 3912009 before the<br />formula works,
3912042 3914244 and I'm not gonna<br />give it to him.
3914278 3916046 Tretiak will find you.<br />No.
3916080 3917381 He found me,<br />and that's a very hard thing to do.
3918548 3919849 I found you.
3920584 3921885 Yes, you did.
3923520 3924688 What do you need?
3928692 3930227 I need some time,
3930694 3931996 and I need...
3934431 3936000 I need a place<br />to work,
3937501 3938635 and...
3940170 3942039 Where's<br />everyone going?
3942072 3945775 To their country relatives<br />to cut firewood.
3945809 3947677 There's no heat<br />in the city.
3957654 3959823 How long will it take you to finish the formula?
3959856 3960924 I don't know.
3960957 3962626 Uh, two hours,<br />maybe.
3963493 3964694 I don't know.
3964728 3966330 Should be enough time
3966363 3968198 to get our<br />passports together,
3968232 3970467 and for us<br />to get married.
3970500 3972069 We're getting married?<br />Yes.
3974438 3977407 I want you to be<br />Mrs. Martin de Porres.
3981545 3983280 You're not Martin.
3983313 3984514 No.
3985449 3986516 Who are you?
3990254 3991388 I don't have a name.
3993357 3994758 That's sad.
3994791 3996693 Will you have a name<br />when we get home?
3997727 3998762 I don't have a home.
3999563 4000664 When we get back,
4000697 4002832 you do the science,<br />I'll do the math.
4002866 4005435 We'll market your formula<br />around the world.
4005469 4008205 We'll make a fortune,<br />and then...
4009906 4011108 We'll see.
4012742 4013810 Okay?
4023320 4024921 Emma!
4037267 4038402 Oh!
4042172 4044174 No trouble, okay?
4047811 4050247 If you want to live,<br />never leave my side.
4099263 4100597 Oh!
4177407 4178908 I've got you.
4184981 4186616 Come on.
4190987 4192422 Here we go. Up.
4196125 4197361 Oh, we've gotta<br />get you warm.
4207103 4208405 We're almost there.
4232729 4234331 Oh, come on.
4235299 4236400 Come on.
4243106 4245208 You'll wait till Christ<br />comes to Moscow.
4246343 4248745 Elevator was made<br />of mahogany.
4248778 4250814 Tenants use it for firewood last winter.
4250847 4252682 We need your help.
4252716 4255251 He fell in the river,<br />and he's freezing.
4255285 4257153 Need clothes.<br />We're just people who were...
4257186 4258588 You're not people.
4259856 4261491 You're Americans.
4261525 4264761 Yes, but we ran into trouble with your mafia.
4296893 4299095 She disapproves<br />of what I do,
4299128 4300930 but eats the bread<br />it buys her.
4303967 4305769 No heat for sale,
4305802 4307937 but these clothes<br />will make him warm.
4313810 4316012 I tell her, Mashenka,<br />go back to bed.
4316045 4317747 She's always<br />puttering around.
4321751 4322986 It's here.
4323019 4325489 Built to escape<br />secret police.
4326623 4328057 In you go.
4342238 4344340 You've got hypothermia.
4344374 4347377 We have to get<br />these wet clothes off,
4348311 4350179 and keep you warm.
4350213 4352582 They must be in one<br />of these buildings.
4352616 4354250 Check every<br />apartment.
4356219 4357387 How you doing?
4358788 4359856 Talk to me.
4359889 4362058 Snug as a bug in a rug.
4370567 4371768 Okay.
4372301 4373803 We're gonna...
4373837 4375472 We're gonna<br />have to do this
4375505 4378374 before your body<br />temperature falls
4378942 4380510 below 95 degrees.
4393957 4396392 Two kids,<br />talking about foreigners.
4405735 4407236 Listen to me, tenants!
4408371 4410574 Show me where<br />the Americans are,
4410607 4413076 and you'll be paid<br />in American dollars.
4414644 4416946 Five hundred<br />bucks reward.
4416980 4418281 Daddy?
4419949 4423152 Have you seen, by chance,<br />two Americans?
4423186 4425589 Just one American<br />and one polar bear.
4427390 4428825 Do we get 250?
4449245 4450346 We check upstairs.
4463226 4464794 What's your name?
4467697 4469499 Who are you, really?
4471400 4472435 Simon.
4473069 4475104 Simon?
4475138 4477040 So you are named<br />for a saint.
4477907 4479643 No, Simon<br />the magician.
4480777 4482846 I did tricks.
4482879 4485314 Tricks for Agnes,
4485348 4487984 and that's how I got things.<br />Priests took everything.
4488785 4490587 Took Agnes.
4490620 4492021 Dogs too big.
4492822 4494524 Teeth.
4494558 4496860 Teeth.<br />She fell.
4497894 4499462 I escaped.
4500530 4501565 I always escape.
4503066 4505134 I don't believe<br />in magic anymore.
4507503 4508872 I do.
4511708 4513910 I've never felt<br />like this before.
4515344 4516613 How?
4517681 4519415 I'm freezing.
4523887 4525589 These are here!
4525622 4527924 These Americans<br />are here!
4530426 4532829 These are here!
4532862 4535031 We've got to get out of here.<br />Are you okay?
4535832 4537266 They're coming.
4538568 4541671 Americans are here!
4541705 4543840 Hurry.<br />Here, put this on.
4549946 4551347 Ilya!
4564761 4566029 Upstairs, go!
4584513 4585548 Maybe we can jump.
4586950 4588985 Let's jump.
4592822 4594057 Come on!
4620316 4621651 Wait.
4638501 4639969 We need her alive,<br />idiot.
4642872 4644273 Embassy's east of here.
4663626 4665461 You're late.<br />Where have you been?
4666495 4668031 I've been waiting<br />two hours.
4668064 4669198 Come on.
4669232 4672035 I've got some beautiful paintings for you to buy.
4672068 4673136 In here. Come on,<br />come on.
4678341 4681610 Don't fret. It's just<br />my curator, Toli.
4681644 4683446 I am Alexa Frankievitch...
4683479 4686182 ...but being you're Americans,<br />you can call me Frankie, okay?
4686215 4687283 Okay, Frankie.
4687316 4688517 I've got money.<br />We want...
4688551 4690086 I know.
4690119 4692856 The icon of the virgin<br />of the damned.
4692889 4694924 Are those maps of the tunnels?<br />- Yes.
4694958 4696125 We're not here<br />to buy art.
4696159 4698094 Just take us to<br />the American Embassy.
4698127 4701397 Right. I need<br />$10,000 up front, huh?
4701430 4703967 No.<br />- Okay.
4704000 4706903 Seven thousand<br />and not a penny less.
4706936 4708905 Shh.
4716245 4717313 Police.
4717346 4719148 No.<br />Tretiak's goons.
4729525 4730860 Wait.
4730894 4733062 Sasha, go east<br />to the Embassy.
4733096 4734998 Are we lost?<br />What's wrong?
4735031 4736532 You're in Russia, sir.
4736565 4738301 Everything<br />is complicated.
4738334 4739402 But you know<br />the way?
4740336 4742071 Like the face<br />of a...
4742105 4743572 Bulgari chronograph.
4750079 4751347 Mmm.
4753349 4754984 I remember.<br />This way.
4760156 4762325 At last,<br />water main.
4763492 4765694 They shut it down each afternoon in winter.
4765728 4767530 What time do<br />they turn it back on?
4767563 4770733 You have five minutes,<br />plus or minus.
4770766 4772168 Plus or minus?
4772201 4774737 That means several minutes<br />earlier or late.
4774770 4775905 Don't worry.
4775939 4777974 Third opening is under<br />your embassy.
4795925 4797560 Quick.<br />Someone's coming.
4803532 4804633 Come on.
4805201 4806435 Come on.
4814743 4816179 Here's the second one.
4816712 4817981 Embassy's next.
4821650 4823319 About two more minutes.
4823352 4824787 Yeah, unless<br />it's minus.
4828791 4829825 Damn.
4830793 4832161 It's sealed.
4833462 4835164 We'll have to go back.
4835198 4836465 Come on.
4861057 4862358 Hurry.
4871767 4873136 Up you go.
4893722 4895424 Yankee, go home!
4895458 4897593 Down with Yankee!
4904467 4906936 Embassy's only about<br />a hundred yards away.
4907670 4909072 There's a car<br />right above us.
4910106 4911407 Watch your head.
4944607 4946642 I'll create a diversion.
4946675 4949312 It should take you only about 10 seconds to run to those gates.
4949345 4951114 They'll open them when<br />they see you coming.
4952448 4954083 Okay.<br />I can do that.
4954117 4955651 You can do it.
4956319 4957987 Wait.
4958021 4959188 When am I<br />gonna see you?
4960123 4962091 I'll find you.<br />You found me.
4962958 4964260 Yeah, I did.
5026789 5027956 I'm an American!
5027990 5030326 Open the gate!<br />Open the gate!
5030359 5032561 Open the gate!<br />I'm an American!
5033696 5035598 Back off<br />from the gate.
5035631 5038734 Back off.<br />I said back off.
5040536 5042738 Stand back<br />from the gate.
5045274 5046542 I said back off!
5059688 5061157 She outran you?
5061190 5062525 How humiliating.
5067430 5068764 One...
5069465 5071066 Shot left.
5072301 5074103 Can't come all<br />the way to Russia
5074137 5075671 and not play<br />Russian roulette.
5077340 5079642 Before you shoot me,<br />don't you want to know where all the money's hidden?
5081377 5082578 Whose money?
5082611 5084247 Tretiak's, yours.
5084280 5085481 He treats you like dirt.
5085514 5086682 You could have it all.
5086715 5087916 What are you saying?
5087950 5090853 I'm saying your father<br />stashed billions,
5090886 5093021 and I know where it's hidden.<br />Let's make a deal.
5093055 5095158 So...
5095191 5097160 Where are all those<br />hidden billions?
5098194 5099428 I know...
5100696 5102265 But I don't think<br />I'm going to tell you.
5132060 5133128 Joseph,<br />what's the holdup?
5133162 5134497 I said get 'em inside!
5134530 5136565 Well, you're worse<br />than all the others,
5136599 5138601 however burns will heal.
5139668 5142171 Maybe a little chance<br />of scarring, perhaps,
5142205 5145441 but all in all I'd say<br />he's a very lucky boy.
5145474 5146809 Lucky?
5146842 5148377 Look at me.
5148877 5150479 I am a damn devil.
5151780 5152981 Christ.
5156585 5158787 Yes?<br />I have run every test
5158821 5160889 on this<br />cold fusion formula
5160923 5165160 and must conclude that it is not merely incomplete,
5165194 5167796 but, rather,<br />impossible.
5167830 5170132 You may as well try to create perpetual motion,
5170165 5171600 Mr. Tretiak.
5172501 5174537 I invest millions...
5176572 5179141 And you can't<br />make it work!
5183212 5185514 What are you doing<br />with my money?
5188451 5191454 Do you think<br />it comes so easy?
5192455 5193989 No!
5194022 5197826 But, sir,<br />I have been working for nearly two weeks
5198394 5200529 without sleep.
5200563 5204367 At first blush,<br />the theorem appears quite impressive.
5204400 5206068 Convincing.<br />It does?
5211407 5212875 Yes.
5213876 5215278 It does.
5216078 5217380 Good man.
5217413 5219582 We can use it<br />to destroy our enemies.
5221884 5225421 Only Dr. Russell<br />can spoil my plan.
5225454 5228324 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press...
5228357 5231460 From here to the airport are three army checkpoints,
5232094 5234029 all of them<br />loyal to us.
5234062 5236365 Make certain they all<br />get the message
5236399 5238801 she doesn't<br />leave Moscow alive.
5241704 5243138 Mr. President.
5243171 5246609 As former vice minister<br />of energy and power,
5246642 5251314 I hear all manner of schemes that provide cheaper energy,
5251347 5255083 and, uh,<br />as our countrymen freeze to death,
5255117 5258787 I've become aware of a marvelous new technology,
5258821 5261490 about which I'm hopelessly out of my league
5261524 5264393 from a scientific<br />viewpoint.
5264427 5267463 That's why I brought our eminent physicist here,
5267496 5270899 Dr. Lev Botvin from<br />the University of Moscow.
5270933 5273436 Before we are dazzled<br />by the good news,
5273469 5275571 let's dispense<br />with the bad.
5276639 5278807 What is the price<br />of this marvel?
5278841 5282110 The cost for research and development are there,
5282144 5284012 which is all you are asked to decide.
5290853 5292855 Ten billion<br />in hard currency?
5293689 5295858 I can't even pay<br />my teachers,
5295891 5297693 my miners,<br />my doctors.
5305368 5307770 Where are you heading?
5307803 5310706 I thought we'd drink some vodka to get warmer.
5315811 5318213 Like the miracle<br />of socialism,
5318246 5320883 our miracle<br />of cold fusion failed.
5321784 5323486 But no matter.
5323519 5327356 We have sold cold fusion to President Karpov.
5327390 5331360 We will use the scandal of its failure to destroy him.
5331394 5333729 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5333762 5335831 You're a man in a hurry,<br />Ivan Petrovich.
5335864 5337566 That's only one day.
5337600 5339468 Not now, old witch.<br />We're working.
5340536 5342671 Yes. Think of it.
5342705 5345207 One day,<br />you can be proud again
5345240 5347342 to be a Russian general.
5348477 5351614 With a big nuclear missile where your prick used to be.
5352548 5353849 You just have to<br />fill out a form
5353882 5355618 before we put you on a flight home.<br />Okay.
5355651 5357285 Any medical problems,<br />that sort of thing.
5357319 5358954 Oh. I have<br />a heart condition.
5358987 5361023 Well, do you need me to arrange any medication for you?
5361056 5362458 Uh...
5362491 5364893 Well, I haven't needed<br />a pill...
5365694 5366729 That's strange.
5366762 5368697 Get a form from table three down the corridor.
5368731 5370332 I'll be back<br />in 10 minutes,
5370365 5372367 by your side,<br />all the way to the airport.
5372401 5374169 Thank you.
5374202 5376171 Across the street<br />in Central Moscow,
5376204 5377973 where overnight,<br />a mob attacked
5378006 5381076 several companies<br />with ties to America.
5381109 5385013 Apparently, four U.S. citizens were badly injured in the attack.
5385047 5386915 I'm told that<br />all American citizens
5386949 5389652 have been asked to report<br />to the American Embassy
5389685 5391186 for immediate evacuation.
5391887 5393789 Excuse me, little lady.
5393822 5394923 You look lost.
5394957 5396358 No, I'm, uh,<br />I'm fine.
5396391 5397526 May I help you?
5397560 5399628 Allow me to<br />introduce myself.
5399662 5402030 My name is<br />August Christopher.
5402064 5403899 I was named after<br />Saint Augustine,
5403932 5405768 who coined<br />my favorite phrase.
5405801 5408270 Give me chastity<br />and give me constancy,
5408303 5409705 but do not give it yet.
5415077 5416411 Simon, I'm...
5416445 5417980 I'm on the next flight<br />out of here.
5419047 5420849 Are you coming with me?<br />No.
5421784 5422985 But they are.
5429492 5432561 I'll need you to develop a sudden fear of flying.
5433295 5434797 Find a quiet room,
5435964 5438467 finish the formula,<br />and fax it back to me.
5438501 5439902 My number's on<br />the back.
5439935 5441504 I don't understand.
5442270 5444406 Why are you<br />keeping my cards?
5444439 5446775 I've got to do a deal with the Russians,<br />or you'll never be safe.
5447876 5449411 Be good at school.
5450513 5451680 Wait.
5453549 5455283 Don't you trust me,<br />darling?
5455317 5456351 Trust who?
5457452 5459287 That hurts, Emma.
5459321 5460689 I'm serious.
5460723 5462057 What's your name?
5462090 5464927 My name is<br />August Christopher.
5464960 5467663 Of course, I trust you,<br />August Christopher.
5467696 5470032 I mean,<br />Vincent Ferrer...
5470065 5471834 I mean,<br />Martin de Porres...
5473669 5474803 Thomas More.
5476539 5478974 After all, you are<br />my personal saint.
5480342 5482177 You have to<br />be a very good,
5482210 5485548 and usually,<br />a very dead person to become a saint.
5485581 5488050 And more importantly,<br />you have to work three miracles.
5489484 5491119 Now, get to work.
5492454 5493989 Who's that man?
5494022 5496892 You're leaving on the transport at nine o'clock, ma'am?
5496925 5499494 Probably be your last chance out of here.
5499528 5501063 Better hurry.<br />It's leaving.
5503498 5506268 Your troops<br />will depose the president
5506301 5509337 and install Ivan Tretiak<br />as leader of Russia.
5509371 5514142 Moscow must be ringed with tanks by early evening.
5514176 5517412 Don't worry,<br />the people will follow me.
5517445 5519915 They will be crying<br />for revolution.
5519948 5522184 Still, no one's guessed<br />the simple truth
5522217 5524319 of where<br />the heating oil went.
5528557 5531426 Who would believe<br />that a sea of oil
5531459 5533696 was hidden under<br />this very building?
5536231 5538734 Yuri, I understand<br />your Nataly is to...
5538767 5541403 Francis, you devil,
5541436 5543371 I heard you came down here,<br />and you didn't call me.
5543872 5545140 Hello, Dominic.
5545173 5546842 Give me a ring when you get this, Charles.
5547209 5548911 Lou,
5548944 5550278 I've heard<br />on the grapevine
5550312 5553181 that you're brokering a revolutionary new energy source.
5554282 5556484 If it's as good as<br />it's cracked up to be,
5556518 5558987 I have friends who can double your best offer,
5559922 5562024 on deposit in Zurich
5562057 5564727 within one hour of delivery and confirmation.
5565728 5566829 I'll be waiting.
5588250 5589985 The work could be here.
5590018 5591486 This machine could work,<br />couldn't it?
5594790 5596625 Who are you?
5596659 5598160 A friend<br />of Dr. Russell's.
5599327 5600729 Dr. Russell...
5602064 5603966 What is this equation?
5603999 5605333 It's so simple. It's...
5607269 5609071 This is the key to<br />Dr. Russell's formula.
5609371 5610405 Yes.
5611539 5613776 The alarm.
5613809 5615010 You had better go.
5615043 5616378 I need a miracle.
5617412 5618580 You've got 12 hours.
5620348 5622785 But Mr. Tretiak's<br />rally is tonight.
5622818 5624086 Can you make it work?
5625654 5626889 Make it work.
5631694 5633061 What is wrong here?
5633595 5635063 Uh, the alarm...
5637032 5639467 Uh...
5639935 5641269 I tripped. I...
5650012 5652547 You are Nikolai Petrovich.
5653816 5655350 You are<br />Nikolai Provovich...
5655383 5656618 Petrovich.
5667930 5670065 Tunnel built by KGB...
5672234 5674436 Leads to machine room<br />in Kremlin.
5674469 5675771 Great. Do you<br />happen to know
5675804 5677505 where the president's<br />quarters are?
5678774 5681043 President Karpov is...
5682010 5685480 There, but there are<br />many guards,
5686081 5687315 so I suggest...
5687349 5689251 An alternate route?
5689284 5691353 Money. Now.
5693688 5695190 Oh, ye<br />of little faith.
5699327 5700863 Russia stands tonight
5700896 5703866 on the brink<br />of a second revolution.
5703899 5706468 As the number of deaths<br />from freezing mounts,
5706501 5710305 hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets.
5710338 5712274 Even as Russian<br />President Karpov
5712307 5714476 is promising<br />a mysterious solution
5714509 5716644 to the crippling<br />heating oil shortage,
5716678 5718747 troops opposed<br />to the elected government
5718781 5721016 and led by<br />General Leo Sklarov
5721049 5724152 have begun to ring<br />the Russian capital city.
5724186 5726054 Angry, frightened citizens
5726088 5728857 are gathering outside<br />the Kremlin in Red Square,
5728891 5732895 but they're not braving the bitter cold for yet another political rally.
5732928 5734997 They've been drawn here by the promise
5735030 5737933 of a revelation,<br />whatever that may be,
5737966 5740235 in what's become<br />a life-and-death struggle
5740268 5743171 for the future<br />of democracy in Russia.
5819481 5821083 Mr. President?<br />I'm your friend.
5821583 5822617 What do you want?
5825854 5828723 I want to help you<br />to destroy Tretiak.
5828756 5830325 I need you to listen<br />for about 30 seconds.
5832360 5833728 I'm all right.
5833761 5834796 Stay outside.
5835297 5837299 Please, continue.
5837332 5840535 Tonight you're going to stand trial in Red Square before the world.
5840568 5843005 Whatever Tretiak<br />accuses you of,
5843038 5844472 I need you<br />to admit to it.
5844506 5846541 Agree with<br />this criminal?
5846574 5848410 If you want to destroy Tretiak, yes.
5865693 5867395 Gruschev, take Mr.<br />Karpov downstairs.
5867429 5868997 The wife stays here.
5871166 5873301 Get your hands off!
5873335 5875370 What you are doing<br />is illegal!
5875403 5876571 The people<br />won't stand for it!
5876604 5878740 The people<br />are too cold to stop it.
5878773 5880108 Who are you?
5885147 5887815 Tretiak! Tretiak! Tretiak!
5912774 5914376 Friends...
5914977 5916644 Countrymen...
5917079 5918513 Russians!
5928656 5933061 You heard about this morning's sensational events.
5933095 5936264 Many shocking documents<br />were recovered
5936298 5938866 from the president's<br />secret files,
5938900 5940835 locked within<br />his private safe.
5941569 5942704 The documents...
5943838 5946208 Which will be published<br />in today's papers,
5946241 5947675 prove
5947709 5952880 that the traitor Karpov<br />was about to steal
5952914 5957219 over 40 trillion of our precious Russian rubles,
5957252 5960388 in a reckless scheme<br />to save his hide!
5961889 5964126 To add insult,
5964159 5966194 millions of dollars
5966228 5969731 were to be paid to these international criminals!
5977472 5979474 And for what was<br />your president
5979507 5983545 hoping to bankrupt<br />our national treasury?
5983578 5986914 What you see<br />is a fairy tale
5986948 5989317 called cold fusion.
5989351 5993688 You pass electric current<br />into the machine,
5993721 5997792 and there is supposed to<br />be a chemical reaction.
5997825 5999261 Watch!
5999294 6003498 It can't even light up<br />a tiny light bulb!
6003531 6006034 Do you dare deny this,<br />Mr. Karpov?
6006068 6007569 Absolutely not!
6008203 6011039 I proudly admit it.
6011073 6013775 But enough puny failure.
6013808 6016411 Failure is in the past!
6016444 6019714 Begging is behind us!
6019747 6022917 The balance of power<br />is about to shift!
6056884 6058320 Miracle one.
6062324 6064959 Karpov! Karpov!
6091085 6092554 Ilya! Ilya!
6092587 6094656 Go! Go!<br />Go, go, go!
6096858 6101329 I order all troops loyal<br />to Mother Russia
6101363 6104399 to seize<br />the criminal Tretiak!
6110505 6112006 A thousand apologies,<br />Mr. President.
6112039 6113541 There was<br />a miscommunication
6113575 6115643 somewhere in<br />the chain of command.
6121783 6123885 Miracle Two.
6123918 6126654 The billionaire industrialist<br />and his son Ilya
6126688 6129023 were taken to the infamous Lubyanka prison
6129056 6133828 where they await trial along with fellow conspirator General Leo Sklarov.
6133861 6137499 Moscow woke today to the forgotten sensation of warmth
6137532 6140868 as millions of gallons of heating oil flowed from a storage depot
6140902 6143338 discovered beneath<br />Tretiak's riverside mansion.
6143371 6146641 And he made no threat to contact you in the future?
6146674 6148142 He never had<br />the chance.
6148176 6150044 You'll tell us if<br />he does make contact?
6150077 6152013 Oh, yes.<br />Which he may well do.
6153181 6155417 He's a proper rogue,<br />you see.
6155450 6157985 He charms women,<br />this so-called saint.
6159086 6160988 It seems<br />it's his stock in trade.
6161022 6162257 No offense.
6162290 6164058 Well, I am offended.
6164091 6168363 All I got from this saint was a series of near-death experiences.
6168396 6170265 Well, count<br />yourself lucky.
6170298 6173668 Look, I have a very important conference that I must prepare for.
6173701 6175437 We understand.<br />You have a life.
6176771 6178172 We appreciate you<br />taking the time.
6178206 6179807 Oh, no problem.
6186381 6187549 She's in love with him.
6258420 6260288 I wanted to call you<br />and tell you everything.
6261423 6262557 It just hasn't<br />been safe.
6262590 6264459 Oh, I couldn't stop<br />thinking about you.
6267529 6269130 So...
6269163 6270532 Have you, uh...
6270565 6271733 Been busy?
6271766 6274802 Yeah.<br />I've been working real hard.
6274836 6277705 Thank God,<br />I have my cards back.
6277739 6281743 You don't believe in all this cold fusion mumbo jumbo,<br />do you?
6281776 6283478 You know,<br />you're a very pretty lady.
6284111 6286448 Oh, my God.
6286481 6288783 That was you?
6288816 6291018 That's who I thought<br />Dr. Russell would like.
6292387 6293788 I didn't know<br />you were...
6293821 6294889 I thought you were<br />some old biddy,
6294922 6298326 not some gorgeous<br />soon-to-be-trillionaire.
6298360 6300862 You know you're going to be the richest woman in the world.
6301496 6302530 I am?
6302564 6304599 Why do you think<br />I'm hanging around?
6312206 6313375 Emma.<br />Yeah?
6313408 6315510 My life<br />is very strange.
6315543 6317144 I just...
6321315 6323351 I don't do<br />anything normal.
6323385 6325820 I'm... I can't even...<br />I know.
6327054 6328255 I know you.
6329591 6331258 I know your life.
6332126 6333861 What do you want?
6333895 6335229 I want you.
6335262 6336598 For how long?
6337331 6338866 It doesn't matter.
6346140 6347341 Tell me you love me.
6349411 6350678 I love you.
6352414 6353681 Simon.
6354849 6356651 I love you, Simon.
6358285 6359754 Miracle three.
6383911 6385580 Dear Simon,
6385613 6389817 the pin is something I've kept for years,<br />God knows why.
6389851 6392620 A graduation gift<br />from catholic school.
6392654 6395256 But don't worry,<br />you don't have to wear it.
6395289 6397625 I just wanted you to have something of mine,
6397659 6399861 something I loved.
6399894 6402764 Simon, if sainthood<br />requires three miracles,
6402797 6405800 then I'd say you've made it,<br />my love,
6405833 6407935 and so I hope<br />you'll understand.
6407969 6412006 Last night it became clear to me what I have to do this morning.
6412039 6415176 You see,<br />I'm going to give cold fusion to the world.
6415209 6417912 It's the only way,<br />if we're ever together again,
6417945 6419346 that I'll know<br />it's for you,
6419380 6421048 and you'll know<br />it's for me.
6421649 6423751 If cold fusion is free,
6423785 6425953 then you and I, Simon,<br />will be free, too.
6427054 6428556 Listen, if you think
6428590 6429991 giving away everything<br />in front of the world,
6430024 6432293 preventing us from making an unimaginable fortune
6432326 6434295 will accomplish<br />anything...
6435497 6436664 You're absolutely right.
6439100 6441068 Simon, what are you<br />doing here?
6441102 6443671 There are...<br />There are police.
6443705 6445072 They're everywhere.
6445106 6446841 I wouldn't miss it<br />for the world.
6447809 6449043 You wore the pin.
6449410 6450812 Of course.
6455049 6456417 You better go.
6469597 6471098 How am I going<br />to find you?
6472967 6474335 I'll find you.
6474368 6475703 You found me.
6503030 6506534 Although our next speaker requires no introduction
6506568 6509370 after last week's<br />Moscow fireworks,
6510705 6515176 uh, please let me welcome Dr.<br />E.J. Russell...
6515209 6517779 Excuse me,<br />is this seat taken?
6519747 6521115 No.
6522550 6524318 Dr. Russell.
6533094 6535730 You don't believe in all this cold fusion mumbo jumbo,<br />do you?
6535763 6537599 Thank you.<br />Good morning.
6537632 6538866 No.
6538900 6542103 Well, we all know that cold fusion has had a...
6543504 6545372 A difficult childhood.
6546608 6548576 Those of us in the field are orphans.
6549143 6551145 Bastards, at best.
6551178 6555082 But difficult childhoods, I believe,<br />make the most interesting adults.
6558119 6560254 And I know that most of you thought that cold fusion
6560287 6562657 was an impossible dream.<br />I'm her biggest fan.
6562690 6564692 Cold fusion belongs to all of us.<br />I think she's a fox.
6565192 6566828 Look at that.
6566861 6569163 Even though some of you may feel that its practical application
6569196 6572466 is still somewhat<br />speculative,
6572499 6576638 well, I've come here today to share with you how that dream is slowly
6576671 6578272 becoming a reality.
6578305 6581308 Yes, it may take years<br />to finally learn
6581342 6582977 how to harness this energy Oh,<br />look at the time. Got to go.
6583745 6586147 and stabilize its power.
6586180 6589183 But with your help,<br />we can all work towards making the...
6589651 6591552 The...
6591585 6594321 Dream of cold fusion<br />finally...
6594355 6595790 Come true.
6626320 6627689 Hands behind<br />your back!
6627722 6629857 Come on! Got you,<br />you slippery son of a...
6629891 6631726 What's going on here?
6637999 6639333 Damn!
6646373 6648442 Donations<br />totaling three billion dollars
6648475 6651245 were made today to the Red Cross,<br />the Salvation Army,
6651278 6653715 and the United Nations<br />Children's Fund.
6653748 6657051 The funds were wired from the account of jailed Russian tycoon
6657084 6658452 Ivan Tretiak.
6658485 6660421 In other<br />philanthropic news,
6660454 6662724 a non-profit<br />research foundation
6662757 6666894 has been established to develop cold fusion technology,
6666928 6669130 funded with<br />an anonymous donation
6669163 6673300 and to be headed by Russian physicist Dr.<br />Lev Botvin.
6673334 6677338 The E.J. Russell foundation is charged to develop inexpensive...
