79000 80239 Mum!
96839 98160 Mum!
101519 102839 Mummy!
106440 107919 Mum!
109440 110959 Mum!
112480 114480 I had the dream again.
123959 126080 "And he climbed down<br />that chimney,
126319 129399 straight into the<br />huge black pot.
130000 134080 And that was the end of<br />the big bad wolf."
137880 139919 Did they really kill the<br />wolf, Mum’?
140600 141960 I'm sure they did.
142720 145080 I'll kill the monster<br />when it comes.
145279 147320 I'll smash its head in.
149800 151679 It's time to go to sleep now,<br />sweetie.
151880 153279 It's very late.
153520 155160 Can we read it again?
159000 163000 "Along time ago--<br />just yesterday, in fact--
163279 168080 there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty, big wolf."
239880 240880 What have you done?
241119 242320 It's not broken.<br />It just slipped.
242520 244479 I don't want you firing<br />things off in the house anymore.
244720 245720 Wait, wait, wait!<br />Watch this.
245960 248320 When the monster comes,<br />I'm gonna do this.
249119 250160 Please don't!
253440 255479 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
255679 257519 Stand still please.
257720 258640 Look at me, Mum.
258839 260640 - Come on, Samuel.<br />- Look at me.
260839 261959 Stand still please.
262200 264000 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
264239 266079 I don't want you making<br />weapons anymore.
266279 268559 It doesn't work if you<br />don't look at me!
268760 271559 This monster thing has<br />got to stop, all right?
281279 282320 Mm!
283480 284920 Mm!
285160 286559 Don't do that
289760 291160 Ready?
293399 294920 Come on.
299880 301359 Quick.<br />You're late already.
301799 302640 What have you got in there?
302839 304600 See you later, alligator!
314200 316519 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in if.
316959 318000 What?
318279 319959 One with your milk in it.
320239 321880 I don't want milk.
322399 324440 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
328200 330799 Ah, just where a woman<br />should be: In the kitchen.
332000 333200 "Get to work, woman!"
334279 336279 - Do you want a cuppa?<br />- Nah.
336480 338279 I'm heading for the<br />dementia ward.
338480 339679 Ah.
339880 341359 It’s a few years before you end<br />up there, isn't it?
342839 343959 Right?
349239 351760 Amelia, your son's school<br />is on the phone.
356959 358079 Oh, my God.
358279 359399 Did he hurt anyone?
359600 362480 A dart could have gone into a<br />child's eye or even worse.
363679 365359 I'm gonna have a serious<br />talk with him.
365559 367519 Mrs. Vanek,<br />we've had the talks.
367720 369440 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
369640 373160 We're going to have to<br />employ cu monitor for him.
373359 374359 Monitor?
374600 376720 He'll be separated from<br />the other children.
376920 379279 The monitor will supervise him<br />one-on-one.
379880 382559 Samuel won't cope with this.<br />He already feels so different.
383279 384239 I'll have a talk with him.
384440 385279 I'll have a serious--
385480 389839 Mrs. Vanek, the boy has<br />significant behavioural problems.
390079 392720 You know, Samuel doesn't<br />need a full-time monitor.
392920 394839 What he needs is some<br />understanding.
395079 397720 I have 24 other first-graders<br />in that class!
397920 400119 Do you want me to put them all<br />at risk because of your son?
400320 401760 I think I'll just find<br />another school.
402119 404279 Mrs. Vonek, you can’t just<br />take the boy out of school.
404480 405679 You look after your business,
405880 408160 and I'll go find a school that<br />sees my son as Cl human being
408399 410320 and not just as another problem<br />to be gotten rid of.
410559 411600 That's very unfair.
411839 412959 We're only trying<br />to help the boy.
413239 415679 Please stop calling him<br />"the boy."
416359 418119 His name is Samuel.
425160 427480 We can see Ruby and<br />Auntie Claire at the park today.
428799 430160 You can play on<br />that swing you like
430399 431920 for as long as you like,<br />okay?
432920 435320 Mrs. Bowen hates me.
435679 437160 No, she doesn't.
438320 440279 You just need a break.<br />That's all.
442559 444640 Don't tell Auntie Claire<br />what happened.
446799 448160 I'll tell her later.
451239 452640 Mum, come and look at this.
452880 454119 I can do it again.
455399 456959 Sam, don't bother the lady.
457200 458359 Oh, no, no,<br />that's all right.
458559 460559 We have to go home and<br />see Daddy though, haven't we?
460760 463839 - My dad's in the cemetery.<br />- Oh, that's--
464079 466760 He got killed driving Mum to<br />the hospital to have me.
466959 467880 Samuel!
469640 471640 - I'm sorry, he just--<br />- No, that's all right.
471880 473079 I shouldn't have...
473920 476720 Well, your Mum's very lucky to<br />have you then, isn't she?
477440 478839 We have to go.
479119 480720 - Say "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
482119 483880 The artist was so drunk<br />he vomited,
484160 486119 right in front of his<br />own installation.
486359 487760 Lost all these sales.
488399 489559 You're not listening.
489799 491239 Oh, I am.<br />I am.
492000 494320 So, you... You lost all these<br />sales and then what happened?
494519 496880 Ruby.<br />Don't play there, it's wet.
497119 499760 Mum! Mum!
499959 501880 I'm gonna smash its head!
504320 505320 Be careful.
505559 507399 Mum, Mum!<br />I'm gonna smash it!
510679 512400 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
513080 514919 I can get their birthday cakes.
515200 516359 That's easy.
517919 520080 I was hoping Ruby would<br />change her mind.
522080 524239 She doesn't want a joint party<br />with Sam this year.
524599 525679 Oh.
525919 527080 Mum, Mum!
527280 528960 She wants to have<br />a princess party.
529200 531359 Mum! Mum!
531599 532840 That's okay.
533280 534760 We don't have to come.
535400 536840 You can still come.
537080 537599 Mum!
537799 538640 She just doesn't want to
538840 539919 share the day with Sam anymore.
540159 540919 I understand.
541159 542359 - Mum!<br />- I understand.
542559 544960 Mum, I can go really high!
545200 546159 Watch!
548280 549799 Maybe you want to<br />celebrate his birthday
550080 552960 properly this year<br />anyway, on the day.
553200 554719 Yeah, we'll see.
556320 557400 You know, Amelia, I just want
557599 558679 you to be happy, and then this
558880 560880 birthday thing rolls around,<br />and I end up feeling awful.
561119 562599 I don't want you to<br />feel awful, Claire.
564440 565440 We'll be fine.
565640 567119 We'll be absolutely fine.
567320 569000 Mum!<br />Look at me!
574640 576239 Mummy!
581840 583000 Who do we have here?
583239 584400 Hello, Mrs. Roach.
584599 586960 You look fired, little one.
587200 588719 You been in the wars today?
588960 590239 A few wars.
591320 593000 He's had a big day,<br />that's all.
593239 594159 He's just exhausted.
594359 595719 Poor little sweetheart.
595919 597280 BUQSY!
597479 600320 Hello, darling.<br />Hello.
600520 602000 You look tired too, love.
602280 603200 You Okay?
603440 605760 Nothing five years of sleep<br />wouldn't fix.
606599 608559 I'll put your rubbish out<br />for you, Gracie.
608760 610880 No, no, no.<br />You just got in, pet.
611119 612119 I'll do it now.
612359 613400 Then it's done.
653359 655000 You can choose one tonight.
662599 663880 Where'd you get this?
664119 665520 On the shelf.
672080 673799 ''If it's in a word or<br />it's in a look,
674080 676919 you can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
680280 681799 If you're ca really clever one,
682000 683679 and you know what it is to see,
683919 686159 then you can make friends<br />with a special one,
686400 688479 ca friend of you and me."
693159 695159 "His name is Mister Babadook.
695880 697359 And this is his book.
699080 702359 A rumbling sound then<br />three sharp knocks.
702599 705599 Ba-ba-ba dook!<br />Dook! Dook!
706919 709119 That's when<br />you'll know he's around.
709960 711559 You'll see him if you look.
715239 717320 "Ba-ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!"
718440 720159 We might read another one<br />tonight, eh?
720359 722359 But you said I could choose.
727719 729599 "This is what<br />he wears on top.
729799 731679 He's funny, don't you think?
735000 736799 See him in your room<br />at night..."
739119 741320 Mum, does it hurt the boy?
743440 744679 Mum?
744919 746880 Does it live under the bed?!
747159 748200 Mum?
749400 750479 Mummy.
752799 753840 Mummy!
754239 757320 "How sweetly they sung,<br />telling of their happiness and
757520 759000 Iovingness way at the bottom of
759239 763080 the ocean and enfreaﬁng the<br />sirens not to be afraid."
832679 836320 It's that time of the night<br />again, time--
836520 837799 If that's what<br />the doctor ordered, I--
838080 839239 Oh, yeah, yeah, that's...
839440 841400 what the doctor ordered.
941280 942320 Mum!
943000 943880 It's in my room!
944119 945280 - What is?<br />- The Babadook!
945479 948159 Oh, no.<br />No, no, no.
948359 950640 This is not going to happen.
950840 952119 The closet doors were closed,
952320 953440 and now they're wide open.
953640 955200 It's just a book.
956320 957640 It can't hurt you.
959080 960559 You've had a big day.
961440 963000 You're just exhausted.
965200 968119 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
970880 973159 Nothing bad's gonna happen,<br />Sam.
974799 976320 I'm gonna protect you.
1047199 1049199 Mum, it's 9:00.
1060280 1062160 He's not running CI fever<br />anymore.
1063280 1064719 No, no, no, my sister's<br />going to take him.
1064959 1066280 Put it back.
1066880 1068560 Put it back,<br />or it goes in the bin.
1068760 1070000 Aw!
1070280 1071479 Sorry.<br />What was that?
1072880 1074119 Oh, no, no,<br />I couldn't get to the phone.
1074319 1075400 He was vomiting.
1075599 1077000 Yeah, yeah, no worries.
1077239 1078959 I'll see you soon.<br />Samuel.
1079199 1081479 No monster talk at<br />Auntie Claire's, okay?
1082800 1083959 Samuel?
1084199 1086160 No Babadook, no nothing.
1086400 1087640 All right?
1095000 1097479 88.<br />Number 88.
1097719 1100359 Two fat ladies?<br />Good, Elaine.
1100599 1103119 Another few days, and someone<br />could call out "bingo."
1106719 1109280 Number 11.<br />Who has number 11?
1110160 1111680 Less?<br />11?
1112520 1113479 Right.
1113719 1115119 Let's see what else we've got.
1117719 1121719 5 billion.<br />Anyone got 5 billion?
1133119 1135280 Beverly's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1138959 1140319 Are you all right?
1140520 1142160 Yeah, yeah.<br />No, I'm fine.
1142359 1144000 How are you?<br />How's G wing?
1144239 1145079 Fine, yeah.
1145280 1147000 Just a bunch of old people.
1150239 1152160 You don't have to be fine,<br />you know.
1154079 1155920 Just a bit stressed<br />at the moment.
1156280 1157479 Why don": you go home?
1160079 1162439 Old cranky bitch,<br />she goes after lunch.
1162640 1163760 I can cover for you.
1163959 1165119 You'd do that?
1165319 1166400 Yeah.
1168439 1169439 I'll give you my pay.
1169640 1171160 Aw, don't...<br />Don't be ridiculous.
1172959 1174560 You've got a sick boy.
1174800 1175959 Life's too short.
1176400 1178319 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1180479 1182439 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1183160 1184239 Say hi to Sam for me.
1184439 1185880 I will.
1236880 1239119 Where have you been?!<br />You weren't at work.
1239319 1241000 - I rung you a million times.<br />- What happened?
1241239 1243359 He scored the crap<br />out of Ruby, that's all.
1243560 1246359 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing.
1246560 1247800 All day, just talking<br />to the air.
1248000 1249319 - It even freaked me out<br />- I'm so sorry.
1249520 1251160 You need to get him to<br />see someone, Amelia.
1251359 1253280 It's not normal for a kid to<br />carry on with this rubbish.
1253479 1255280 It's not rubbish!<br />It's real!
1255520 1257400 Don't you talk to your<br />Auntie Claire like that!
1260119 1261640 Where did you get<br />those firecrackers?
1261839 1263239 You got them for me<br />on the internet.
1263439 1265560 Well, that's the<br />end of the internet.
1267439 1268479 If the Babadook was real,
1268719 1270160 we'd see it right now,<br />wouldn't we?
1270359 1272560 It wants to scare you first.
1272760 1274000 Then you'll see if.
1274239 1275560 Well, I'm not scared.
1275760 1279000 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1279239 1280119 That's enough.
1280319 1282439 You will be when it<br />eats your insides!
1282680 1283719 I've decided you're not
1283959 1285280 having your birthday<br />with Ruby this week.
1285520 1287520 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1292479 1293680 Samuel!
1303160 1305479 Ladies and gentlemen!
1305680 1307079 Mum and Dad!
1307280 1310000 Life is not always as it seems.
1310280 1312760 It can be a wondrous thing!
1313959 1317280 But if can also be<br />very treacherous.
1325640 1328280 Don't worry, Dad.<br />I'll save Mum.
1329359 1331439 I'm gonna trap the Babadook<br />like this!
1335400 1337800 When he's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it!
1338839 1340079 Samuel?
1349319 1350920 I was just putting<br />something back.
1351199 1352280 All your father's things<br />are down there.
1352479 1353479 He's my father!
1353719 1355119 You don't own him!
1358239 1360079 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1363880 1364959 Can I come in?
1366160 1368400 Hi, matey.<br />This is for you.
1369160 1371359 My mum always got me a<br />model plane when I was sick.
1372199 1373520 I'm not sick.
1375079 1377599 Oh. I...<br />I thought...
1377800 1378880 No, he's not, actually.
1379119 1380079 The truth is, he's so
1380319 1381680 disobedient he can't<br />go to school anymore.
1381920 1383119 You said that's not true!
1383359 1384400 How many six-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1384640 1385599 who still believe in monsters?
1385839 1387079 I hate you!
1387400 1388800 She won't let me<br />have a birthday party,
1389079 1390920 and she won't let me<br />have a dad!
1459199 1460160 Ow.
1465880 1466920 Don"r eat it.
1479239 1481560 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1483000 1484560 Go and watch a DVD, and<br />I'll make something else.
1484760 1485880 The Babadook did it!
1486119 1487920 Just go and watch a DVD,<br />Samuel.
1488479 1492520 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />girls and boys,
1492760 1498280 welcome to The Great Martin's<br />DVD School of Magic.
1498479 1501520 Life is not always as it seems.
1501760 1504599 It can be ca wondrous thing.
1506000 1508719 But it can also be very<br />treacherous.
1510119 1515079 On this DVD, you will learn<br />magic tricks to surprise,
1515280 1519160 to delight and<br />perhaps even shock
1519359 1522880 your family and friends.
1545280 1546680 Do you think this is funny?
1549239 1551280 Oh, no.<br />No. No.
1553640 1554839 Give it to me!
1557239 1559359 Do you want to die?!
1632199 1633239 Don't let it in!
1633439 1634439 Don't let it in!
1634640 1635640 Don't let it in!
1635839 1636880 Don't let it in!
1637119 1638119 Don't let it in!
1638319 1639760 Don't let it in!
1710560 1713640 Mum, do we have to go to<br />Ruby's party?
1724359 1726280 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1726479 1729359 Now she's got 0 twin.<br />They can go shopping together.
1730400 1731800 Come on.
1733680 1734959 Off you go.
1737359 1738880 He's just really tired.
1743839 1746160 Go and play right now.
1754000 1755479 Claire tells me<br />you're Cl writer.
1755719 1758760 Oh. no, not really.<br />Not anymore.
1759400 1760680 What kind of writing<br />did you do?
1760880 1763079 I wrote some articles for<br />some magazines
1763280 1764479 and did some<br />kids‘ stuff.
1764680 1767400 You just need to get<br />back into it, hat’s all.
1767599 1768959 It must be difficult.
1769199 1770640 I do volunteer work with some
1770839 1771719 disadvantaged women,
1771959 1774280 and a few of them have<br />lost their husbands,
1774520 1776560 and they find it very hard.
1779599 1780959 How's Richard's merger going?
1781239 1782319 Ah. Good.
1782520 1785000 I mean, his workload's<br />just ballooned.
1785760 1787560 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1787880 1789479 - Tell me about if.<br />- I don't even have time to go
1789719 1791199 to the gym anymore.<br />It's ridiculous!
1791400 1793000 That's a real tragedy.
1794160 1796599 Not having time to go to the gym<br />anymore, how do you cope?
1797160 1798199 You must have<br />so much to talk about
1798439 1799959 with those poor<br />disadvantaged women.
1812439 1815239 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1815479 1816880 I'm not hurting anybody.
1818199 1819520 Thank you.
1819760 1820839 Bye.
1823199 1824400 Thanks
1824640 1825880 Thanks
1831160 1833079 How would your mum<br />know if it's real or not?
1833520 1834959 She never comes to our house.
1835199 1836680 Mum told Dad<br />she didn't want
1836880 1839359 to go to your house<br />‘cause it's too depressing.
1839560 1842599 The Babadook would eat<br />your mum for breakfast.
1842800 1844520 - It’d rip her arms off!<br />- Shut up!
1844719 1847599 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1847800 1850520 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can‘? cope.
1850719 1853280 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1853479 1854560 Isn't it time you moved on?
1854800 1856160 I have moved on.
1857079 1858160 I don't mention him.
1858359 1859680 I don't talk about him.
1859880 1861839 What strain is that on you,<br />Claire?
1862079 1864359 You're not even good enough<br />to have Cl dad.
1864560 1866680 Everyone else has one,<br />and you don't.
1866880 1868199 I do have CI dad!
1868400 1871359 I listen to your life,<br />day in, day out,
1871599 1874199 and you never stop<br />to ask me anything about mine.
1874400 1875479 I do.
1875680 1876599 I want to know how you are!
1876800 1878560 You don’t come around<br />to our house anymore.
1878800 1881199 Because I can‘? stand being<br />around your son.
1882199 1883920 I can't believe<br />you just said that.
1884160 1886119 You can't stand being<br />around him yourself.
1886319 1888640 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1888839 1889800 That's not true!
1890079 1891800 And your mum<br />doesn't want you.
1892599 1893839 No one wants you.
1905160 1906079 What did you do?!
1906280 1907520 She said I didn't have a dad!
1907719 1909479 She kept saying if!
1911199 1912599 Is she all right?
1912800 1914560 Stay here and<br />look after the children!
1914760 1916479 Do you want another one<br />to get hurt?
1917959 1918959 Mummy!
1919199 1921239 She wouldn't believe me!
1921439 1923239 Mummy!
1923439 1926000 Mummy! MummY!
1926239 1927880 Mummy! MummY!
1928119 1930359 Why can‘? you<br />just be normal?!
1932239 1934079 There is no Babadook!
1937239 1938760 Get out!
1941400 1943119 - Get out!<br />- Samuel.
1943319 1945400 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now.
1945599 1948680 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1967760 1968640 Please help me!
1968839 1971319 There's something<br />wrong with my son!
1983880 1986079 I think it may have been a<br />febrile convulsion.
1986280 1987560 That's when the brain overheats.
1987760 1989160 It always looks worse<br />than it is.
1989359 1991119 I've never seen<br />anything like this.
1991319 1993280 We'll have to wait until<br />the tests come back.
1993479 1995560 All his other results<br />are normal.
1995760 1998640 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety,
1998880 2001079 very committed<br />to the monster theory.
2001280 2002800 That's an understatement.
2004599 2006599 All children see monsters.
2006839 2008239 Not like this.
2010199 2011599 And it's getting worse.
2012239 2014199 He's becoming aggressive.
2014439 2015760 He could see a psychiatrist.
2016000 2017359 I can refer you.
2017599 2018959 Takes a few weeks to get in.
2019239 2020280 That’d be great.
2022239 2025760 But can you just give me<br />something for now,
2026000 2027719 just to make him sleep?
2029239 2030800 And just until...
2032160 2034280 Just until we can<br />get an appointment.
2036359 2037560 Please.
2038560 2040319 I haven": slept in weeks, and...
2040760 2041839 and neither has Samuel.
2042119 2043319 And when we go home tonight,
2043520 2044959 this whole nightmare will start
2045239 2046719 up again, and I'm really...
2047920 2049439 I'm really not coping.
2053199 2056600 I can give you a<br />short course of sedatives,
2056840 2059120 just until the tests come back.
2060159 2063879 Most mothers aren't too keen on<br />them unless it's really bad.
2064439 2065959 It's really bad.
2073639 2076199 These can make<br />children feel...
2077080 2079959 foggy, perhaps some<br />temporary nausea.
2080919 2082840 They'll certainly help him<br />sleep, though.
2084479 2085399 That's for one week.
2085600 2086560 Thank you.
2089479 2091520 Why don": people like me?
2091719 2093320 WhY do you say that?
2093520 2096919 Ruby said people don't like<br />me because I'm weird.
2099479 2102560 Sometimes people say things<br />that aren't true.
2107159 2108840 You just need to<br />take your medicine,
2109080 2111120 have a big sleep,<br />and not worry.
2113080 2114560 I don't want you to die.
2115239 2117959 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2118520 2122120 Did you think that about my<br />dad before he died?
2126760 2129159 Just take your pill<br />so you can go to sleep.
2131280 2132199 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2132439 2133840 Maybe we can do something, hmm?
2135080 2137520 Will these make<br />the Babadook go away?
2138199 2139800 I think so, but you<br />have to promise me
2140080 2141320 not to mention it<br />again.
2141919 2145280 I promise to protect you if<br />you promise to protect me.
2145919 2147520 Then I won't mention it.
2148399 2150760 I promise to protect you.
2151639 2152679 Come on.
2165399 2166639 Come on.
2172520 2174399 Can you stay here with me?
2175840 2176879 Yes.
2178000 2179199 I love you, Mum.
2180000 2181080 Me too.
2363199 2364879 Her nose is broken<br />in two places.
2365120 2366080 She's gonna need surgery.
2366280 2367280 I'll pay for everything.
2367479 2369159 You can't even pay<br />your own bills.
2369360 2370479 Look, I really have to go.
2370719 2373840 Claire, I think someone is<br />stalking me and Samuel.
2374600 2375520 What?
2376120 2378600 A book turned up<br />at our place.
2378800 2380159 I threw it away,<br />but somebody
2380360 2383120 glued it back together<br />and put it on our doorstep.
2383360 2384479 Amelia.
2384719 2386639 I just can‘? help you right now.
2386840 2388600 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted--
2388800 2392439 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2392639 2393479 I have to go.
2412800 2414000 Claire.
2417199 2418399 Hello?
2421080 2427879 Ba-ba dook!<br />Dook! Dook!
2436000 2437159 Hi.
2438280 2440919 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2441639 2443080 Can you tell us what<br />happened?
2443280 2446399 Somebody sent me...<br />ca children's book.
2449159 2450360 And...?
2451159 2454120 And it contained violent and<br />graphic images of my child and
2454320 2455520 me being murdered.
2455719 2457320 Can we have a look<br />at the book, please?
2458280 2459399 I burnt if.
2460919 2461919 You burnt it.
2462399 2463159 Yes.
2463840 2465760 Well, unfortunately there's<br />nothing we can do about it.
2468800 2470919 He's been making phone calls<br />to me, as well.
2471159 2472280 What's he been saying?
2472479 2476159 Nothing.<br />Just making these... noises.
2476919 2478560 How do you know<br />it's the same person?
2478760 2480800 Because of what he<br />wrote in the book!
2481080 2482360 The book you burnt.
2484479 2485560 Yes.
2501399 2502439 Okay.
2504000 2505679 Don't worry about it.
2516120 2517959 Did you get your things done?
2518199 2519639 Mrs. Roach has Parkinson's.
2519840 2521159 That's why she shakes like this.
2521360 2522399 Samuel, you don": have to say
2522600 2525080 everything that goes<br />through your head.
2525280 2527879 Oh, it’s all right, love.
2528120 2532280 He wanted to know,<br />so we talked about it.
2532479 2535000 He sees things as they are,<br />that one.
2535239 2536280 Oskar was the same.
2536439 2537919 He always spoke his mind.
2538159 2540239 Do you have to keep on<br />bringing him up?
2547080 2548760 Hey, Bugsy.
2550959 2551879 Hey.
2552840 2553840 Hey.
2620439 2621719 Don't come in here!
2635600 2636840 I don't want to buy anything.
2637120 2638479 Are you Amelia Vanek?
2639520 2640120 Yes.
2640320 2642719 I'm Warren Newton, and this<br />is Prue Flannery from the
2642919 2644399 Department of<br />Community Services.
2644600 2646199 My son's only been away<br />for two days.
2646399 2649760 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2649959 2651760 If I could just come in<br />and meet Samuel
2651959 2654080 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2656159 2658760 I'm just in the middle of<br />cleaning up the house
2659000 2660320 at the moment.
2661399 2664840 I'm sorry.<br />There's, um, stuff everywhere.
2668280 2669800 Hello, Samuel.
2670520 2673080 I'm Prue,<br />and this is Warren.
2675239 2676159 How are you?
2676360 2679959 I'm a bit tired from the<br />drugs Mum gave me.
2680600 2682399 Not drugs.<br />Tranquillizers.
2683000 2684360 From the doctor.
2684600 2686320 Oh, he had a fit yesterday.
2686919 2689080 I'm really tired actually.
2689320 2690479 That's no good.
2694280 2696280 May I have a<br />glass of water please?
2697159 2698000 Yes, of course.
2698239 2700120 I'll... get you one.
2708120 2709000 It's a real mess.
2709239 2711560 I just found this<br />cockroach infestation.
2711760 2713239 I normally have<br />the house sprayed.
2713439 2715399 I did actually already<br />have if sprayed,
2715639 2717919 but there's this hole in<br />the wall behind the fridge,
2718159 2719320 and that's why I...
2724679 2727840 I didn’t mean<br />cu hole in the wall.
2728080 2729679 Uh, there was a<br />hole in the wallpaper.
2729879 2732520 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2732760 2734560 We've caught you<br />at a bad time.
2735879 2737360 I'll leave you with this.
2738199 2739879 We're required to<br />come back in a week
2740159 2741439 to talk through<br />your options.
2742399 2743679 Here's my card.
2745639 2746800 Mum.
2747840 2749560 I think I'm gonna vomit.
2770120 2772320 What was that noise I heard?
2772840 2774320 I didn't hear any noise.
2774520 2776800 Yeah, howling, doors<br />slamming.
2777000 2780000 Why, I declare, Bonnie<br />thinks this house is haunted.
2780520 2781479 Mum.
2782879 2784560 I'm gonna go to bed.
2784760 2786120 Are you sick?
2789800 2790959 It's only 6:00.
2791639 2794000 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your Mum for a while?
2794280 2795520 No.
2796239 2798639 If you go to bed now the<br />pills won't work properly.
2803199 2805479 You have to stay up for a while,<br />sweetheart.
2820840 2821879 Where's its mother, Skip?
2822479 2824399 Koalas don"r leave<br />their babies about.
2825120 2826159 Hey, you're still there.
2826360 2827760 Yep, soon as I've fuelled up.
2827959 2829320 Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch<br />on the radio,
2829560 2831760 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2834159 2837479 "And the prince and the<br />princess lived happily together
2837679 2841320 in a beautiful palace for the<br />rest of their days."
2944679 2951800 Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!
2986840 2988479 Where are we going?
2989280 2990639 We're going downstairs.
2990879 2992800 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
3011639 3014399 Iris, Iris, Iris.
3015000 3016360 No.
3065800 3067399 Glass and mirror attachment.
3067639 3069520 Clean and polish<br />shower doors or mirrors
3069760 3071000 for a streak-free shine.
3071280 3072679 As part of this<br />steaming special,
3072919 3074919 we'll even include the<br />garment and uphoIst--
3075879 3077840 I don't want to give it<br />to anyone at work.
3080679 3082560 All right, give<br />all my shifts away.
3082760 3084120 That's just what I need.
3085679 3088800 I can‘t help it if I'm sick.<br />What do you expect me to do?
3089840 3091159 You do that!
3106760 3107800 Mum.
3108080 3110959 I took the pills,<br />but I feel sick again.
3113360 3115120 I need to eat something.
3120439 3122919 I couldn't find any food<br />in the fridge.
3125879 3127919 You said to have them<br />with food.
3129840 3131919 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3132159 3136320 Why do you have to keep<br />talk-talk-talking?
3136560 3138439 Don't you ever stop?
3139760 3142199 - I was just—<br />- I need to sleep!
3143000 3145199 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3145399 3148439 If you're that hungry, why<br />don't you go and eat shit?!
3183199 3184639 I'm so sorry.
3185800 3187159 I don't know why I said that
3187399 3188679 That was terrible.
3189639 3191639 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3193120 3195080 I didn't know what I was saying.
3197199 3199080 I'll cook you something, eh?
3200399 3201679 What would you like?
3201919 3203879 I'm not hungry anymore.
3211159 3212639 We really need to<br />get out of this house.
3212879 3213919 We've been cooped up<br />here too long.
3214159 3215679 That's the problem.
3220239 3221919 Do you want to go to WaIly's?
3222840 3225280 You can have anything you want,<br />all right?
3226439 3229000 Even ice cream for breakfast<br />if you like.
3232159 3233080 Give it back now.
3233280 3234800 - It's mine!<br />- Give it back.
3235000 3237000 Stop it. Sit down.<br />Sit down now.
3238239 3239159 - Now.
3239360 3240560 Give my drink back.
3240760 3241959 Go sit down, please.
3248399 3249879 Where are we going?
3250600 3252439 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3268000 3269120 Mummy!
3270800 3276560 Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!
3284280 3285879 You run straight into me!
3286399 3287919 I just bought this bloody car!
3288199 3289679 What were you thinking?
3290879 3292520 Oh, driving on the<br />wrong side of the road,
3292760 3293800 with a kid in the<br />back!
3294080 3295639 You could've killed someone!
3297760 3299959 Hey!<br />Hey, what are you doing?
3300199 3301840 Hey!<br />Crazy bitch!
3308239 3310159 Hi, sweetheart.
3319520 3320919 Mum?
3322280 3324239 I can call Auntie Claire.
3327800 3330120 I can call and<br />she can come over.
3333959 3335199 Mum?
3336639 3339239 Auntie Claire doesn't want to<br />talk to us anymore.
3341239 3342439 Mum?
3342679 3344000 Mum, look at me.
3371080 3373280 It's nice and warm in here.
3376760 3379080 I don't want you to go away.
3381520 3383399 I'm not going anywhere.
3396000 3397199 Mum?
3405000 3406399 Mum.
3406600 3409120 I don't think we should<br />stay here tonight.
3410560 3412679 I can call Mrs. Roach.
3413479 3415760 I don't want you<br />to call anyone.
3419479 3421600 I just need to sleep.
3426120 3427919 - Mum.<br />- Leave it!
3459159 3461120 There's something in the house.
3476560 3478760 There's someone in the house!
3533239 3534800 Mrs. Roach.
3535080 3536879 Can we come<br />and stay the night?
3546800 3548320 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3548520 3551239 Has someone broken<br />into the house?
3551439 3553719 - Sam said that—<br />- No, no, we're fine.
3553919 3555919 Samuel's just being very<br />disobedient again.
3556159 3558199 Oh.<br />I was so worried.
3558399 3560000 I told him<br />not to call anyone.
3560280 3561560 He asked if you could<br />stay the night.
3561800 3562760 No, no.<br />We're fine.
3563000 3564159 I just had a headache.<br />That's all.
3564399 3566919 I really have to go,<br />though, now, Gracie.
3568199 3569600 I'm so sorry for<br />troubling you.
3569840 3570879 Yes.<br />Talk soon?
3571159 3572679 No worries.<br />Talk soon.
3576159 3577560 I told you not to call anyone,
3577800 3579879 and you deliberately<br />disobeyed me.
3581120 3583199 Do you want to<br />frighten Mrs. Roach,
3583439 3585080 an old lady who<br />can hardly walk?
3585320 3586879 Do you want to make her sick?
3589439 3590919 Get that bloody thing off!
3595919 3598719 Is this the only way<br />I can trust you
3598919 3601959 not to embarrass me<br />in front of our neighbours?
3606959 3608919 Is this what I have to do?
3619919 3620800 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3621000 3623600 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then--
3623800 3626560 - What did you say?<br />- I said the BCIbCldOOk--
3626760 3628320 The Babadook isn't real,<br />Samuel.
3629000 3632080 It's just something you've made<br />up in your stupid little head.
3632280 3634719 I just didn't want you<br />to let it in!
3635399 3640120 I'll make sure nothing gets<br />in tonight, all right, Samuel?
3640320 3643159 Nothing is coming<br />in here tonight.
3643399 3644719 Nothing!
3681479 3683080 I feel sick.
3684159 3687639 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3688639 3689800 Mum, I don't think I need--
3690080 3691639 I am the parent,<br />and you are the child,
3691879 3693320 so take the pill.
3716800 3718239 Good boy.
3741520 3742560 Mum!
3759800 3761360 Hey, Bugsy.
3761719 3763120 Hey, sweetie.
3765560 3768199 Come here, sweetie.<br />Hey.
3769159 3770360 Hey.
3771679 3772919 Hey.
3794280 3795560 Here we go.
3801679 3803199 There's more<br />where that came from.
3817439 3819959 Decide, or we all die.
3822399 3823439 What’s the secret—
3826719 3827919 ...Ietter of Max's,<br />didn't you?
3828159 3829000 No, not for c: minute.
3829239 3830679 Don't lie.<br />You called me Cl Jezebel.
3830879 3832239 - Why?<br />- The north--
3832439 3833560 Natural corset.
3833760 3834760 With fresh meat—
3837719 3838760 Only five in--
3840000 3842879 You don't want to go in there<br />all by yourself, do you?
3844360 3848120 Police say the woman used a<br />kitchen knife to stab her son.
3848320 3850959 His body was found<br />in their basement.
3851199 3853840 The woman later attacked<br />officers with the knife.
3854080 3857399 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3857600 3860959 Little is known about the<br />tragedy but neighbours say
3861199 3863800 boy was celebrating his<br />birthday today.
3864000 3865679 He had just turned seven.
3881120 3882320 Samuel.
3886239 3887760 Wake up, Mummy.
3891479 3893800 But you're the one who's<br />asleep, sweetheart.
3899600 3901120 Don't go down there.
3906479 3908080 It's not safe.
3945679 3947959 I thought you were dead.
3949560 3951320 I thought you were dead.
3966159 3967479 We can be together.
3970479 3972439 You just need to<br />bring me the boy.
3995280 3996879 You mean Samuel?
3998320 4000159 You can bring me the boy.
4002639 4004520 You can bring me the boy.
4006399 4007320 You can bring me the boy.
4007560 4009120 Stop calling him "the boy."
4009840 4011639 I think it's going to rain.
4011840 4013120 No.
4013360 4015280 No. No.
4105680 4108439 It isn't real, it isn't real,<br />it isn't real.
4117879 4120560 Aah! Ohh!
4120759 4124319 Oh, no.<br />Oh, no.
4126959 4128520 No, no.
4135399 4137359 No! No!
4138200 4139319 Bugsy!
4251000 4252080 Samuel!
4258240 4259520 Samuel.
4262959 4264919 Bugsy's hurt,<br />and we need to get help.
4268600 4270640 You don't want him to die,<br />do you?
4274520 4278080 Samuel.<br />Are you listening to me?
4283240 4285120 Let me in, you little shit!
4286839 4289640 Let me in!<br />Let me in!
4289839 4291240 Let me in!
4291759 4293000 Let me in!
4316399 4318319 You little pig!
4319200 4321279 Six years old and<br />you're still wetting yourself!
4322479 4326160 You don't know how many times<br />I wished it was you,
4326359 4327560 not him, that died!
4328200 4329600 I just want you to be happy.
4329839 4332240 ''I just want you<br />to be happy."
4336279 4338000 Sometimes...
4338720 4342919 I just want to smash your head<br />against a brick wall until
4343160 4345279 your fucking brains pop out!
4345520 4346919 You're not my mother.
4348120 4348959 What did you say?
4349200 4351399 I said, you're not my mother!
4351600 4354959 I am your mother!
4357919 4361160 Run, run, run<br />as fast as you can!
4364640 4365759 Get awCIY!
4366080 4368000 Didn't I tell you not to play<br />with weapons?!
4416439 4417600 I'm sorry, love.
4417799 4419000 I know it's late.
4419279 4421839 I just wanted to make sure<br />you were okay.
4422759 4424000 I'm okay.
4425560 4427520 I know...
4427839 4430319 this time of year is<br />terribly hard for you.
4431080 4434600 And I know you don't want me to<br />go on about it, so I won"r.
4435319 4437000 I just wanted you to know that
4437279 4439439 I'd do anything for you and Sam.
4440160 4441359 I love you both.
4445439 4446919 Samuel.
4450399 4451759 I'm sorry.
4454600 4456600 I understand you're scared.
4458279 4460160 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4461240 4462799 I haven’t been good at all.
4466359 4469399 I'm sick, Sam.<br />I need help.
4474479 4476279 I just spoke with Mrs. Roach.
4479839 4481799 We're gonna stay there tonight.
4483959 4485560 Do you want that?
4490000 4492120 I want to make it up to you,<br />Sam.
4504319 4506160 I want you to meet your dad.
4508000 4509720 It's beautiful there.
4512279 4513560 You'll be happy.
4516000 4518160 - Aah!<br />- Unh!
4521120 4522439 Sorry, Mummy!
4542160 4543120 Aah!
4543319 4544240 Unh!
4571680 4574520 Mum!<br />Mum!
4575879 4577080 I'm not leaving you!
4581479 4582720 Mum?
4583200 4584319 Mum?
4590759 4593080 We said we'd protect<br />each other!
4599839 4601439 I know you don't love me.
4603200 4605120 The Babadook won't let you.
4605839 4607479 But I love you, Mum.
4609879 4611399 And I always will.
4621479 4622759 You let it in!
4622959 4624520 You have to get if out!
4629120 4631120 I don't want you to go away!
4632120 4633399 No, Mum, no!
4633640 4634799 NO! Mummy!
4686240 4687560 Mummy!
4688399 4689479 Mummy!
4690319 4691560 Mummy!
4691759 4692600 Mummy!
4692799 4694359 Mummy!
4694560 4696520 Mummy!
4696720 4697680 Mummy!
4735959 4736959 What is if?
4737200 4738919 You can't get rid<br />of the Babadook.
4754839 4755759 Unh!
4756919 4757959 Ohm
4769640 4770600 What do you want?
4773720 4775720 What do you want?!
4813879 4815640 No.
4816399 4817640 Keep breathing.
4821919 4823000 Put your seat back, sweetheart.
4823240 4824680 10 more minutes,<br />and we're there.
4829680 4831080 No.
4836120 4837520 I think it's gonna rain.
4837720 4839319 Stop!
4888240 4889879 You are nothing.
4902759 4903879 You're nothing!
4913680 4915359 This is my house!
4919640 4922799 You are trespassing in my house!
4933640 4937759 If you touch my son again,<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4992399 4993479 Mummy, don't!
4999799 5000879 Don’t!
5107479 5109879 Watch out for your Mum's leg,<br />little one.
5110120 5112080 He's fine.<br />I've had the stitches out.
5112279 5113479 What time's the party?
5113680 5115479 Oh, any time<br />after 3:00 is fine.
5115680 5117680 I'll see you<br />in a few hours then.
5117839 5118959 Bye.
5119240 5120520 Bye, Sam.
5121319 5122720 That school's a good choice.
5122919 5124759 I've been doing a lot of<br />reading about it,
5125000 5126560 so I think Sam will be<br />happy there.
5126759 5128600 He's been out of school<br />over two weeks now.
5128839 5130319 It's time to get back.
5131439 5133680 We needed some time<br />to sort Cl few things out.
5135959 5138919 - Are you having a party?<br />- It's Sam's birthday today.
5139759 5142240 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
5142439 5143479 That's not true.
5143680 5146560 Yes, it is.<br />My first party on the day.
5146799 5148240 That's unusual.
5151799 5154160 My husband died<br />the day that Sam was born.
5154399 5157640 He got killed driving Mum to<br />the hospital to have me.
5159919 5161759 Sam's just like his dad was.
5162200 5163879 Always speaks his mind.
5164279 5167560 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
5168759 5170160 My cousin's not coming
5170399 5172759 because I broke her nose<br />in two places.
5176560 5178279 I'll take that for you.
5197240 5198640 Good shot!
5199279 5200919 Look, there's another one!
5201759 5202959 Where's your bowl?
5206799 5208959 Wow, you've got a lot today!
5210479 5212240 Am I ever going to see it?
5213600 5215680 One day,<br />when you're bigger.
5222439 5223359 You go outside.
5223560 5225919 And you don't come in<br />until I tell you.
5271160 5273879 It's all right!<br />l’r's all right.
5274839 5275919 It's all right.
5276759 5277959 Shh!
5279680 5281120 Shh-shh!
5282680 5283799 Shh-shh!
5285399 5287680 Shh-shh-shh-shh.
5288759 5290120 Shh-shh-shh.
5311399 5312640 How was if?
5313319 5314919 It's pretty quiet today.
5317600 5318720 Come here.
5323120 5325120 It's getting much better,<br />Mum.
5329359 5330399 Wait!
5331359 5332959 I have a new trick.
5336399 5339240 Life is not always as it seems.
5339919 5342479 Nothing in my hands,<br />nothing in my hands.
5347399 5348879 That's great.
5349160 5350479 I haven't finished.
5360120 5362479 Abracadabra!
5365279 5367479 How did you do that?!
5373000 5375359 Come here, you.<br />Come here.
5386600 5388600 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
