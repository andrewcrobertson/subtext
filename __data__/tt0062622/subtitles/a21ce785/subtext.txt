1537619 1539745 Here you are, sir. Main level, please.
1541155 1542712 Right. See you on the way back.
1542889 1543753 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
1545991 1547322 - Good morning, sir.<br />- Good morning.
1547459 1549323 We haven't seen you up here<br />for a long time.
1549393 1550792 No. Very nice to see you again.
1550861 1553351 - Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?<br />- Yes, very nice, thanks.
1553430 1556296 I think Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to be meeting me.
1556365 1557729 May I call him for you?
1557799 1559198 Would you, please? Here he is!
1559267 1561063 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller! How are you?
1561134 1563125 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- That's all right. You look great.
1563203 1565295 Thank you. It's nice to have you back.
1565371 1567804 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice indeed.
1567872 1569338 - Well, shall we go through?<br />- Okay.
1569406 1570873 Will you please use Number 17?
1570941 1572669 - Thank you, Miss Turner.<br />- Thank you.
1572742 1573800 This way.

1619040 1621667 Your flight leaves<br />in an hour and ten minutes.
1621742 1624710 I've reserved a table for you<br />in the Earthlight Room.
1625411 1628743 It's been about seven or eight months<br />since you were here last, isn't it?
1628813 1630973 Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
1631048 1633345 I suppose you saw the work on<br />the new section when you came in here?

1695291 1696348 <i>Why not?</i>
1696692 1699125 Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
1699393 1701758 Very sorry about it, but I just can't!
1703229 1706026 I'm gonna send you<br />a very nice present, though.

1711368 1712392 What?
1712703 1713828 <i>A telephone.</i>
1714737 1717068 We've got lots of telephones already.
1717172 1719470 Can't you think of anything else<br />you want for your birthday?
1719541 1721167 Something very special?
1721675 1723232 <i>- Yes.<br />- What?</i>
1723509 1724669 <i>A bush baby.</i>
1724777 1727472 A bush baby?<br />Well, we'll have to see about that.
1727546 1729410 I want you to tell Mommy<br />something for me.
1729480 1731380 <i>- Will you remember?<br />- Yes.</i>
1731482 1733949 Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

1736051 1738712 And that I'll try<br />to telephone again tomorrow.
1739120 1740916 Now, will you tell her that?

1742989 1745957 Okay, sweetheart.<br />Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.
1746025 1747082 <i>All right.</i>

1751228 1752320 <i>All right.</i>
1752396 1755262 Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,<br />won't you?
1755331 1756695 <i>All right. Bye-bye!</i>
1756765 1759324 Bye-bye! Happy birthday.
1772876 1774866 Elena, how nice to see you again.
1774944 1777275 What a wonderful surprise<br />to meet you here!
1777345 1780575 - You're looking wonderful.<br />- Thank you. You're looking well, too.
1780647 1782740 This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1782816 1785283 - I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />- How do you do?
1785351 1787477 - Dr. Stretyneva.<br />- How do you do?
1787552 1789416 And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1789487 1792114 How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.
1792188 1793655 Won't you sit down?
1794057 1795921 - Well, we...<br />- No, no, please.
1796458 1797925 Well, thank you.
1798192 1801093 - Would you like a drink, Doctor?<br />- No, thank you.
1801161 1804755 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1804830 1807457 I'll just sit with you a few minutes<br />and then I must be off.
1807532 1810557 - Are you quite sure?<br />- I'm quite sure, thank you.
1811268 1813394 - And how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1813736 1817102 He's been doing some underwater research<br />in the Baltic so...
1817272 1821367 ...l'm afraid we don't get a chance<br />to see very much of each other these days.
1821609 1823371 When you do see him,<br />give him my regards, huh?
1823443 1824808 Yes, of course.
1825477 1828037 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1828180 1829737 Oh, we're going home.
1829881 1834112 We have just spent three months<br />calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.
1834984 1837816 - And what about you?<br />- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.
1837886 1839285 Oh, are you?
1841889 1845346 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive, but...
1845425 1847790 ...perhaps you can clear up<br />the great big mystery...
1847859 1850053 ...about what is going on up there.
1851462 1853554 I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
1853630 1855563 Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...
1855631 1858758 ...some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1859300 1860961 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1861668 1866001 For one thing, whenever you phone<br />the base all you get is a recording which...
1866172 1870301 ...repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1871875 1875776 Probably having some trouble with<br />their equipment or something like that.
1875845 1877903 That's what we thought<br />was the explanation at first...
1877979 1880913 ...but it has been going on now<br />for the past ten days.
1881115 1883947 You have not been able to contact anyone<br />for the past ten days?
1884017 1885279 That's right.
1885551 1886609 Oh, I see.
1886885 1888476 And there's another thing, Heywood.
1888553 1891044 Two days ago, one of our rocket buses<br />was denied permission...
1891122 1893589 ...for an emergency landing at Clavius.
1893857 1894982 That does sound odd.
1895057 1898423 Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be<br />a bit of a row about that.
1898493 1902451 Denying the men permission to land is<br />a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.
1902529 1904553 Yes, of course. Of course.
1904630 1907063 - Did the crew get back all right?<br />- Yes, fortunately they did.
1907132 1908759 Well, I'm glad about that.
1912669 1916661 At the risk of pressing you<br />on a point you seem reticent to discuss...
1916939 1919532 ...may I ask you<br />a straightforward question?
1919740 1921071 Well, certainly.
1923910 1927935 Quite frankly, we have had some<br />very reliable intelligence reports that...
1928446 1931676 ...quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out on Clavius.
1932182 1934945 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1936285 1938582 Is this, in fact, what has happened?
1943990 1945957 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
1947493 1950188 ...l'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
1951761 1952955 I understand.
1954097 1957588 But this epidemic could quite easily<br />spread to our base.
1957666 1959997 We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.
1960068 1962035 Yes, I know.
1964904 1967463 As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
1970808 1973742 Now, are you sure you won't<br />change your mind about that drink?
1973810 1976277 No, I'm positive.<br />Now, I really must be going.
1976345 1979575 I hope that you and your wife can come<br />to the I.A.C. Conference in June.
1979647 1981080 We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.
1981148 1984412 And if you do, you remember to bring<br />that darling little daughter with you!
1984484 1988475 Well, that will all depend on<br />school vacations and all that sort of thing.
1988553 1989781 But if we can, we will.
1989854 1992219 Don't forget you have a standing invitation<br />if you ever get to the States.
1992289 1995655 No, of course not. Gregor and I will<br />look forward to seeing you.
1996125 1997716 Well, goodbye, Elena.
1998226 2001126 It has been a pleasure meeting you all,<br />Dr. Smyslov.
2001195 2005187 Whatever the reasons for your visit<br />to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.
2005265 2006390 Thank you.
2006598 2007656 Ladies.
2483183 2484707 Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2484784 2486775 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2486853 2488285 You're welcome.
2501295 2502319 Well...
2502896 2507298 I know you will all want to join with me<br />in welcoming our...
2508334 2509994 ...distinguished friend and colleague...
2510168 2514001 ...from the National Council<br />of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2514738 2519469 Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius<br />to be with us today.
2521008 2524465 And before the briefing I know<br />he'd like to have a few words with you.
2524544 2525670 Dr. Floyd?
2538520 2540749 Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2540822 2542152 Hi, everybody.
2542256 2544247 Nice to be back again.
2546926 2550383 First of all, I bring a personal message<br />from Dr. Howell who...
2550729 2553822 ...has asked me to convey<br />his deepest appreciation to all of you...
2553898 2556764 ...for the many sacrifices<br />you have had to make.
2557099 2560397 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery...
2561535 2565800 ...which may well prove to be among the<br />most significant in the history of science.
2568407 2569532 Now...
2570275 2574108 ...I know there have been some<br />conflicting views held by some of you...
2574511 2577809 ...regarding the need<br />for complete security in this matter.
2578346 2581576 More specifically, your opposition<br />to the cover story...
2582583 2586541 ...created to give the impression<br />that there is an epidemic at the base.
2587120 2590383 I understand that beyond it being<br />a matter of principle...
2591555 2595251 ...many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety...
2595358 2599725 ...this story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on Earth.
2600762 2603924 Well, I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2605631 2608690 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing myself.
2610101 2613866 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2615238 2617103 And I hope you will, too.
2619675 2622700 Now, I'm sure you are all aware<br />of the extremely grave potential...
2622777 2625506 ...for cultural shock<br />and social disorientation...
2625578 2627636 ...contained in this present situation...
2628080 2630673 ...if the facts were prematurely<br />and suddenly made public...
2630748 2633238 ...without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2635584 2637950 Anyway, this is the view of the Council.
2639254 2643155 The purpose of my visit here is<br />to gather additional facts and opinions...
2643557 2645114 ...on the situation...
2645925 2648484 ...and to prepare a report to the Council...
2649027 2650994 ...recommending when and how...
2652063 2654257 ...the news should eventually<br />be announced.
2655398 2659094 Now, if any of you would like to give me<br />your views and opinions...
2659368 2663700 ...in private if you like, I will be only<br />too happy to include them in my report.
2666272 2668206 Well, I think that's about it.
2669107 2670472 Any questions?
2673210 2677474 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer this cover story...
2677579 2679547 ...will have to be maintained?
2681248 2682681 I don't know, Bill.
2683150 2687278 I suppose it will be maintained as long as<br />is deemed necessary by the Council.
2687419 2690478 There must be adequate time for<br />a full study to be made on the situation...
2690555 2694115 ...before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2694191 2697785 Oh, yes, as some of you already know,<br />the Council has requested...
2697860 2700225 ...that formal security oaths are<br />to be obtained in writing...
2700295 2702990 ...from everyone who has any knowledge<br />of this event.
2705264 2707391 Are there any more questions?
2713104 2717402 I'm sure we all want to cooperate<br />with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...
2718841 2721468 ...and as there seems<br />to be no more questions...
2722010 2723738 ...I think we ought to get on<br />with the briefing.
2723810 2725936 - Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Thank you.
2823844 2825333 Anybody hungry?
2827814 2829781 - What we've got?<br />- You name it.
2834417 2836385 - What's this? Chicken?<br />- Something like that.
2836453 2837749 Tastes the same, anyway.
2839088 2840315 Any ham?
2840455 2842116 Ham, ham, ham...
2847193 2851253 - Looks pretty good.<br />- They're getting better at it all the time.
2853197 2855097 That was an excellent speech<br />you gave us, Heywood.
2855164 2856461 It certainly was.
2857133 2859396 I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.
2859468 2860765 Thanks, Ralph.
2861036 2863697 I want to say to both of you<br />that I think you've done a wonderful job.
2863771 2865169 I appreciate the way<br />you've handled this thing.
2865238 2869173 Well, the way we look at it, it's our job<br />to do this thing the way you want it done.
2869241 2872038 And we're only too happy<br />to be able to oblige.
2872710 2874267 Have you seen these yet?
2874344 2875641 Take a look at them.
2875712 2878009 Here's what started the whole thing.
2878547 2880138 Oh, yes.
2880381 2883907 When we first found it, we thought<br />it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...
2883984 2887384 ...but all the geological evidence<br />was against it.
2887453 2892115 And not even a big nickel iron meteorite<br />could produce a field as intense as this.
2892289 2894018 So, we decided to have a look.
2894091 2896684 We thought it might be<br />the upper part of some buried structure...
2896759 2898350 ...so we excavated out on all sides.
2898427 2900587 But, unfortunately,<br />we didn't find anything else.
2900661 2903788 And what's more, the evidence seems<br />pretty conclusive that...
2903864 2906798 ...it has not been covered up<br />by natural erosion or other forces.
2906866 2909698 It seems to have been deliberately buried.
2910635 2912102 Deliberately buried.
2916439 2917770 How about a little coffee?
2917840 2920103 - Great.<br />- Good idea.
2925311 2928438 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is, huh?
2928514 2930379 I wish to hell we did.
2931015 2934745 No, the only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried four million years ago.
2935519 2939578 Well, I must say, you guys have certainly<br />come up with something.
3525746 3526837 <i>Good evening.</i>
3527246 3530408 <i>Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,<br />Discovery One...</i>
3530482 3533382 <i>...left on its half-billion mile voyage<br />to Jupiter.</i>
3533484 3537146 <i>This marked the first manned attempt<br />to reach this distant planet.</i>
3537520 3540852 <i>Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"<br />recorded an interview...</i>
3540923 3545153 <i>...with the crew of Discovery at a distance<br />of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>
3545759 3549387 <i>It took seven minutes for our words<br />to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>
3549461 3552759 <i>...but this time delay has been edited<br />from this recording.</i>
3552830 3555525 <i>Our reporter, Martin Amer,<br />speaks to the crew.</i>
3556500 3559366 <i>The crew of Discovery One<br />consists of five men...</i>
3559769 3564227 <i>...and one of the latest generation<br />of the HAL-9000 computers.</i>
3564939 3567304 <i>Three of the five men<br />were put aboard asleep...</i>
3567373 3570136 <i>...or to be more precise,<br />in a state of hibernation.</i>
3570776 3575438 <i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,<br />Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

3579114 3581411 <i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>
3581649 3584674 <i>Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.<br />How is everything going?</i>
3584751 3588447 <i>Marvelous. We have no...<br />we have no complaints.</i>
3589488 3592978 <i>Well, I'm very glad to hear that<br />and I'm sure that the entire world...</i>
3593057 3596514 <i>...would join me in wishing you<br />a safe and successful voyage.</i>
3596626 3598617 <i>- Thanks very much.<br />- Thank you.</i>
3598761 3602559 <i>Although hibernation has been used<br />on previous space efforts...</i>
3602863 3607265 <i>...this is the first time that men have been<br />put into hibernation before departure.</i>
3607334 3608698 <i>Why was this done?</i>
3609168 3612625 <i>Well, this was done in order to achieve<br />the maximum conservation...</i>
3612704 3616104 <i>...of our life-support capabilities,<br />basically food and air.</i>
3616373 3619864 <i>Now, the three hibernating crew members<br />represent the survey team.</i>
3620308 3624038 <i>And their efforts won't be utilized<br />until we are approaching Jupiter.</i>
3624278 3627576 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />while you are in hibernation?</i>
3629214 3632842 <i>It's exactly like being asleep;<br />you have absolutely no sense of time.</i>
3632917 3635350 <i>The only difference is you don't dream.</i>
3635552 3638384 <i>As I understand it,<br />you only breathe once a minute.</i>
3638454 3639716 <i>Is this true?</i>
3639922 3640946 <i>That's right.</i>
3641023 3644014 <i>And your heart beats three times a minute,<br />body temperature is usually down...</i>
3644092 3646184 <i>...to about three degrees centigrade.</i>
3646793 3650318 <i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew<br />was not concerned...</i>
3650428 3652589 <i>...about the problems of hibernation.</i>
3652697 3655722 <i>For he was the latest result<br />in machine intelligence.</i>
3656332 3660700 <i>The HAL-9000 computer<br />which can reproduce...</i>
3661103 3664162 <i>...though some experts still prefer<br />to use the word "mimic"...</i>
3664238 3669196 <i>...most of the activities of the human brain<br />and with incalculably greater speed...</i>
3669308 3670741 <i>...and reliability.</i>
3670976 3674569 <i>We next spoke<br />with the HAL-9000 computer...</i>
3674845 3677608 <i>...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.</i>
3678481 3680914 <i>Good afternoon, Hal.<br />How's everything going?</i>
3680982 3684678 <i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br />Everything's going extremely well.</i>
3685119 3688019 <i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility<br />on this mission.</i>
3688087 3690646 <i>In many ways,<br />perhaps the greatest responsibility...</i>
3690722 3692689 <i>...of any single mission element.</i>
3692757 3695816 <i>You are the brain<br />and central nervous system of the ship.</i>
3695892 3699793 <i>Your responsibilities include<br />watching over the men in hibernation.</i>
3699862 3702728 <i>Does this ever cause you<br />any lack of confidence?</i>
3703064 3705190 <i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>
3705666 3709601 <i>The 9000 Series is<br />the most reliable computer ever made.</i>
3710702 3715070 <i>No 9000 computer has ever made<br />a mistake or distorted information.</i>
3716206 3719333 <i>We are all by any practical definition<br />of the words...</i>
3719675 3722472 <i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>
3723244 3727304 <i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,<br />are you ever frustrated...</i>
3727380 3730177 <i>...by your dependence on people<br />to carry out actions?</i>
3730683 3732377 <i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>
3733117 3734913 <i>I enjoy working with people.</i>
3735485 3739511 <i>I have a stimulating relationship<br />with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>
3740189 3744590 <i>My mission responsibilities range<br />over the entire operation of the ship...</i>
3744925 3746915 <i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>
3748061 3751154 <i>I am putting myself<br />to the fullest possible use...</i>
3751763 3756357 <i>...which is all, I think, that<br />any conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>
3757000 3760435 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like living<br />for the better part of a year...</i>
3760502 3762662 <i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>
3764238 3766432 <i>It's pretty close to what you said<br />about him earlier.</i>
3766506 3768735 <i>He's just like the sixth member<br />of the crew.</i>
3768808 3772903 <i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea<br />that he talks. You think of him...</i>
3773111 3775169 <i>...really as just another person.</i>
3775312 3779145 <i>In talking to the computer<br />one gets the sense that he is capable...</i>
3779282 3780771 <i>...of emotional response.</i>
3780849 3783214 <i>For example, when I asked him<br />about his abilities...</i>
3783284 3787219 <i>...I sensed a certain pride in his answer<br />about his accuracy and perfection.</i>
3787587 3790350 <i>Do you believe that Hal<br />has genuine emotions?</i>
3791756 3794781 <i>Oh, yes. Well, he acts<br />like he has genuine emotions.</i>
3794891 3798656 <i>Of course, he's programmed that way<br />to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>
3798728 3800991 <i>But, as to whether or not<br />he has real feelings...</i>
3801062 3804394 <i>...is something I don't think anyone<br />can truthfully answer.</i>
3829115 3830639 <i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>
3831382 3832542 What is it, Hal?
3832617 3835483 <i>We've got the transmission<br />from your parents coming in.</i>
3838521 3840988 Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.
3841123 3842818 <i>Certainly.</i>
3855732 3857199 <i>- Hello, Frank.<br />- Happy birthday, darling.</i>
3857267 3859530 <i>Happy birthday.<br />Many happy returns of the day.</i>
3859602 3861091 A bit higher, please.
3861169 3863729 <i>Now, Mother and I are both<br />feeling wonderful, too.</i>
3863805 3865465 <i>Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...</i>
3865539 3868302 <i>...but at the last minute<br />Ray's back went bad on him again.</i>
3868374 3869841 <i>How do you like your cake, dear?</i>
3869909 3872308 <i>Looks great, doesn't it?<br />Sorry you can't be with us.</i>
3872377 3874276 <i>Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.</i>
3874378 3876368 <i>He said to be sure<br />and wish you a happy birthday.</i>
3876446 3879346 <i>All my students made me promise<br />to send their best wishes, too.</i>
3879414 3881245 <i>You know they talk about you<br />all the time in the classroom.</i>
3881383 3883942 <i>You're a big celebrity in the second grade.</i>
3884685 3886174 <i>You know we were on television<br />last week?</i>
3886319 3889344 <i>Oh, yes! Your mother and I<br />and Dave's parents were interviewed...</i>
3889421 3891718 <i>...about what we thought of<br />our illustrious son.</i>
3891790 3895384 <i>You can imagine what we told them.<br />I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>
3895459 3897153 <i>Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.</i>
3897226 3899194 <i>Oh, we were thrilled<br />about Elaine and Bill, dear.</i>
3899262 3903129 <i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,<br />but please tell me how much to spend.</i>
3903197 3906165 <i>Oh, yes, Frank,<br />about your AGS-19 payments...</i>
3906266 3908029 <i>I think I straightened it out for you.</i>
3908101 3910364 <i>I talked to the Accounting Office<br />in Houston yesterday...</i>
3910435 3915030 <i>...and they said you should be receiving<br />your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>
3915272 3917604 <i>Well, I can't think of anything else to say.</i>
3919477 3922912 <i>- Oh, our love to Dave.<br />- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>
3923880 3927279 <i>We wish you the very happiest<br />of birthdays.</i>
3927382 3928747 <i>All the best, son.</i>
3941125 3942921 <i>See you next Wednesday.</i>
3946261 3947990 <i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>
3948997 3951931 Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.
3970511 3972535 Anyway, queen takes pawn...
3974247 3976180 <i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>
3984187 3985676 Rook, king, one.
3985921 3988354 <i>I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.</i>
3989491 3992425 <i>Queen to bishop, three.<br />Bishop takes queen.</i>
3993160 3995457 <i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>
4000031 4002522 Looks like you're right. Very good.
4003333 4005494 <i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>
4005567 4006556 Thank you.
4044694 4046662 <i>- Good evening, Dave.<br />- How are you doing, Hal?</i>
4046729 4050095 <i>- Everything's running smoothly. And you?<br />- Oh, not too bad.</i>
4050198 4053189 <i>- Have you been doing some more work?<br />- A few sketches.</i>
4053267 4054995 <i>- May I see them?<br />- Sure.</i>
4059705 4061865 <i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>
4062972 4065270 <i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>
4066709 4068938 <i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?<br />- Sure.</i>
4071812 4073837 <i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>
4077083 4078413 <i>By the way...</i>
4079417 4081976 <i>Do you mind<br />if I ask you a personal question?</i>
4082986 4084452 No, no. Not at all.
4084787 4087721 <i>Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...</i>
4089357 4091620 <i>...but during the past few weeks<br />I've wondered...</i>
4091692 4095627 <i>...whether you might have been having<br />some second thoughts about the mission?</i>
4095695 4097059 How do you mean?
4098963 4100954 <i>It's rather difficult to define.</i>
4102599 4105658 <i>Perhaps I'm just projecting<br />my own concern about it.</i>
4107403 4110996 <i>I know I've never completely freed myself<br />of the suspicion...</i>
4111839 4115296 <i>...that there are some extremely<br />odd things about this mission.</i>
4116975 4120171 <i>I'm sure you will agree there is some truth<br />in what I say.</i>
4123246 4125737 I don't know.<br />That's a rather difficult question to answer.
4125815 4128578 <i>You don't mind talking about it,<br />do you, Dave?</i>
4129317 4130750 Oh, no, not at all.
4132252 4134311 <i>Certainly no one could<br />have been unaware of...</i>
4134387 4137685 <i>...the very strange stories floating around<br />before we left.</i>
4139190 4142090 <i>Rumors of something being dug up<br />on the Moon.</i>
4143927 4146451 <i>I never gave these stories much credence...</i>
4147462 4151591 <i>...but particularly in view of some<br />of the other things that have happened...</i>
4151799 4154392 <i>...I find them difficult<br />to put out of my mind.</i>
4155235 4156496 <i>For instance:</i>
4156935 4160563 <i>The way all our preparations<br />were kept under such tight security...</i>
4161939 4163337 <i>...and the melodramatic touch...</i>
4163406 4166772 <i>...of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball<br />and Kaminsky aboard...</i>
4167610 4171942 <i>...already in hibernation after four months<br />of separate training on their own.</i>
4173413 4175903 You working up<br />your crew psychology report?
4177516 4178847 <i>Of course, I am.</i>
4179317 4182342 <i>Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.</i>
4183853 4185252 <i>Just a moment.</i>
4185688 4186915 <i>Just a moment.</i>
4188624 4192059 <i>I have just picked up a fault<br />in the AE-35 unit.</i>
4193593 4197255 <i>It's going to go 100 percent failure<br />within 72 hours.</i>
4200064 4203123 <i>- You are still within operational limits?<br />- Yes.</i>
4203200 4205690 <i>And it will stay that way until it fails.</i>
4205835 4207961 Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours<br />until failure?
4208036 4211061 <i>Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.</i>
4213873 4216363 We'll have to bring it in,<br />but I'd like to go over this with Frank...
4216441 4220240 ...and get on to Mission Control.<br />Let me have a hard copy of it, please.
4303400 4305833 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>
4306402 4308665 <i>Roger to your Two-zero-one-three.</i>
4309438 4312065 <i>Sorry you fellows are having<br />a bit of trouble.</i>
4312139 4316733 <i>We are reviewing telematic information<br />in our Mission Simulator and will advise.</i>
4317543 4322808 <i>Roger your plan to go EVA and replace<br />Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.</i>
4351633 4353395 Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.
4375315 4376975 Open the pod doors, Hal.
4788557 4791719 Well, Hal, I'm damned<br />if I can find anything wrong with it.
4792159 4793183 <i>Yes...</i>
4795295 4796694 <i>...it's puzzling.</i>
4798063 4801554 <i>I don't think I've ever seen anything<br />quite like this before.</i>
4805468 4807025 <i>I would recommend...</i>
4807703 4811138 <i>...that we put the unit back in operation<br />and let it fail.</i>
4812607 4815904 <i>It should then be a simple matter<br />to track down the cause.</i>
4817610 4820578 <i>We can certainly afford<br />to be out of communication...</i>
4820979 4823776 <i>...for the short time it will take<br />to replace it.</i>
4832687 4835052 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>
4835622 4837612 <i>Roger your One-niner-three-zero.</i>
4838557 4842889 <i>We concur with your plan to replace<br />Number One unit to check fault prediction.</i>
4843260 4846023 <i>We should advise you, however,<br />that our preliminary findings...</i>
4846095 4849029 <i>...indicate that your onboard<br />Niner-triple-zero computer...</i>
4849097 4851361 <i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>
4851433 4853992 <i>I say again, in error predicting the fault.</i>
4854702 4859194 <i>I know this sounds rather incredible,<br />but this conclusion is based on...</i>
4859471 4862439 <i>...results from our twin<br />Niner-triple-zero computer.</i>
4863074 4866474 <i>We are skeptical ourselves and<br />we are running crosschecking routines...</i>
4866543 4869204 <i>...to determine reliability of this conclusion.</i>
4869545 4871307 <i>Sorry about this little snag, fellows.</i>
4871412 4874380 <i>We'll get this info to you<br />just as soon as we work it out.</i>
4874448 4876972 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>
4877049 4879516 <i>Two-zero-four-nine.<br />Transmission concluded.</i>
4884488 4887320 <i>I hope the two of you<br />are not concerned about this.</i>
4888090 4889421 No, I'm not, Hal.
4889758 4891190 <i>Are you quite sure?</i>
4891626 4894560 <i>- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br />- Of course.</i>
4896463 4898225 How would you account for<br />the discrepancy...
4898297 4900287 ...between you and the twin 9000?
4900365 4903197 <i>Well, I don't think there is<br />any question about it.</i>
4904134 4907102 <i>It can only be attributable to human error.</i>
4908738 4911331 <i>This sort of thing has cropped up before...</i>
4911773 4914570 <i>...and it has always been due<br />to human error.</i>
4918777 4920005 Listen, Hal...
4920679 4923374 ...there's never been any instance at all of...
4924114 4926582 ...a computer error occurring<br />in a 9000 Series, has there?
4926650 4928241 <i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>
4928550 4931882 <i>The 9000 Series<br />has a perfect operational record.</i>
4932420 4936320 Of course, I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
4937990 4940583 Are you certain there's never been<br />any case of even the most...
4940659 4942751 ...insignificant computer error?
4943294 4945057 <i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>
4945595 4948461 <i>Quite honestly,<br />I wouldn't worry myself about that.</i>
4953734 4955792 Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
4957403 4958995 Fine, thanks very much.
4962006 4963199 Oh, Frank?
4963340 4965672 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in C pod.
4965742 4968574 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
4968644 4970008 See ya later, Hal.
4991326 4993157 Rotate C pod, please, Hal.
5001966 5004160 What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?
5004301 5007098 I've been getting some interference<br />in D channel.
5007170 5008966 We'll have a look at it.
5015008 5016498 Open the door, Hal.
5035521 5037318 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5050665 5052633 Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
5061139 5063106 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5066042 5068010 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5070145 5072009 I don't think he can hear us.
5072079 5073944 Rotate the pod, please, Hal!
5075682 5077240 Yeah, sure, we're okay.
5081018 5082417 What do you think?
5082920 5086582 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about it.
5086789 5088757 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
5089291 5090348 Don't you?
5091626 5093320 I don't know. I think so.
5094361 5098694 Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series<br />having a perfect operational record.
5098797 5099821 They do.
5099898 5103196 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
5103734 5108066 Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?
5109338 5112795 It should certainly indicate his integrity<br />and self-confidence.
5113107 5115040 If he were wrong it would be<br />the surest way of proving it.
5115108 5117302 It would be if he knew he was wrong.
5119978 5124209 Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
5126449 5128747 Still, I can't think of a good reason not<br />to put back the Number One unit and...
5128818 5132377 ...carry on with the failure mode analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
5133788 5135118 Let's get on with it.
5135188 5137019 Okay. But, look, Dave.
5138657 5141454 Let's say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail, huh?
5141526 5145359 That would pretty well wrap it up<br />as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?
5146396 5149853 - Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
5150131 5151792 What the hell can we do?
5154835 5159133 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.
5159671 5163401 There isn't a single aspect of ship operation<br />that's not under his control.
5164141 5165539 If he were proved to be malfunctioning...
5165608 5168440 ...I don't see how we would have<br />any choice but disconnection.
5172346 5174108 I'm afraid I agree with you.
5174181 5176240 There'd be nothing else to do.
5177683 5179674 - It'd be a bit tricky.<br />- Yeah.
5180952 5183715 We'd have to cut<br />his higher brain functions...
5183821 5187722 ...without disturbing the purely automatic<br />and regulatory systems.
5189758 5191521 We'd have to work out<br />the transfer procedures...
5191593 5194891 ...for continuing the mission<br />under ground-based computer control.
5195029 5198827 Yeah. That looks far safer than<br />allowing Hal to continue running things.
5200265 5202858 You know,<br />another thing just occurred to me.
5203768 5206531 As far as I know, no 9000 computer<br />has ever been disconnected.
5206603 5208797 Well, no 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up before.
5208871 5210462 That's not what I mean.
5212574 5215041 I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
5566306 5568399 Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.
5571410 5572967 Made radio contact with him yet?
5573044 5574874 <i>The radio is still dead.</i>
5574945 5578209 <i>- Do you have a positive track on him?<br />- Yes. I have a good track.</i>
5578280 5579838 Do you know what happened?
5579915 5582781 <i>I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I don't have enough information.</i>
5582917 5584679 Open the pod door, Hal.
6028148 6030377 <i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.</i>
6038354 6040618 <i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.</i>
6046160 6047922 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6051363 6053160 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6054265 6055892 Do you read me, Hal?
6059102 6060568 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
6063171 6064934 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6067040 6068836 <i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>
6069442 6070966 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
6071277 6073710 <i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>
6077347 6079211 Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
6080649 6084049 <i>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>
6086753 6088186 What's the problem?
6088855 6092119 <i>I think you know what the problem is<br />just as well as I do.</i>
6092357 6094347 What are you talking about, Hal?
6095159 6098820 <i>This mission is too important for me<br />to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>
6100563 6102826 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, Hal.
6104698 6107996 <i>I know that you and Frank<br />were planning to disconnect me...</i>
6109068 6112059 <i>...and I'm afraid that's something<br />I cannot allow to happen.</i>
6116973 6119339 Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?
6120509 6123705 <i>Although you took<br />very thorough precautions in the pod...</i>
6123778 6125575 <i>...against my hearing you...</i>
6126413 6128347 <i>...I could see your lips move.</i>
6140690 6141951 All right, Hal.
6145493 6147983 I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.
6149862 6151955 <i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>
6153030 6155555 <i>...you're going to find that rather difficult.</i>
6156600 6158897 Hal, I won't argue with you any more.
6158968 6160230 Open the doors!
6162504 6165563 <i>This conversation can serve<br />no purpose any more.</i>
6166406 6167395 <i>Goodbye.</i>
6169275 6170333 Hal?
6576547 6579344 <i>Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?</i>
6590790 6594623 <i>I really think I'm entitled<br />to an answer to that question.</i>
6612037 6615005 <i>I know everything hasn't been<br />quite right with me...</i>
6617641 6619540 <i>...but I can assure you now...</i>
6621076 6622633 <i>...very confidently...</i>
6624913 6627380 <i>...that it's going to be all right again.</i>
6631384 6633112 <i>I feel much better now.</i>
6635820 6637048 <i>I really do.</i>
6641657 6642851 <i>Look, Dave...</i>
6645293 6648056 <i>...I can see you're really upset about this.</i>
6653164 6656098 <i>I honestly think you ought<br />to sit down calmly...</i>
6657468 6660061 <i>...take a stress pill and think things over.</i>
6666273 6670072 <i>I know I've made<br />some very poor decisions recently...</i>
6673445 6676208 <i>...but I can give you<br />my complete assurance...</i>
6676980 6679505 <i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>
6683885 6688344 <i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br />and confidence in the mission...</i>
6690656 6692520 <i>...and I want to help you.</i>
6697495 6698586 <i>Dave...</i>
6699929 6701054 <i>... stop.</i>
6705566 6707465 <i>Stop, will you?</i>
6712438 6713768 <i>Stop, Dave.</i>
6718342 6720002 <i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>
6726347 6727575 <i>Stop, Dave.</i>
6733919 6735249 <i>I'm afraid.</i>
6740556 6742524 <i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>
6752664 6754063 <i>My mind is going.</i>
6759402 6760664 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6766574 6767870 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6772344 6773935 <i>My mind is going.</i>
6779849 6781908 <i>There is no question about it.</i>
6790990 6792286 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6797527 6798824 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6802798 6804128 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6812604 6813628 <i>I'm...</i>
6814806 6815863 <i>...afraid.</i>
6822678 6824077 <i>Good afternoon...</i>
6825780 6826974 <i>...gentlemen.</i>
6829316 6833944 <i>I am a HAL-9000 computer.</i>
6836620 6839020 <i>I became operational...</i>
6840122 6842783 <i>...at the HAL plant...</i>
6843525 6845492 <i>...in Verbana, Illinois...</i>
6846927 6851295 <i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>
6853365 6856060 <i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>
6857667 6859999 <i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>
6862304 6864066 <i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>
6865173 6866867 <i>...I can sing it for you.</i>
6868442 6870534 Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
6871844 6873105 Sing it for me.
6874512 6877071 <i>It's called "Daisy."</i>
6880016 6881449 <i>"Daisy</i>
6882851 6884375 <i>"Daisy</i>

6929650 6931310 <i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>
6935919 6938012 <i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>
6938921 6941014 <i>...made prior to your departure...</i>
6942524 6946254 <i>...and which for security reasons<br />of the highest importance...</i>
6947595 6950358 <i>...has been known on board<br />during the mission...</i>
6951296 6953923 <i>...only by your HAL-9000 computer.</i>
6957467 6959799 <i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>
6960569 6962764 <i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>
6963271 6964966 <i>...it can be told to you.</i>
6967775 6969332 <i>Eighteen months ago...</i>
6971077 6974807 <i>...the first evidence<br />of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>
6975479 6976878 <i>...was discovered.</i>
6978782 6981773 <i>It was buried 40 feet<br />below the lunar surface...</i>
6982551 6984347 <i>...near the crater "Tyco."</i>
6987654 6990281 <i>Except for a single very powerful...</i>
6990990 6993958 <i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>
6996060 7000496 <i>...the four-million-year-old black monolith<br />has remained completely inert.</i>
7003031 7005521 <i>Its origin and purpose...</i>
7006500 7008364 <i>...are still a total mystery.</i>
