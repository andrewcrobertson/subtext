74908 76993 Well, my dad was a farmer.
78162 80621 Um, like everybody else back then.
82750 84917 Of course, he didn't start that way.
91216 93136 Computer says you're too tight.
93302 95845 - Nah, I got this.<br />- Crossing the Straights.
98265 100016 - Shutting it down, Cooper.<br />- No!
101518 103936 - Shutting it all down.<br />- No, I need power up!
108275 109317 Dad?
115866 118367 Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
118702 121204 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
122873 124874 There are no such things as ghosts, babe.
125042 127210 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128629 133382 Maybe that's because Grandpa's<br />close to being one himself. Back to bed.
133717 135551 Were you dreaming about the crash?
136970 139263 Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.
166291 167792 The wheat had died.
168627 170962 The blight came and we had to burn it.
171880 174590 And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.
174758 177009 But, uh, mostly we had dust.
179429 182056 I guess I can't describe<br />it. It was just constant.
182224 186102 Just that steady blow... of dirt.
188188 191274 We wore, um, little strips of sheet...
191441 194151 sometimes over our nose and mouth...
194319 196821 so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
198532 201033 When we set the table,<br />we always set the plate...
201201 204120 upside-down. Glasses<br />or cups, whatever it was...
204288 205454 upside-down.
210878 213129 Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!
213297 216757 Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in<br />the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101.
216925 218426 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
219970 221637 Not at the table, Murph.
222389 224223 Dad, can you fix this?
225809 227169 What the heck did you do...
227311 228477 - to my lander?<br />- Wasn't me.
228645 230521 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
230689 233024 It knocked it off. It<br />keeps knocking books off.
233191 234711 No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
234860 235380 Hey.
235392 236986 I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
237154 238404 Dad, tell her.
238572 240489 Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.
240657 242992 You said science was about<br />admitting what we don't know.
243160 245328 - She's got you there.<br />- Hey.
245495 246996 Start looking after our stuff.
248624 249832 Coop.
252628 254795 All right, Murph, you want to talk science?
255756 259008 Don't tell me you're afraid of some<br />ghost. No, you got to go further.
259176 262345 You got to record the facts,<br />analyze, get to the how and the why...
262512 265431 then present your conclusions. Deal?
266099 267516 - Deal.<br />- All right.
270354 272521 - Have a good day at school.<br />- Hold up.
272856 275149 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
275317 277276 Not grandparent.
279529 281364 Slow down, turbo!
282699 285826 - That's not a dust storm.<br />- Nelson's torching his whole crop.
285994 287370 Blight?
287537 289956 They're saying it's the<br />last harvest for okra.
290624 291791 Ever.
293710 296337 He should've planted<br />corn like the rest of us.
296505 299215 Now, be nice to that<br />Miss Hanley. She's single.
299383 300883 What's that supposed to mean?
301051 304178 Repopulating the earth. Start<br />pulling your weight, young man.
304346 308307 Why don't you start minding<br />your own business, old man?
315607 317274 All right, Murph, give me second.
318902 320111 Uh-huh.
320696 322071 Third.
323615 325282 - Find a gear, dumb-ass.<br />- Grind it!
325450 326492 Shut it, Tom!
327869 330204 - What'd you do, Murph?<br />- Ah, she didn't do nothing.
330372 332873 - Blew a tire is all.<br />- Murphy's Law.
333709 335042 Shut up!
335210 336961 - Grab the spare, Tom.<br />- That is the spare.
339589 341090 Get the patch kit!
342384 345594 How am I supposed to patch it out here?<br />COOPER: You got to figure it out.
345762 347722 I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
356148 357898 What's going on, Murph?
358066 361277 Why did you and Mom name<br />me after something that's bad?
361445 362820 We didn't.
363196 364697 Murphy's Law?
365657 369744 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
369911 373289 What it means is whatever<br />can happen will happen.
373457 376000 And that sounded just fine with us.
380213 381756 Whoa!
382340 383632 Get in.
385010 386427 Get in, let's go.
387763 389889 What about the flat tire?
392851 394185 Yeah.
408158 412161 It's an Indian Air Force drone.<br />Solar cells could power an entire farm.
412329 413788 Take the wheel, Tom.
419252 420586 Go, go, go!
422172 423839 Keep that aimed right at it.
431765 434183 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
434851 435893 Right at it.
437395 438437 Stay on it.
440023 441107 Here we go.
444027 445236 Whoa.
450367 451951 Nice one, Tom.
458416 459792 Dad?
460210 462962 I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!
463421 464463 Dad!
464798 466006 Tom!
470554 472888 You told me to keep driving.
473723 478185 Well, I guess that answers the old "if I<br />asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.
481398 484233 - We lost it.<br />- No, we didn't.
496913 498581 Want to give it a whirl?
504588 505963 This way.
511344 512428 Go.
513430 516432 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
520729 522438 Nicely done.
525442 527318 How long you think it's been up there?
527485 530029 Delhi Mission Control<br />went down, same as ours...
530197 532031 - ten years ago.<br />- Heh.
532365 534283 So for ten years?
537245 539872 - Why did it come down so low?<br />- I don't know.
540040 542958 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543126 545377 - What?<br />- Give me a large flatblade.
545795 548464 Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.
553720 555221 What are you gonna do with it?
556139 559308 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560185 561518 like drive a combine.
562103 563604 Can't we just let it go?
565899 567566 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569236 571737 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph...
572030 573530 like the rest of us.
578119 579839 How's this work? You guys come with?
579996 581038 I've got class.
581456 583832 This one needs to wait.
585377 588170 - What did you do?<br />- They'll tell you about it in there.
588338 590506 - Am I gonna be mad?<br />- Not with me.
590674 593842 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
595262 596595 I got this.
600850 602142 Little late, Coop.
602310 603852 Yeah, we had a flat.
604020 607564 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
607857 611443 No, actually, sir, that's<br />a surveillance drone.
611611 614363 With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
614781 616115 Take a seat.
617242 618742 So, uh...
619452 622037 we got Tom's scores back.
622580 624540 He's going to make an excellent farmer.
624708 628210 Yeah, he's got a knack<br />for it. What about college?
628378 632131 The university only takes a handful.<br />They don't have the resources to...
632299 634591 I still pay my taxes.
634759 636760 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637262 639596 Well, it doesn't go to the university.
640181 641807 Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
641975 644768 You're ruling my son out for college now?
645312 648814 - The kid's 15.<br />- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649816 651984 What's your waistline? About what, 32?
652402 653502 About a 33 inseam?
653514 656071 I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
656239 660659 It takes two numbers to measure your ass<br />but only one to measure my son's future?
661536 664413 Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.
664581 666540 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
667042 671795 Okay, well, right now we<br />don't need more engineers.
672255 676592 We didn't run out of television<br />screens and planes. We ran out of food.
676926 680346 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680513 682890 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
683808 687728 We're a caretaker generation,<br />Coop. And things are getting better.
687896 689925 Maybe your grandkids<br />will get to be engin...
689937 691023 Are we done here, sir?
692317 693400 No.
694235 696403 Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
696738 699281 Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.
699449 701700 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701868 705245 She brought this in to show the students.<br />The section on the lunar landings.
705413 707915 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
708375 710376 She always loved the pictures.
710543 714254 It's an old federal textbook. We've<br />replaced them with the corrected versions.
714422 715464 Corrected?
715632 719760 Explaining how the Apollo missions<br />were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726476 728435 You don't believe we went to the moon?
729562 731563 It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
731731 734566 The Soviets bankrupted<br />themselves pouring resources...
734734 736985 into rockets and other useless machines.
737153 738237 "Useless machines."
738405 742491 If we don't want a repeat of the excess and<br />wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
742659 746453 we need to teach our kids about<br />this planet, not tales of leaving it.
747288 751291 One of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
751668 755003 If we had any of those left, the<br />doctors would've been able to find...
755171 758924 the cyst in my wife's brain before<br />she died instead of afterwards.
759092 762177 Then she'd have been the one<br />listening to this instead of me...
762345 765431 which would have been a good<br />thing, because she was always...
766015 767516 the calmer one.
768184 770269 I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
771521 775190 But Murph got into a fistfight with<br />several of her classmates over this...
775358 777025 Apollo nonsense.
777193 779653 So we thought it best to bring<br />you in and see what ideas...
779821 782489 you might have for dealing with<br />her behavior on the home front.
783700 786743 Yeah, you know what? Um,<br />there's a game tomorrow night.
786911 789037 She's going through a<br />bit of a baseball phase.
789205 793417 Her favorite team is playing. There's<br />gonna be candy and soda and...
796504 798338 I think I'll take her to that.
803678 804928 How'd it go?
805847 807723 I got you suspended.
808141 809475 - What?<br />- Cooper.
811227 812394 This is Cooper. Go.
812562 815397 Coop, those combines<br />you rebuilt went haywire.
815565 817733 Just reset the controllers.
818067 820694 I did that. Now you<br />should come take a look.
840423 843425 One by one they've been peeling<br />off the fields and heading over.
843593 845427 Something's interfering with the compass.
846930 849306 Magnetism or some such.
892225 893892 Nothing special about which book.
894561 896812 I've been working on it, like you said.
897564 900065 - I counted the spaces.<br />- Why?
902110 904194 In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
904988 906530 I'm trying Morse.
907115 908365 Morse?
908700 909783 Yeah.
910201 912828 - Dots and dashes, used...<br />- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
912996 915914 I just don't think your<br />bookshelf's trying to talk to you.
927510 931888 Had to reset every compass clock<br />and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
932181 934725 - Which is?<br />- I don't know.
936519 938645 If the house was<br />built on magnetic ore...
938813 941898 we'd have seen this the first<br />time we switched on the tractor.
944569 947738 I hear your meeting at<br />the school didn't go so well.
948364 950073 Heh. You heard?
951034 953869 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
955538 959041 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
960752 962377 When I was a kid...
962545 966673 it felt like they made something<br />new every day. Some...
967050 970344 gadget or idea. Like<br />every day was Christmas.
970803 973472 But six billion people...
973890 975891 just try to imagine that.
976893 979895 And every last one of<br />them trying to have it all.
983274 985192 This world isn't so bad.
987445 989655 And Tom will do just fine.
989822 994201 You're the one who doesn't belong. Born<br />40 years too late, or 40 years too early.
995203 997704 My daughter knew<br />it, God bless her.
998581 1001375 And your kids know<br />it. Especially Murph.
1001709 1005128 Well, we used to look up<br />in the sky and wonder...
1005296 1007673 at our place in the stars.
1010093 1014471 Now we just look down and<br />worry about our place in the dirt.
1014972 1017808 Cooper, you were good at something...
1018142 1020644 and you never got a<br />chance to do anything with it.
1021437 1022771 I'm sorry.
1024482 1025899 You didn't expect...
1026067 1028610 this dirt that was giving you this food...
1028945 1032030 to turn on you like that and destroy you.
1032532 1036660 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />Fifteenth of April, I think.
1037120 1039413 This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
1039747 1041498 came off the top of that canyon.
1043209 1045335 In my day, we had real ballplayers.
1045503 1047254 Who are these bums?
1047630 1050132 In my day, people were too busy...
1050299 1052342 fighting over food to even play baseball.
1052635 1057514 Popcorn at a ballgame is<br />unnatural. I want a hot dog.
1057682 1059808 School says you're gonna<br />follow in my footsteps.
1060560 1062060 I think that's great.
1062353 1065647 - You think that's great?<br />- You hate farming, Dad.
1066441 1068066 Grandpa said.
1068234 1069651 Grandpa said, huh?
1070069 1072612 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072780 1074448 I like what you do.
1075158 1076658 I like our farm.
1077326 1078952 You're gonna be great at it.
1091799 1093300 Let's get out of here.
1100558 1102559 All right, it's a doozy.
1103269 1105103 All right, gang, let's mask up.
1108441 1110442 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- Yeah.
1163996 1166581 Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?
1171003 1172087 Murph?
1193484 1194776 The ghost.
1196028 1197654 Grab your pillow.
1198447 1200282 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1255212 1256880 It's not a ghost.
1262303 1263720 It's gravity.
1265473 1267724 I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.
1268017 1272187 You want to clean that up<br />when you've finished praying to it?
1297546 1299798 It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.
1300299 1302258 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306722 1308056 Coordinates.
1310643 1313144 Nope. Mm-mm.
1314605 1315772 Here we go.
1317358 1318733 Thirty-three.
1321696 1322737 That's it.
1324198 1325699 I can't miss this!
1326033 1329202 Grandpa will be back in<br />a couple hours, Murph.
1329996 1332664 But you don't know what you're gonna find.
1333666 1335000 And that...
1336085 1338169 is why I can't take you.
1344260 1345385 Murph?
1347471 1350974 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
1357148 1358398 - Aah!<br />- Jesus.
1359400 1361317 - What are you doing?<br />- Heh-heh.
1361485 1363611 Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?
1363946 1366281 You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
1368117 1370118 Make yourself useful.
1433474 1434808 Hey, Murph?
1436435 1437477 Murph!
1440981 1443316 I think this is the end of the road.
1446320 1448363 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1449532 1450782 That's my girl.
1478519 1479769 Step away!
1479937 1483022 Don't shoot! I'm not armed.<br />My daughter's in the car.
1488571 1490822 - Don't be afraid.<br />- Aah!
1503544 1505628 How did you find this place?
1506338 1507672 Where's my daughter?
1507965 1511885 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map. Where did you get them?
1512052 1513386 Where's my daughter?
1513554 1516472 Don't make me take<br />you down again. Sit down!
1516807 1519017 Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?
1519185 1521769 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522062 1524677 And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
1524689 1527025 Where did you find those coordinates?
1527193 1529777 But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
1529945 1532780 Think I'll turn you into an<br />overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532948 1534157 No, you won't.
1535784 1537702 TARS, back down, please.
1539205 1542332 You know, you're taking a<br />risk using ex-military security.
1542791 1546628 They're old, and their<br />control units are unpredictable.
1546795 1548796 It's what the government could spare.
1550466 1551633 Who are you?
1552092 1553426 Dr. Brand.
1553594 1555970 I knew a Dr. Brand<br />once. He was a professor.
1556347 1557847 What makes you think I'm not?
1558307 1560642 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1560976 1563478 Please, Dr. Brand. I don't<br />have any idea what this is.
1564313 1566814 Now I'm scared for my<br />daughter and want her by my side.
1566982 1569442 You give me that, I'll tell you<br />anything you want to know.
1572821 1575823 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1577159 1578534 Your daughter is fine.
1578994 1580036 Bright kid.
1580621 1582455 Must have a very smart mother.
1582623 1585041 It's pretty clear you<br />don't want any visitors.
1585209 1589170 So why don't you just let us back up from<br />your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1589463 1592006 - It's not that simple.<br />- Well, sure, it is.
1592341 1596010 I don't know anything about you. I<br />don't know anything about this place.
1596887 1598054 Yes, you do.
1603769 1604852 Dad!
1607523 1608564 Hello, Cooper.
1610025 1611067 Professor Brand.
1613237 1615196 Explain to me how you found this facility.
1615364 1618658 Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled<br />upon it. We were on a salvage run...
1618826 1621536 You're sitting in the<br />best-kept secret in the world.
1621704 1625206 Nobody stumbles in<br />here. Nobody stumbles out.
1625541 1627208 Cooper, please.
1627668 1629752 Cooperate with these people.
1629920 1631129 Look.
1632047 1633715 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634049 1638219 We learned these<br />coordinates from an anomaly.
1638971 1640305 What sort of anomaly?
1640472 1643766 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1643934 1647854 You're going to have to be<br />specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1648022 1649272 It was gravity.
1652943 1657155 Um, what sort of gravitational<br />anomaly? Where was this?
1657323 1660616 Now, I'm real happy that you're<br />excited about gravity, bud...
1660784 1663995 but you're not getting any answers<br />from us until I get assurances.
1664163 1665455 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1666290 1669751 Like, that we're getting out of here.<br />And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1672296 1674422 Don't you know who we are, Coop?
1674590 1675840 No, professor, I don't.
1676008 1678009 You know my father, Professor Brand.
1678635 1679927 We're NASA.
1681722 1683931 - NASA?<br />- NASA.
1684266 1686059 The same NASA you flew for.
1697112 1698780 I heard they shut you down, sir...
1698947 1701240 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere...
1701408 1702950 onto starving people.
1703118 1705453 When they realized that<br />killing other people was...
1705621 1708456 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708624 1710625 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1710793 1714629 Because public opinion wouldn't<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1715089 1717382 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718801 1719967 Blight.
1720427 1724263 Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.
1725015 1726682 Now there's just corn.
1727017 1728976 And we're growing more than we ever have.
1729144 1733314 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733899 1736401 the corn will die.
1737152 1738194 Soon.
1743492 1747078 We'll find a way,<br />professor. We always have.
1747830 1751833 Driven by the unshakable<br />faith the Earth is ours.
1752334 1754210 Not just ours, no.
1755003 1756337 But it is our home.
1757673 1761008 Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
1761176 1762885 We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763053 1768391 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768559 1772019 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772187 1774355 And your daughter's generation...
1776024 1778276 will be the last to survive on Earth.
1778444 1782029 Murph is tired. I was wondering if<br />she could take a nap in my office.
1782531 1784031 Yeah. Thank you.
1786827 1787869 Okay...
1788871 1792373 now you need to tell me what<br />your plan is to save the world.
1793041 1796544 We're not meant to save the<br />world. We're meant to leave it.
1802384 1803426 Rangers.
1803719 1808681 The last components of our one<br />versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance.
1808974 1810600 Our final expedition.
1811393 1814353 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814980 1816272 The Lazarus missions.
1816607 1819567 - Oh, that sounds cheerful.<br />- Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819902 1821903 Sure, but he had to die in the first place.
1822529 1825239 There's not a planet in our solar<br />system that could sustain life...
1825407 1827909 and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1828076 1830745 That doesn't even qualify as futile.
1832414 1833748 Where'd you send them?
1834166 1835583 Cooper...
1835751 1838544 I can't tell you anymore<br />unless you agree...
1838712 1840546 to pilot this craft.
1840714 1844008 - You're the best pilot we ever had.<br />- I barely left the stratosphere.
1844301 1846427 This team never left the simulator.
1846762 1850556 We need a pilot, and this is the<br />mission that you were trained for.
1850724 1852225 Without even knowing it?
1853268 1857522 An hour ago, you didn't even know<br />I was alive. You were going anyway.
1857689 1859398 We had no choice.
1859566 1861317 But something sent you here.
1861652 1864362 - They chose you.<br />- Who's "they"?
1872329 1874247 How long would I be gone?
1874831 1877750 Hard to know. Years?
1878460 1880086 I've got kids, professor.
1880587 1882630 Get out there and save them.
1886009 1887385 Who's "they"?
1887553 1891347 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1891682 1895309 Mostly small distortions to our<br />instruments in the upper atmosphere.
1895477 1898604 In fact, I believe you<br />encountered one yourself.
1899273 1901274 Yeah, over the Straights.
1902276 1905319 My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905487 1906696 Exactly.
1907531 1912451 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this:
1912619 1914620 Out near Saturn...
1914788 1916872 a disturbance of space-time.
1919001 1922128 - Is that a wormhole?<br />- It appeared 48 years ago.
1922588 1924505 And it leads where?
1925048 1926674 Another galaxy.
1928427 1930678 A wormhole's not a naturally<br />occurring phenomenon.
1930846 1932263 Someone placed it there.
1933056 1934557 - "They"?<br />- Mm.
1935058 1939145 And whoever they are, they<br />appear to be looking out for us.
1939605 1942189 That wormhole lets<br />us travel to other stars.
1942357 1944275 It came along right as we needed it.
1944443 1947361 They've put potentially habitable<br />worlds right within our reach.
1947529 1949447 Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
1949615 1951991 - You sent probes into that?<br />- Mm-hm.
1952159 1955161 We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
1956496 1958164 The Lazarus missions.
1958498 1959738 Twelve possible worlds...
1959875 1962209 twelve Ranger launches carrying...
1962669 1965087 the bravest humans ever to live...
1965255 1967882 led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968383 1971385 Each person's landing pod had<br />enough life support for two years.
1971553 1973512 But they could use<br />hibernation to stretch that...
1973680 1976891 making observations on<br />organics over a decade or more.
1977059 1980895 Their mission was to assess their<br />world, and if it showed potential...
1981229 1985650 then they could send out a signal, bed<br />down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
1985817 1987860 And what if the world didn't show promise?
1988487 1989904 Hence the bravery.
1990697 1993240 You don't have the<br />resources to visit all 12.
1993408 1994533 No.
1995410 1998204 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
1998372 2000937 Simple binary pings on<br />an annual basis give us
2000949 2003417 some clue as to which<br />worlds have potential.
2003585 2005378 And one system shows promise.
2005712 2008255 One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
2009091 2011926 One system with three potential worlds?
2012344 2013928 No long shot.
2016098 2017223 Okay.
2017933 2020267 So if we find a home...
2022938 2026399 - then what?<br />- That's the long shot.
2026733 2029944 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030445 2033406 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045127 2048045 This entire facility's a centrifuge.
2048380 2050881 Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
2051216 2052967 Both. Plan A.
2053135 2055219 How do you get it off the ground?
2055387 2059056 The first gravitational<br />anomalies changed everything.
2059391 2063728 Suddenly we knew that<br />harnessing gravity was real.
2064062 2068733 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
2069109 2071193 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072279 2073821 That's why there's Plan B.
2074322 2079034 The problem is gravity. How to get a<br />viable amount of human life off the planet.
2079202 2080494 This is one way.
2080829 2083330 Plan B: a population bomb.
2083665 2088419 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089129 2090629 How would you raise them?
2090797 2093257 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093425 2097303 After that, with surrogacy, the<br />growth becomes exponential.
2098013 2101307 Within 30 years, we could<br />have a colony of hundreds.
2101475 2104852 The real difficulty with<br />colonization is genetic diversity.
2105479 2107021 This takes care of that.
2107189 2109648 But what about the people here? You just...
2110025 2111358 give up on them?
2111985 2113235 My kids?
2113779 2117114 That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
2119367 2122244 - How far have you got?<br />- Almost there.
2122412 2124830 You're asking me to hang everything...
2125874 2127208 on an almost.
2127751 2130044 I'm asking you to trust me.
2133131 2134799 Find us a new home.
2135550 2137551 And by the time you return...
2138136 2140805 I will have solved the problem of gravity.
2141765 2143349 I give you my word.
2155987 2157488 Go away!
2168166 2169208 Murph.
2169584 2172586 Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2175382 2178217 This world was never<br />enough for you, was it, Coop?
2179052 2182805 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183765 2185599 And it excites me? Heh.
2186309 2188769 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188937 2190062 It might.
2190438 2193566 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194317 2196652 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2196820 2198904 And the foundation's solid.
2202075 2207079 We farmers, we sit here every<br />year when the rains fail and we say:
2207372 2208622 "Next year."
2209291 2212960 Well, next year ain't gonna<br />save us, nor the one after that.
2213795 2217923 This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's<br />been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222637 2226432 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229561 2232771 Tom will be all right, but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2232939 2233981 I will.
2234941 2238110 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248747 2250748 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253251 2255377 I need to fix this before I go.
2255545 2258422 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2260008 2265012 After you kids came along, your mom said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265388 2267014 She said, "Now...
2268892 2273395 we're just here to be<br />memories for our kids."
2278526 2281028 And I think that now I<br />understand what she meant.
2284783 2288535 Once you're a parent, you're<br />the ghost of your children's future.
2290163 2292331 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298797 2300297 That's right, Murph.
2303510 2304843 Murph, look at me.
2307889 2310391 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312185 2314186 I need to exist.
2315814 2317731 They chose me.
2318441 2322403 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2325031 2327533 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330745 2332705 I figured out the message.
2333123 2336333 - One word. Know what it is?<br />- Murph.
2336501 2337835 "Stay."
2338211 2341088 - It says, "Stay," Dad.<br />- Murph.
2342048 2343507 You don't believe me.
2343675 2346468 Look at the books! Look<br />at this. It says, "Stay."
2346636 2349596 Why...? You're not<br />listening! It says, "Stay!"
2349931 2351765 No, I'm coming back.
2351933 2353267 When?
2366281 2368741 One for you, one for me.
2369117 2372286 When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...
2372620 2375164 traveling near the speed of light, or...
2376166 2378292 near a black hole...
2378752 2383297 time's gonna change for<br />me. It's gonna run more slowly.
2384883 2386675 When we get back...
2387802 2389219 we're gonna compare.
2389387 2392014 - Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2393099 2397770 By the time I get back, we might<br />even be the same age, you and me.
2398146 2400481 "What?" Imagine that!
2405028 2406195 Aw, Murph...
2406362 2408989 You have no idea when you're coming back.
2410784 2412284 No idea at all!
2415413 2417539 Murph, don't... Don't<br />make me leave like this.
2417707 2419208 Come on, Murph!
2419709 2422044 Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
2429636 2430677 Hey...
2431221 2432554 I love you.
2432931 2434848 Forever. You hear me?
2435308 2438519 I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
2444317 2445651 I'm coming back.
2463878 2466046 - How'd it go?<br />- Fine.
2466798 2468257 Just fine.
2474722 2475848 I love you, Tom.
2476391 2478517 - Travel safe, huh?<br />- Yeah.
2478685 2480936 You look after our place for me, all right?
2481104 2482729 - All right?<br />- Uh-huh.
2487235 2489490 Hey, can I use your<br />truck while you're gone?
2489502 2490612 You mean your truck?
2492115 2493740 I'll make sure they bring it back.
2495869 2497661 Look after my kids, Donald!
2510133 2513760 Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...
2514429 2517931 - Dad!<br />- Nine... Dad!
2518558 2519600 Eight...
2520935 2523437 seven... Dad!
2523771 2524813 Six...
2526191 2529109 five, main engine start, four...
2530445 2531612 three...
2532280 2533405 two...
2534324 2536408 one. Booster ignition and...
2545877 2548337 All engines look good.<br />Beginning roll program.
2552634 2555469 Prepare for stage one separation.
2555803 2556845 Stage one.
2562810 2564645 There is Mach 1.
2565605 2569316 Everybody good? Plenty of<br />slaves for my robot colony?
2571194 2574488 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he'd fit in better with his unit.
2574822 2576490 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576658 2579451 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580328 2581745 What a great idea!
2581913 2584623 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2584791 2585832 That'd probably help.
2586000 2589920 You can use it to find your way back to<br />the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
2591005 2594007 - What's your humor setting, TARS?<br />- That's 100 percent.
2594175 2595968 Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
2596302 2598136 Stage two separation.
2608815 2610983 All feeds going manual.
2611276 2612693 Going manual.
2614988 2617155 Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.
2617323 2618365 Check.
2623955 2626873 - Taking control.<br />- This is handover to you.
2630712 2633005 - A.D.F. check.<br />- Over.
2633339 2637009 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one, two, three.
2637176 2638510 One hundred percent.
2638678 2640512 Ex-mites.
2649480 2651315 It's hard leaving everything.
2651691 2654192 My kids. Your father.
2654819 2657195 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2657363 2660407 - We should learn to talk.<br />- And when not to.
2662702 2664244 Just being honest.
2664412 2666747 I don't think you need to be that honest.
2667165 2669583 Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
2669751 2672377 - Ninety percent.<br />- Ninety percent?
2672545 2675589 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic, nor the...
2675757 2678342 safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678509 2679968 Okay.
2680428 2683055 Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.
2686768 2689978 We are coming up on the<br />Endurance. Twelve minutes out.
2707080 2709081 Okay. Taking control.
2712543 2715420 Approaching module port, 500 meters.
2728434 2729559 It's all you, Doyle.
2748121 2750580 Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.
2755753 2757003 I feel good.
2757171 2758338 Take us home.
2766139 2768473 - Lock.<br />- Target locked.
2768641 2770475 - Well done.<br />- Okay, helmets on.
2770643 2771685 Good job.
2805136 2806887 Door's not charging.
2807054 2808555 Never mind.
2831329 2833038 Cooper, you should have control.
2833372 2834873 Control here.
2836292 2838919 Communication with ring module active.
2845384 2846927 Oh, wow.
2852725 2853892 That's initiate.
2861442 2863944 - Are we ready to spin?<br />- Just a sec.
2875373 2877707 - Hello, CASE.<br />- Hello, TARS.
2878668 2880585 All right, we're all set.
2881045 2882546 All right, let's do it.
2900856 2902357 Heh.
2911701 2912993 Thirty percent of spin.
2919917 2921251 One G.
2922003 2924004 How's gravity treating you back there?
2924338 2925505 Well.
2928676 2930468 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2930636 2931678 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2931846 2933930 Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.
2934348 2939019 We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or<br />maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.
2939186 2941354 - Hey, Brand?<br />- Yeah?
2941689 2943523 - Bring a lot.<br />- Heh-heh-heh.
2951991 2954868 Amelia, be safe.
2955202 2958705 - Give my regards to Dr. Mann.<br />- I will, Dad.
2958873 2960790 It looks good for your trajectory.
2960958 2964294 We've calculated two years to Saturn.
2965046 2966546 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2967256 2969716 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2970259 2973053 We'll be waiting for you when you get back.
2973554 2977390 A little older, a little wiser,<br />but happy to see you.
2980227 2983563 Do not go gentle into that good night
2984231 2988276 Old age should burn<br />and rave at close of day
2989445 2994407 Rage, rage against the dying of the light
2995284 2999079 Though wise men at<br />their end Know dark is right
2999413 3002290 Because their words had<br />forked No lightning they
3002708 3006252 Do not go gentle into that good night
3006921 3011257 Rage, rage against the dying of the light
3027858 3029526 - You good?<br />- Yeah.
3030444 3031945 Okay, thank you.
3035449 3036783 Here. Pills.
3039537 3040954 So alone.
3041455 3043415 We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043582 3044958 No, I mean them.
3045126 3046251 Hm?
3046419 3049713 it's a perfect planet, and we<br />won't find another one like her.
3050297 3053550 No, it's not like looking for a new condo.
3054677 3056845 The human race is going to be...
3057346 3058388 adrift...
3058556 3062058 desperate for a rock it can<br />cling to while it catches its breath.
3062643 3064477 We need to find that rock.
3064812 3067522 And our three prospects<br />are at the edge of what...
3067690 3069566 might sustain human life.
3070067 3072527 Laura Miller's planet is first.
3072695 3074821 - Laura started our biology program. Mm-hm.
3079827 3082996 - Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.<br />- Tell me about Edmunds.
3083831 3086583 Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.
3088878 3091212 None of them had families, huh?
3092256 3095133 No. No attachments. My father insisted.
3095301 3098845 They all knew the odds against ever<br />seeing another human being again.
3099013 3100973 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101140 3103057 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
3103225 3105143 He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
3105311 3109689 He inspired 11 people to follow him on<br />the loneliest journey in human history.
3109857 3111441 Scientists, explorers.
3111609 3115695 That's what I love. You know,<br />out there we face great odds.
3116197 3117614 Death, but...
3119366 3120700 not evil.
3120993 3122744 You don't think nature can be evil?
3123120 3125789 No. Formidable. Frightening. But...
3126582 3128583 - no, not evil.<br />- Hm.
3129835 3133046 Is a lion evil because it<br />rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133547 3135548 Just what we take with us, then.
3136091 3137133 Yeah.
3137551 3139636 This crew represents the best of humanity.
3139804 3140970 Even me, huh?
3141138 3143139 You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.
3143307 3144390 There you go.
3144809 3147185 - Don't stay up.<br />- I'll be there in a minute.
3147353 3151397 Just remember, Coop, you<br />are literally wasting your breath.
3158072 3161241 Hey, TARS? Let's go over<br />that trajectory one more time.
3161575 3163243 Eight months to Mars.
3163744 3166579 Counter-orbital slingshot<br />around. Fourteen months to Saturn.
3166747 3168164 Nothing's changed on that.
3168332 3170416 Just let me ask you something.
3172670 3173874 Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
3173886 3176130 Why are you whispering?<br />They can't hear you.
3177591 3180593 Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
3180761 3182178 I wouldn't know.
3182346 3185348 Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"<br />or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
3185516 3188643 - I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.<br />- Aah.
3190104 3192272 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204618 3205869 Hey, guys.
3206287 3209372 Uh, Dad's about to go<br />down for the long nap.
3209707 3212333 So I wanted to give you an update.
3212501 3213626 Uh...
3214169 3217881 The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...
3218424 3221259 You can't see any of the dust. Heh.
3221427 3225555 Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.
3225890 3230143 I know you'll get this message. Professor<br />Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.
3230686 3232729 Know that I love you.
3234148 3236482 - Is it him?<br />- I don't think so, Murph.
3243365 3245033 You must be Donald.
3247244 3248411 Hello, Murph.
3249163 3251164 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251790 3253958 He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
3254710 3256878 He sent you a message.
3259965 3261966 She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
3262134 3266220 If you record any messages, I<br />can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267306 3269974 Murph is a bright spark.
3270976 3273519 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273687 3276272 She's already making fools of her teachers.
3276440 3279275 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280361 3283196 - So where are they?<br />- Heading for Mars.
3283906 3287909 The next time you hear from<br />Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3327866 3329586 As far as school goes...
3329743 3332912 the administration wants me to<br />repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.
3333414 3336624 But they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.
3338419 3342296 All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.
3346343 3347927 Um, sorry, Coop.
3348095 3352932 I asked Murph to say hi, but<br />she's as stubborn as her old man.
3353350 3355184 I'll try again next time.
3370200 3371784 You all right, Rom?
3374121 3375955 This gets to me, Cooper.
3376123 3377790 This. This.
3378292 3381169 Millimeters of aluminum,<br />that's it, and then nothing...
3381336 3385298 out there for millions of<br />miles won't kill us in seconds.
3386216 3388134 You know that some of the finest...
3388302 3392138 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392723 3395892 They don't know how. And if they<br />go overboard, psst, they're done.
3397644 3399604 We're explorers, Rom.
3401148 3402857 This is our boat.
3403025 3404150 Here.
3431261 3433012 This is from the, uh, relay probe?
3433180 3435223 It was in orbit around the wormhole.
3435724 3438768 This is the wormhole, and<br />every time we'd come around...
3438936 3442146 we would receive images from<br />the other side of the foreign galaxy.
3442481 3444607 Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.
3444775 3445858 Exactly.
3446026 3450530 So we got a pretty good idea what<br />we're gonna find on the other side, huh?
3451615 3452949 Navigationally.
3454409 3458162 Guys? We'll be approaching<br />the wormhole in about three hours.
3464545 3465586 Hey, Coop?
3466463 3468214 Can we stop the spinning?
3468382 3469465 Why?
3469633 3471968 Because we're close enough to see it now?
3473804 3474929 All right.
3475097 3476180 Thanks.
3481937 3483896 There, that's it! That's the wormhole!
3484064 3485857 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
3486233 3487525 It's a sphere.
3487693 3491654 Of course it is. What, you...?<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3492865 3495950 No, it's just that all the<br />illustrations I've ever seen, they...
3496493 3499579 In the illustrations, they're<br />trying to show you how it works.
3500289 3504125 So they say you want<br />to go from here to there.
3504459 3507003 - But it's too far, right?<br />- Mm-hm.
3507171 3511966 So a wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through...
3512301 3513885 a higher dimension.
3514052 3515511 Okay, so...
3515846 3518258 to show that, they've<br />turned three-dimensional
3518270 3519765 space into two dimensions...
3519933 3523895 which turns a wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3524062 3526314 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3527524 3529025 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529443 3530943 A spherical hole.
3531486 3534322 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3534740 3539410 I'm not thanking anybody until we<br />get out of here in one piece, Rom.
3546627 3548044 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3549379 3551047 No one knows.
3558180 3559847 The others made it, right?
3561892 3563559 At least some of them.
3595509 3598678 Everybody ready to say<br />goodbye to our solar system?
3599554 3601555 To our galaxy.
3603475 3604517 Here we go.
3637134 3640636 The controls won't work here.<br />We're passing through the bulk.
3640804 3645224 It's space beyond our three dimensions.<br />All you can do is record and observe.
3656403 3657445 What is that?
3659823 3661657 I think it's them.
3661992 3663826 Distorting space-time.
3665912 3666996 Don't! Don't!
3695025 3696275 What was that?
3699279 3700780 The first handshake.
3702449 3703491 We're...
3705118 3706452 We're here.
3726807 3729058 So the lost communications came through.
3729226 3732103 - How?<br />- The relay on this side cached them.
3732270 3735815 So years of basic data. No real surprises.
3736733 3740569 Miller's site has kept pinging<br />thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's. Um...
3740737 3742863 Edmunds' went down three years ago.
3743031 3744240 Transmitter failure?
3744408 3747410 Maybe. He was sending the<br />thumbs up right until it went dark.
3747577 3749337 But Miller's still looks<br />good though, right?
3749496 3751789 - Because she's coming up fast. Mm-hm.
3752249 3754250 With one complication.
3754668 3757670 The planet is much closer to<br />Gargantua than we thought.
3757838 3760506 - Gargantua?<br />- It's what we're calling the black hole.
3760674 3762967 Miller's and Dr. Mann's<br />planets both orbit it.
3763135 3766345 - And Miller's is on the horizon?<br />- As a basketball around a hoop.
3766513 3768514 Landing there takes us dangerously close.
3768682 3771934 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3774521 3777523 Look, I could swing around<br />that neutron star to decelerate.
3777691 3779567 No, it's not that. It's time.
3779734 3784238 The gravity on that planet will slow<br />our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
3784865 3786031 How bad?
3786199 3789743 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3790620 3792788 seven years back on Earth.
3793665 3794707 Jesus.
3795041 3796709 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3798128 3800588 Well, we can't just drop<br />down there without...
3800755 3802631 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802799 3805384 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,<br />and our mission Plan A is...
3805552 3808721 to find a planet that can habitate<br />the people that are living on Earth now.
3808889 3811724 You can't just think about your<br />family. Now you have to think bigger.
3811892 3815102 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families, okay?
3815270 3819523 Plan A does not work if the people on<br />Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.
3820817 3822485 No. It doesn't.
3822819 3824487 That's why there's a Plan B.
3826406 3827907 Okay. Cooper's right.
3828074 3830047 We need to think of<br />time as a resource, like
3830059 3831911 oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.
3834289 3835456 All right, look.
3836750 3840211 Dr. Mann's data is promising,<br />but it will take months to get there.
3840378 3842588 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842756 3844829 Miller hasn't sent much,<br />but what she has is
3844841 3846926 very promising. it's<br />water, it's organics...
3847093 3849261 - You don't find that every day.<br />- No, you don't.
3849429 3851764 And just think about the<br />resources, including time...
3851932 3854433 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855560 3857353 - Romilly...<br />- Yeah?
3857521 3861357 How far off from Miller's planet do we<br />have to be to stay out of the time shift?
3861525 3863192 Just back from the cusp.
3863360 3866320 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866488 3868280 - Right.<br />- Okay.
3869199 3871992 Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.
3872160 3875329 Instead of taking the Endurance<br />into orbit around Miller's planet...
3875497 3878374 which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878542 3882628 what if we take a wider orbit around<br />Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...
3882796 3885297 outside of this time shift, to here?
3885465 3888259 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3888426 3891136 We come back, we analyze,<br />we debrief. We're in, we're out.
3891304 3893639 We lose a little fuel, but<br />we save a whole lot of time.
3893807 3895641 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895809 3898269 There's no time for monkey<br />business or chit-chat down there.
3898436 3901230 So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.
3901398 3903649 CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.
3903817 3907403 If we're talking about a couple years, I<br />could use the time to research gravity.
3907571 3910531 Observations from the wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910699 3912379 TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912534 3917288 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make<br />sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
3917455 3919999 - You got it?<br />- I wouldn't leave you behind...
3920166 3921208 Dr. Brand.
3925880 3927506 - You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3928466 3931969 - You don't say much, do you?<br />- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933179 3934221 Detach.
3941521 3944481 - Romilly, are you reading<br />these forces? it's unbelievable.
3947694 3949820 A literal heart of darkness.
3953992 3956702 If we could just see the<br />collapsed star inside...
3956870 3959622 the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3960040 3963334 - And we can't get anything from it?<br />- Nothing escapes that horizon.
3963501 3964835 Not even light.
3965003 3967180 The answer's there, just no way to see it.
3967192 3968505 There's Miller's planet.
3971176 3972509 Goodbye, Ranger.
3985315 3987608 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987776 3990027 - Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />- No.
3990487 3993822 I'm gonna use the Ranger's<br />aerodynamics to save some fuel.
3993990 3995199 Air brake?
3995367 3998911 - We want to get down fast, don't we?<br />- We want to get there in one piece.
3999079 4002081 - Hang on.<br />- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4017931 4020432 - We should ease!<br />- Hands where I can see them.
4020600 4023936 The only time I went down was when a<br />machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024104 4024981 A little caution...
4024993 4026939 Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
4027107 4029274 - Cooper, it's too damn fast!<br />- I got this.
4034114 4038117 - Should I disable the feedback?<br />- No. I need to feel the air.
4042122 4043288 Here we go.
4046584 4047876 It's just water!
4049379 4050879 The stuff of life.
4051339 4052756 Twelve hundred meters.
4052924 4054967 - Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />- Got it!
4055135 4057761 - Can you maneuver?<br />- I'll need to shave some speed.
4057929 4060556 I'm gonna spiral down on<br />top of it. Everybody hang on!
4062976 4064017 Seven hundred.
4066146 4068147 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.
4071651 4073152 Five hundred meters.
4082620 4083662 Fire!
4097218 4098302 Very graceful.
4098470 4099553 No.
4100180 4102264 But very efficient.
4104726 4106935 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
4107103 4109021 Go, go, go!
4109439 4112691 Seven years per hour<br />here. Let's make it count!
4138802 4140052 This way.
4142889 4144640 About 200 meters.
4154150 4155776 The gravity's punishing.
4156736 4158862 Been floating through space too long?
4159030 4161073 One hundred and thirty<br />percent Earth gravity.
4161407 4163408 Come on. Come on.
4166037 4168872 - There's nothing here.<br />- Should be right here.
4170792 4173794 If the signal's coming from here, then...
4183429 4184596 Her beacon.
4192730 4193772 Wreckage.
4194440 4195607 Where's the rest?
4196109 4197609 Towards the mountains!
4201447 4203282 Those aren't mountains.
4204951 4206285 They're waves.
4211624 4214293 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214794 4216795 That one's moving away from us.
4223303 4224970 We need the recorder.
4235148 4237399 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4237567 4240944 We're not leaving without her data.
4241112 4242446 Get back here now!
4242614 4244323 We do not have time!
4244490 4246950 The second wave is coming!<br />We're in the middle of a swell.
4248244 4249661 No, I got it.
4249829 4251830 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4256836 4258879 Brand, get back here now!
4260840 4263050 No, Cooper, go. Cooper,<br />go. I can't make it.
4263468 4265844 - Go!<br />- CASE, go get her.
4270642 4272643 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4273561 4275062 Go, go! Go!
4276648 4279483 - I'm not gonna make it!<br />- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4286324 4288617 Come on, CASE has<br />her! Get back here, Doyle!
4291621 4292704 Come on!
4295458 4296875 Get to the hatch!
4301422 4302923 Go, go! Go!
4308471 4309554 Shit.
4310056 4311890 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4315395 4316561 Cooper! Wait!
4323903 4327572 The engines are flooded! I'm<br />gonna have to shut her down.
4361024 4362357 Holy shit.
4366779 4368113 Hang on!
4399353 4400604 CASE, what's the problem?
4400772 4403190 Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404317 4405525 Goddamn it!
4405693 4410363 - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?<br />- And I told you to get your ass back here!
4410531 4415202 - One of us was thinking about the mission!<br />- You were thinking about getting home.
4417038 4419372 I was trying to do the right thing!
4419540 4421500 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423795 4425962 - CASE, how much time?<br />- Forty-five to an hour.
4427757 4429091 The stuff of life, huh?
4430009 4432177 What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4432345 4434304 A lot. Decades.
4441521 4442854 What happened to Miller?
4443606 4446358 Judging by the wreckage, she was...
4446526 4449152 broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449320 4452155 How's the wreckage stayed<br />together after all these years, huh?
4453407 4455408 Because of the time slippage.
4456536 4461039 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4461958 4464334 She probably just died minutes ago.
4464502 4468547 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status echoing endlessly.
4468923 4471091 Oh, we are not prepared for this.
4473469 4476930 You eggheads have the<br />survival skills of a Boy Scout troop.
4477098 4480350 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4480518 4482102 Well, not far enough!
4482436 4485939 And now we're stuck here till there<br />won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
4488985 4491653 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496450 4498285 Is there any possibility...
4498452 4502080 some kind of a way we can<br />maybe all jump in a black hole?
4502248 4503915 Gain back the years?
4504584 4506084 Don't shake your head at me.
4506252 4508253 Time is relative, okay?
4508421 4511464 It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...
4511966 4514176 it can't run backwards. it just can't.
4514343 4518763 The only thing that can move<br />across dimensions, like time, is gravity.
4521475 4522642 Okay.
4524604 4528481 The beings that led us<br />here, they communicate...
4528649 4530483 - through gravity, right?<br />- Yes.
4530651 4532819 Could they be talking<br />to us from the future?
4533738 4535989 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4537200 4540452 "They" are beings of five dimensions.
4540870 4544206 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544540 4545874 To them...
4546292 4550462 the past might be a canyon that<br />they can climb into and the future...
4550630 4553632 a mountain they can climb<br />up. But to us, it's not, okay?
4554717 4557135 Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.
4559305 4561056 But you knew about relativity.
4561224 4562557 Oh.
4564268 4565435 Brand...
4570316 4572234 My daughter was 10 years old.
4572860 4575654 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576072 4578907 Couldn't you have told her you<br />were going to save the world?
4579492 4580533 No.
4582203 4586373 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4587875 4591044 And that is that you want to<br />make sure your children feel safe.
4592088 4595840 And it rules out telling a<br />10-year-old that the world is ending.
4598302 4599678 Cooper?
4603391 4605892 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4606060 4608144 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4612066 4613858 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614026 4616528 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616696 4618405 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618698 4620031 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4625913 4627163 Engines up!
4656027 4657527 Hello, Rom.
4657987 4659654 I've waited years.
4660740 4662574 How...? How many years?
4664410 4667370 - By now it must be...<br />Twenty-three years...
4667538 4669247 four months, eight days.
4673669 4674836 Doyle?
4681052 4684054 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685431 4686931 Reality's different.
4687975 4689142 And Miller?
4690728 4692729 There's nothing here for us.
4695483 4696983 Why didn't you sleep?
4697943 4702030 Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I<br />stopped believing you were coming back.
4702531 4705533 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706369 4709204 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole...
4709580 4712040 but I couldn't send<br />anything to your father.
4712208 4714459 We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.
4714627 4716711 - Is he alive?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4717129 4718922 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4721926 4724928 We've got years of messages stored.
4725221 4726388 Cooper.
4726555 4729557 Messages span 23 years.
4731602 4733269 Play it from the beginning.
4736315 4738024 Hey, Dad.
4738859 4741277 Checking in. Saying hi.
4742363 4745824 Um... Finished second in school.
4747410 4749828 Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.
4750121 4752956 Pulled me down, but second's not bad.
4754125 4756292 Grandpa attended the ceremony.
4757920 4759921 Um... Oh.
4760881 4762841 I met another girl, Dad.
4763008 4764592 I, uh...
4765344 4767345 I really think this is the one.
4768639 4771224 Name's Lois. That's her right there.
4774270 4776271 Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
4776939 4779607 She crashed it. She's okay, though.
4780276 4781359 Hey, Dad.
4782278 4783611 Look at this!
4784447 4785947 You're a grandpa.
4787366 4789033 His name's Jesse.
4789702 4794289 I kind of wanted to call him Coop,<br />but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.
4794957 4799377 Donald says he's already earned the<br />"great" part, so we just leave it at that.
4802548 4804340 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
4805134 4806759 Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
4807136 4808970 Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.
4809388 4811890 Sorry it's been a while.
4813267 4814309 Just...
4816520 4818521 what with Jesse and all.
4821901 4823401 Uh...
4825029 4827363 Grandpa died last week.
4827781 4830867 We buried him out in the<br />back forty next to Mom and...
4831744 4832827 Jesse.
4833704 4836789 Which is where we would<br />have buried you if you'd ever...
4837541 4839042 come back.
4840544 4842795 Murph was there at the funeral.
4843422 4846174 We don't see her that<br />much, but she came for that.
4849386 4851804 You aren't listening to this, I know that.
4854934 4857685 All these messages are just, like...
4858854 4862524 drifting out there in the darkness.
4863609 4865944 Lois says that, uh...
4866737 4869489 I have to let you go.
4869865 4871699 And, uh...
4872201 4873284 so...
4876539 4879624 I guess I'm letting you go.
4880584 4883253 I don't know where you are, Dad...
4883879 4886506 but I hope that you're at peace.
4888300 4889384 Goodbye.
4902982 4904232 Hey, Dad.
4907069 4908236 Hey, Murph.
4908404 4910321 You son of a bitch.
4914034 4916536 I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding...
4916704 4919038 because I was so mad at you for leaving.
4922084 4924168 And then when you went quiet, it...
4926797 4929632 seemed like I should live<br />with that decision. And I have.
4934138 4936556 But today's my birthday.
4940227 4943396 And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...
4947526 4951863 You once told me that when you<br />came back, we might be the same age.
4953574 4956659 And today I'm the age<br />you were when you left.
4959663 4961748 So it would be a real good<br />time for you to come back.
4976221 4980516 I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that<br />I've never seen you in here before.
4981143 4983311 I've never been in here before.
4985189 4988191 I talk to Amelia all the time.
4988692 4990026 It helps.
4990694 4993446 - I'm glad you've started.<br />- I haven't. I...
4993614 4996115 I just had something I needed to get out.
4996450 4998868 - I know they're still out there.<br />- I know.
4999036 5000719 There are so many reasons their
5000731 5003247 communications might<br />not be getting through.
5003415 5004832 I know, professor.
5005459 5008378 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
5009546 5011881 Them never coming back or...
5013092 5016302 coming back to find we've failed.
5016470 5017887 Then let's succeed.
5018931 5019972 So...
5020683 5024686 back to the fourth iteration. Let's<br />run it through some new fields.
5025020 5028189 With respect, professor, we've<br />tried that hundreds of times.
5028524 5032193 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035489 5039367 Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
5039535 5041536 We've done well for the world here...
5041704 5046457 whether or not we crack the<br />equation before I kick the bucket.
5046625 5049502 - Don't be morbid, professor.<br />- I'm not afraid of death.
5050254 5052088 I'm an old physicist.
5053340 5055007 I'm afraid of time.
5062182 5063349 Time.
5065394 5067061 You're afraid of time.
5069648 5071649 We've been trying to solve the equation...
5071817 5074318 without changing the<br />underlying assumption about time.
5074486 5076195 - And?<br />- And that means...
5076363 5080825 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5080993 5083119 It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
5083412 5085329 Are you calling my life's work...
5085497 5087206 nonsense, Murph?
5087374 5089417 No, I'm saying that<br />you've been trying to...
5089585 5093379 finish it with one arm... No, with<br />both arms... tied behind your back.
5095466 5097467 And I don't understand why.
5098427 5100261 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101180 5103806 Can we take this point up at another time?
5103974 5106100 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108270 5110730 Stepping out into the universe...
5110898 5114692 we must confront the<br />reality of interstellar travel.
5115611 5120156 We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.
5120324 5125453 We must think not as<br />individuals but as a species.
5128290 5130917 Do not go gentle into that good night
5133086 5135671 TARS kept the Endurance<br />right where we needed her.
5135839 5138633 But the trip took years<br />longer than we anticipated.
5138967 5142470 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142805 5144305 we have to choose.
5145516 5146641 But how?
5147684 5149352 They're both promising.
5150896 5155399 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
5155567 5158486 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
5159404 5161906 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162074 5165243 - As does Dr. Mann's.<br />- Cooper, this is my field.
5166411 5167453 And...
5168247 5170414 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170582 5173918 - Why?<br />- Gargantua, that's why.
5175045 5179090 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
5179258 5183678 but no life. Sterile. We'll find<br />the same thing on Mann's.
5184096 5185763 Because of the black hole?
5186056 5189100 Murphy's Law. Whatever<br />can happen will happen.
5189268 5191602 Accident is the first<br />building block of evolution.
5191770 5194605 But when you're orbiting a black<br />hole not enough can happen.
5194773 5199068 It sucks in asteroids and comets, other<br />events which would otherwise reach you.
5199444 5201279 We need to go further afield.
5201905 5204240 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205492 5206993 was the best of us.
5207286 5210454 He's remarkable. We're<br />only here because of him.
5210998 5212832 And yet... Yet here he is.
5213000 5217962 He's on the ground, and he's sending a<br />very unambiguous message, telling us...
5218130 5219839 to come to his planet.
5220007 5224635 Granted, but Edmunds'<br />data is more promising.
5225095 5226137 We should vote.
5226305 5228472 Well, if we vote, there's<br />something you should know.
5229600 5230641 Brand?
5230809 5232476 He has a right to know.
5232978 5234729 That has nothing to do with it.
5234897 5237940 - What does?<br />- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238108 5240651 - Is that true?<br />- Yes.
5243822 5246532 And that makes me want to follow my heart.
5249995 5253664 But maybe we've spent too long<br />trying to figure all this out with theory.
5253832 5255249 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255417 5256959 So listen to me...
5257794 5262506 when I say that love isn't<br />something we invented. It's...
5263508 5265843 observable, powerful.
5267930 5269639 It has to mean something.
5269806 5274185 Love has meaning, yes. Social<br />utility, social bonding, child rearing...
5274353 5277855 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5278398 5279440 None.
5279608 5283486 Maybe it means something<br />more, something we can't...
5283654 5285696 yet understand.
5285864 5289325 Maybe it's some evidence, some...
5290285 5294747 artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5294915 5299710 I'm drawn across the universe to<br />someone I haven't seen in a decade...
5299878 5302713 who I know is probably dead.
5303048 5306384 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving...
5306551 5309387 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311223 5315559 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320565 5322233 All right, Cooper...
5324111 5325403 yes...
5326571 5329907 the tiniest possibility of<br />seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330742 5332410 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5333120 5335287 Honestly, Amelia...
5337082 5338249 it might.
5345048 5347758 TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5364651 5366110 We'll lose about a third again.
5366278 5367820 But next year...
5370115 5372950 Next year I'm gonna work<br />Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.
5373785 5375619 What happened to Nelson?
5381543 5383753 Murph, would you like some more soufflé?
5383920 5387298 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.
5388175 5390176 Coop, finish your fritter, please.
5392345 5396057 Will you spend the night? Your<br />room is exactly as you left it. it's ready.
5396224 5397600 I need to get back.
5397768 5400311 My sewing machine is in<br />there, but there's plenty...
5400479 5401771 I need to...
5404649 5406192 Too many memories.
5406818 5409612 We might have something<br />for that. Hey, Coop.
5417162 5418454 The dust.
5420957 5423334 Lois, I have a friend who...
5423502 5425336 could look at his lungs.
5443522 5446190 - Amelia, I'm sorry.<br />- You were just being objective.
5446358 5449819 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5449986 5452238 No, this wasn't a personal decision.
5453073 5457118 If you're wrong, you will have a<br />very personal decision to make.
5457285 5460246 Your fuel calculations are<br />based on a return journey.
5460580 5464458 Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll<br />have to decide whether to return home...
5464751 5466877 or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467212 5470881 Starting a colony could<br />save us from extinction.
5471216 5474385 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474553 5476387 and the future of the human race.
5477889 5479598 I trust you'll be as objective then.
5486481 5488399 He's been asking for you since he came to.
5488567 5490192 We were trying to reach you.
5496158 5497199 Murph.
5498201 5499702 I'm here, professor.
5500412 5502746 I let you all down.
5503081 5506417 No, you got us so far. Real close.
5508253 5510045 I'll finish what you started.
5510213 5512423 Good, good Murph.
5514718 5517011 You had faith...
5518221 5519513 all those...
5520473 5522266 all those years.
5523935 5527855 I... I asked you to have faith.
5529608 5532401 I wanted you to believe...
5533904 5535779 that your father...
5538783 5540618 would come back.
5540785 5542077 I do, professor.
5543705 5545206 Forgive me, Murph.
5545957 5547958 There's nothing to forgive.
5550629 5551670 I...
5552255 5554089 I lied, Murph.
5556468 5558260 I lied to you.
5564601 5567811 There was no need for him to...
5569022 5570898 To come back.
5573485 5576820 There is no way to help us.
5578114 5579156 But Plan A...
5579699 5582826 All this. All these people.
5583954 5585746 And the equation.
5589751 5591502 Did my father know?
5595298 5597007 Did he leave me?
5600971 5602012 Do...
5603181 5604515 not...
5605475 5606725 go...
5607936 5609520 gentle...
5611523 5612690 No.
5614359 5615442 No!
5616653 5618320 You can't leave.
5618697 5619947 You... No.
5621032 5625703 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that<br />your father died today. He had no pain.
5626288 5627955 He was at peace.
5628623 5630708 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5643305 5644972 Brand, did you know?
5647392 5649059 He told you, right?
5651938 5653314 You knew.
5655233 5657026 This was all a sham.
5661406 5663490 You left us here.
5665243 5666744 To suffocate.
5668913 5670247 To starve.
5697609 5698942 Frozen cloud.
5843379 5844755 It's okay.
5844923 5846340 It's okay.
5853181 5854681 It's okay.
5860104 5862105 Pray you never learn...
5863274 5866610 just how good it can<br />be to see another face.
5875036 5877538 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5877705 5880040 after so long, I had none.
5881709 5884545 My supplies were completely exhausted.
5886506 5890259 The last time I went to sleep, I<br />didn't even set a waking date.
5893972 5896557 You have literally raised me from the dead.
5897600 5899768 - Lazarus.<br />- Hm.
5900687 5903939 - What about the others?<br />- I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5904649 5907067 So far, surely.
5907819 5912656 No, our present situation is that there's<br />very little chance of rescuing any others.
5916411 5918620 Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5919497 5921290 Tell us about your world.
5924669 5926545 Our world, we hope.
5930341 5934136 Our world, uh, is cold... stark...
5936014 5937848 but undeniably beautiful.
5940101 5943353 The days are 67 hours long, cold.
5947358 5951612 The nights are... 67 far colder hours.
5957452 5961788 The gravity is a very, very<br />pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.
5961956 5964958 Now, up here where I<br />landed, the water is alkali...
5965293 5969046 and the air has too much ammonia to<br />breathe for more than just a few minutes...
5969213 5973800 but down at the surface,<br />and there is a surface...
5973968 5975594 the chlorine dissipates.
5975762 5979640 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5979974 5981475 To organics.
5981809 5984144 Possibly even to life.
5984979 5986897 We might be sharing this world.
5987440 5989399 These readings are from the surface?
5989567 5992736 Over the years, I've<br />dropped various probes.
5993071 5996490 - How far have you explored?<br />- I've mounted several major expeditions.
5996658 6000911 But with oxygen in limited supply,<br />KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
6001079 6003538 - What went wrong with him, sir?<br />- Degeneration.
6003706 6007292 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007460 6011588 We struggled on for a time, but<br />ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011756 6013924 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014092 6017094 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
6017261 6018929 Would you like me to look at him?
6019430 6021598 No. No. He needs a human touch.
6021766 6026269 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a<br />message for you from the comm station.
6026437 6028897 Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.
6040910 6043495 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell<br />you that your father died today.
6044205 6045831 He had no pain.
6048960 6050460 He was at peace.
6052547 6054381 I'm sorry for your loss.
6056759 6057801 Is that Murph?
6058511 6060971 She's... She's grown.
6061139 6062723 Brand, did you know?
6063891 6065559 He told you, right?
6068604 6069896 You knew.
6071649 6073150 This was all a sham.
6074193 6075861 You left us here.
6077989 6079489 To suffocate.
6081576 6082951 To starve.
6086289 6087873 Did my father know too?
6090460 6091918 Dad?
6093671 6095589 I just want to know...
6096924 6098925 if you left me here to die.
6101512 6103513 I just have to know.
6109020 6110437 Cooper, my...
6111939 6113857 My father dedicated...
6114233 6119237 his whole life to Plan A. I have<br />no idea what she's talking about.
6120948 6122115 I do.
6127246 6129915 He never even hoped to<br />get the people off the Earth?
6131125 6132334 No.
6136380 6140217 But he's been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
6140718 6144137 Amelia, your father solved<br />his equation before I even left.
6144722 6146598 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146766 6150727 The equation couldn't reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics. You need more.
6150895 6152813 More? More what?
6152980 6155982 More data. You need<br />to see into a black hole.
6156150 6158235 The laws of nature<br />prohibit a naked singularity.
6158402 6159903 Romilly, is that true?
6161197 6164908 If a black hole is an oyster, then<br />the singularity's the pearl inside.
6165076 6167828 The gravity's so strong, it's<br />always hidden in darkness...
6167995 6169412 behind the horizon.
6170832 6172916 That's why we call it a black hole.
6173084 6176503 Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...
6177088 6178588 We can't, Coop.
6178756 6181258 There are some things that<br />aren't meant to be known.
6181592 6185637 Your father had to find another way<br />to save the human race from extinction.
6185805 6187305 Plan B. A colony.
6187473 6189140 Why not tell people?
6190726 6193812 - Why keep building those stations?<br />- He knew how hard it would be...
6193980 6198108 to get people to work together to<br />save the species instead of themselves.
6198276 6199442 Or their children.
6199610 6200652 Bullshit.
6200820 6203613 You never would've come unless<br />you believed you would save them.
6203781 6206992 Evolution has yet to<br />transcend that simple barrier.
6207159 6209619 We can care deeply, selflessly about...
6209787 6213290 those we know, but that empathy<br />rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
6213457 6215166 But the lie.
6218462 6220881 That monstrous lie?
6222133 6223425 Unforgivable.
6223593 6225051 And he knew that.
6225803 6230140 He was prepared to destroy his own<br />humanity in order to save the species.
6230308 6232726 - He made an incredible sacrifice.<br />- No.
6234145 6239024 An incredible sacrifice is being made by<br />the people on Earth who are gonna die!
6239483 6241651 Because in his fucking arrogance...
6242069 6244154 he declared their case hopeless.
6244822 6246323 I'm sorry, Cooper...
6246866 6248325 their case is hopeless.
6248492 6250619 No. No.
6251245 6252746 We are the future.
6256417 6258335 Cooper, what can I do?
6261547 6263381 Let me go home.
6263966 6265884 You're absolutely positive?
6266510 6269012 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269680 6272307 - It's worthless?<br />- It's half the answer.
6273267 6276269 Okay, how do you find the other half?
6276854 6278521 Out there? A black hole.
6278689 6281524 - But stuck down here on Earth?<br />- Yeah?
6282860 6284527 I'm not sure you can.
6286447 6289115 God, they just pack up and leave.
6290534 6292619 What are they hoping to find?
6293204 6294245 Survival.
6302046 6303129 Damn it.
6306050 6309844 Murph, don't...? Don't<br />people have a right to know?
6310471 6314557 Panic won't help. We just have<br />to keep working, same as ever.
6314725 6318061 But isn't that exactly what Professor<br />Brand was manipulating us to do?
6318229 6321481 Brand gave up on us.<br />I'm still trying to solve this.
6322108 6323191 So...
6324610 6326277 do you have an idea?
6326988 6328321 A feeling.
6331742 6333743 I told you about my ghost.
6335746 6337789 My dad thought I called it a ghost...
6338249 6339916 because I was scared of it.
6343379 6344713 But I was never scared of it.
6346924 6349592 I called it a ghost because it felt...
6352013 6353680 It felt like a person.
6356225 6357892 It was trying to tell me something.
6360855 6363857 If there's an answer here<br />on Earth, it's back there...
6364316 6366234 somehow, in that room.
6366777 6368528 So I have to find it.
6371949 6373700 We're running out of time.
6375619 6377620 What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
6377788 6379956 No, they can stay. I'll be sleeping anyway.
6380124 6381708 - Hey, Coop?<br />- Yeah?
6381876 6383877 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384045 6386796 - Yeah, what's that?<br />- Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388674 6390258 I'm going home, Rom.
6390426 6393678 Yeah, I know. This isn't<br />going to cost you any time.
6394430 6396264 There's a chance for the people on Earth.
6397016 6400060 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
6400227 6404105 - It's what we call a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6404273 6407734 They're hardly gentle. But the<br />tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407902 6412155 something crossing the horizon<br />fast might survive. A probe, say.
6412323 6416993 - What happens after it crosses?<br />- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417161 6420246 So, what's to say there isn't<br />some way that the probe...
6420414 6423333 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423501 6426753 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426921 6429714 Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," professor?
6430257 6432008 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432843 6434761 I've already told him what to look for.
6434929 6437639 I'd need the old optical<br />transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.
6437807 6439140 You'd do this for us?
6439308 6443228 Before you get all teary, remember that<br />as a robot I have to do anything you say.
6444146 6445605 Your cue light's broken.
6445773 6447315 I'm not joking.
6449944 6453196 I'll need TARS to remove and<br />adapt some components from KIPP.
6453364 6455698 I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455866 6457367 I'll supervise.
6457701 6458743 All right.
6458911 6461067 Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure
6461079 6463581 sites. One for Brand's<br />lab, two for habitat.
6463749 6466209 Once those modules have<br />landed, you don't want to move them.
6466377 6468920 I can take you to the probe<br />sites, but I don't think...
6469088 6471798 these conditions will<br />hold. I think we should wait.
6471966 6474801 CASE is headed down with the<br />rest of the distillery equipment.
6474969 6477804 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479723 6482809 Well, these squalls do usually blow over.
6483227 6484352 Okay, then.
6484520 6486729 - You'll need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486897 6488439 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6489024 6490066 Follow me.
6490860 6493027 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6493195 6494404 Roger that, Cooper.
6500703 6503746 Brand told me why you<br />feel you have to go back.
6505583 6508334 But I'd be remiss if I<br />didn't at least mention...
6508669 6512839 that a mission such as ours could<br />certainly use an extra engineer.
6514675 6518928 You better slow down, turbo.<br />Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519555 6521306 Safety first, Cooper.
6522558 6525560 I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6525936 6530940 But once we set up base camp and<br />secure those modules, my work's done here.
6531358 6532692 I'm going home.
6540701 6544204 You have attachments.<br />But even without a family...
6544622 6549083 I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6549752 6553087 That emotion is at the foundation...
6553756 6556799 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6564808 6567393 - How long have you had that cough?<br />- A while.
6577947 6579864 Mom lets me play in here.
6581784 6583034 I don't touch your stuff.
6614024 6615650 Just take this gently.
6620781 6624158 You know why we couldn't just send<br />machines on these missions, don't you?
6624785 6629414 A machine doesn't improvise well<br />because you can't program a fear of death.
6630291 6632625 Our survival instinct<br />is our single greatest...
6632793 6636337 source of inspiration.<br />Take you, for example.
6637047 6638381 A father...
6638882 6641884 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6643053 6647724 What does research tell us is the last<br />thing you're going to see before you die?
6649435 6651894 Your children. Their faces.
6652229 6654814 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push...
6654982 6656691 a little bit harder to survive.
6657401 6658443 For them.
6659320 6660570 Deep breath.
6662865 6666617 Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop. Why<br />don't you have a seat here for me?
6666910 6669245 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6669955 6671247 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6679590 6681049 TARS, what's taking so long?
6681216 6684093 Professor, I am having<br />trouble completing the boot up.
6684261 6685803 I don't understand.
6692603 6693853 It's funny.
6695939 6697565 When I left Earth...
6698567 6700651 I thought I was prepared to die.
6702696 6704030 The truth is...
6706241 6711245 I never really considered the<br />possibility that my planet wasn't the one.
6713957 6716292 Nothing worked out the<br />way it was supposed to.
6716460 6717502 Let's go.
6725969 6728763 All right, buddy, give<br />me a big deep breath.
6733560 6734977 What is this?
6735396 6736488 What are you doing?
6736500 6739232 I'm sorry! I can't let<br />you leave with that ship.
6739566 6741901 We're gonna need it to<br />complete the mission...
6742236 6745655 once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6745948 6748699 We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!
6749159 6750201 I'm sorry!
6759962 6763089 - They can't stay here anymore.<br />- You have to leave right now.
6763257 6766801 Let me make something abundantly<br />clear. You have a responsibility...
6766969 6770096 - Oh! Jesus!<br />- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.
6770431 6772348 Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!
6772516 6776602 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And<br />he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.
6777187 6779856 You faked all the data?
6781567 6782650 Yeah.
6786655 6788364 There's no surface?
6788532 6789699 No.
6790659 6792660 I tried to do my duty, Cooper...
6792828 6797832 but I knew the day that I arrived<br />here that this place had nothing.
6798459 6802253 And I resisted the temptation for years...
6802880 6804964 but I knew that...
6805299 6808134 if I just pressed that button, then...
6808427 6810428 somebody would come and save me.
6811472 6812972 You fucking coward.
6813807 6814849 Yes.
6820272 6821314 Yes.
6823233 6824275 Yes.
6825527 6826569 Yes.
6838081 6842627 Listen, if you're not going to go, let<br />your family go. Just save your family.
6843128 6845421 And we go live underground with you?
6845589 6847507 Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6847674 6851177 Dad's not coming back. He never<br />was coming back. It's up to me.
6851345 6853221 You're gonna save everybody?
6853597 6856432 - Because Dad couldn't do it.<br />- Dad didn't even try!
6856600 6858768 Dad just abandoned us!
6859520 6861312 He left us here to die.
6862022 6863689 Nobody's going with you.
6867402 6870112 You gonna wait for your next kid to die?
6873116 6874408 Get out.
6875285 6876619 And don't come back.
6881500 6883334 You can keep my stuff.
6894263 6895638 Stop it!
6898642 6900226 No. No!
6901311 6904188 Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50<br />chance you're gonna kill yourself!
6905023 6907024 Those are the best odds I've had in years.
6927462 6929297 Don't judge me, Cooper.
6930048 6932300 You were never tested like I was.
6932926 6934385 Few men have been.
6942728 6943894 You tried your best, Murph.
6953405 6954780 You're feeling it, aren't you?
6956450 6958284 The survival instinct.
6959202 6963539 That's what drove me. it's what drives<br />all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.
6964708 6968044 Because I want to save<br />all of us. For you, Cooper.
6973216 6976761 I'm sorry, I can't watch you<br />go through this. I'm sorry.
6977095 6979764 I thought I could, but I can't.
6980849 6983017 I'm here. I'm here for you.
6983310 6985353 Just listen to my voice, Cooper.
6986146 6987480 I'm right here.
6989316 6990650 You're not alone.
7000369 7001869 Do you see your children?
7005123 7006457 It's okay.
7007417 7009168 They're right there with you.
7013048 7015633 Did Professor Brand tell<br />you that poem before you left?
7016468 7017968 Do you remember?
7020347 7023015 Do not go gentle into that good night
7024935 7027728 Old age should burn and rave
7027896 7029480 At close of day
7031066 7033442 Rage, rage against the dying of the light
7058093 7059760 Brand! Help!
7059928 7061887 - Help!<br />- Cooper?
7068603 7069812 CASE!
7070188 7071480 No air.
7072315 7073524 Ammonia.
7074609 7077111 Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
7077279 7079196 - I have a fix.<br />- Go! Go, go, go!
7079364 7081449 And away!
7093003 7095212 Cooper, we're coming.<br />Hang in there. Don't talk.
7095380 7097673 Try to breathe as little as<br />possible. We're almost there.
7101344 7103345 There's a security lockout, sir.
7103513 7106766 It requires a person to access function.
7111813 7113314 It's all yours, sir.
7121531 7122990 Try not to breathe.
7123992 7125659 We're coming. We're coming right now.
7125827 7127953 CASE, come on! Come on!
7128121 7130831 We got to go faster,<br />CASE! Faster, faster, faster!
7135337 7137046 Hang in there. Come on.
7143553 7146847 I see him, I see him!<br />CASE, bank! Bank right!
7165867 7167409 Cooper! Cooper!
7167786 7168869 I'm here!
7192102 7194103 This data makes no sense.
7202529 7203779 I'm sorry.
7204114 7206699 - What?<br />- Mann was lying!
7214457 7216250 Go. Go.
7217335 7218377 Romilly.
7218753 7219795 Romilly!
7220130 7222548 Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?
7223133 7225134 Step back, professor! Step back!
7233059 7235644 - Romilly...<br />- Romilly, do you read me?
7238648 7239982 Keep watch!
7241151 7242276 Lois?
7242777 7245279 - What happened to caution, CASE?<br />- Safety first, Cooper.
7246656 7250075 Romilly? Romilly, do you<br />read me? This is Brand.
7252954 7253996 Romilly?
7254164 7256749 Dr. Brand. Cooper.<br />There's been an explosion.
7257375 7259168 Dr. Mann's compound.
7286780 7288822 TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!
7295205 7297164 Let me know when TARS is aboard.
7300794 7302670 Romilly did not survive.
7303880 7305547 I could not save him.
7305715 7307195 - TARS is in.<br />- I'll take her now.
7307342 7310219 - Do we have a fix on the Ranger?<br />- He's pushing into orbit!
7310387 7313389 If he takes control of<br />that ship, we're dead.
7314599 7317559 - He'd maroon us?<br />- He is marooning us.
7319562 7322064 I'll meet you guys<br />downstairs. Go wait by the car.
7329906 7334118 Come on! Give me your bag. Get in<br />the backseat. Get in the backseat now!
7339749 7341667 Dr. Mann, please respond.
7342293 7344378 Dr. Mann, please respond!
7344546 7346755 He doesn't know the<br />Endurance docking procedure.
7346923 7349425 - The autopilot does.<br />- Not since TARS disabled it.
7350635 7351677 Nice.
7351845 7354763 - What's your trust setting, TARS?<br />- Lower than yours apparently.
7358393 7361937 Do not attempt docking. I<br />repeat, do not attempt docking.
7362105 7363147 Please res...
7422582 7424958 Auto-docking sequence withheld.
7425126 7427795 - Override.<br />- Unauthorized.
7428505 7429838 Override.
7430340 7432216 Unauthorized.
7436346 7440474 Do not attempt docking. I repeat,<br />do not attempt docking. Please resp...
7484269 7486436 Moving slowly toward the Endurance.
7510962 7512546 Imperfect contact.
7512714 7514756 - Override.<br />- Hatch lockout.
7522557 7525100 - Is he locked on yet?<br />- Imperfectly.
7526936 7528187 Dr. Mann, do not...
7549667 7552669 Hatch lockout disengaged.
7561221 7564723 Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat,<br />do not open the hatch.
7565058 7566934 I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7567101 7569937 If you open the hatch, the<br />airlock will depressurize.
7595838 7598158 - What happens if he blows the airlock?<br />- Nothing good.
7604013 7606640 Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,<br />everything we've got, CASE!
7606808 7608517 - Thrusters are full!<br />- Back!
7608685 7610686 Relay my transmission<br />to the on board computer...
7610853 7612938 and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.
7613106 7614147 Dr. Mann...
7616734 7619611 I repeat, do not open<br />the inner hatch. I repeat...
7619779 7620821 Brand?
7621656 7623699 I don't know what he said to you...
7623866 7626535 but I am taking command of the Endurance.
7626995 7629037 And then we can talk about<br />completing the mission.
7632500 7634209 Dr. Mann, listen to me.
7635003 7637004 This is not about my life.
7637630 7640882 Or Cooper's life. This<br />is about all mankind.
7641467 7642884 There is a moment...
7649225 7650559 It is not sa...
7658860 7659901 Oh, my God.
7678212 7680537 CASE: There's no point<br />using fuel to chase...
7680549 7682174 Analyze the Endurance's spin.
7687430 7689639 - Cooper, what are you doing?<br />- Docking.
7694228 7697064 Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
7697231 7699691 Okay, get ready to match<br />our spin with the retro thrusters.
7699859 7701943 - it's not possible.<br />- No...
7702111 7703278 it's necessary.
7714916 7717084 Endurance is hitting stratosphere!
7721130 7723173 She's got no heat shield.
7726302 7728053 - CASE, you ready?<br />- Ready.
7736479 7739648 Cooper! This is no time for caution.
7741192 7743652 CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.
7743820 7746279 TARS, get ready to engage<br />the docking mechanism.
7753329 7754830 Endurance is starting to heat.
7754997 7756331 Twenty feet out.
7756499 7759000 I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.
7759168 7761169 Ten feet out.
7761337 7763839 Cooper, we are lined up.
7764006 7765590 Initiating spin!
7807175 7808383 Come on, TARS.
7816642 7818185 Come on, TARS!
7829405 7831823 - We are locked, Cooper.<br />- Locked. Easing up!
7839707 7841041 Easy.
7842210 7843543 Easy.
7849383 7850884 Retro thrusters!
7858851 7860352 Main engines on.
7866108 7868818 Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.
7876827 7878495 Killing main engines!
7879747 7881414 Okay, we're out of orbit.
7888756 7891633 Okay. And for our next trick!
7893469 7897305 it'll have to be good. We're<br />heading into Gargantua's pull.
7898224 7899266 Oh, shit.
7899767 7901560 - CASE, take the stick.<br />- Roger that.
7951527 7953862 Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.
7955197 7957157 Shall I use main engines?
7957325 7958366 No.
7958951 7961202 We got to let her slide as far as we can.
7970004 7972881 - Give it to me.<br />- There's good news, there's bad news.
7973049 7976676 Yeah, I've heard that one,<br />TARS. Give it to me straight.
7985519 7988730 The backup generator kicked in, so<br />the system's stable. They're all good.
7988898 7989939 Good.
7990358 7993693 Okay. The navigational hub<br />has been completely destroyed.
7993861 7996821 We don't have enough life<br />support to make it back to Earth...
7996989 7999074 but we can scratch our<br />way to Edmunds' planet.
7999241 8000575 What about fuel?
8000993 8003495 Not enough. But I have a plan.
8004121 8008124 We let Gargantua pull us<br />down close to her horizon.
8008626 8011878 Then a powered slingshot around,<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
8012046 8014547 - Manually?<br />- That's what I'm here for.
8014715 8017425 I'm gonna take us just<br />inside the critical orbit.
8017593 8020113 - What about time slippage?<br />- Neither of us has time to worry...
8020262 8021930 about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.
8026560 8028061 I'm sorry, Cooper.
8031190 8034442 Once we've gathered enough<br />speed around Gargantua...
8034777 8036611 we use Lander 1...
8037113 8039406 and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...
8040574 8042575 push us out of the black hole's gravity.
8044912 8047580 The Lander's linkages<br />have been destroyed...
8047748 8050083 so we'll have to control manually.
8051293 8054754 Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...
8054922 8056631 And get sucked into that black hole.
8057258 8059217 Why does TARS have to detach?
8059385 8061428 We have to shed the<br />weight to escape the gravity.
8061595 8062971 Newton's third law.
8063139 8065849 The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere...
8066016 8067559 is to leave something behind.
8067727 8070770 Cooper, you can't ask<br />TARS to do this for us.
8070938 8074774 He's a robot. So you don't<br />have to ask him to do anything.
8074942 8076234 Cooper, you asshole!
8076610 8078611 Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
8078863 8081114 It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
8081449 8083908 It's our only chance to<br />save people on Earth.
8084076 8087287 If I can find a way to transmit<br />the quantum data I'll find in there...
8087455 8089289 they might still make it.
8090332 8092959 Let's just hope there's<br />still someone there to save.
8121447 8123114 Maximum velocity achieved.
8124366 8126868 Prepare to fire escape thrusters.
8127036 8128119 Ready?
8128287 8129704 Ready.
8129872 8131039 Ready.
8131207 8134334 Main engine ignition in three... two...
8134960 8136795 one. Mark.
8150226 8151476 Come on, baby.
8152645 8154813 Lander 1 engines, on my mark.
8155147 8156189 Three...
8156607 8159400 two... one. Mark.
8164740 8167325 Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.
8167493 8169869 Three, two, one...
8170412 8171579 - Mark.<br />- Fire!
8181715 8184884 This little maneuver's<br />gonna cost us 51 years!
8185761 8188263 You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!
8203654 8206823 Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.
8207491 8209492 Three, two...
8211120 8212704 one. Mark.
8212872 8213955 Detach!
8217126 8219627 - Goodbye, TARS.<br />- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
8219795 8222797 - See you on the other side, Coop.<br />- See you there, Slick!
8231307 8232891 Okay, CASE.
8233934 8237312 - Nice reckless flying!<br />- Learned from the master.
8237771 8240356 - Ranger 2, prepare to detach.<br />- What?
8240524 8243443 No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?
8243903 8247614 Newton's third law. You got<br />to leave something behind.
8247781 8250199 You told me we had enough<br />resources for both of us.
8250367 8252118 We agreed, Amelia...
8252494 8253953 90 percent.
8255831 8256915 Don't.
8259126 8260293 Detach.
8273390 8276142 Okay, I am nosing down.
8279939 8281940 Approaching the event horizon.
8284193 8286444 Portside, dipping down beneath it...
8287029 8288696 to go through it.
8290282 8293117 Heading towards blackness.
8293452 8295453 I have a visual of the event.
8295955 8297330 It's all black.
8299458 8301125 TARS, do you read me?
8301460 8302961 It's all blackness.
8304964 8306965 TARS! Do you read me? Over.
8311804 8312971 Okay.
8314181 8315431 Screens...
8317059 8318559 getting interference.
8320270 8322855 Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.
8323440 8325608 Flashes of lightness and blackness.
8326819 8329320 The turbulence in the<br />gravity is increasing.
8334243 8335493 Ah.
8335995 8338830 The computers are going down. Agh.
8349925 8352760 Gravitational pull. I'm<br />losing control of the stick.
8386128 8387795 Murph? Murph, come on!
8393469 8395470 Eject. Eject.
8396972 8398056 Eject.
8398474 8399640 Eject.
8400184 8401225 Eject.
8401935 8403019 Eject.
8515215 8516257 Murph.
8526226 8528394 Murph! Murph! Murph!
8536778 8537820 Murph!
8545037 8546954 No, no, no!
8547122 8548414 Murph!
8548582 8550082 Murph!
8550250 8551292 No! No!
8610978 8612937 If you're leaving, just go.
8613438 8614605 No, no. No.
8616191 8618526 No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.
8618694 8619986 Don't go!
8621947 8623614 Morse. Morse.
8624366 8625408 Morse.
8626618 8628411 Dot. Dot.
8628578 8629620 S.
8635752 8636794 T.
8641383 8642466 A.
8642634 8643718 Dash!
8646513 8647847 Dash! Dash!
8648348 8649390 Murph!
8649558 8651559 Murph, we don't have<br />time for this! Come on!
8651977 8653102 Y.
8658400 8659442 "Stay!"
8670537 8672872 Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!
8673540 8675333 What's it say? What's it say, Murph?
8676126 8677209 What's it say?
8687763 8688888 "Stay."
8724633 8726092 Tell him, Murph.
8726259 8727468 Make him stay.
8730806 8732473 Make him stay, Murph.
8741483 8743359 Make him stay, Murph.
8744820 8746946 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8750158 8752576 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8758375 8760709 No! No! No!
8781398 8782898 It was you.
8794369 8796412 You were my ghost.
8806131 8809133 Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.
8810927 8813429 - TARS?<br />- Roger that.
8815223 8817850 - You survived.<br />- Somewhere...
8818393 8820436 in their fifth dimension.
8820604 8822938 They saved us.
8823106 8828319 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"? And<br />just why would they want to help us?
8828487 8831197 I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space...
8831364 8834658 inside their five-dimensional<br />reality to allow you to understand it.
8834826 8836785 Yeah, that ain't working.
8836953 8838496 Yes, it is.
8838663 8842541 You've seen that time is represented<br />here as a physical dimension.
8842709 8845544 You have worked out that you<br />can exert a force across space-time.
8846213 8849381 Gravity to send a message.
8849758 8851091 Affirmative.
8853678 8854803 Gravity...
8855931 8859266 can cross the dimensions, including time.
8859601 8860893 Apparently.
8864773 8866774 Do you have the quantum data?
8867192 8868817 Roger. I have it.
8869778 8873781 I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,<br />but nothing is getting out, Cooper.
8873949 8876200 I can do this. I can do this.
8876660 8879411 But such complicated data to a child?
8879579 8880704 Not just any child.
8880872 8882248 What else?
8882791 8884959 Oh, come on, Dad.
8887128 8889296 Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
8889464 8893467 Even if you communicate it here, she won't<br />understand its significance for years.
8894261 8895719 I get that, TARS.
8895887 8900558 But we've got to figure something out or<br />the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!
8900725 8902309 Cooper...
8902477 8904979 they didn't bring us<br />here to change the past.
8908567 8910067 Say that again.
8910235 8913696 They didn't bring us<br />here to change the past.
8918118 8920077 No, they didn't bring us here at all.
8924708 8926375 We brought ourselves.
8935635 8939680 TARS, give me the<br />coordinates for NASA in binary.
8940223 8942683 In binary. Roger. Feeding data.
8967000 8968917 "It's not a ghost."
8970670 8972171 "it's gravity."
8972505 8974173 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8974841 8976634 I brought myself here!
8977510 8981013 We're here to communicate<br />with the three-dimensional world.
8981431 8982931 We're the bridge!
8990940 8992733 I thought they chose me.
8996071 8999740 - But they didn't choose me, they<br />chose her. TARS: For what, Cooper?
9002243 9003911 To save the world.
9008208 9012586 All of this is one little girl's<br />bedroom. Every moment.
9012921 9014338 It's infinitely complex.
9014506 9019259 They have access to infinite time and<br />space, but they're not bound by anything!
9019427 9024098 They can't find a specific place<br />in time. They can't communicate.
9025600 9028602 That's why I'm here. I'm<br />gonna find a way to tell Murph...
9028770 9030270 just like I found this moment.
9030438 9032773 - How, Cooper?<br />- Love, TARS, love.
9032941 9035266 It's just like Brand<br />said. My connection with
9035278 9037361 Murph, it is quantifiable. it's the key!
9037529 9039405 What are we here to do?
9040323 9042199 Find how to tell her.
9044994 9046328 The watch.
9049457 9050624 The watch.
9052001 9053127 That's it.
9055630 9058632 We code the data into the<br />movement of the second hand.
9062262 9065472 TARS, translate the data<br />into Morse and feed it to me.
9065640 9069935 Translating data to Morse. Cooper,<br />what if she never came back for it?
9071604 9074273 She will. She will.
9075483 9077109 Murph, I can see his car!
9078319 9079486 He's coming, Murph!
9081322 9083157 Okay. I'm coming down.
9084617 9086118 How do you know?
9089330 9091165 Because I gave it to her.
9096546 9099047 Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
9102552 9103677 Dot-dot...
9105013 9106680 dash-dot.
9107140 9108807 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9109184 9111852 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112353 9113687 Dash-dash-dash.
9114022 9116273 Dash, dash, dash.
9134542 9135876 He came back!
9136795 9140964 It was him all the time!<br />I didn't know. it was him!
9142050 9144009 Dad's gonna save us.
9186761 9188011 Eureka!
9191766 9193100 It's traditional.
9197689 9199314 Eureka!
9204028 9205529 Did it work?
9205697 9207531 I think it might have.
9208908 9210200 How do you know?
9210368 9213745 Because the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.
9217584 9219585 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9220753 9222588 They're not "beings."
9223256 9224590 They're us.
9226634 9229761 What I've been doing for<br />Murph, they're doing for me.
9230305 9231805 For all of us.
9231973 9234224 Cooper, people couldn't build this.
9234392 9236768 No. No, not yet.
9237145 9238604 But one day.
9239272 9242482 Not you and me. But people.
9243151 9247195 A civilization that's evolved<br />past the four dimensions we know.
9253786 9255287 What happens now?
9317892 9319351 Mr. Cooper.
9323564 9325273 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
9325692 9327818 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9327986 9333031 Remember, you're no spring chicken<br />anymore. Actually, you are 124 years old.
9340039 9341373 Take it slow, sir.
9342291 9344584 You were, uh, extremely lucky.
9344919 9348255 The Rangers found you with only<br />minutes left in your oxygen supply.
9362437 9363770 Where am I?
9365440 9366982 Cooper Station.
9368401 9369943 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371946 9373989 Cooper Station.
9376451 9378452 Nice of you to name it after me.
9382290 9383373 What?
9383541 9386752 The station isn't named after you,<br />sir. It's, uh, named after your daughter.
9387253 9390255 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9390423 9392132 Is she still alive?
9394093 9395969 She'll be here in a couple weeks.
9397013 9399473 She is far too old to be<br />transferring from another station...
9399640 9402017 but when she heard that you'd been found...
9403227 9405937 well, this is, uh, Murphy<br />Cooper we're talking about.
9406814 9408315 Yes, it is.
9410443 9412944 We'll have you checked<br />out of here in a couple days.
9415615 9418116 I'm sure you'll be excited<br />to see what's in store.
9419368 9423330 I actually, uh, did a paper<br />on you in high school.
9423664 9425999 I know all about your life back on Earth.
9427668 9428835 Oh, yeah.
9429003 9430253 Right.
9432673 9438011 If... If you'll follow me, we've<br />got a really good situation for you.
9441349 9445393 So, uh, when I made my<br />suggestion to Miss Cooper...
9446312 9449106 I was delighted to hear that<br />she thought it was perfect.
9452485 9455779 It was just constant. Just<br />that steady blow of dirt.
9455947 9458865 Of course, I didn't<br />speak to her personally.
9459033 9461034 We always set the plate upside-down.
9461202 9463954 Glasses or cups, whatever<br />it was, upside-down.
9464122 9469042 Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Uh, like everybody else back then.
9469210 9471670 There just wasn't enough food.
9471838 9474548 We wore little things, little strips...
9474715 9479886 of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
9480054 9483515 Well, it was pretty exciting<br />for me because it was hope.
9483683 9485870 I don't care who<br />describes it, there is no way
9485882 9487894 for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.
9488062 9491731 She did confirm just how<br />much you loved farming.
9492066 9493733 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah.
9493901 9495110 Come here.
9495695 9500657 Home sweet home. Everything<br />replaced and put back where it...
9507039 9509082 - Hey, is this...?<br />- Oh, yeah.
9509250 9512252 The machine we found out near<br />Saturn when we found you. Yes.
9512420 9515088 Its, uh, power source was shot,<br />but we could get you another one.
9515256 9517424 Yes. Please.
9518634 9519968 Settings.

9545578 9547495 Let's make that 60 percent.
9549790 9551917 Sixty percent confirmed.
9552543 9555629 - Knock-knock.<br />- You want 55?
9560509 9562636 Is this really what it was like?
9564847 9567265 It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.
9571771 9575440 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9577526 9579819 I want to know where we are.
9581447 9582989 Where we're going.
9587536 9590622 - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.<br />- Yeah.
9590790 9591873 Family?
9592041 9595919 Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's<br />been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
9628995 9630870 You told them I like farming.
9636836 9638503 It was me, Murph.
9640965 9642757 I was your ghost.
9644051 9645677 I know.
9647471 9652183 People didn't believe me. They<br />thought that I was doing it all myself.
9652351 9653393 But....
9656272 9658231 I knew who it was.
9663195 9665363 Nobody believed me.
9665865 9668283 But I knew you'd come back.
9670870 9672078 How?
9674081 9677208 Because my dad promised me.
9683257 9685258 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9686552 9687886 I'm here.
9689347 9690680 No.
9692767 9696895 No parent should have to<br />watch their own child die.
9699815 9702484 I have my kids here for me now.
9705279 9706780 You go.
9709700 9711201 Where?
9714705 9716289 Brand.
9726133 9727759 She's out there...
9734183 9735934 setting up camp.
9762420 9764129 Alone...
9765297 9767966 in a strange galaxy.
9778853 9783523 Maybe right now she's<br />settling in for the long nap....
9801876 9804711 by the light of our new sun...
9820186 9822228 in our new home.
