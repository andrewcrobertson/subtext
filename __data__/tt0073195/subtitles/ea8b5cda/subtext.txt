188021 191149 - What's your name again?<br />- Chrissy.
192275 195111 - Where are we goin'?<br />- Swimming.
198573 202619 Slow up. Slow down some.
203203 207165 I'm not drunk. Slow down.
209000 211419 Wait. I'm coming.
213421 215090 I'm coming.
216508 218927 I'm definitely coming.
220512 221971 Hold on.
234275 235944 I can swim.
237237 240699 I just can't walk or undress myself.
265974 267934 Come on in the water.
268226 271062 Take it easy. Take it easy.
329162 330413 Help me!
330789 332916 I'm coming. I'm coming.
336252 338088 It hurts!
345762 347138 Oh, my God!
360652 362153 Please help!
400442 403778 How come the sun didn't<br />use to shine in here?
407991 412495 We bought the house in the fall,<br />and this is summer.
417625 420128 Somebody feed the dogs.
421338 422672 Right.
427552 429471 Do you see the kids?
437395 439773 They must be in the backyard.
439898 442442 In Amity you say "yard."
444319 449449 They're in the "yard",<br />not too "far" from the "car."
452952 455955 - How's that?<br />- Like you're from New York.
458375 462170 Mom, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.
462253 465382 You were playin' on those swings,<br />weren't you?
465507 470428 Those swings are dangerous.<br />Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.
470553 472597 I think you're gonna live.
472681 476059 - It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.<br />- Hello.
476184 478269 - Yes.<br />- Can I go swimmin'?
478937 481189 Let me clean this thing off first.
481314 485235 What do they usually do?<br />Wash up or float up? Or what?
490949 494619 Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...
496955 502544 ...15, 20 minutes. All right?<br />- Dry you off. Go on, get a Band-Aid.
504087 506381 Got to go. Missing person.
506548 509926 Season hasn't started.<br />Nobody's even here yet.
514764 516641 Listen, Chief...
517392 520353 ...be careful, will ya?<br />- In this town?
520770 522063 Hi, Dad.
522480 524983 Wait a minute. Let me get on.
525316 528820 - I want my cup back!<br />- You'll get it.
530321 533742 Wave goodbye. Bye.
571279 573656 Nobody saw her go into the water?
573782 577702 Somebody could've.<br />I was sort of passed out.
578953 582332 - You mean, she ran out on you?<br />- No, sir.
585460 587379 She must've drowned.
588213 591132 Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?
591675 594302 - You live here?<br />- No. Hartford.
595053 598181 I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.
598306 601518 - Your folks were born here, right?<br />- I'm an Islander.
601643 604270 They moved off when my dad retired.
604396 606981 - You an Islander?<br />- No. New York City.
607107 609275 You here for the summer?
609818 611277 Come on.
627502 628920 Hold it.
644936 646563 Oh, Jesus.
677886 682307 You're up awful early.<br />Is the Chief in there?
684934 690190 - Chief, what have you got on?<br />- Lf this new filing system is to work...
690315 694486 ...you must keep that old stuff<br />off my desk. Just the pending.
694569 698531 Yes, Chief. We got a bunch<br />of calls about the Karate school.
698656 702827 It seems that the 9-year-olds<br />from the school have been...
702994 706081 ...karate-ing the picket fences.
707457 711002 Chief Brody's office.<br />The Medical Inspector.
727102 730105 The Fire Chief wants you to go over...
730230 734234 I want a list of the water activities<br />that the city fathers...
734359 736277 ...are planning for today.
736403 737779 Hendricks!
738238 740782 Where do we keep<br />the "Beach Closed" signs?
740865 742450 We never had any.
742909 746830 There's a truck with New Hampshire plates<br />in front of my store.
748081 752460 Just have him fill out the form.<br />Just fill it out.
779779 784159 Look what the kids did to my fence.<br />Eight and nine-year-olds...
784242 786369 - Glasses?<br />- Yeah, glasses.
787787 791458 I'll call you later in the afternoon.<br />I promise.
798131 801134 This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.
801259 804304 The summer ginks come<br />down here in June.
804763 808016 You haven't got one thing<br />on here I ordered.
808183 813104 Not a beach umbrella,<br />not a sun lounger, no beach balls.
813605 815940 If I can't get service...
825283 828411 Polly sent me to tell you<br />that there's a bunch...
828536 833208 ...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay,<br />doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.
833333 836544 I couldn't call them in,<br />there's no phones out there.
836670 838838 Come on, get out of there.
838963 842634 Take this stuff back to the office<br />and work on those signs.
842759 846930 "Beaches Closed. No Swimming.<br />By order of the Amity P.D."
847138 848932 Let Polly do the printing.
849057 853144 - What's the matter with my printing?<br />- Let Polly do the printing.
853770 855689 Chief Brody!
859901 861736 What have you got there?
861820 865365 We had a shark attack at South Beach<br />this morning, Mayor.
865490 868076 Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.
868410 871579 Albert, come on, you kook.<br />Keep your arms up.
880714 884050 Charlie, take me out to those kids, will ya?
914039 917625 You're gonna shut down<br />the beaches on your own authority?
917709 921629 - What other authority do I need?<br />- You need a civic ordinance...
921755 925592 ...or a resolution by the board.<br />- That's going by the book.
925717 930638 We're really a little anxious that you're<br />rushing into something serious here.
930764 933433 This is your first summer, you know.
933558 935477 What does that mean?
936394 940815 I'm only trying to say<br />that Amity is a summer town.
941775 943568 We need summer dollars.
944486 949449 If they can't swim here, they'll be glad<br />to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...
949574 951618 ...the Hamptons, Long Island.
951701 954412 That doesn't mean we serve<br />them a smorgasbord.
954537 958124 But we've never had<br />that kind of trouble in these waters.
959084 962796 What else could've done that?<br />A boat propeller?
962921 966424 I think possibly yes, a boating accident.
966508 969219 That's not what you told me<br />over the phone.
969344 973348 I was wrong.<br />We'll have to amend our reports.
973556 976935 - And you'll stand by that?<br />- I'll stand by that.
979312 983441 A summer girl goes swimming,<br />swims out a little far.
983566 987779 - She tires, fishing boat comes along...<br />- It's happened before.
987904 992325 I don't think you appreciate<br />the reaction people have to these things.
992450 996287 I appreciate it.<br />I'm just reacting to what I was told.
997872 1000041 It's all psychological.
1000375 1004921 You yell "Barracuda!"<br />and everybody says, "What?"
1007507 1009426 You yell, "Shark!"...
1011344 1015223 ...we've got a panic on our hands<br />on the Fourth of July.
1017767 1020562 Okay. You can take us back now.
1036453 1039664 I'm gonna get my raft<br />and go back out in the water.
1039748 1041958 Let me see your fingers.
1043460 1048673 - Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune.<br />- Just let me go out a little longer.
1048798 1051843 - Just 10 more minutes.<br />- Thanks.
1060268 1062062 All I want to know...
1062187 1066858 I just want to know one simple thing:<br />When do I get to become an Islander?
1066983 1069569 Ellen, never. Never.
1069694 1073281 You're not born here,<br />you're not an Islander. That's it.
1145520 1148690 Don't bother him. Come right back.
1152527 1155071 I know you got<br />a lot of problems downtown...
1155196 1159242 ...but I've got a couple of problems<br />I wish you'd take care of.
1159367 1164956 One, I've got some cats parking<br />in front of the house, I can't get...
1168460 1173173 What I need is a red zone.<br />It's simple, you could take care of it.
1173298 1176092 Would you come here a minute, please?
1181681 1183433 Are you okay?
1183808 1186102 Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
1186227 1190231 Look, if the kids goin'<br />in the water is worrying you...
1190648 1193735 ...they can play out here on the beach.
1193818 1196029 It's all right. Let them go.
1208333 1209793 It's cold.
1212045 1217509 We know all about you, Chief.<br />You don't go in the water at all, do you?
1218343 1220720 That's some bad hat, Harry.
1227602 1230522 Chief Brody, you are uptight.
1232482 1235819 Come on. That's it.
1252502 1254504 Tippet! Tippet!
1292000 1294085 Did you see that?
1305764 1307098 Blood!
1312937 1314731 Everybody out!
1318234 1320153 Get them out!
1328286 1331247 Michael, get out of the water!
1347430 1348682 Alex!
1372539 1376209 We don't even know<br />if there's a shark around here.
1376418 1379671 I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.
1380380 1384634 I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.<br />This is turning into a contest.
1384759 1389431 It's not just the <i>Gazette</i>.<br />She's advertising in out of town papers.
1390181 1394769 I suggest we move to council chambers<br />where we'll have more room.
1395020 1397480 I'm responsible for public safety here.
1397564 1401067 Then go out tomorrow<br />and see that no one gets hurt.
1401735 1404904 It's a small story.<br />I'll bury it as deep as I can.
1405030 1408825 The ad is gonna run on the back<br />along with the grocery ads.
1410160 1412162 Right in here, please.
1414289 1416291 Move on in, please.
1434017 1436519 Why do you insist on playing the heavy?
1436644 1441399 I have a point of view and it speaks<br />for many of the people here.
1445403 1449866 Not only me, because I have the motel.<br />How do you feel about it?
1450200 1452327 Let's have some order.
1454871 1457374 Let's have some order, please.
1458792 1460752 Any special questions?
1462087 1466466 Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark<br />in cash or check?
1468593 1472847 I don't think that's funny.<br />I don't think that's funny at all.
1472972 1474933 All right, all right.
1476351 1480772 That's private business between<br />you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
1482982 1485735 Martin, would you please...
1486903 1488613 Chief Brody.
1491157 1495120 I just want to tell you<br />what we're planning so far.
1495245 1497414 What about the beaches, Chief?
1497539 1502335 We're gonna put on the extra<br />summer deputies as soon as possible.
1502961 1506798 And then we're gonna try<br />and use shark spotters on the beach.
1506923 1510260 Are you going to close the beaches?
1514639 1516349 Yes, we are.
1519436 1524024 We're also bringing in some experts<br />from the Oceanographic Institute.
1525984 1527861 Only 24 hours.
1528862 1530989 I didn't agree to that.
1533033 1534909 Only 24 hours.
1535577 1539122 24 hours is like three weeks.
1568693 1572739 You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.
1574783 1579871 I'll catch this bird for you.<br />It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.
1581164 1586044 Not like goin' down to the pond<br />and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.
1587712 1590674 This shark, swallow you whole.
1592258 1597389 Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.
1598932 1600684 And we got to do it quick.
1600809 1606022 Got to bring back the tourists that'll put<br />your businesses on a payin' basis.
1607691 1610235 But it's not gonna be pleasant.
1610652 1614364 I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.
1615699 1621162 I'll find him for $3,000,<br />but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.
1622122 1624624 You got to make up your minds.
1625250 1627585 Gonna stay alive and ante up...
1627711 1631881 ...gonna play it cheap<br />and be on welfare the whole winter.
1633842 1636970 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1637095 1640265 There's too many captains on this island.
1641558 1644686 $10,000, for me, by myself.
1645478 1650900 For that, you get the head,<br />the tail, the whole damn thing.
1656156 1658867 Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.
1660744 1664205 We'll take it under advisement.
1668043 1671713 Mr. Mayor, Chief...
1674090 1676217 ...ladies and gentlemen.
1717884 1721012 Oh, God, you scared me.
1727644 1730814 People don't even know<br />how old sharks are.
1731231 1735193 If they live 2,000,<br />3,000 years they don't know.
1735985 1739781 Enough. You're not going to be able<br />to go to sleep tonight.
1739906 1742534 Here. Come on.
1744494 1745870 Thanks.
1757048 1759759 Want to get drunk and fool around?
1760343 1761845 Oh, yeah.
1767017 1769769 Mikey really loves his present.
1771438 1772897 Where is he?
1773690 1775275 Sitting in it.
1778778 1780280 Good God.
1785326 1788121 All right, Michael, out of the boat.
1789372 1793084 Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.
1793543 1795628 I'm helpin' Michael.
1795837 1798089 - Get out of that boat.<br />- Hi, Dad.
1798173 1800508 Just a little longer. Please?
1800633 1804262 - It's his birthday tomorrow.<br />- I don't want him on the ocean!
1804387 1808808 He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.<br />He's not gonna go in the water.
1808933 1814397 I don't think he'll go in the water again,<br />after what happened yesterday.
1816107 1818026 Now don't say that.
1819152 1822364 I don't want that to happen,<br />you know that.
1824532 1827994 I want him to read the boating regulations,<br />the rules...
1828119 1830789 ...before he goes out on his own.
1831373 1836461 Michael, did you hear your father?<br />Out of the water now!
1847555 1851101 I'm tired.<br />Let's stop before someone reports us.
1853311 1856815 The chief lives on the other side<br />of the island.
1857273 1859818 Am I comin' in straight?
1861027 1862779 Just keep rowin'.
1873456 1877669 We better catch something,<br />this is my wife's holiday roast.
1878336 1882340 Don't worry about it.<br />$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.
1892225 1896438 Come and get it.
1900316 1902861 The tide's takin' it right out.
1906948 1908742 Can't we go home?
1984693 1986903 He's takin' it.
1988655 1990615 Go, go, go.
2027736 2032741 Charlie, take my word for it.<br />Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.
2036870 2042083 Come on, Charlie, swim to me!<br />Keep comin'.
2048631 2051968 - I can't get up.<br />- Give me your hand, Charlie.
2054554 2059225 - Help me!<br />- Get your feet out of the water!
2076076 2078286 Can we go home now?
2089589 2094094 So then Denherder and Charlie<br />sat there tryin' to catch their breath...
2094219 2099724 ...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife<br />what happened to her freezer full of meat.
2099849 2103061 That's not funny. That's not funny at all.
2103269 2106564 Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad<br />in <i>Field and Stream</i>.
2106690 2109651 Looks more like <i>The National Enquirer</i>.
2111528 2116408 All right, hold it, hold it.<br />Hold everything. I said, hold it!
2124124 2128628 - Hello.<br />- Hello, back, young feller. How are you?
2129629 2133717 Say, I hope you're not goin' out<br />with those nuts, are you?
2138930 2141307 The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.
2141433 2145020 You have to move out,<br />or he can't get out at all.
2146146 2151359 Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it.<br />You got a paddle on the boat?
2151651 2155196 Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.
2157824 2160577 How many guys are you gonna put<br />in that boat?
2160702 2162454 Whatever's safe, right?
2162579 2166708 - Yeah, well that ain't safe.<br />- Watch it, that's dynamite.
2168752 2172714 - Where are you goin' with that?<br />- I'm goin' on the boat.
2173089 2176885 - Help me get those guys out of the boat.<br />- Sure.
2179137 2184601 Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you<br />that you're overloading that boat.
2185018 2187312 Go on, get out of here.
2187604 2191232 - You ain't going. What do you care?<br />- Can you tell me...
2191358 2194235 ...if there's a good restaurant<br />or hotel here?
2194361 2196863 Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
2198031 2200033 They're all gonna die.
2201284 2205205 Listen to me.<br />We've got some road block signs outside.
2205330 2207999 You've got to get somebody to help us.
2208124 2211711 Yeah, get those road block signs<br />out on the highway.
2211836 2216049 Because we've got more people<br />down here than we can handle.
2216174 2219969 What are you doing?<br />These are your people. Go talk to them.
2220053 2222305 They aren't mine. They're from all over.
2222430 2227352 You see the plates in the parking lot?<br />Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...
2227477 2231564 I'm all by myself out there.<br />What happened to the extra help?
2231690 2234651 That's not until the Fourth of July.
2234776 2238113 You know those guys<br />in that fan-tail launch out there?
2238196 2241116 None of them will get<br />out of the harbor alive.
2241241 2245704 That's what I'm saying. You know<br />their names. Talk to those clowns.
2245829 2251084 - Everyone seems to be having a good time.<br />- Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.
2251209 2254379 Could you tell me<br />how I could find Chief Brody?
2254462 2255755 Who are you?
2255880 2259592 Matt Hooper.<br />I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.
2260051 2264139 For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.<br />I'm Brody.
2264264 2266766 - I'm glad to meet you.<br />- Me, too.
2266891 2270437 I know you got a lot<br />on your hands right now, but...
2270520 2274858 The best thing for me to do is<br />to see the remains of the first victim.
2274983 2276735 The girl on the beach.
2277193 2279904 - Just bear with me, will ya?<br />- Sure.
2281656 2285535 Wait'll we get them silly bastards<br />down in that rock pile.
2285660 2287412 There'll be some fun.
2287537 2290957 They'll wish their fathers<br />had never met their mothers...
2291082 2295503 ...when they start diggin' the bottoms out<br />and slammin' into them rocks.
2295628 2299049 Get away from there, you goddamn fool!
2299299 2301134 What's the matter with you?
2301259 2304262 You want to swamp us,<br />you crazy son of a bitch?
2305305 2308016 What are these guys doin' out here?
2309309 2313104 - What are they doin' back there?<br />- They're chummin' right now.
2313229 2316358 - What is that?<br />- They're tracking the shark now.
2316483 2320403 $3,000 divided four ways is what?
2331122 2334084 Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
2338630 2342676 Victim identified as Christine Watkins,<br />female Caucasian.
2342967 2347138 - And here's the way we have it.<br />- Probable boating accident.
2354896 2360902 The height and weight of the victim can<br />only be estimated from the partial remains.
2367200 2370245 The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.
2370370 2374332 There are no major organs remaining.<br />May I have a glass of water?
2374457 2380130 The right arm has been severed<br />above the elbow with massive tissue loss...
2380296 2382924 ...in the upper musculature.
2383925 2385885 Thank you, very much.
2389055 2393184 Partially denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
2393309 2399190 - Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?<br />- No. It was only local jurisdiction.
2404154 2410160 The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum<br />and portions of the rib cage are intact.
2410243 2413371 Do not smoke in here.<br />Thank you very much.
2415206 2417667 This is what happens.
2418793 2425050 Indicates the non-frenzy feeding<br />of a large <i>squalus</i>, possibly <i>longimanus</i>...
2425425 2427552 ...or <i>isurus glaucus</i>.
2429387 2433183 The amount of tissue loss<br />prevents any detailed analysis...
2433308 2437062 ...however, the attacking <i>squalus</i><br />must be larger...
2438313 2441566 ...than any normal <i>squalus</i><br />found in these waters.
2441691 2444569 Didn't you get a boat<br />and check these waters?
2445111 2447697 This is not a boat accident.
2448281 2452869 And it wasn't any propeller.<br />It wasn't any coral reef.
2453328 2455789 And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
2459626 2461544 It was a shark.
2482190 2486152 I wanna go AP and UPI.<br />I wanna get on the state wire services.
2486361 2488947 See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.
2489072 2493034 Call Dave Axelrod in New York<br />and tell him he owes me a favor.
2493159 2497038 This is the shot I want<br />with everybody and the fish in it.
2497163 2500458 Guys, could we please get organized?
2500542 2503503 I want to get a picture for the paper.
2504921 2509718 - Ben Gardner get this?<br />- No, no. We caught it.
2512095 2516182 - That's swell.<br />- It's a beauty, eh?
2517809 2521604 I need a picture for the paper.<br />Clear out of the way, please.
2521730 2525358 Just the guys that caught the fish.<br />Open it up a little bit.
2525483 2528361 I want to get a picture<br />of the guy with the fish.
2530113 2534576 I need a picture for the paper.<br />Could we get the sign please?
2546212 2549674 Young fella,<br />could you step out of the picture?
2553303 2555013 We're ready.
2556723 2560143 - Can you get that, please.<br />- How's that?
2568193 2570403 Larry, you won't believe it.
2570528 2573865 - What kind of a shark is that?<br />- I don't know.
2574115 2578036 - I think it's a mako.<br />- It's got a deep throat, Frank.
2578119 2582123 - Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?<br />- Tiger shark.
2584167 2585585 A what?
2585919 2587545 We can start breathing again.
2587671 2591007 - Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?<br />- You bet he is.
2591091 2593885 What is this bite radius crap?
2595679 2601017 You stuff your friggin' head in there man,<br />and find out if it's a man-eater.
2606356 2609859 All I'm saying,<br />is that it may not be the shark.
2610985 2615407 I want you to meet Matt.<br />This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.
2615990 2620286 - Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.<br />- Nice to meet you.
2623123 2626835 There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.
2626918 2629713 Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...
2629838 2633383 And the chances that these bozos got<br />the exact shark...
2633508 2638221 - There are no other sharks like this here.<br />- It's 100 to 1.
2639347 2644019 I'm not saying that this is not the shark.<br />It probably is, Martin.
2644394 2648023 It's a man-eater.<br />It's extremely rare for these waters.
2648148 2651943 The fact is,<br />the bite radius on this animal is different...
2652068 2654487 ...than the wounds on the victim.
2656489 2659617 I want to be sure. You want to be sure.
2659743 2663788 We all want to be sure. Okay?<br />What I want to do is very simple.
2663913 2667417 The digestive system<br />of this animal is very, very slow.
2667542 2671546 Let's cut it open.<br />Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...
2671671 2675717 ...is bound to still be in there.<br />And then we'll be sure.
2683183 2686102 It may be the only way to confirm it.
2686311 2689105 Look, fellas let's be reasonable.
2689564 2692359 This is not the time or the place...
2692692 2696821 ...to perform some kind<br />of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.
2698323 2702660 I am not going to stand here<br />and see that thing cut open...
2702786 2707457 ...and see that little Kintner boy spill out<br />all over the dock.
2738071 2739948 I just found out...
2742325 2745495 ...that a girl got killed here last week.
2747580 2749374 And you knew it.
2750709 2753586 You knew there was a shark out there.
2756715 2759050 You knew it was dangerous.
2759759 2763138 But you let people go swimming anyway.
2768268 2770645 You knew all those things...
2775400 2778153 ...but still my boy is dead now.
2783742 2786870 And there's nothing you can do about it.
2794502 2796421 My boy is dead.
2803553 2805805 I wanted you to know that.
2823073 2825658 I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.
2828119 2829829 No, she's not.
2836503 2838088 All right, fellas...
2838171 2842926 ...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down<br />before it stinks up the island.
2843051 2847722 Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow<br />and dump it in the drink.
2937771 2939147 Come here.
2943777 2945362 Give us a kiss.
2946112 2947280 Why?
2950450 2952243 Because I need it.
2957999 2959709 Get out of here.
2962962 2966800 The door was open.<br />Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.
2966925 2968760 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2968885 2972681 Your husband's home?<br />I'd really like to talk to him.
2973056 2974724 Yes, so would I.
2977769 2979521 Can I get you some coffee?
2981189 2982899 Wine. How nice.
3006589 3008341 How was your day?
3016141 3017475 Swell.
3021438 3024983 I got red and white.<br />I didn't know what you'd be serving.
3025108 3026818 That's nice.
3028570 3030613 Is anyone eating this?
3042876 3045754 My husband tells me you're in sharks.
3049591 3055013 Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it<br />quite put that way. But yes, I am.
3055847 3057432 I love sharks.
3057557 3060435 - You love sharks?<br />- Yeah, I love them.
3060602 3065940 When I was 12 years old, my father got me<br />a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.
3066066 3068777 I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...
3068860 3072530 ...I hooked a four and a half foot<br />baby thresher shark...
3072739 3075325 ...who proceeded to eat my boat.
3076326 3080497 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
3080622 3084626 He turned an inboard into an outboard.<br />Scared me to death...
3084751 3086961 ...and I swam back to shore.
3087087 3089047 When I was on the beach...
3089172 3092634 ...I turned around and I saw my boat<br />being taken apart.
3092759 3096054 Ever since then,<br />I have been studying sharks...
3096137 3100225 ...and that's why I'm gonna go<br />to the Institute tomorrow...
3100308 3104187 ...and tell them that you still have<br />a shark problem here.
3104270 3108441 - Why do you have to tell them that?<br />- I'm sorry, I thought that...
3108566 3110777 You told me the shark was caught.
3110902 3114197 I heard it on the news.<br />I heard it on the Cape station.
3114280 3117367 They caught a shark, not the shark.
3117992 3121204 Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.
3121371 3124916 And probably not the shark<br />that killed the little boy.
3125041 3128253 Which I wanted to prove<br />by cutting the shark open...
3128378 3131464 You may want to let that breathe...<br />Nothing.
3155488 3160326 You'll be the only rational man<br />left on this island after I leave tomorrow.
3160452 3162370 Where are you going?
3164039 3166207 I am going on the Aurora.
3166416 3172422 - The Aurora? What is that?<br />- It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.
3172547 3175008 Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.
3175133 3179137 Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.
3180305 3184768 Martin sits in his car when we go<br />on the ferry to the mainland.
3185518 3190190 I guess it's a childhood thing.<br />There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?
3190315 3191816 Drowning.
3193109 3198448 Is it true that most people get attacked<br />by sharks in three feet of water...
3198615 3201284 ...about 10 feet from the beach?
3203536 3207248 And before people started<br />to swim for recreation...
3207374 3211086 ...I mean before sharks knew<br />what they were missing...
3211211 3214756 ...that a lot of these attacks<br />weren't reported?
3216591 3218134 That's right.
3219969 3223723 Now this shark that swims alone,<br />what's it called?
3223848 3226226 - Rogue.<br />- Rogue, yeah.
3227435 3229145 Now, this guy...
3229312 3233566 ...he keeps swimmin' around in a place<br />where the feeding is good...
3233692 3238113 ...until the food supply is gone. Right?<br />- That's called territoriality.
3238238 3242367 It's just a theory<br />that I happen to agree with.
3245745 3250917 Then why don't we have one more drink<br />and go down and cut that shark open?
3253712 3255422 Can you do that?
3259968 3263304 I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.
3271521 3274482 We start in the alimentary canal...
3276526 3279446 ...open the digestive tract.
3317108 3320195 - Just like I thought.<br />- What?
3320904 3325283 Came up from the Gulf Stream<br />from southern waters.
3331790 3334167 He didn't eat a car, did he?
3335418 3338672 Tiger shark's like a garbage can.<br />It'll eat anything.
3338797 3342008 Somebody probably threw that in the river.
3350600 3351976 That's it.
3354646 3357982 I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.
3359359 3362153 You got a bigger problem than that.
3362570 3365407 You still got a hell of a fish out there...
3365532 3368076 ...with a mouth about this big.
3373915 3376626 How do we confirm that by morning?
3377460 3382298 If he is a rogue, and there's any truth<br />to territoriality at all...
3382757 3386636 ...we could spot him<br />between Cape Scott and South Beach.
3386761 3390223 - Where're you going?<br />- To find him. He's a night feeder.
3390348 3393476 - On the water!<br />- We're not gonna find him on the land.
3393601 3395729 I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.
3395812 3398148 - Yes, you are.<br />- No, I'm not!
3398523 3400608 - I can't do that.<br />- Yes, you can.
3411995 3415957 I'm tellin' you,<br />the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.
3416875 3421504 There's so many problems, you never feel<br />like you're accomplishing anything.
3421629 3424716 Violence, rip-offs, muggings.
3425508 3429679 The kids can't leave the house.<br />You've got to walk them to school.
3429804 3433099 But in Amity,<br />one man can make a difference.
3434392 3439230 In 25 years, there's never been a shooting<br />or a murder in this town.
3440148 3443485 No kidding? Want a pretzel?
3444486 3445904 Where are we?
3446029 3449783 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.
3452744 3455205 Can you get the Late Show on this thing?
3455330 3460585 No, it's a closed circuit TV system.<br />I have underwater cameras fore and aft.
3461461 3465465 Who pays for all this stuff?<br />The Government? The Institute?
3465590 3468134 This stuff cost a lot of money.
3470220 3474391 - I paid for this mostly myself, actually.<br />- You're kidding.
3476184 3477977 - You rich?<br />- Yeah.
3479104 3480730 How much?
3480855 3483441 Personally or the whole family?
3485026 3489698 Doesn't make any sense.<br />They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
3492283 3497539 It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates<br />the water to live on an island, either.
3497664 3501501 It's only an island<br />if you look at it from the water.
3501918 3504170 That makes a lot of sense.
3511636 3513805 What is that thing doing?
3516933 3518685 It's a fish finder.
3518810 3524065 It's probably just a school of mackerel<br />or something, all clumped together.
3526526 3528028 Wait a minute.
3534284 3537746 - There's somethin' else out there.<br />- What is it?
3538621 3541916 About 100 yards, south, southwest.
3585669 3588630 - That's Ben Gardner's boat.<br />- You know him?
3588713 3592676 It's all banged up. Sure I know him.<br />He's a fisherman.
3595261 3596805 What happened?
3605188 3607774 I got to go down there and check their hull.
3607899 3610402 Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?
3610527 3613863 We will. I just got to check something out.
3614114 3616157 Keep the lights going.
3647022 3648690 Let's tow it in.
3648773 3652068 Don't worry, Martin.<br />Nothing's gonna happen.
3658533 3661244 What am I supposed to do<br />while you're gone?
3661369 3666666 Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br />Don't touch any of the equipment.
3669627 3672005 I'll be back in two minutes.
3781573 3783825 This is a great white. A big one.
3783908 3788705 Any shark expert in the world<br />will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.
3789080 3794294 A great white shark has staked a claim<br />in the waters off Amity Island.
3794419 3798340 He'll continue to feed here<br />as long as there's food in the water.
3798465 3802260 There's no limit to what he'll do.<br />We've had three incidents.
3802385 3805138 Two people killed in a week.<br />It'll happen again.
3805221 3807724 It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.
3807849 3810393 - Five people were killed...<br />- In one week.
3810518 3812312 Tell him about the swimmers.
3812437 3816524 A shark is attracted to the exact kind<br />of splashing and activity...
3816649 3820153 ...that occurs whenever people swim.<br />You can't avoid it.
3820236 3823073 If you open the beaches<br />on the Fourth of July...
3823198 3826618 ...it's like ringing the dinner bell,<br />for Christ sakes.
3826868 3831831 I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass,<br />out of a boat out there.
3831956 3834167 It was the tooth of a great white.
3834292 3839089 It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.<br />I helped tow it. You should've seen it.
3839172 3843259 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3843426 3844844 I didn't see it.
3844969 3848306 - He dropped it on the way in.<br />- I had an accident.
3848473 3851893 And what did you say<br />the name of this shark is?
3854187 3857691 It's a <i>carcharodon carcharias</i>.<br />It's a great white.
3857816 3860235 You don't have the tooth?
3862487 3865198 We depend on the summer people<br />for our lives...
3865323 3869411 You are not gonna have a summer<br />unless you deal with this problem.
3869536 3873832 We have to close the beaches,<br />and hire somebody to kill the shark!
3873957 3875709 We have to tell the Coast Guard.
3875834 3879421 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3879921 3882507 You'll have to ring this entire harbor.
3882632 3887095 I don't think either one of you<br />are familiar with our problems.
3888179 3891266 I know that you are going to ignore...
3891391 3895520 ...this problem until it swims up<br />and bites you on the ass!
3895854 3899566 Wait a second.<br />There are two ways to deal with this.
3899649 3903945 You're either gonna kill this animal,<br />or cut off it's food supply.
3904029 3906281 We have to close the beaches.
3908742 3910326 Sick vandalism.
3910785 3915582 That is a deliberate mutilation<br />of a public service message.
3916666 3920003 I want those little paint-happy<br />bastards caught...
3920086 3924049 ...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.<br />- That's it. Goodbye.
3924174 3929179 I won't waste my time arguing with a man<br />who's lining up to be a hot lunch.
3929262 3930972 Don't do this.
3940523 3946363 What we are dealing with here,<br />is a perfect engine, an eating machine.
3947572 3952994 It's really a miracle of evolution.<br />All this machine does is swim...
3953370 3957374 ...and eat, and make little sharks.<br />And that's all.
3958208 3962003 Now, why don't you take a long,<br />close look at this sign.
3962128 3965674 - Those proportions are correct.<br />- You'd love to prove that.
3965757 3968927 Get your name<br />into the <i>National Geographic</i>.
3984234 3988446 Larry, if we make an effort today,<br />we might be able to save August.
3988905 3993493 August? For Christ sake,<br />tomorrow's the Fourth of July.
3993618 3995829 And we will be open for business.
3995954 3998707 This will be the best summer<br />we've ever had.
3998832 4003753 If you are concerned about the beaches<br />do what you have to, to make them safe.
4003878 4007424 But those beaches will be open<br />for this weekend.
4035910 4039122 I want to know how many men<br />you're going to send.
4039247 4041833 I don't need to come to Brisbane...
4041916 4044794 ...when I have a great white shark<br />right here.
4045503 4048173 <i>We need men to patrol the swimming area.
4048298 4051926 <i>We've got to have help. </i><br /><i>Anybody with a gun or a boat.

4072614 4077744 Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?<br />He's the little guy with a crew cut.
4099140 4103770 Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?<br />Could you connect me, please?

4156531 4159659 Nothing, here, Martin.<br />And nothing on sonar.
4160285 4165081 Amity Island has long been known<br />for it's clean air, clear water...
4165457 4168043 ...beautiful white sand beaches.
4168460 4170045 But in recent days...
4170128 4174674 ...a cloud has appeared on the horizon<br />of this beautiful resort community.
4174758 4178219 A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.
4215131 4219552 - Hi, Larry.<br />- Why aren't you in the water?
4221346 4226601 I just put some sun tan lotion on,<br />and I'm trying to absorb some...
4226768 4229229 Nobody's going in.
4230271 4232899 Please, get in the water.
4310226 4311895 Do me a favor, will you?
4312020 4316775 You and the other guys take the boat<br />and put it in the pond instead.
4317692 4319569 The pond's for old ladies.
4319652 4324157 I know it's for the old ladies,<br />but just do it for the old man.
4325700 4328995 - All right.<br />- Thanks.
4344803 4347097 I've got Sean.
4356564 4358400 Michael, wait!
4358775 4361945 Michael, I don't like you no more.
4393685 4396271 Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.
4396688 4399149 Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
4405655 4408867 False alarm. Must be this glare.
4422672 4426551 I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news<br />that we have...
4426634 4432640 ...caught and killed a large predator<br />that supposedly injured some bathers.
4433058 4435101 As you see, it's a beautiful day.
4435185 4439272 The beaches are open,<br />and people are having a wonderful time.
4439356 4442567 "Amity," as you know, means "friendship."
4457082 4461252 My God!

5080372 5084334 I'm not talkin' about hookin'<br />some poor dogfish or sand shark.
5084459 5087212 I'm talkin' about finding a great white.
5087295 5090256 Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?
5096638 5099015 Just tie me a sheepshank.
5102602 5106481 I haven't had to pass basic seamanship<br />in a long time.
5107774 5110819 You didn't say how short you wanted it.
5114155 5115615 How's that?
5120036 5121830 Gimme your hands.

5146730 5150942 I don't need this.<br />I don't need this working class hero crap.

5209793 5213296 What are you?<br />Some kind of half-assed astronaut?
5224724 5228812 Take that stuff down below<br />and you lash it secure.
5235360 5237404 Jesus H. Christ!
5238071 5244077 When I was a boy, every squirt wanted<br />to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.
5245537 5249624 What have you got here?<br />A portable shower or a monkey cage?
5249749 5253545 - An anti-shark cage.<br />- Anti-shark cage?
5255255 5257382 You go inside the cage?
5259968 5262095 Cage goes in the water?
5262554 5265724 You go in the water? Shark's in the water.
5267392 5268768 Our shark.
5271521 5276818 "Farewell and adieu to you,<br />fair Spanish ladies
5278069 5282657 "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

5333333 5335043 Colorful, isn't he?
5335168 5336961 He scares me.
5339631 5344386 - Don't use the fireplace in the den.<br />- What am I gonna tell the kids?
5348973 5351351 Tell them I'm going fishing.
5357565 5361778 Break it up, will ya, Chief?<br />Daylight's wastin'.
5365281 5367492 Front: bow. Back: stern.
5368201 5370120 Better get it right, squirt...
5370245 5374708 ...or I throw your ass out<br />the little round window on the side.
5375166 5378003 This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
5378753 5381047 See you got your rubbers.

5403403 5406823 If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow.
5411369 5415540 Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
5427093 5429220 How's the Missus, Chief?
5430555 5435060 If they don't like you goin' out,<br />they'll love you comin' in.
5467300 5471346 Keep that chum line goin'.<br />We got five good miles on it.
5474099 5477811 - Who's driving this boat?<br />- Nobody. The tide.
5479437 5484359 One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.<br />Had to stick two barrels in him.
5484484 5487445 Two to wear him down and bring him up.
5488571 5491658 Nowadays, these kids,<br />they take out everything.

5500333 5502043 Jesus H. Christ.
5503962 5507465 Best drop another chum marker.
5535410 5537328 Damn it, Martin!
5538371 5540498 This is compressed air.
5540623 5545003 - What the hell kind of a knot was that?<br />- You pulled the wrong one.
5545128 5549132 You screw around with these tanks,<br />and they're gonna blow up.
5549215 5553720 Yeah, that's real fine,<br />expensive gear you've brought out here.
5555138 5558600 I don't know what<br />that bastard shark's gonna do with it.
5558725 5563605 Might eat it, I suppose.<br />Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.
5568818 5572697 Next time,<br />you just ask me which line to pull, right?
5580580 5583750 Little brown eel comes out of the cave...
5584834 5587003 ...swims into the hole...
5588838 5592592 ...comes out of the hole,<br />back into the cave again.
5594427 5596596 It's not too good, is it?
5597597 5601142 Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.
5702410 5703787 I got it.
5705914 5708458 - What?<br />- Get behind me.
5712712 5714923 Hooper, reverse her!
5715965 5718510 Takin' a hell of a lot of line.
5719010 5722514 Get the scoop out of the bucket.<br />Wet the reel.
5729104 5731106 Reverse her!
5734567 5738738 Duck your head down.<br />We're swingin'. Get behind me again.
5739572 5743159 No more water.<br />I don't want you to drown me.
5743952 5748206 Hooper, you idiot, starboard!<br />Ain't you watchin' it!
5753253 5755255 Hooper, neutral.
5764222 5766057 Where'd he go now?
5767642 5769561 He ain't foolin' me.
5771021 5773189 What's he yankin' on now?
5774733 5776484 Go on, try it.
5792459 5796254 I don't know, Chief,<br />if he's very smart or very dumb.
5805055 5806431 Jesus...
5811144 5812979 He's gone under.
5813229 5817442 He's gone under the boat.<br />I think he's gone under the boat.
5818985 5820904 Yeah, it's too easy.
5821071 5825075 He is a smart, big fish.<br />He's gone under the boat.
5825742 5829829 Keep her steady, now.<br />I got somethin' very big.
5830080 5831831 I don't think so.
5833333 5835752 Chief, put your gloves on.
5836753 5839547 You put your gloves on, both of you.
5843051 5845595 Getting ready to run out again.
5846554 5848640 Quint, let it go.
5850016 5853603 You may be big in the lab,<br />but out here you're just cargo.
5853687 5857273 If you don't want to backstroke home,<br />you get down here.
5857399 5861111 You don't want to listen to me,<br />don't listen to me.
5861194 5865365 - It's not a shark.<br />- The wire's showing!
5865490 5867033 Unbuckle me.
5868451 5872747 - Get the other side.<br />- It's a tuna or swordfish.
5876376 5878044 Take this rod.
5879295 5882424 - Give the Chief a hand, will you?<br />- Right!
5895979 5899149 It's a marlin or a stingray...
5900150 5902902 ...but it's definitely a game fish.
5917625 5919627 Gamin' fish?
5920211 5924007 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
5924382 5926926 Don't you tell me my business again.
5927052 5931556 - You get back on the bridge.<br />- Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.
5931681 5933600 It proves one thing.
5933767 5938396 It proves that you wealthy college boys<br />don't have the education enough...
5938521 5940774 ...to admit when you're wrong.
5952452 5955789 What's the point? Hooks and lines?
5958958 5962045 You lose one, you rig one.
5967717 5971012 Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now.<br />Full throttle.
5971096 5972972 Aye, aye, sir.
5975600 5979688 You see, what I do, Chief,<br />is I trick 'em to the surface.
5980230 5982148 And then jab at 'em.
5982732 5986945 I'm not gonna haul 'em up<br />like a lot of catfish.
5988154 5989489 Full throttle.
5989614 5992909 I don't have to take this abuse<br />much longer.
5993326 5996871 Your head's bleeding. First aid there.
6032741 6035493 Start that chum line again, will ya?
6038997 6041124 Let Hooper take a turn.
6041499 6044461 Hooper drives the boat.
6063521 6066107 Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.
6066191 6068526 Slow ahead, if you please.
6069611 6071863 You heard him. Slow ahead.
6083249 6084793 Slow ahead.
6085335 6090590 I can go slow ahead. Come on down<br />and chum some of this shit.
6112028 6114614 You're gonna need a bigger boat.
6134050 6136094 Shut off that engine.
6170962 6174299 - That's a 20-footer.<br />- 25.
6175592 6177385 Three tons of him.
6184309 6187270 We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?
6187645 6189439 Gotta get to work.
6189731 6191733 How do we handle this?
6192734 6195487 Come up front, Martin. I need you.
6197781 6199908 He's circling the boat.
6216716 6221429 <i>Amity Point Light Station to Orca. </i><br /><i>This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
6221554 6223056 <i>Come in, Orca.
6224265 6228603 - Orca. Come in.<br />- <i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.
6228812 6230188 Put her on.
6231272 6234901 - Come on, Martin! Move!<br />- I'm not goin' out there!
6235110 6240907 Beyond the edge of the barrels.<br />Go to the end of the barrels, further out.
6241282 6242784 - Further out.<br />- Why?
6242909 6244744 - Go further out.<br />- What for?
6244869 6247247 Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
6247372 6250166 - What?<br />- Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
6250291 6254004 I need something<br />in the foreground to give it some scale.
6254087 6255505 Foreground my ass!
6255630 6259551 Your husband's okay. He's fishin'.<br />He just caught some stripers.
6259676 6262178 We'll bring 'em for dinner.<br />We won't be long.
6262303 6264681 We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
6264931 6267726 - I'm not staying here!<br />- I'm begging you!
6267851 6269519 Goddamn it!
6270103 6272605 Come here, come here, darlin'.
6279654 6283199 I want you up on the bridge,<br />just take her forward, steady.
6283283 6288621 - I've never steered a boat in my life.<br />- Just watch my hand, take her steady.
6289456 6292834 Attach the end of this line to the first keg.
6294044 6297672 I've got to get a good shot<br />at that porker's head.
6321446 6323448 Get clear of the bow.
6329162 6332457 - Hurry up, will ya?<br />- Your turn, Quint.
6333291 6335251 Hooper, where are you?
6340173 6342467 Hurry it up now, tie it on.
6344302 6347305 He's comin' straight for us!<br />Don't screw up now.
6347430 6349224 Don't wait for me.
6352477 6356231 Come on, Hooper. Come on.<br />Hurry it up. Tie it on.
6357273 6358942 Now. Now.
6363738 6365281 Kill it!
6366700 6367742 Now!
6370412 6371788 Shoot!
6375959 6377168 Time.
6379504 6384592 What were you doin', anyway?<br />I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.
6385260 6389139 Let's see how long that barrel takes<br />to bring him up.
6391057 6395061 Free another barrel.<br />I'm comin' around again.
6462379 6464756 What do we do now? We're quittin', right?
6464881 6469886 We got one barrel on him.<br />We stay out here until we find him again.
6470303 6473014 We could radio in and get a bigger boat...
6505046 6507716 Don't you worry about it, Chief.
6508842 6510844 It won't be permanent.
6511094 6513888 You want to see something permanent?
6521980 6525442 You want to feel somethin' permanent?
6526985 6531489 Just put your hand underneath my cap.<br />You feel that little lump?
6532073 6535744 Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.
6541458 6543251 I got that beat.
6553470 6555221 It's a moray eel.
6556348 6559017 It bit right through my wet suit.
6561478 6565565 I don't know about that,<br />but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...
6565648 6568818 ...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.<br />See this?
6568943 6571696 I can't extend that. You know why?
6572030 6574324 'Cause in the semi-final...
6574741 6577535 ...celebrating my third wife's demise...
6577660 6581539 ...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.
6596971 6598473 Look at that.
6600892 6602811 That's a bull shark.
6603311 6606398 He scraped me when I was takin' samples.
6607732 6609859 I got something for you.
6610860 6614698 There's a thresher.<br />You see that? A thresher's tail.
6615490 6617784 - Thresher?<br />- It's a shark.
6621538 6625458 - You want a drink? Drink to your leg?<br />- I'll drink to your leg.
6625583 6628253 So we drink to our legs.
6634884 6638638 I got the <i>crème de la crème</i>.<br />Right here. Hold on.
6640390 6642225 Here, you see that?
6642934 6645103 You're wearin' a sweater.
6646062 6648648 Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.
6650608 6652402 She broke my heart.
6665623 6667334 What's that one?
6667584 6671087 - What?<br />- That one, there. On your arm.
6674632 6677093 A tattoo. I got that removed.
6678011 6681556 Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother."
6688646 6690315 What is it?
6696905 6699532 That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
6709959 6712420 You were on the Indianapolis?
6712629 6714214 What happened?
6716591 6721846 Japanese submarine slammed<br />two torpedoes into her side, Chief.
6723556 6727727 I was comin' back<br />from the island of Tinian to Leyte...
6727852 6731773 ...just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
6736152 6739155 1,100 men went into the water.
6739489 6742075 Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
6745120 6748748 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour.
6749040 6751251 Tiger, 13-footer.
6751376 6755005 Know how you know that<br />when you're in the water?
6755130 6758675 You tell by lookin'<br />from the dorsal to the tail.
6761386 6763388 Well, we didn't know.
6764180 6767559 Because our bomb mission<br />had been so secret...
6768935 6772022 ...no distress signal had been sent.
6780363 6783616 They didn't even list us overdue<br />for a week.
6785869 6789831 Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...
6790874 6794169 ...so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
6796880 6801051 Kinda like old squares in a battle<br />like you see on a calendar...
6801134 6803219 ...like the Battle of Waterloo.
6803345 6806681 The idea was,<br />the shark comes to the nearest man...
6806806 6810393 ...and he starts poundin'<br />hollerin' and screamin'.
6810477 6812979 Sometimes the shark would go away...
6815398 6817776 ...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
6817901 6821363 Sometimes that shark,<br />he looks right into you...
6821488 6823615 ...right into your eyes.
6824991 6828244 You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...
6828703 6830455 ...lifeless eyes.
6830914 6833875 Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
6835877 6839798 When he comes at you,<br />he doesn't seem to be livin'...
6840423 6842509 ...until he bites you.
6842801 6846554 Those little black eyes<br />roll over white and then...
6849015 6852977 ...then you hear<br />that terrible high-pitched screamin'.
6853603 6855647 The ocean turns red...
6856523 6861027 ...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin',<br />they all come in.
6863363 6865490 They rip you to pieces.
6871538 6874749 You know, by the end of that first dawn...
6876876 6878712 ...we lost 100 men.
6880755 6883675 I don't know how many sharks.<br />Maybe 1,000.
6883800 6887637 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
6888680 6892058 On Thursday mornin',<br />I bumped into a friend of mine...
6892183 6894894 ...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.
6896813 6899899 Baseball player, Bosun's mate.
6903028 6905155 I thought he was asleep.
6906156 6908533 Reached over to wake him up.
6909909 6914289 He bobbed up and down<br />in the water just like a kind of top.
6915498 6917000 Upended.
6922213 6925592 He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.
6930388 6935393 Noon the fifth day,<br />a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
6935518 6939064 He swung in low and he saw us.<br />He was a young pilot.
6939147 6941608 Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...
6941733 6944611 ...and he came in low,<br />and three hours later...
6944736 6948823 ...a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
6949240 6952911 That was the time I was most frightened.
6953703 6955872 Waitin' for my turn.
6957624 6960585 I'll never put on a life jacket again.
6963630 6966424 So, 1,100 men went into the water...
6967384 6969511 ...316 men come out.
6969594 6974391 The sharks took the rest<br />June the 29th, 1945.
6978436 6982941 Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
6998456 6999874 What's that?
7001209 7002794 It's a whale.
7005255 7010802 "Farewell and adieu to you,<br />fair Spanish ladies
7013138 7019019 "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"
7024941 7029738 "Show me the way to go home
7031531 7036703 "I'm tired and I want to go to bed
7038496 7044294 "I had a little drink about an hour ago
7044878 7050008 "And it's gone right to my head
7051468 7056473 "Wherever I may roam
7057724 7062771 "By land, or sea, or foam
7076534 7080330 "Show me the way to go home
7080872 7084709 "I'm tired and I want to go to bed
7084876 7088088 "I had a little drink about a hour ago
7088213 7091299 "And it's gone right to my head
7091383 7094260 "Wherever I may roam
7094803 7097639 "On land or sea or foam
7097806 7101976 "You can always hear me singing this..."
7105980 7107899 Start the engines.
7120453 7121913 Fire her up!
7132799 7135010 Put out the fire, will ya?
7147147 7149190 - Pump her out.<br />- Done.
7160160 7163121 - Everybody on deck.<br />- He ate the light.
7163246 7165206 - Terrific.<br />- Excuse me.
7168418 7172088 Quint, what are you doing?<br />Don't waste your time.
7174049 7176176 What's wrong with this?
7179137 7183933 Hooper, take the wheel.<br />Brody, follow that. Watch for him.
7206081 7207749 You okay?
7210377 7211670 You okay?
7243326 7245078 More left rudder.
7246204 7248039 Pull your left hand down.
7248164 7251793 I can't. It'll only go about three inches.
7251960 7256715 All of our injectors got scored<br />from the salt water in the fuel.
7258091 7261302 Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.
7262345 7267934 Try the left rudder again. More left.<br />Good. Once again now.
7273023 7274524 There it is.
7274983 7277110 What do you say, Chief?
7277360 7280572 The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.
7285326 7289622 I think he's right under the keg.<br />Grab the boat hook.
7305096 7307599 If we can get close enough...
7308850 7314731 ...l've got things on board that'll kill it.<br />- Just want to goose him up. Come on.
7329496 7333792 When he runs, you drop that rope<br />or you'll lose your hands.
7335919 7341216 I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.<br />Whole sea's bones, full of 'em.
7341758 7343885 Give it to me a minute.
7363113 7366241 Haul in that line or it'll foul us.
7367325 7369160 Start the engine.
7371663 7375667 - Where are you goin'?<br />- I'm gonna make a phone call.
7384092 7387137 Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?
7388722 7391599 Coast Guard, this is the Orca.<br />Do you read me?
7391683 7394811 Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...
7402444 7404362 Excuse me, Chief.
7405113 7410785 That's great. That's just great.<br />Now, where the hell are we?
7413371 7418126 You're certifiable, Quint.<br />You know that? You're certifiable.
7418293 7422172 - You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!<br />- Boys.
7424507 7428011 I think he's come back for his noon feeding.
7429512 7431681 Hook me up another barrel.
7470053 7472347 Bring her around after him.
7493410 7496413 Full throttle.<br />Get me right up alongside of him.
7496538 7500625 I can't rev it up that high,<br />it's not gonna take it.
7523064 7525066 Five degrees port.
7533825 7536202 All right, hold your course.
7543960 7546421 Five degrees port now.
7550800 7552594 Hold your course.
7554888 7557182 - Fast fish.<br />- Watch my hand.
7559100 7563355 Be sure you watch my hand.<br />Follow me. Follow me.
7565106 7568568 Lad, you watch him now.<br />Starboard. Starboard.
7570070 7571613 Run him down.
7581414 7583083 Hard apart.
7587587 7588797 Watch him.
7588922 7590382 Starboard.
7620954 7625083 I can't believe it.<br />Two barrels and he's going down again.
7631923 7633717 It's incredible.
7641516 7643893 - They're up again!<br />- Now what?
7655238 7660535 Why don't we lead the shark into shore<br />instead of him leading us out to sea?
7666291 7668418 Grab a couple of poles.
7671296 7673965 Hang on now, we're going around.
7674799 7677886 Into starboard. Easy.
7679095 7683641 I'm gonna back her off now.<br />Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.
7689898 7692442 All right, gentlemen, snag them.
7699324 7702535 Now then tie them to the stern cleats.
7706289 7709542 Brody, bring your end around the cleat.
7710502 7714798 That's right, it'll lock itself off.<br />Give him room, Brody.
7717175 7719302 Stay clear of the line.
7729479 7731606 Watch it. Stand clear.
7744202 7747539 Stand away from those stern cleats.
7763847 7766307 Back home we got a taxidermy man.
7766433 7770603 He gonna have a heart attack<br />when he sees what I brought him.
7779320 7783158 Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.
7785910 7789247 My God, this one, too. They're both going.
7789664 7795045 - He's eating his way through that line.<br />- He's working his way right up to us.
7795837 7798923 Come on, Quint. Hurry!
7801384 7802927 Out of my way.
7809517 7810810 Watch it.
7815857 7819069 Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.
7823907 7825575 Make it fast.
7826826 7829245 I can't. It's trying to run.
7832916 7835377 Pull, you son of a bitch!
7838546 7841508 Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.
7849974 7851726 It's impossible!
7872372 7874916 We're breaking up! Cut it!
7876751 7878545 Watch your hands!
7879796 7882382 Cut it quick. I can't hold it!
7909034 7912037 He can't stay down<br />with three barrels on him.
7912162 7914873 Not with three barrels, he can't.
7915206 7917042 What about us?
7919085 7922756 Get the pump out of the locker<br />in front of you, will you?
7922839 7924758 We're gonna sink, aren't we?
7924883 7928303 Keep an eye on the barrels.<br />Pump it out, Chief.
7936686 7938605 Starting to go under.
7939397 7943193 He can't with three barrels on him.<br />Not with three he can't.
7986736 7989406 You ever have one do this before?
7992409 7993702 No.
8033158 8035910 He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.
8043376 8046129 I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.
8046254 8051134 Draw him into the shallow water.<br />I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.
8051676 8054679 - We're headin' in, Brody.<br />- Thank Christ!
8064439 8067567 - You ever had a great white do that?<br />- No.
8075450 8077619 How far do we have to go?
8081247 8084459 Don't put that much pressure on it.
8096971 8100558 - Goddamn it.<br />- Shut up. Get back there.
8107732 8108983 Hold on.
