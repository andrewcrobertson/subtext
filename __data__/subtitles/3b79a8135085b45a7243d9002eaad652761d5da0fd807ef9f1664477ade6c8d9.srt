1
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, time to eat.

2
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,650
Let's see, open the app.

3
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,710
I'm gonna get a double pepperoni pizza,
order breadsticks and, well, lasagna,
yeah.

4
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,150
New item alert, jalapeno breadstick quick
bites.

5
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,990
Huh, it might be nice to have something in
the salad family.

6
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,390
And do I want dessert?

7
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,090
Ooh, I'm gonna be naughty, butterscotch
bedino.

8
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,970
Okay, I'm gonna have five.

9
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,690
Delivery, because of that saying, now
please.

10
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,690
Eh, all right, that oughta be til
breakfast.

11
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,630
Oh, hey, wait, are you guys early or am I
late?

12
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,390
No matter.

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,670
I have got a real treat for you today.

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,390
No, not a treat for you.

15
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,230
Okay.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,570
Anyway, about the treat, can I just say,
you will not be disappointed.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,150
It's a story about me that no one's ever
heard before, featuring someone in my life
you've never met.

18
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,310
I don't know about you, but color me
intrigued.

19
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh, yeah, drone delivery, welcome to the
future.

20
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,770
You know, to really understand everything,
I'm gonna have to take you back to where
it all began.

21
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,710
You don't want anything to take away from
the flavor of the cheese.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,700
And like every great story, it all started
on a dark and stormy night.

23
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,890
Wait here, Junior.

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,890
I'll be right back.

25
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,710
I'll be right back.

26
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,490
Oh.

27
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,370
Oh.

28
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,470
Hi there, little buddy.

29
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,310
Hi.

30
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,900
You hungry, little guy?

31
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
You want a little more?

32
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,620
Whoa, you are a hungry little guy.

33
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
That was a quick dinner, Senor John.

34
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,120
You must have been very hungry.

35
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,080
Can I bring you anything else?

36
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,700
Uh, yes.

37
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,080
Some lasagna?

38
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,780
Yes, lasagna for one.

39
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,780
Uh, yeah.

40
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,960
You know what? No, make it family style.

41
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,540
Very good.

42
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,700
To go, please, Vito.

43
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,380
Okay, everybody.

44
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,300
Where do you go?

45
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,420
Stand up and see.

46
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,880
Join with us.

47
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, no.

48
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,100
Oh, no, I'm dancing.

49
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,780
Excuse me. Pardon me if I hate this.

50
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,300
Oh, no.

51
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,200
John!

52
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,400
Take out for John!

53
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,380
Your takeout is ready, Senor John.

54
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes, one familia-style lasagna to go.

55
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,580
You eat alone too much, John.

56
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,420
You should get on the dating apps.

57
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,520
-There's bumble, tinder, gluten
-free singles, hot sauce, passions.

58
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:01,500
And you should spend serious money on
premium memberships.

59
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:01,880
Bye!

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh, hey.

61
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,340
Well, that was an interesting dinner that
you had.

62
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, I guess, um, this is where we say
goodbye.

63
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh, you're really cute, but I can't have
pets in my apartment.

64
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,840
So, I'll see you around, okay?

65
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,780
Go on.

66
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,800
Oh, no.

67
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,200
No, don't cry, don't cry.

68
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,860
Oh, oh.

69
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,900
No, no, no, no, no.

70
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,740
No. Oh, no. Oh, no.

71
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,020
You don't have a home, do you?

72
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,220
Excuse me, but you see, back in old
Napoli, that's Amore.

73
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,620
Amore, that's Amore.

74
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,120
And that's how I adopted John.

75
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,550
-So, I moved John out of his apartment to this nice little two
-bed
-two
-bath in the suburbs.

76
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,750
As soon as he understood the ground rules,
well, let's just say, we were living the
dream.

77
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,390
And once we were settled in, I even let
John get a pet.

78
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,230
Odie became my most trusted ally.

79
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,790
He was kind, gentle, and most importantly,

80
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:12,310
my unpaid intern.

81
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:21,610
Oh, yeah, as you can see, life here is
pretty near perfect.

82
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,760
Yeah, except for…

83
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:42,220
Time to go to the vet.

84
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
We're gonna need the big scale.

85
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,020
Does she need to announce it to the whole
office?

86
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,560
No, please, no. Ow, it's so hot. Ow, it's
really hurting. Ow, ow, ow.

87
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,170
And that's why we should go from Sunday to
Tuesday.

88
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,190
Okay, where were we?

89
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,090
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey. Good
morning.

90
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,860
What? Where'd you get that chair?

91
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
I think I was meant to be here tonight
because I was meant to meet you.

92
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
I think we were meant to be. That's what I
meant to say.

93
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
You had me at the word meant.

94
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,520
We're gonna run like the wind. Faster,
harder, more insane.

95
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,820
Odie, yeah, can you put this back to
normal?

96
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,160
There you go. Just let the pepperoni's
healing powers work its magic.

97
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,360
Oh!

98
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,940
You saw nothing.

99
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,480
Up until that moment, my life was a
perfect souffle.

100
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,830
Little did I know it was all about to
collapse.

101
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:14,490
Imagine yourself distract you or max out
your credit card by excessively placing
online food orders.

102
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,650
I swear.

103
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,050
Huh? Huh? Who said that?

104
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,070
Huh? Odie. Odie. Odie!

105
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,130
It's time for my midnight snack.

106
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,470
Thank you, good sir. Your kindness will be
rewarded.

107
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,190
What are we feeling like tonight, huh?
French, Italian, Chinese, cupcakes,
Chinese it is.

108
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,790
Odie, shape everything from the bottom two
shelves into a dumpling.

109
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:21,310
Night night snacking.

110
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,160
Not good for digestion.

111
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
Odie, I'm dreaming again. Slap me across
the face.

112
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,280
Nope, still dreaming. I must be really
deep in this one.

113
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,680
What do you want? You want money? I don't
have any money, okay?

114
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,440
Who carries cash anymore?

115
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,140
-I've got John's credit card number. Memorize 555
-238
-575521. Did you write that down?

116
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,220
Expiration code is 555.

117
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
The cat is out of the bag.

118
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,320
I really hope this kidnapping plan works
or she'll put us down.

119
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,780
With her insults and cutting observations.

120
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,780
I think this is a case of mistaken
identity.

121
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,240
We must be looking for another gorgeous,
lovable kitty cat, right?

122
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,360
Hey, where are you going? Come back!

123
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,500
Odie, I'll handle this.

124
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,500
Alright you guys, I'm giving you to the
count of three to get back here and let us
down.

125
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,540
One, two, three.

126
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
Four, five.

127
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,580
I am not kidding here!

128
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,240
Three hundred and eight.

129
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,460
Three hundred and nine.

130
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,700
Three hundred and…

131
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,540
Yeah, they're not coming.

132
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,720
It's over.

133
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,420
Am I dead?

134
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,140
Are you an angel?

135
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,430
Please, take me.

136
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,930
-I am ready to go to that… to that all
-you
-can
-eat buffet in the sky.

137
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,250
What? Listen. I'm going to swing you out,
cut your ropes and drop you safely to that
landing below.

138
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,010
Wait, what? That seems a tad risky.

139
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,930
Is there another plan that doesn't involve
cutting a rope over a forty foot drop?

140
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,870
No tag. We gotta get out of here before
they come back.

141
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,410
We need to go. Come on, Junior.

142
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,790
Wait here, Junior. I'll be right back.

143
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,190
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

144
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,390
You.

145
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,430
Hey, Junior.

146
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,870
Who is he? This is Vic, my father.

147
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,530
Look, Junior, I know how you might be
upset.

148
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:45,550
Upset? Why would I be upset? You only
abandoned me in an alley as a kitten. I'm
probably just overreacting.

149
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,490
No, no, not her.

150
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,400
Okay, follow me, Junior.

151
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,260
No, no, no, no. You lost the privilege of
telling me what to do a long time ago.

152
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Hello, Vic.

153
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,060
Dang it.

154
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,280
Scarecam!

155
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,960
Oh, you should have seen your faces.

156
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,780
Okay, boys. Show me.

157
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,120
Hello, Vic.

158
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,510
Post that ASAP.

159
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,210
What? Hey, Jinx. I haven't seen you since…

160
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,650
Well, no hard feelings though, right?

161
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh, I don't think so.

162
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,550
I'm a hugger.

163
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,030
Part of me wants to be mad at her for
kidnapping us, but you gotta love her
energy.

164
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,530
Where are my manners?

165
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,690
Chop, chop, gentlemen. Look alive.

166
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,530
Perfection. You know, I was so delighted
that you accepted my invitation here
tonight.

167
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,930
-Well, throwing us in a burlap sack wasn't exactly an e
-vite.

168
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,730
Vic, you're so quiet.

169
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,230
-Are you feline sad? Cat got your tongue? Would you prefer a mu
-mo, sir?

170
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,990
Excuse me. How do you two know each other?

171
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,210
Let me handle this, Junior.

172
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,910
-Oh, don't Junior me. You may call me Garfield, Mr. Garfield, or G
-Money.

173
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,770
-Okay, whatever. No G
-Money. Anyway, can somebody please tell me what is going on?

174
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,910
I'll take this one.

175
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,860
What?

176
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,100
I'm from a small town outside London that
you've probably never heard of.

177
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh, I scratched and clawed my way through
hard times to come here with one dream.

178
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,610
I wanted to be seen.

179
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,410
I wanted to matter.

180
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,390
I was a failure.

181
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:28,490
The winner!

182
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:40,830
And then, I met Vic and his crew. They
were outcasts, losers, thugs.

183
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,030
We didn't have much, but we had each
other. We became a real family.

184
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,030
Vic and family. I know this is going.

185
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,890
Excuse me, Garcon. When might we expect
appetizers? Perhaps in a mouze bouche?

186
00:19:56,973 --> 00:20:03,890
And then, one night, we were about to make
our biggest score. Enough milk to last us
for weeks!

187
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:13,830
Vic!

188
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,750
Jinx, I tried to come back for you. You
have to know that.

189
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,950
Oh yes, you get an A for effort.

190
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,330
So what happened next?

191
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,770
Imagine Alcatraz, but smellier.

192
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:34,770
It was cold. And lonely. And stinky. So
very stinky. I can't overstate that
enough.

193
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,230
But it gave me purpose. I needed to get
out. I just needed help.

194
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,790
So your purpose was to escape jail and get
involved with charities?

195
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,430
Nope. My purpose was… revenge.

196
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,190
Oh, I see. I went the other way with it.

197
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:12,590
I'm kidding. Another cat would be bent on
revenge, but I'm a…

198
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,670
How do you put it?

199
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,670
-Evolved, compassionate, and incredibly self
-actualized.

200
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:25,010
Bingo! I had such trouble finding him, and
when I discovered you were his son, I had
no choice but to kidnap you to lure him
here.

201
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,870
Listen, I totally get it. It's all part of
being associated with Vic.

202
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,190
So what do you need from him to make this
right?

203
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:39,410
I simply want him to pay back the quart of
milk I lost that night. And we'll call it
even.

204
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,870
I can do that. What he can't do is raise a
child.

205
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,690
Just one quart. Just one quart. Done.

206
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,550
For every day I was in the pound.

207
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,030
What now? Nice twist. Well played.

208
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,470
How long were you in the pound again?

209
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,290
Four years, seven months, and two days.

210
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,670
Oh, that long? Alright, I'm gonna do the
math here in my brain. The way you do that
is…

211
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:03,830
Odie. 1675 quarts of milk. Exactly right,
Odie. We both came up with it at the exact
same time.

212
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,590
Where am I gonna find that much milk?

213
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,750
-Well, I suggest you go back to the place you double
-crossed me. Lactose Farms.

214
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:19,590
Wow. Well, good luck, Vic. I'll leave you
two to work out the fire print. We'll just
see ourselves out. Odie?

215
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,470
Uh, no. You're all going to do this.

216
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,390
What? Why me? He's the one who abandoned
you.

217
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,990
Yes, but this is more than a one-cat job.

218
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,530
-Yeah, but I'm sure Vic has a whole crew of low
-life cat burglars he could ask.

219
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:39,490
Oh, I'm sure he does. But if I'm being
completely honest, seeing how miserable
you make one another brings me endless
satisfaction.

220
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,690
Oh, well, thank you for your honesty. And
if I don't go?

221
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,810
You can stay and have a playdate with
Roland and Nolan.

222
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,310
Okay, boys. Go play!

223
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:05,230
Ma'am, I think this is an opportunity to
take a deep, cleansing breath and repeat
your anger management mantra.

224
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,890
Anyone else have any objections?

225
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,170
Nope, I'm good. Thanks for the
opportunity.

226
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,470
Excellent. Now you boys have 72 hours.

227
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:25,970
Or else.

228
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,590
I can't believe this is happening. I don't
see you for years.

229
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,730
And when I do, you pull me into a life of
crime.

230
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,030
I had this reunion playing differently in
my head, too.

231
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,330
That's the difference between us, because
I never wanted to see you again.

232
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,950
I totally understand your anger, but give
me a chance to explain. You see, I'm not
the bad guy you think I am.

233
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,790
A good guy doesn't leave his kid in an
alley.

234
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,430
It wasn't like that.

235
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:48,630
It was exactly like that!

236
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,430
No, it wasn't. Let me tell you…

237
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:55,850
No, no, I don't want to hear it. This
whole thing with jinx. This is your mess,
not mine.

238
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,930
Come on, Odie.

239
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,750
Can't let you do that.

240
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,330
We'll be watching you.

241
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,470
Like a hawk.

242
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,690
Is today a Monday? Because it feels an
awful lot like a Monday.

243
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,490
It's Thursday.

244
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:19,790
Not to me it's not.

245
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,050
Look, I know this isn't ideal, but we have
to do this.

246
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,490
So let's just try and make the best of our
time together.

247
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,210
Our time together? What are you talking
about?

248
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,430
Once we get this milk, I want you out of
my life. Forever.

249
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,070
Alright, just relax.

250
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,650
Lactose Farms ain't nothing but a sleepy
little mom and pop dairy.

251
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,810
This will be a quick grab and go. You'll
be back home before you know it.

252
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,630
So how do we even get to Lactose Farms?

253
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,830
It's way out in the country.

254
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:48,290
You ever jumped a train?

255
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,310
I've never jumped.

256
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,530
Well, if jumping a train is too hard, just
say it.

257
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,890
How hard can it be?

258
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,630
Exactly!

259
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,070
This is gonna be fun!

260
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,950
Garfield? Odie? Hello?

261
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,990
Garfield, how many times have I told you
to close the refrigerator door?

262
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,490
Wait, there's food on the floor.

263
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,550
He's never left food on the floor.

264
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:21,890
Garfield?

265
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,730
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

266
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,530
Garfield!

267
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,790
Our best shot at jumping on the train is
here.

268
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,470
Hold on a sec, I'm just taking in the wind
speed, the direction of the sun, and
various angles.

269
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,650
Yes, I say we jump the train from right
here.

270
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,890
Didn't I just say that?

271
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,490
We've been on television a million times,
we'll need a hundred feet of rope.

272
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,730
Uh-huh, rope, yeah, okay.

273
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,110
We'll throw the rope over that branch,
right there.

274
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,630
Can you follow me?

275
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,690
And then, timing it just right, we swing
over as the train passes by and land on
top of the car.

276
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,050
Or we can do this!

277
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,230
Odie, jump boy!

278
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,260
Part of me wants to help him.

279
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,580
No, this is how he learns.

280
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,920
I don't know, it's kind of pricey. How
does it handle?

281
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,900
I'll take it!

282
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,070
See? I told you this was going to be fun.

283
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,190
You and I have different definitions of
fun.

284
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,270
Oh, finally, hello!

285
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,010
You've reached Find My Pet. If your pet is
lost, we're here to help.

286
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,870
Hi, yes, great! Okay, my orange tabby and
my dog are both missing, and I need your
help.

287
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,310
Please, listen carefully, as our menu
options have changed.

288
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,390
If you'd like to hear this call in
Spanish…

289
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:13,450
What?

290
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,810
Come on.

291
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,110
What do I press to talk to a real person?

292
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,400
346.

293
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,060
Garfield, where are you?

294
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,590
Okay, I think you've got to figure this
out.

295
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,130
Jinx, you can't be trusted. And you've got
to keep Junior safe.

296
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,870
You've got to figure out a way to get him
out of this.

297
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,630
Tell me, is it a burr? It hurts. You
pulled my hair.

298
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,470
Is it a bug? A bug?

299
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,790
Ow, owie, owie, owie, owie, owie.

300
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:57,930
Howdy.

301
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,190
You know what, Junior? This is going to be
good for you.

302
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,950
What will be good for me?

303
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:12,850
What are we doing?

304
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,850
We're about to steal a truck full of milk
from a dairy to pay back a deranged cat.

305
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,550
What part of that is going to be good for
me?

306
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,250
All of it! You can't even imagine the life
lessons you're going to learn.

307
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,230
Oh yeah, name one.

308
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,110
But for starters, you already know how to
get on a moving train.

309
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,870
I found it funny.

310
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,570
All I'm saying is that to break into a
dairy is going to take a few skills.

311
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,470
-I'm guessing a rounded, mush
-filled, overly pampered indoor cat like you doesn't have.

312
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,010
So, we need to toughen you up.

313
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,970
Toughen me up? Hey, I know tough, Vic.

314
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:53,830
You've obviously never been in an Olive
Garden that's run out of breadsticks.

315
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,370
Anyway, I'm never going to need those
skills you're talking about.

316
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,530
But you'll have them.

317
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,770
I'm never going to break into a dairy or
anything else.

318
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,610
Ever again.

319
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,210
You are missing the point.

320
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,190
You're going to learn to improvise, stick
on your feet, develop moves that'll come
in handy out there in the real world.

321
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,250
I wouldn't be in the real world if it
wasn't for you.

322
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,290
Too rude. You'd still be hanging upside
down in the mall.

323
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,170
No, I would be asleep at home.

324
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,530
I'd be out on life all together.

325
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,090
Look, I'm just a dad trying to teach his
son some skills.

326
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,430
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't make
up for five years of not being around.

327
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,530
Ah, yes I can.

328
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,450
No, you can't.

329
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:31,990
I think I can.

330
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,790
In fact, you can't.

331
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,510
You really can't.

332
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,110
With your attitude, I can't.

333
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,970
Okay, whatever. Dad, wow, great lesson.

334
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,510
I'm done talking to you. You do not know
me. You don't know the first thing about
me.

335
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,810
I am not pampered. I'm not anything you
think I am.

336
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,340
Okay.

337
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,720
I'm just gonna say that blanket is not the
best idea.

338
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,100
Ah, fantastic. Thank you. I'll take it
from here.

339
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,560
Ah! Ah! They're everywhere! Get them off!
Get them off!

340
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,080
Get them off me!

341
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,200
What are you doing?

342
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,460
What'd you do?

343
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,480
See the chips. Spiders hate them.

344
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,060
See? Another life skill learned.

345
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,720
I think the words you're looking for are,
thank you pops.

346
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,480
No, the word I'm looking for is…

347
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,660
Oh, here's that stop.

348
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,240
Nelly, where?

349
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,420
Oh, Odie, you'd think he'd see that
coming.

350
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,290
Quaint. Just a simple little grab and go.

351
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,290
Okay. Okay, so they've done a few upgrades
since I was last here.

352
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:29,490
Stop being so dramatic. All we have to do
is climb the fence.

353
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Wait, is that Otto?

354
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,120
Who? Otto! Of Otto and Ethel?

355
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,460
Uh, no clue who you're talking about.

356
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,300
He's one of the mascots of lactose farps.
See?

357
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,720
On the side of the barn?

358
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,100
I'll bet he knows how to get into that
place.

359
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,040
Leave him alone. Seems to be in a period
of meditation. Or depression.

360
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,260
Yes, he does.

361
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,960
This calls for tact, sensitivity, and
diplomacy.

362
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,300
Oh yeah? Where we supposed to get that?

363
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,980
I have it. In spades.

364
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,560
Watch. Maybe you'll learn something.

365
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,440
Excuse me. You're Otto, right?

366
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,420
Hmm.

367
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,120
I'm Garfield. A pleasure.

368
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,780
Go away.

369
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,880
I just wanted to say I am a huge fan.

370
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,640
I have eaten everything that has a picture
of your face on it.

371
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,020
I'm not that guy anymore.

372
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,660
I even loved that recalled probe alone
from a few years back.

373
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,280
Yeah. Anyways, here's the thing. Me and my
crew back there.

374
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,880
We were in a bit of a bind. Got ourselves
in a situation.

375
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,000
Long story short, we could use your help.

376
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
You're a fan, huh?

377
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:04,920
Oh yes. Big time.

378
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,180
Then sing the jingle.

379
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,540
Wow. I don't really sing on command. I'm
not a circus animal.

380
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,360
Sing it.

381
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,120
Really?

382
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,920
Sing it.

383
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,260
Black toast farms. Black toast farms.

384
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,520
We've got milks, butters, creams, and
cheeses.

385
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,220
More spirit.

386
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,380
As much as you want. As much as it
pleases.

387
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,920
Livelier.

388
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,880
Come and take a look and see what we got.

389
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,260
Cause what we got is a whole lotta lot.

390
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:31,000
Ha ha. Bop chee bop. Bibbidi bop bop chee
bop.

391
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,880
Tasty goodness is our motto. Brought to
you by Atlanata.

392
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,240
What was that for?

393
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,620
I hate that jingle.

394
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,980
You could have just told me to stop.

395
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,520
Let's go. Kids are waiting.

396
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,250
Odie, come back. Leave him alone. He might
punch you.

397
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,070
Was that Ethel?

398
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,380
A few years back, old man lactose was
forced out of business.

399
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,880
The corporation that took over separated
me from my Ethel.

400
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,940
Ethel!

401
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,580
You are my day!

402
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,140
You are my night!

403
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,580
I was put out to pasture.

404
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,220
She was put on display as part of the
tour.

405
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,160
I tried to get in there to break Ethel
free, but they stopped me every time.

406
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,920
Now I only see her six seconds twice a
day.

407
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,660
We feel you, Otto. Let's go, Junior. We'll
find another way to break in there.

408
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,080
What could you possibly want from that
place?

409
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,080
A couple quarts a meal.

410
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,500
A couple thousand quarts.

411
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,660
Good luck.

412
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,540
We'll take any helpful hint you have.

413
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,060
Pass.

414
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm telling you, it's a life or death
situation.

415
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,840
I hope you've notified your next of kin.

416
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,220
What if we can get Ethel out? Or get you a
commemorative pin?

417
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,540
Where are we going to find a commemorative
pin?

418
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,660
Now pay attention. Here's the perimeter of
the plant.

419
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,340
And here are the two places you need to
go.

420
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,920
First, the truck with your milk is back
here.

421
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,240
And this delicate buttercup is my Ethel,
my North Star.

422
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:23,240
And reason for living is being kept by
those barbarians in a petting zoo.

423
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,880
Located here.

424
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,800
This cricket represents the electrical
room.

425
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,080
This snail, the refrigeration room.

426
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,260
This toadstool is the loading dock, where
you'll find the keys to the trucks.

427
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,160
Wait, what's the pinecone?

428
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,580
The pinecone is the cheese and butter
room.

429
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,380
Ooh! Cheese is my love language.

430
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,140
Now, for this briefing, I've done a quick
reading of your personalities

431
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:48,060
and have chosen tokens to represent each
of you.

432
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,380
You are the majestic bullfrog.

433
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,680
Oh, yeah. That feels right.

434
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,360
You are the curious and clever chipmunk.

435
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,500
And you…

436
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,760
Wait for it…

437
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:02,460
…are Roadkill.

438
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,340
Huh? What? Oh!

439
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,000
No, I get it. That's a good one, Otto.

440
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
Giving your new best friend Roadkill.

441
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,720
Seriously, though, what's my real token?

442
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,020
That is your real token.

443
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,520
Now, if you have any chance of succeeding…

444
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,400
Excuse me, can I switch to something
living?

445
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:20,700
Like the snail or the cricket?

446
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,940
You should have spoken up sooner.

447
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,380
At this point, it would be too confusing
to switch.

448
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,580
Sooner? But you just told me this five
seconds ago.

449
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,740
Come on, Roadkill. Focus.

450
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,700
Oh, really?

451
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,860
You give Vic the majestic bullfrog,

452
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,280
you give Odie the curious and clever
chipmunk,

453
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,740
and then you give me your new BFF,
Roadkill?

454
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,280
I mean, it feels disrespectful. Not gonna
lie.

455
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,740
What makes you think he's dead?

456
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,880
My eyes. I have eyes and can see.

457
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,640
It's a possum.

458
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,960
Their masters are playing dead.

459
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,860
-Well then, little Daniel Day
-possum here should do Shakespeare in the park.

460
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,200
Things aren't always what they seem.

461
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,640
You're right.

462
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:49,800
But in this case, they are.

463
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,560
What's the big deal? Possums play dead.

464
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,120
Oh, do they, Otto? Do they play dead? Do
possums play possum?

465
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,780
Is that what they do?

466
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes. Possums are very clever.

467
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,100
Yeah, I'm sure he was until the day he ate
a pickup truck.

468
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,660
Just ignore him. Please, continue.

469
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,120
I'll just put this back where you had it.

470
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,160
The straightest line to the loading dock
is through the snail here,

471
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,280
then the cricket there, cut through the
toadstool and onto the rock.

472
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,540
Each of these rooms have their own set of
unique challenges.

473
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
Well, why can't we just go straight
through the pine cone?

474
00:38:17,283 --> 00:38:19,000
You don't want to go through the pine
cone.

475
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,660
Looks like the straightest shot is through
the pine cone.

476
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,540
You like walking with those feet, do you?

477
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,040
You a fan of unimaginable pain and misery?

478
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,360
Then go through the pine cone.

479
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,720
Stay away from the pine cone.

480
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:29,900
Got it.

481
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,560
Once you're inside the facility, you will
enter the electrical room.

482
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:41,100
There you will locate the air vent, pop
the grate, and climb up.

483
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:51,660
Then you'll crawl through a maze of vents
and drop down to the refrigeration room.

484
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,800
-Next, you will need to hurl your body over a 30
-foot drop to a series of hand runs.

485
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,380
You'll propel yourselves hand over hand
and drop down directly into a loading
dock.

486
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,740
From there, you'll locate the keys to the
milk truck.

487
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,900
Drive that truck to the west pasture of
the complex.

488
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:17,700
Cut the lock on the gate and find the
closest thing we have to an angel here on
Earth.

489
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:26,020
You'll escort my sweet Ethel onto the
truck and drive her to freedom.

490
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,260
It's going to take mad skills to get that
milk and free my dear sweet Ethel.

491
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,940
Clearly, this one is qualified for the
mission, but I have some serious doubts
here

492
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:40,040
about all of this.

493
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,160
He's pointing to you, roadkill.

494
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,680
Let's get to work.

495
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Stupid roadkill.

496
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,060
Hey! I'm working here!

497
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,060
Uh, definitely a Monday.

498
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,820
Your call is fairly important to us.

499
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,880
If you've lost a cat, please press 1.

500
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,120
If your cat is orange, please press 2.

501
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,200
This doesn't really accomplish anything,
but gives you the false sense that we're
engaged with you.

502
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:07,020
Aw!

503
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Alright gentlemen, I've made a list of
skills that you'll need to master in order
to break into lactose farms.

504
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,380
Number one, develop lightning fast
reflexes.

505
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,080
You tell Garfield there's a plate of pasta
on the other side of that wall and you
will see lightning reflexes.

506
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,060
Yeah, no, no, no. Depends what kind of
pasta.

507
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,380
This pebble represents danger you may
encounter.

508
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,740
You need to grab it before it grabs you.

509
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,140
Ha! It grabs me.

510
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:36,820
I snatch the pebble from my hand.

511
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,060
Too slow!

512
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,880
Ow! What was that for?

513
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,920
Being able to grab the pebble could be the
difference between life and death.

514
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,600
Alright, let me try that again.

515
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,040
Ha! Got it!

516
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,480
Ah! Now what was that for?

517
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,120
It's never just about the pebble.

518
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,640
Come on junior, everyone knows that.

519
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,100
Your head's got to be on a swivel at all
times.

520
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,560
Gotta be ready for anything.

521
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,720
I was ready. He changed the game.

522
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,340
Sounds like someone's making excuses.

523
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,620
And what was that about being ready for
anything?

524
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,200
You were dissecting me!

525
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,100
Might I suggest putting your head on a
swivel?

526
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,240
You should have seen that coming.

527
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,140
Toes on the line.

528
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,100
Guard your grill.

529
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Cover your stomach.

530
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,240
There are surprises around every corner at
Lactose Farms.

531
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,520
You need to stay alert.

532
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,720
Too slow.

533
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,400
A baby could have seen that coming.

534
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,600
Too slow.

535
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,620
Too slow.

536
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,060
Too slow.

537
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,320
You'll never make it through Lactose Farms
if you can't survive this.

538
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:34,660
Are you for real? What kind of dairy is
this?

539
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,800
The kind of dairy that requires teamwork
to survive.

540
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,180
Danger could be anywhere, gentlemen.

541
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,780
You've got to be ready to outrun it.

542
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,300
Here comes the babe!

543
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,060
Left, right, left, right!

544
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,260
You're confusing me.

545
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,200
Shhhh!

546
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,320
I think I'm gonna need rehab.

547
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,760
If this is going to work, these two have
to be on the same page.

548
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,300
I'm out of ideas. You got any?

549
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,180
Can't believe I'm out in the middle of
nowhere getting beaten up against my will
by a former celebrity steer.

550
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,520
Odie?

551
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,880
Can you tell my son to please stop
whining?

552
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:38,540
Odie, can you tell Vic that I collapsed on
this tree first and that he needs to find
another one?

553
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,300
Odie, can you tell my son that I will
gladly find another one when I get the
feeling back in my legs?

554
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:51,340
Odie, can you tell my father that he
wouldn't be lying in pain if he let a
better life and didn't create problems for
himself?

555
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:57,280
Could you please inform my son that he
should focus on fixing his own issues?

556
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,000
Odie?

557
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:58,780
What?

558
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,260
Odie?

559
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,320
What'd you do?

560
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,840
After all I've let you do for me.

561
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,240
What is this?

562
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,060
Hey! Watch it!

563
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,920
What's the problem, Vic? Is this bothering
you?

564
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,340
No!

565
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,520
Vic!

566
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,780
I don't mind it either!

567
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,120
I could watch this all day.

568
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,040
Stop pulling!

569
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:35,040
I'm not! You're pulling!

570
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,200
If I was pulling, you would know it!

571
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,320
Why does everything you do always end up
hurting me?

572
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,700
Hurt you?

573
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,080
All I ever did was try to help you!

574
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,680
Oh, you sure? Because every time you're
around it ends up with me in pain!

575
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,200
Odie, these ropes are not funny anymore!

576
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,280
Maybe if you were a little more open to
seeing me, things might be better between
us.

577
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,340
Oh, you do remember you were the one who
left me in an alley, right?

578
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,320
You don't know what you're talking about!

579
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,620
Then please, enlighten me.

580
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,540
This is about to get real.

581
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,840
Oh, that's right. You're normally never
around to actually defend yourself.

582
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,000
No back door to slink out of this time.

583
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,540
First you abandon me, then years later you
pull me into a life of crime.

584
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,360
Well, classic father of the year stuff,
Dad.

585
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,460
You know, why would I ever think that
seeing you could be anything other than a
train wreck?

586
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,600
I did not leave you in that alley!

587
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,680
Oh, you did! You told me you'd come right
back! You never did!

588
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:35,280
No! That is not what happened.

589
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,900
Oh, please. You're probably on the run
from someone like Jinx and I was in the
way.

590
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,680
No. No, that…that night…that night was
different.

591
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,250
Hey, shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

592
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,930
Wait here, Junior. I'll be right back.

593
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,120
Oh, hey, get out of here!

594
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,800
Hey, how you doing? Yeah, yeah.

595
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,560
Uh, I had to show you a cat. Yeah, yeah,
digging in the trash.

596
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,100
Yeah, heh, heh, heh.

597
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,460
So what you up to now, huh? Still taking
it easy?

598
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,260
Uh, yeah, yeah.

599
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,600
What? Oh, no, you're kidding. Really?

600
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,920
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's been raining here for
a while now.

601
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,840
Heh, heh, yeah.

602
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,100
Yeah, I'll see you then. Okay, bye.

603
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,100
Bye.

604
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,500
I…I never knew.

605
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,840
I know. How could you?

606
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,560
Why didn't you ever come visit me?

607
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,100
I did.

608
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:25,420
A million times I came to knock on your
door and I'd see what a great life you had
with Jon.

609
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:29,980
And so I just…thought it was better if I
kept my distance.

610
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,240
I sense a positive breakthrough in your
relationship. Am I wrong?

611
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Good. After an extensive evaluation, I
have concluded that you two are, in fact,
ready to move forward with this mission.

612
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,360
We are? How is that even possible?

613
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,400
Mathematically, it isn't.

614
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,420
But given your present levels of
incompetence and overall lack of basic
skills…

615
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,540
I have determined it would take roughly 17
years to get you both properly ready for
this job.

616
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,060
And since we have less than 48 hours,
you've passed.

617
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,640
Congratulations.

618
00:49:06,723 --> 00:49:08,180
Mm-hmm.

619
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,900
Alouette, gente, alouette. Alouette, je te
plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête. Je te
plumerai la tête.

620
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,800
Il a tête. Il a tête. Alouette. Il a tête.

621
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,040
Ahem.

622
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,540
She's really losing it.

623
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,460
Yes, what is it?

624
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,640
They're ready to rob the dairy.

625
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,780
Perfect. Everything is going to plan. Now
it's time to make a call.

626
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,420
Excuse me, you keep that thing in your
folds? That is so disgusting.

627
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,560
You! You dial the number and put me on
speaker.

628
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,760
Hello?

629
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,920
Hello, Blacktoast Farms.

630
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,260
It's come to my attention that there'll be
an attempt to rob one of your dairy trucks
tomorrow.

631
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,460
It's not important who I am or how I came
to know this.

632
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,820
Just think of me as a concerned citizen
intent on fulfilling my civic
responsibility as well as…

633
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:43,020
Uh, Chief?

634
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,840
We may have a situation.

635
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,380
Well, okay then. Let's go have a look-see.

636
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,560
This is the third time they've called.

637
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,020
It just sounds like some cat prank calling
us.

638
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,020
If it were a dog barking, I'd be on board
for a prank.

639
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,560
Them dogs are born for mischief, they just
are.

640
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,860
Not cats.

641
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,680
Oh no. Cats mean business.

642
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,500
I repeat, there will be an attempt to make
off with one of your milk trucks tomorrow.

643
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,780
I suggest you take appropriate measures to
prevent this brazen thievery. What an evil
genius I am.

644
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,470
Well then, still seem like a prank to you.

645
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,090
That last part did a little.

646
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,710
What's our next move, Chief?

647
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:50,590
Our next move is for me to go back to my
office and formulate an ingenious plan.

648
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,910
Then you go get my car waxed.

649
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:02,210
Well, well, well. Would you look at that,
Margie Malone. We're having company
tomorrow.

650
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,910
I guess I better take out my finest china
to serve a heaping plate…

651
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,250
…of justice.

652
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,860
What are those for?

653
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,020
For us to communicate. Once you're inside,
the belly of the beast.

654
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,020
Okay, don't we need something more like
radio headsets?

655
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,680
Indoor cat. These are better.

656
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,240
It just feels like bluetooth would be
better.

657
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,440
These are better than bluetooth.

658
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,740
These are better than bluetooth.

659
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,960
They're equal. And I don't have to pay for
the brand.

660
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,480
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk. Do you copy?

661
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,240
Of course you can hear him. He's standing
three feet away from you.

662
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,320
Oh, I see you sprung for the binoculars.

663
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,100
Now, we just need to find…

664
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:05,440
…a way in.

665
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,160
Anyone ever told you that you take a lot
of dramatic pauses when you speak?

666
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,000
Yes.

667
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,300
Mmm.

668
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,840
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the one
and only Lactose Farms.

669
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,520
If you will all gather around me, we'll
begin our tour and head into the heart of
the farm.

670
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,000
I know you're here. I can feel it.

671
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,940
Show yourself.

672
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,920
Today, you will discover the answers to
all of your dairy questions,

673
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,220
including the most asked dairy question of
all time,

674
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:52,100
our curds the way.

675
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,880
Ballfrog, Chipmunk, Roadkill, do you copy?

676
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,520
Are you kidding me? They actually work?
You should take this to Shark Tank.

677
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,400
Now remember, the only way to get the keys
to the milk truck and free ethylene
detected

678
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:07,400
is by sticking to the path I mapped out
for you.

679
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,500
If you deviate from that path, you will
trigger security and all bets are off.
Understood?

680
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,680
All right, look alive. The electrical
access door should be coming up on your
left.

681
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:20,100
Okay, this way.

682
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,780
Hey, hey, look. There it is.

683
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,940
Okay, we're in.

684
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,120
Continue through and locate the air vent
at the end of the hallway.

685
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,200
That will take you to the refrigeration
room.

686
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,100
Factory workers, your fifteen minute break
begins now.

687
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Oh, your feet need a deep rinse.

688
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:04,030
That's a hold up, Junior. How do you get
through this? You're bigger than me.

689
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,930
Am I?

690
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:06,650
Yes.

691
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,170
Well, the vent doesn't agree.

692
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:09,970
Try sucking in your gut.

693
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:10,710
I am.

694
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,390
Try sucking in your butt and your gut.

695
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:32,330
No! No! No! No! It's a alarm!

696
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,310
Bullfrog, what's happening now?

697
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:47,850
We fell out of the vent into a room that
looks like it's full of heavy machinery.

698
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:49,930
Son of a cud.

699
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,890
You and the pine cone.

700
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,810
Jiminy Davis! The perp is the cat!

701
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,110
And this one looks like it could eat us
out of business.

702
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,430
Oh Vic, Vic! Look! There's the loading
dock!

703
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,170
No, Junior! Don't move!

704
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:07,950
What? Why?

705
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,310
We're in the middle of the pine cone!

706
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,810
Otto told us to stay out of the pine cone!

707
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,890
Oh stop, there's no pine cone. Otto's a
bit of a worry ward.

708
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:17,550
I can walk to the loading dock from here.

709
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,650
No, Junior! Junior!

710
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,000
Oh, cheddar. Probably one of my top 26
favorite cheeses.

711
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,140
What do you think happens when that gets
to zero?

712
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,700
Bullfrog! What's happening now?

713
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,600
Roadkill got catered way into the pine
cone!

714
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,720
Listen to me. You have to carry on with
the mission.

715
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,480
Get to the loading dock before the workers
return from their break,

716
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,520
or you'll miss your only chance to get
that truck.

717
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,200
No, no, no! No, no, no, no!

718
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,500
Shred sequence initiated.

719
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,580
Cody! Thanks buddy, but I'm pretty full
from the cheddar.

720
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,320
Oh! Jump off! Yeah, yeah. Good idea!

721
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,840
Oh good, he's safe.

722
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,470
Hang on, where am I going?

723
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,890
Fondue! Fondue!

724
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,790
Junior!

725
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,910
That was too close even for me.

726
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,350
Thanks.

727
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,790
Yeah, I couldn't let you have all the fun.

728
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:51,450
Workers, your break ends in five minutes.

729
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,810
Okay Otto, we're in the loading dock.
Where are the keys?

730
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,790
They should be hanging on a pegboard on
the far wall.

731
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,050
What do you mean we have a problem?

732
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,270
Uh, pegboard's empty.

733
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:05,190
Empty?

734
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,530
Now would you look at this.

735
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,150
Three misguided stray pets trying to steal
a truck of milk.

736
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,330
It's never a dull moment at this dairy, is
there Margie?

737
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:18,830
Well, you're looking for these, aren't
you?

738
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,450
Well, here you go then.

739
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,150
So how's this gonna play out fellas?

740
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,570
The easy way or the hard way?

741
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,270
Well, just so you know, I'm up for either.

742
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,250
Follow my lead.

743
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,070
Huh? What?

744
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,860
Who's next then?

745
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
Otto, a security guard has the truck keys!

746
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,480
Crazy eyes? Tragic sense of fashion?

747
00:59:52,563 --> 00:59:53,880
Yeah, how did you know?

748
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:54,660
Marge Malone.

749
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,200
Otto!

750
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,280
Otto!

751
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,840
She's not just my nemesis, she's also my…
enemy.

752
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,100
Love to hear about it, but right now, what
do we do?

753
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,420
Get those keys. I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

754
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,060
Come here, you!

755
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,700
Did you see that? That's indoor cat style.

756
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:21,820
Gah!

757
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:34,400
No, no, no, no. You're not getting away.
I've already called the pound.

758
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,100
Your days of thievery end today.

759
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,410
Jim, sorry about this.

760
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,270
Sorry?

761
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:56,930
For what?

762
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:01,790
Vic?

763
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,200
What are you doing?

764
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,400
Vic! Don't you go! Vic!

765
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,720
Please!

766
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,040
Send security to the loading dock.

767
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:45,410
You do not want to try me today, mister.

768
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,880
Welcome back.

769
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,420
Victor?

770
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:51,760
Oh, hey, Jinx. Why are you here? I was
bringing this to you.

771
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,220
Were you? Really?

772
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,720
Yeah, of course I was. That's what we
agreed to, right?

773
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,120
So, you and me square now?

774
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,440
Not quite.

775
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,620
There's still the matter of those five
years I lost because of you.

776
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,480
What? But I thought this settled that.

777
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,840
It was never about the milk.

778
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:24,660
It was about you getting caught trying to
steal it and being sent to the pound. Like
I was.

779
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,040
You see, Vic. I needed you to suffer. Like
I did.

780
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:39,100
I see. And I'm guessing you have an idea
about how that should happen.

781
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,440
As a matter of fact, I do.

782
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,660
I can't believe he did that. He ran out
and he left me.

783
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,960
Again.

784
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,960
I thought he'd changed, but it was… it was
a lie. All of it.

785
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,070
How could I have been so stupid?

786
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:15,770
Oh…

787
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:21,210
Oh, come on, kid. Don't beat yourself up.

788
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,810
Vic, man. We've all been burned by Vic.

789
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,290
Yeah, that's right. He's burned every cat
I know.

790
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:33,250
Oh, yeah. The one thing about Vic you can
count on is that you can't count on him.

791
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:34,830
Tell me about it.

792
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:41,990
Yeah, I'll tell you about it. Long story
short, we all used to run in the pack
until we had to kick him out the crew.

793
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,190
Like I said, couldn't count on him.

794
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:47,370
Sounds about right.

795
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:51,010
He'd leave in the middle of a job just to
go see his kid.

796
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:56,130
Yeah, he said he wanted to check up on
him. Make sure he was doing okay.

797
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,950
But get this. He'd never actually visit.

798
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,030
He'd just sit across the street from his
kid's house in a giant oak tree.

799
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:03,910
That never happened.

800
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,390
He'd watch that kid eat and eat and eat
and eat.

801
01:05:07,473 --> 01:05:11,410
He'd put a notch in the park and eat every
time he was there.

802
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,010
Yeah, sure he did.

803
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,250
He'd go every Sunday night, rain or shine.

804
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:20,390
Said it was his kid's family dinner night.

805
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,930
Wish I had a family.

806
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:30,250
Okay, hate to tell you guys, I guarantee
that never happened.

807
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,550
Okay? You all fell for another one of
Vic's lies.

808
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:34,910
We all have.

809
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,290
Because that's what he does best.

810
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:41,560
Where?

811
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,740
Odie! Odie! How did you get out? Quick!
Pick the lock on my cage!

812
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,540
Garfield! There you are!

813
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,160
John! Take me away from all of this!

814
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,160
You can't imagine what I've been through.

815
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,320
You want this one too?

816
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,580
Oh, yes I do.

817
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,620
You sure he's yours? He didn't have a tag.

818
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,440
Oh, he has a tag.

819
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,620
I have a collar and a tag? How long have I
had those?

820
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,860
Okay, I'm just gonna need you to hold.

821
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,440
I will not hold! I am done holding!

822
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,860
John, who was on hold is dead! Do you
understand?

823
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That's right. I'm back, baby.

824
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,100
I was just talking about you, wasn't I?

825
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,760
Oh, I've missed you too.

826
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,330
Pookie!

827
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:42,320
I have a lot to tell you. You're never
gonna believe it.

828
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,340
Crazy stuff happened. I slept outside.
Twice!

829
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,780
I know! Me! Oh, and I got you this
commemorative pin?

830
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:50,980
Dinner time!

831
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,600
Talk later!

832
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:11,630
Say when?

833
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,810
Never, John! Bury me in cheese!

834
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:20,610
I have two more in the freezer. Let me
know when you want them.

835
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,070
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

836
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,210
Oh, I apologize in advance.

837
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,790
The eating you're about to see will not be
pretty.

838
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:31,050
And if you have young children, this would
be a good time for them to leave the room.

839
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:51,630
Oh, I know, I know. We're coming back.

840
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,310
I just need to check something out first.

841
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,300
He put a notch in the bark.

842
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,540
Every time he was there.

843
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,420
Ah!

844
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,370
He left a notch.

845
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,010
Yeah, right.

846
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,480
He was here.

847
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,960
He saw me grow up.

848
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:58,100
Oh, ow! Wow, that really stinks. I don't
know why I didn't think it would.

849
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,440
Give me a second.

850
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:07,860
Vic loves us. Me first, of course, but
then you, too. But me? A lot! And first!

851
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,220
Wait, but if he loves me…

852
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:14,340
Us? Why would he let us get captured at
the dairy?

853
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,580
Unless…

854
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:18,180
He wanted us to get captured!

855
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:25,660
Yes, he knew that Jinx wasn't gonna let
him off the hook, but if we got caught,
we'd get sent to the pound, and John would
come to get us!

856
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,180
Don't you see, Odie? He was trying to save
us!

857
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,780
We have to go save my dad.

858
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,160
And here's your favorite dessert, Mt.
Canditoa!

859
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,880
Uh, guys?

860
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,440
Oh, come on!

861
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,000
What is this?

862
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,090
Half a star for Mama Leonis?

863
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,450
She's a monster.

864
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,230
She's gonna tie him up, take him on a
train…

865
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,670
She's going to throw him off the Mile High
Bridge!

866
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:29,130
We're gonna need help.

867
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:30,330
Who can we call?

868
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,930
-You got a lot of waxy buildup. What's your Q
-tip for Dean?

869
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,390
You're right, you're right. We can deal
with that situation later.

870
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,650
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?

871
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,040
I can see you someplace.

872
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,320
Otto! Otto? Please, listen.

873
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,520
I want to make good on our original deal,
but…

874
01:11:57,603 --> 01:11:58,980
But I need a favor first.

875
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,820
Otto, are you still there, or are you
taking a dramatic pause?

876
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,010
I'm listening.

877
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:21,090
You know, Vic, you only have yourself to
blame for this.

878
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:27,510
Right. Look, there's got to be some way
for me to make this right.

879
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,230
I mean, I know we can think of something.

880
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,930
Oh, there is.

881
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,810
And you will.

882
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,800
So once I get on the train, I untie Vic
and we jump off right as the train gets to
the bridge.

883
01:12:50,883 --> 01:12:53,540
Correct. Chipmunk will be waiting for you.

884
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,620
Confirm your status, Chipmunk.

885
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,560
If you don't jump right as the train gets
to the bridge, you'll miss the net.

886
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,780
Got it. It's getting close.

887
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,100
Have you considered throwing a rope over a
branch and just swinging onto the passing
train instead?

888
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,180
You watch too much TV.

889
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,600
I've never watched TV.

890
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,540
Well, this weighs much better than your
rope idea.

891
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,380
Better than the versatile, reliable rope?

892
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,400
Look, I've studied the science. I know
what I'm doing.

893
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,060
And you think you can battle these
villains on your own?

894
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:21,960
Oh, yeah. I have a plan.

895
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,260
Odie, make the order.

896
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:31,440
Now get ready to fling me in the direction
of that moving train.

897
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,620
Get ready.

898
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,660
If I don't make it back, tell my story.

899
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,520
Rokyo, you're too high. You're going to
miss it.

900
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:51,920
No, no. This is how you do it. It's called
the ricochet approach.

901
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:02,120
It won't be long now. I can't tell you how
excited I am for what's about to happen
next.

902
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,620
Dad, I'm here to rescue you.

903
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,640
No, no, no, no, no, Junior. Get out of
here.

904
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,100
I'm going to untie you and we're going to
jump off the train.

905
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,620
Just leave me and go.

906
01:14:11,703 --> 01:14:13,920
I didn't come this far just to turn
around. Let me untie you.

907
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,780
You're ruining everything.

908
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,740
Quick, this way.

909
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,170
Oh, you half-weight. Get them.

910
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,160
The bridge is coming up. We got to get to
the caboose now.

911
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,000
What? What?

912
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,220
Just follow my lead.

913
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,360
Oi, kitty cat. Did you expect to take us
on all by yourself?

914
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,780
No, I brought takeout.

915
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:43,740
Whoa.

916
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:15,330
I never understood the purpose of salad
until this exact moment.

917
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:24,210
Go, go. Now.

918
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:25,930
Get after him.

919
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:30,860
Oh.

920
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,140
Ow.

921
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,440
Yeah, in case you were wondering, I do my
own stunts.

922
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,040
Me and Tom Cruise.

923
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,440
Junior.

924
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:00,340
Whoa.

925
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,020
Stop him.

926
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:30,070
Now, that's amazing. I can't feel my
tongue.

927
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,990
Roadkill, are you at the caboose ready to
jump?

928
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:57,330
Dad. Dad.

929
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,250
Jump, Junior. I'll catch you.

930
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:17,750
What do we do now?

931
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,540
We do this.

932
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,440
See you, everyone.

933
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,160
The net's too tight.

934
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,860
Roadkill, the net is too tight.

935
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,600
I heard.

936
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,480
Hello again. Welcome back. Now, where were
we?

937
01:18:55,740 --> 01:19:02,740
Don't throw them over just yet.

938
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:10,550
I want to find the perfect place for them
to make the biggest splat.

939
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,310
Hey, Junior. Junior.

940
01:19:13,393 --> 01:19:15,510
Get ready. Almost there.

941
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,950
I'm sorry my rescue didn't work out.

942
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,670
No, you gave me another chance.

943
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:23,950
That's all that matters.

944
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,890
Now, now. Drop them now.

945
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,350
What are you waiting for?

946
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:41,010
Their love for one another indicates that
despite their current circumstances,

947
01:19:41,093 --> 01:19:45,410
they are at peace because they are
together.

948
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,350
So?

949
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,930
If the point of your revenge was to hurt
them, it has done the opposite.

950
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,250
It's actually textbook irony.

951
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,650
And we're no longer comfortable with your
plan.

952
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:02,110
You two are still as weak as you were when
I found you sniveling in the pond.

953
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,710
No one will adopt us. I never grew into my
fold.

954
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:08,910
I hide behind them because I'm socially
awkward.

955
01:20:08,993 --> 01:20:12,710
Please, somebody love me, even though I
can't sit still for more than ten seconds

956
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:14,850
and have the attention span of a bloody
goldfish.

957
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,290
We did everything you ever asked of us.

958
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:22,110
I even spoke with this ridiculous accent
to make you feel more at home.

959
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,790
But no more. I'm New York, loud and proud.

960
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,210
I love myself the way I am.

961
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,050
And I'm a big, brave boy, baby.

962
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,090
And I've been working on my attention
span.

963
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,370
Is that a hot air balloon?

964
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:37,570
You two.

965
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:46,460
What? Yes!

966
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,820
You have a beautiful body, sir.

967
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,200
Oh dear.

968
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,580
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

969
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,760
There's something about your cadence that
really throws me, but thank you.

970
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,310
Tossing me off the train.

971
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:57,150
I did not see that coming.

972
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,730
Well, when you live in the wild, you gotta
keep your head on a swivel.

973
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,510
Right.

974
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:08,330
It's basic outdoor cat 101 and that head
bird poop on it.

975
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:10,690
Hey, you good roadkill?

976
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:16,210
Not quite. There's one last thing to take
care of.

977
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,310
Cut to…

978
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:27,850
It was a dark and foggy night.

979
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:32,310
The air was damp and heavier than a broken
heart.

980
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:40,110
On nights like this, you can't swing a cat
without hitting shady characters making
shady deals all over town.

981
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:46,230
Oh, but this night was going to be
different.

982
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:53,410
Justice was about to be served with the
helping of retribution on the side.

983
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:56,110
Is that the package?

984
01:22:56,193 --> 01:22:57,730
It is.

985
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:59,730
Then we have a deal.

986
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:07,020
No one will come looking for her?

987
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:12,880
Nope. I did what you said. I burned her
paperwork and then shredded it and burned
it some more.

988
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,960
It's like she never existed.

989
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,280
Except for the image of her face and
millions of dairy products.

990
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,080
This never happened.

991
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,800
Agreed.

992
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:52,800
Oh, save it, cat fancy. I know you planned
the milk truck heist and then tried to
throw those innocent cats off a train to
cover it up.

993
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,740
The boys told me everything.

994
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,900
You are my day.

995
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,720
You are my night.

996
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,060
Well, this is us.

997
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,400
Right. You're home.

998
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,740
Listen, I just want to say I'm sorry.

999
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,080
What are you sorry for?

1000
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,840
For misjudging you.

1001
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,640
Oh, well, thanks.

1002
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,680
-Well, I just wanted to apologize to you for

1003
01:25:26,763 --> 01:25:28,880
Everything bad that happened to us the
last three days?

1004
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,040
You know, you had your hand on a few bad
decisions back there too.

1005
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,020
Yeah, I'm sorry for dragging you into my
world.

1006
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,620
This is where you belong.

1007
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,580
Here was John and…

1008
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,060
What's your name again?

1009
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:44,980
Odor?

1010
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,520
So, um…

1011
01:25:51,603 --> 01:25:51,940
Yeah, I should go.

1012
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,820
Yeah, yeah. I mean, unless you'd want to
come in.

1013
01:25:54,903 --> 01:25:56,640
Nah, nah, nah. I don't think that would
work.

1014
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,600
I'm an outdoor cat.

1015
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,600
Right, sure, sure. No, I just, I figured-

1016
01:26:00,683 --> 01:26:02,080
No, no, no, no. I get it.

1017
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:06,380
-But you know, I got this thing on the other side of town I gotta go do, so

1018
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:07,740
I'm very busy too.

1019
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,940
See you around then?

1020
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,900
You know where to find me.

1021
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:13,700
In the kitchen?

1022
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,900
Well, take care.

1023
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,320
And remember, stay out of the pine cone.

1024
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,500
What? You heard him.

1025
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,620
It's for the best.

1026
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,920
Ah! Ah! You're back! What is going on? Are
you okay?

1027
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:45,140
I was so worried. I was going to add more
locks to the door, you know, try to keep
you in,

1028
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:49,200
but then I thought, well, what if they
wanted to be outdoor pets? Do you want to
be free range?

1029
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:55,340
Oh, I really missed you guys and I gotta
say it's great to be together again, the
whole entire family.

1030
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,280
Give me that. I asked him to stay.

1031
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,080
He wanted to leave.

1032
01:27:04,163 --> 01:27:07,380
You heard him. He said he had to-

1033
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,920
Fine. I'll be right back.

1034
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:11,300
Wait, wait, what?

1035
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,140
Am I using trigger words that I'm not
aware of?

1036
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,020
So you coming in or do we have to bring
food up there to you?

1037
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:00,230
I'll come to you. I just need to finish
something up here.

1038
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:18,750
You know, those notches show how much you
love me.

1039
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:20,910
Is that what you think they mean?

1040
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:22,150
Yeah.

1041
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:26,110
I was just counting how many slices of
lasagna you ate.

1042
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,920
My medium is cuisine. My colors are
flavors. My palate is my palate, if you
will.

1043
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:50,680
Dinner is served.

1044
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:58,030
Wow, son, I didn't know you could cook.

1045
01:28:58,113 --> 01:29:03,390
Ah yes, pasta is my paint and the dinner
plate is my canvas.

1046
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:05,890
Oh, that's where that went.

1047
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:15,960
I've had worse.

1048
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,870
Thank you, Garfield.

1049
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,070
Is he going to be coming around for dinner
often?

1050
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,630
Yeah, he's family.

1051
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:42,130
What? Why do I have a takeout bill for
6,000 drone deliveries?

1052
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,310
Let it roll.

1053
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:54,110
I wish I could have had a warning, but
I've got things to do, people to see.

1054
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:15,340
Everybody wanna get a piece of me, so I
tell you what I do.

1055
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:21,540
I let it roll when your body can't catch
the feeling, when your feet are stuck on
the ceiling.

1056
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:25,060
When your rhyme runs out of reason, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1057
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:29,420
Ahh!

1058
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,960
I don't know where to go.

1059
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,340
Still in the field and I'm back on the
run. I came in the party to have me some
fun.

1060
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,300
I ride with these cats so I'm never alone.

1061
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:42,540
DJ, please, could you play my song?

1062
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,580
Wobble the wiggle, I slide off the back.

1063
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,620
Pay no attention, my head in my hat.

1064
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,620
Surprise the minute.

1065
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,940
Ride some wrists and slide with me, the
sky's the limit.

1066
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,180
I let it roll.

1067
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,200
I let it ride.

1068
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,620
L-I-G, L-I-G.

1069
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:55,280
I let it go.

1070
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:56,140
Let it go.

1071
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,500
Let it roll.

1073
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:01,840
I let it ride.

1074
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,440
When I'm spinning out and don't know where
to go, I let it roll.
