1
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,788
<i>Fuck.</i>

2
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,999
<i>What is an adult?</i>

3
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,351
<i>Becomin' one
didn't suddenly transform me</i>

4
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,876
<i>into anything outstanding
or significant.</i>

5
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:36,313
<i>I am 18 and
entirely unremarkable.</i>

6
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,882
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

7
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,797
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

8
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,320
<i>In this tomb of a house
left to me</i>

9
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,496
<i>by my brilliant
and selfish parents.</i>

10
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,195
<i>They're not dead...</i>

11
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,718
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

12
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,329
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

13
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>Literature is my solace
in the solitude.</i>

14
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,206
<i>And writing is my only means
of escape.</i>

15
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,557
<i>Because, you see...</i>

16
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,646
<i>I've never left the edges
of this town.</i>

17
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,736
<i>It's positively gothic,
really.</i>

18
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,174
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

19
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:14,525
<i>the interminable boredom
of her small village.</i>

20
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,614
<i>Lonely girl longs
to be meaningful.</i>

21
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:20,749
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

22
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,491
<i>Books make longing
seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,710
<i>It's greedy.</i>

24
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,235
<i>And I wear longing
like a fucking veil.</i>

25
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,471
<i>But today?</i>

26
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,778
<i>Today comes with
something new.</i>

27
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>Something surprising.</i>

28
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,392
<i>Today I meet a writer,
like me.</i>

29
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,743
<i>A teacher.</i>

30
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,310
<i>One who somehow
found inspiration</i>

31
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,833
<i>in a place like this.</i>

32
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,140
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,801
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:15,238
<i>I suppose even graveyards
grow flowers.</i>

35
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,052
Good morning.

36
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,316
Morning.

37
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,972
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

38
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,192
I know. I don't like crowds.

39
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,280
Uh-uh...

40
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:01,153
- Do you live far?
- Close enough to walk.

41
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,981
- Oh, where's that?
- Lovell Hill?

42
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,896
You live in Lovell Hill?

43
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,768
- You know it?
- I just didn't think it was

44
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,161
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

45
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,337
- Who says it is?

46
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,427
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

47
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:14,515
Wow.

48
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,431
It's enormous.

49
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,954
My parents are lawyers.

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,738
- Hmm, what kind?
- The expensive kind.

51
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,262
And you wanna be a lawyer?

52
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,176
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

53
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,482
What's your name?

54
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,918
Cairo Sweet.

55
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,094
- I'm Mr. Miller.
- I know.

56
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,227
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

57
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,315
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,099
Uh...

59
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,537
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

60
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,365
the holidays.

61
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,757
Got a chance to look it over?

62
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:40,976
I read it.

63
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,499
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

64
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:43,718
but I promise you
we'll get through it

65
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,241
as quickly as we can.

66
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,373
I read the whole list.

67
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,462
Wait, you read these?

68
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,335
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

69
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,467
I party hard.

70
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,732
- Winnie.
Mm. Hmm, hmm.

71
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,429
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

72
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:00,604
Did you miss me?

73
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:01,953
I did not.

74
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,391
Well, that's too bad.

75
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,526
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

76
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,789
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

77
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,536
How boring.

78
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,929
Censorship is dead.

79
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,539
It can't exist
with the Internet.

80
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:23,714
And yet it does.

81
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,063
Do you know why?

82
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,151
Yeah.

83
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,328
- Do you?

84
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,025
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

85
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,767
- Not limitation.

86
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,203
Oh.
Excuse me,

87
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,726
but what's that you say?

88
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:39,774
You want
a chicken biscuit

89
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,385
and a Coke?

90
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,170
Mm. Well, you heard the boss.

91
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:48,391
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

92
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:50,088
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

93
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,569
No, thank you, Cairo.

94
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:53,788
Sweet of you to ask.

95
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,660
I see
what you did there.

96
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,575
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

97
00:05:58,662 --> 00:05:59,663
Not.

98
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:01,404
Good one.

99
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,624
Like we've never heard
that before.

100
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,072
Jesus.

101
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,602
My God.

102
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,699
What you reading?

103
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,007
- Uh, nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothin'.

104
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,095
It's a student's.

105
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,226
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

106
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,445
How do you know it's a girl?

107
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,099
Oh, boys are too lazy
to read porn.

108
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,274
How do you know it's porn?

109
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,757
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

110
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:50,932
"She leaps off the couch

111
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,020
-"and pushes herself..."
- Boris.

112
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,413
"...between the girl and me.

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,590
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

114
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,026
-"that I can't move."
- Give me that.

115
00:06:58,113 --> 00:06:59,549
-"Marcelle stretches..."
- Okay.

116
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,377
-"...her tiny split fig."
- That's quite enough...

117
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,770
- All right.
- ...of your elocution...

118
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,424
- And test tomorrow, kids.
- I think.

119
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,034
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

120
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,427
- This coffee for me?
- Biscuit, too.

121
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,299
One of yours?

122
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,561
Oh, yeah,
that's one of yours.

123
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:12,649
One of mine. Exactly.

124
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,781
- Christ!

125
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,217
I don't know what
you're doing,

126
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,566
- but it's some...
- Oh, you know. Come on, now.

127
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,046
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

128
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,134
- Man, that's good.
-"Oh, I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

129
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,265
-"I'm so smart."
- Can you not?

130
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,919
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

131
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,007
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.
- </i>  Boris. Boris. Come on.

132
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,182
"I'm better than most people."

133
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,096
- Stop, please.
- Is this her diary?

134
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,315
Oh, what do we have here?

135
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,360
Well, well, well.

136
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,320
<i>"Apostrophes
and Ampersands..."</i>

137
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:35,933
six abysmally
romantic short stories

138
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,458
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

139
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,287
- She has my book?
Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,680
It would appear so.
It would also appear

141
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,073
she's the only one
who checked it out.

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,379
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

143
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,685
Well, you know,

144
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:49,947
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

145
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,210
No, you really can't.

146
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,256
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

147
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,997
They cut
the theater program.

148
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,477
But they kept you?

149
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,217
Along with
the other props, yeah.

150
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,003
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,158
- Hello, wife.
- Hello, husband.

152
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,034
Beatrice.

153
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,036
- What?
- Look at me.

154
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,695
Huh.

155
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,348
Red-Letter Day.

156
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,742
What, your school
finally get computers?

157
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:46,874
Better.

158
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,136
Indoor bathrooms?

159
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,616
A writer.

160
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:50,965
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

161
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,444
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

162
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,098
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

163
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,274
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

164
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,233
And, uh, guess what else?

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,669
<i>- Naked Lunch.</i>
- Mm-mm.

166
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,715
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

167
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,846
She...

168
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,153
She checked it out
of the library.

169
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,459
They carry your book
at the library?

170
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,940
-  Aw. Fuck.

171
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,814
<i>- A Confederacy of Dunces.
- </i>  Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,685
Well, deep breaths.

173
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,034
- Happy place.

174
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:19,341
My happy place
has all their heads

175
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,822
impaled on Montblanc pens.

176
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,519
Share your riches.

177
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,698
Hello, Amy.

178
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,570
What? Are you fucking joking?

179
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,180
I've been back and forth
all day

180
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,138
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

181
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,444
what it is they want

182
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,359
and somehow think
they can articulate

183
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,230
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

184
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,362
considering how they think

185
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,843
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

186
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,585
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

187
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,238
my teeth with a baby spoon.

188
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,936
Mm.
They can go

189
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,634
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

190
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,505
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

191
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,618
- Here now.

192
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,533
Cheers.

193
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,623
Cheers.

194
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,670
Oh, that's so good.

195
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,327
Hey, you ever read, uh,

196
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,590
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

197
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,940
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

198
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,986
- I had to throw it away.

199
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,031
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

200
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,642
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- ...and the cum money?

201
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,339
That is choice.

202
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,734
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

203
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,519
-"and wipe my cock on it."

204
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:55,089
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

205
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,308
"weighted with a coin."

206
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,702
- I love when you do magic.
- Mm.

207
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,095
You care to reenact?

208
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,966
I can papier-mache you...

209
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,448
with cum and money.

210
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,797
- Oh, so you're expecting

211
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,104
- a heavy load, then, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,889
A full body of work.

213
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,543
Come here.

214
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,676
Dance with me.

215
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,305
You're so beautiful.

216
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:38,959
Shut up.

217
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,238
Oh, for fuck's sake.

218
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,153
- Okay.

219
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,156
Will you take care
of those dishes?

220
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,244
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,115
I'll give you a handy later.

222
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,120
It's Pushkin, Amy.

223
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,643
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

224
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,951
What
a terrible weekend.

225
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,127
- Mm.
- Come on,

226
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,347
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

227
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,783
'Cause you're a puritan.

228
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,045
I feel like it's my duty

229
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,743
to punish the goodness
out of you.

230
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,135
God, you're a sadist.

231
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,571
I'm a public school teacher.

232
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,095
- Amen to that.
- Cheers.

233
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:31,707
Ooh, mama.

234
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,669
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

235
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,586
Why don't you go see?

236
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:43,893
Mm-mm.
I don't go in the kudzu.

237
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,982
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

238
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,288
That's why it grows so fast.

239
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:16,883
Good morning.

240
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,145
You always walk through
the woods alone?

241
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,320
That's a peculiar question

242
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,539
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

243
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,106
What, what are you,
uh, listening to?

244
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,978
- Celine Dion.
- Really?

245
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,457
- Really.

246
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:27,894
But why?

247
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,330
- I'm sorry.
- Because she's great.

248
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,635
Oh. Hmm.
- Ignore him. Ignore him.

249
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,724
- He wept aloud openly...
- Hmm.

250
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,378
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

251
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,553
Hmm.
- ...at my bachelor party.

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,338
- Remember that?
- I was drunk.

253
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,513
You were disconsolate.

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,862
You are a fucking traitor.

255
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:40,994
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

256
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,212
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

257
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:44,998
Uh, want a biscuit?

259
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,521
- Yeah, sure.
- There you go.

260
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,964
It's good.
Yeah?

261
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,096
- Do you make these?
Yeah.

262
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,619
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

263
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,447
- Why not? I don't.
- Oh, you know.

264
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:00,927
- You'll figure it out.
- I won't.

265
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,363
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

266
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,234
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

267
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:07,107
On that...
Take my leave.

268
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:09,370
I shall bid you goodbye.

269
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,588
- Okay.
- Uh, you, bad bye.

270
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,807
- Well, goodbye.
A bad bye?

271
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,026
Mm-hmm.
- But I love you though.

272
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,114
No, you don't.

273
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,640
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

274
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,602
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

275
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:41,837
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

276
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,144
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

277
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,798
I dressed up just for you.

278
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,932
What you want?

279
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,020
I wanna get into

280
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
- your physics class.
- Why?

281
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:54,197
You'd be really behind.

282
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,633
Don't you tutor?

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,157
You don't need lessons.

284
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,420
Then what do I need?

285
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,162
Um...

286
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,818
See what I can do.

287
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,211
'Preciate ya!

288
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,430
Hope so.

289
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,259
You are insane.

290
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,786
Here.

291
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,049
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

292
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:23,183
But you're a lesbian.

293
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,315
I'm an equal opportunist.

294
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:26,969
Mm.

295
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,579
Are you jealous?

296
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,407
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

297
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,670
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

298
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,456
Okay, chickybikky?

299
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,328
Okay.

300
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,904
So, you're a smoker now?

301
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,776
I'm smoking now.

302
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,214
No plans for it
to define me yet.

303
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,693
Where are your parents
this time?

304
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,478
Mumbai.

305
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:59,697
For how long?

306
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,569
Who knows?

307
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,223
Let me dress you up.

308
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,920
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

309
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,269
I give a fuck
about being smart.

310
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,271
You can be both.

311
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,622
What are you doin'?

312
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,799
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

313
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,105
into my Yale essay.

314
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:17,802
You dry?

315
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,370
Unqualified.

316
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,894
What's the subject?

317
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,722
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

318
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,856
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

319
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,727
Surviving the crippling ennui

320
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:30,859
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

321
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,514
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

323
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,603
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

324
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,865
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

325
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,127
I've had no achievement.

326
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,390
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

327
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:41,478
Boring.

328
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,959
- You have a 4.6 GPA.
- Boring.

329
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,265
And you've successfully...

330
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:46,353
- What?
- Well...

331
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,008
You've successfully, um...

332
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,966
Well...

333
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,881
Shit.

334
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,970
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

335
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,493
generationally wealthy gal

336
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,582
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

337
00:16:58,669 --> 00:16:59,714
Fuck.

338
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,456
So...

339
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,502
- Experience something.

340
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,721
Like what?

341
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,070
Something worth writing about.

342
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:13,119
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

343
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,339
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

344
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,558
Easy.

345
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,516
It becomes a conversation

346
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,649
about achieving emancipation

347
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:25,348
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

348
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,133
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

349
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,309
Haven't decided yet.

350
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,093
What's it to you?

351
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,268
Like, he's, like,

352
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,575
- twenty years older than you.
- So?

353
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,403
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

354
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,969
since the dawn of time.

355
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:43,540
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

356
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,238
What?

357
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,804
Your virginity.

358
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,371
Does it mean something to you?

359
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,158
I haven't decided yet.

360
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:54,899
Come to Winnie.

361
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,431
We're, like,

362
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,564
the fucking
American wet dream.

363
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,698
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

364
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,310
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

365
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,704
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

366
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,445
whose sexual standards
are mandated

367
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,708
by the shit porn he downloads.

368
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:21,883
That's deli meat.

369
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,887
I want a dry-aged

370
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,498
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

371
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,109
to take me to pleasure town.

372
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,286
Like...

373
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,026
Wagyu beef.

374
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,901
Hungee.

375
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,381
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

376
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,818
Why not?

377
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,690
He's fine.

378
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,998
He's like,
really fucking smart.

379
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,391
And he's kind.

380
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:53,697
Which means, as my first time,

381
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,526
he'd take his time

382
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,746
to get me all good and juiced.

383
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,617
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

384
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,231
You know,
the first time you have sex,

385
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,710
it's not supposed to hurt.

386
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:08,538
Right?

387
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:12,325
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

388
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,676
You likely won't even bleed.

389
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,940
Didn't know that.

390
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,811
That's because a woman's pain

391
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,900
is valued more
than her pleasure.

392
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,902
But that's a conversation
for another day.

393
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,034
My point...

394
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,647
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

395
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,650
I know what I'm looking for.

396
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,003
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

397
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,135
What do you mean?

398
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,659
I've never seen him look
at a student

399
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,921
the way he looks at you.

400
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,098
He sees you

401
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,839
even though
you hide in plain sight.

402
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,667
- Shut up.
- What?

403
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,929
- Stop!
- No.

404
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,280
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

405
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,020
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

406
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,893
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

407
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,200
No, you're being... Shut up.

408
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,163
I'd fuck you.

409
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,209
I know.

410
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,828
<i>"I was nothing</i>

411
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,308
<i>"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.</i>

412
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,747
<i>"Human ruins
of a madman's love."</i>

413
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,925
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

414
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,930
<i>God, I'd give anything
to feel that.</i>

415
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:42,415
<i>What muse could inspire
this deranged yearning?</i>

416
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,685
<i>To inspire.</i>

417
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,427
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

418
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,346
<i>Could we be that
to each other?</i>

419
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,568
<i>What was I saying?</i>

420
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,180
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

421
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,966
<i>Feels good.</i>

422
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,490
<i>It feels pink.</i>

423
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:15,926
Never forget.

424
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,625
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

425
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,062
It's very big, it's very bold.

426
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,891
To us,
it might seem a little...

427
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,284
much.

428
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,113
If we don't stick
to the brief,

429
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,028
it gets a little bit woolly.

430
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:34,510
Uh, can you see me
after school, please?

431
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,601
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

432
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,081
<i>It's like a sugar cube
under the tongue.</i>

433
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,169
...a little better.

434
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,780
But worth persevering.

435
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,478
Colby, what?

436
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,262
<i>I want your attention.</i>

437
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,267
Uh, how's Bea?

438
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,617
She's, uh, she's Bea.

439
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,923
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

440
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,533
It's not.

441
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,100
You mean you're not.

442
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,971
No, she's, uh, she's occupied.

443
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,146
All right,
what time is dinner?

444
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,365
Seven o'clock.

445
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,758
And please take a shower.

446
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,237
Are you worried?

447
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,284
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

448
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,764
Top three worst nightmares.

449
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:13,462
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

450
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,464
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

451
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,597
Aw, cutie.

452
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,947
- Hey.
- What?

453
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,296
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

454
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,428
Check it out now.

455
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,700
- It's close, right?
- To?

456
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,005
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

457
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,180
All right, man.
- Bye, Professor.

458
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,573
- Love you.

459
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,284
Ooh!

460
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,765
F... Hi. Uh...

461
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:00,770
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

462
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,903
- I won't tell.
- That's generous, thank you.

463
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,601
Uh, hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

464
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,038
I'm waiting for Winnie.

465
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,127
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

466
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,129
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

467
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,610
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

468
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,439
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

469
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,528
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

470
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,009
What's Winnie doing?

471
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,314
She's applying to Vandy.

472
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,968
You would be pleased to know.

473
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,666
And are you?

474
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,320
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

475
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,236
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

476
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,368
Maybe.

477
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,414
From afar.

478
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,285
As it burns.

479
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,027
- Like Nero.

480
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:43,813
Well, that's...

481
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,163
So, uh,
how far are we talkin'?

482
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,469
Yale far.

483
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,079
Yale far? My God!

484
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,081
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

485
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,866
and read Joan Didion or what?

486
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,607
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

487
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,177
You ever been to

488
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,831
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

489
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,485
No. What's that?

490
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,270
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

491
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,489
Victorian Village.

492
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,273
- What is that?
- What's...

493
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,014
What's that? It's blank.

494
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,494
Ca... How can you disdain

495
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,670
of what Tennessee has to offer

496
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:18,631
without conducting a thorough,
uh, cultural investigation?

497
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,284
Educated judgment.

498
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:23,462
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

499
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,464
Because they're bad?

500
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,771
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

501
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,730
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

502
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:32,862
Yeah.

503
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,517
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

504
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,866
I think you might
be surprised.

505
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,392
You wanted to see me?

506
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,046
This week's story,

507
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:47,790
uh, you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

508
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:48,922
I enjoyed this one.

509
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:54,275
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

510
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:56,669
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

511
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:01,935
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

512
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,462
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

513
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,030
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

514
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,684
"like a hypergiant star

515
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,512
"burning to ash.

516
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:19,082
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

517
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,520
"We are what we are.

518
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,740
"And all creatures must eat."

519
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:31,355
- Um...
- Damn. That, I mean...

520
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,966
I was not expecting that.

521
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,098
Um...

522
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,101
She's not reluctant.

523
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,451
She's resigned.

524
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,714
- To her death?
- No.

525
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:42,889
To the order of things.

526
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,022
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

527
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,329
- Phew. It's dark.
- It's nature.

528
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,635
That's true.

529
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,857
You memorized it.

530
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,293
Uh...

531
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,513
Well, I'm eidetic.

532
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,341
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

533
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:04,650
You are...

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,655
You're exceptionally talented.

535
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,787
- Do I get an A?
- Well, how about a jumpstart

536
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,310
on the midterm?

537
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:15,225
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

538
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,924
I want you to write
a short story

539
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,926
in the style
of your favorite author.

540
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:22,885
I think it could be
the highlight

541
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,583
of your portfolio submission

542
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,062
- to Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

543
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,673
-  Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

544
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,065
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

545
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:31,981
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

546
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,069
Thought you would.

547
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,723
Good.

548
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:37,944
I read your book.

549
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,555
- Oh, God. Well, uh...

550
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,648
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

551
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,998
found it, uh,

552
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:52,393
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

553
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,612
I would call it...

554
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,223
grand and tragic.

555
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,965
Okay.

556
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,750
Romantic horror.

557
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,059
That's, uh...

558
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,453
"She was an electric white

559
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,934
"noon-shadow moon

560
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,503
"casting cold light like water

561
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,200
"over the flat earth
of my face.

562
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,290
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

563
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,118
"But the moon,

564
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,425
"the moon...

565
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,254
"I stared until I was nothing

00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,386
"but a bleached bone monument

567
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,000
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

568
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:40,746
Well, you memorized that, right?

569
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,886
That was too much.
That was weird.

570
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,105
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

571
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,760
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

572
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,370
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

573
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,417
which felt tangible.

574
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,768
Like I'd touched somethin'.

575
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,295
You know,
I haven't written anything

576
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,601
- in a very long time.
- Why not?

577
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,690
I don't know.

578
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:13,648
Do I know?

579
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,346
Mm?

580
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,697
Uh...

581
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,307
I guess I got married.

582
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,701
Started teaching.

583
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,836
I don't have anything else
to say.

584
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,013
You're uninspired.

585
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,363
- You judging me?
- I am challenging you.

586
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,887
That's my job.

587
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,810
Hi, Winnie.
- Oh, no.

588
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,164
- Hungee.
I think she's hungry.

589
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,426
She just doesn't use
real words

590
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,906
because she's a child.

591
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,259
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

592
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,782
- I knew it.
- Please don't start.

593
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,262
Don't.
- Your hair looks good.

594
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:03,263
I will not go...
- I'm more concerned...

595
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,873
...gently into the good night.

596
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,048
- No, I know. You look fine.
Like you have.

597
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,354
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

598
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,181
that you got two damn phones
on the table

599
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,312
like you're a rapper.

600
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,836
This one
is my professional phone.

601
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,402
And the other one...

602
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:13,839
The other one...
- ...is for selling drugs.

603
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,144
- The other one is personal.
Oh, yeah?

604
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,145
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

605
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,845
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

606
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,760
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

607
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:24,284
- I'm getting angry now.

608
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,025
Well...
Well, hi.

609
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,983
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

610
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,724
So, what is the holdup?

611
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,160
A fuck-up...
- Bea. Come on.

612
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:32,814
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

613
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,948
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

614
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,167
- On me.
- Another Maker's.

615
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,821
Okay, you got it.

616
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,867
- Coach?
Blue Moon.

617
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:43,520
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

618
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,609
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

619
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,829
Oh, you think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

620
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,309
Gets me
a better grade.

621
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:51,398
Doesn't it?

622
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,356
- That might be true, yeah.
- Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

623
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:54,836
I'm good, Winnie.

624
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:55,968
Designated driver.

625
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,491
- Oh.
Oh, really?

626
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,753
- Unless you wanna do it.
- First I'm hearing of this.

627
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,843
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

628
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,454
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

629
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,021
- Boring?

630
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,066
What? And let
my students make their grades

631
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,458
with scholastic merit?

632
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:09,590
Do you really think
I'm boring?

633
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,113
In a good way.

634
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,420
Like a nice pastoral.

635
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,291
I'll get those drinks for you.

636
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,902
Yeah. "Pastoral."

637
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:18,338
She just called you a field.

638
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,600
At best.

639
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,428
- She's cute.
- Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

640
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,690
And she can paint.

641
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,300
She's in my morning class.

642
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,825
Oh, is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

643
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,522
That's Cairo.

644
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,871
- Cairo?
Yeah.

645
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,220
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

646
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,092
He sure did.

647
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,051
- Is she pretty?
Is she pretty?

648
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:37,836
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

649
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,359
Damn. Even worse.

650
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,230
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

651
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,972
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

652
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,496
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

653
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,237
And it's rare as well

654
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,630
- to be so engaged and so...
- Hmm. I bet is is. Yes.

655
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,414
- So worshipped.
- So worthy.

656
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,242
- Wanna be like me.
- She, in earnest

657
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:55,897
uses words
like "vituperation."

658
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,072
Please.

659
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,769
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

660
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,381
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

661
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,687
Bea, she's extraordinary.

662
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:05,515
- Okay?
- But enjoy it while you can.

663
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:07,300
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

664
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,128
Rural education
not as romantic

665
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:10,433
as you thought it'd be, huh?

666
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,870
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

667
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,567
<i>- Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

668
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,003
- That's on you, man.
- Just cool stories

669
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,526
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

670
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:19,268
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

671
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,835
- Oh, he's judging you.
- Yes, he is. I feel it.

672
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,141
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

673
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,533
Are too.

674
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,144
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

675
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,710
"without inspiring the pupil

676
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:29,888
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

677
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,498
- Horace Mann.
- Ten points to Slytherin.

678
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:32,586
That's so rich.

679
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,283
I wanted to be a teacher.

680
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,371
You fell back on it.

681
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,156
And by the way,
I love teaching.

682
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,114
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

683
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:40,942
- Hey, than what?
- Writing.

684
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:42,944
Goddamn, Beatrice.
- What does that mean?

685
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,467
You don't have kids.

686
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,294
You don't have kids.
You don't have

687
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,774
brain damage, right?

688
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,819
So, um, you stopped writing

689
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,821
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

690
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,693
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

691
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:54,651
I'm a writer.

692
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,131
You haven't put pen to page

693
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,916
since your stories got panned.

694
00:31:58,699 --> 00:31:59,700
You're not a writer.

695
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:00,831
Hmm.

696
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,617
Well, okay.

697
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,227
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

698
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,750
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

699
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:07,926
It's that you don't.

700
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,103
You chose to be a teacher.

701
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,018
Why would I see you
as anything else?

702
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,760
'Cause you married a writer.

703
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:18,066
I did.

704
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:19,589
Didn't I?

705
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,734
<i>Why am I here?</i>

706
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,347
<i>It's not for the poetry,
I'll tell you that.</i>

707
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,571
<i>It's for the thrill
of something</i>

708
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,921
<i>that I've managed to go
my whole life without knowing.</i>

709
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,145
<i>An ache of anticipation
that you'll be here.</i>

710
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,803
<i>And it will mean something
that you are.</i>

711
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,634
<i>Be here.</i>

712
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,288
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

713
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,337
"Stay, illusion.

714
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,861
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

715
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:18,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

716
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:19,780
Can I sit?
Of course.

717
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,177
What's that you got there?

718
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:28,136
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

719
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,877
Said the barrister's daughter.

720
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:31,922
Do you know
all these people?

721
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,315
Uh, most of them.

722
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,274
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

723
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:37,798
- Like group therapy?

724
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,714
Yeah, exactly that.

725
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,760
Who's that fellow?
That's Elliot.

726
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,719
Three-time Ostrander winner.

727
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,547
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

728
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,288
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

729
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,680
Hmm.

730
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,205
"It is my intention
to escape you

731
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,469
"and leave you far behind...

732
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,299
"...bereft of me and aching.

733
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,650
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

734
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:06,870
"Not quite heartache.

735
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,351
"Not quite homesick.

736
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,962
"Me-shaped and filled

737
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,008
"with the remnants of stars.

738
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:18,621
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

739
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,971
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

740
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,975
"The hideous pulse,

741
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,239
"the shouting blood,

742
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,938
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

743
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,113
"with wanting

744
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,291
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

745
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,296
"And yet
some part of me stays.

746
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,211
"Some bit,

747
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,213
"some parcel,

748
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,738
"some ash left behind.

749
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,787
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

750
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:57,660
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

751
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,275
"But they are not me.

752
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,496
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

753
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:14,024
"I will never fit there
again."

754
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:24,600
What?

755
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,560
I can see.

756
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,649
It was really something.

757
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,434
Hot dog.

758
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,393
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

759
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,482
Yes, I did.

760
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:38,571
Have more faith.

761
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,058
<i>What is the word?</i>

762
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,193
<i>It's not falling.
That's too stale.</i>

763
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,545
<i>It's more deliberate
than that.</i>

764
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:01,463
<i>It's recognition
of what we really are.</i>

765
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:05,815
<i>Ghosts.</i>

766
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,819
<i>You do see me.</i>

767
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,606
<i>And I see you.</i>

768
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:25,661
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

769
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,663
- Go inside.
- And miss Godot?

770
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,143
Gifts for the wallflowers.

771
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,884
Oh. Okay.
Mm. Hmm.

772
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,364
Thank you.
What's this?

773
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,105
Coffee.
- No, no.

774
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,543
What's this? What is...
What's with the, uh, new look?

775
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,285
Thank you for this. It's,
uh... It's very generous.

776
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,200
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

777
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,940
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

778
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,681
- What flavor?
- Split fig.

779
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,857
Mm.

780
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,207
Excuse me.

781
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,773
It's good.
- Come on, man.

782
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,210
You got
a little split fig in you?

783
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:54,603
- Not right now. Really?
- Caught in your throat?

784
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,431
- You know what you should do?
What should I do?

785
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,867
You should make a logo
and sell these

786
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,521
- to raise money for the team.

787
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:01,393
Don't laugh.

788
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,481
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

789
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:03,786
- Oh, yeah.
- He doesn't count.

790
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,484
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

791
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,529
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

792
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,661
Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:09,749
She's really good
at that stuff.

794
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:11,664
Really?
- Coach.

795
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,536
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

796
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:16,016
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

797
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,626
What's in it for you?

798
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,541
- What's in it for me?
Mm-hmm.

799
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:22,370
Oh, well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

800
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,154
Connection. 5%.

801
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,811
- I'm the Biscuit Batter.
- No. Once more with pride.

802
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,901
- I'm the Biscuit Batter!
- Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

803
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,251
I'm the...

804
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:34,643
I'm gonna work on that.

805
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,210
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

806
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,343
- Y'all coming inside?
- You go ahead.

807
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,040
All right, suit yourself.

808
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,085
I'll suit myself. See you now.

809
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,348
Mm.

810
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,052
Hi.

811
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:54,620
Hi.

812
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,364
You're sweet.

813
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,497
When it suits.

814
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:07,415
Please.

815
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,070
Thank you.
Mm.

816
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,312
What did he say
about the outfit?

817
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,096
He didn't have
to say anything.

818
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,968
Oh.

819
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,318
You ready? Can we go?

820
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,145
No. I need to stop
by his class.

821
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,757
Can I watch?

822
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:46,106
- Oh, hi.

823
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,237
Hey.

824
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,326
How are you, kid?

825
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:52,330
Are you in a hurry?

826
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,983
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little, uh,

827
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,073
weekend vacation with my wife.

828
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,382
What do writers
do on vacation?

829
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,514
Uh, excuse me.

830
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,560
Um, well,
they pretend to write

831
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,083
someplace else, I guess.

832
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,609
Uh, can we talk about
the midterm?

833
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,088
Uh, sure, what's on your mind?

834
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,916
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

835
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,396
Okay. Who is it?

836
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,050
Henry Miller.

837
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,661
Provocative and,
uh...

838
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,272
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

839
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,797
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

840
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,146
You know, his decadence,

841
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,931
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

842
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:30,977
his, um,
destruction of convention.

843
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,109
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

844
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:38,898
- Do you not think I can do it?
- Look,

845
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:41,727
Miller is public enemy
number one

846
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:42,945
with the censors.

847
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,773
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

848
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,515
So?

849
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:52,346
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

850
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,960
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

851
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:00,963
Okay.

852
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:02,617
Okay, yes?

853
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,663
Okay, I trust you.

854
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,274
Write what you know,
little ghost.

855
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,237
Damn, I gotta go. Uh...

856
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,892
Do me a favor.

857
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,155
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

858
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:20,766
Take a recess.

859
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,508
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

860
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,553
Uh, listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

861
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,641
Bye, Winnie.

862
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,080
- Don't do that.

863
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:33,735
Don't look at me like that.

864
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:38,610
Hmm...

865
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,090
"Oh..."

866
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:43,005
No, I never did that.

867
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:44,703
- Stop.

868
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,358
Wait, Winnie, don't...

869
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,796
"Oh, Mr. Miller,

870
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:55,235
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

871
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,064
"and breakin' all the rules!"

872
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:59,457
Okay, enough, enough.

873
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,067
- You need to get off his desk.

874
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:02,677
I did not say it like that.

875
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,244
Oh, but you meant it
like that.

876
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,115
- No, I didn't.
- You're seducin' him,

877
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:08,291
you floozy.

878
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:10,163
- We make a good double team.

879
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,252
Hi.

880
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,862
Am I interruptin'?

881
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,908
- We were just leavin'.
Where's Jon?

882
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,605
Uh, where's Mr. Miller?

883
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:18,780
He left.

884
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,348
Shoot.
Oh, while I have you. Cairo.

885
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,089
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

886
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,307
And, uh, Winnie...

887
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,266
- I'd like your help too.
- With what?

888
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,528
Well, can you keep the secret?

889
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:28,616
Sure can.

890
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,748
I bake biscuits.

891
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,053
He's gonna have
the baseball team

892
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,402
sell them to raise money.

893
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,448
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

894
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:36,102
I think that's really cool.

895

00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,785
<i>"and slid two deft fingers</i>

1069
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:35,135
<i>"into the warm darkness
of her virgin cunt."</i>

1070
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:36,745
<i>"She felt him shift."</i>

1071
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:38,051
<i>"He peeled the wet
cotton down her legs</i>

1072
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,183
<i>"and pressed into her
from behind."</i>

1073
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,923
<i>"The width of his face..."</i>

1074
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,490
<i>"The thousand years
of violence and conquering</i>

1075
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:44,623
<i>"boiled within him as he held
the mouth of her pubis</i>

1076
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,928
<i>-"like a hooked fish."</i>
<i>"Searching for</i>

1077
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,452
<i>"the answer to a question
he'd doubted."</i>

1078
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:48,931
<i>"But there it was."</i>
<i>"The answer</i>

1079
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,629
<i>-"and the question."</i>
<i>"The cicatrix</i>

1080
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,239
<i>-"that will never heal."</i>
<i>"The serpent's apple."</i>

1081
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:53,893
<i>"Her cul was slick
against his fingers."</i>

1082
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,155
<i>"Just as he imagined
it was when she was alone."</i>

1083
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:56,417
<i>"Maybe in
her bedroom..."</i>

1084
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:57,853
<i>"Her own fingers
knuckle deep."</i>

1085
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,724
<i>"Trying to rub out
that itch."</i>

1086
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:00,029
<i>"The ache inside.</i>

1087
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,205
<i>"He saw himself

1088
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,902
<i>"brutally fucking away

1089
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,121
<i>"that swirled her clit</i>

00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,035
<i>"and choked her

1091
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,907
<i>"He would fill her up
with cum."</i>

1092
00:52:58,436 --> 00:52:59,437
Good morning.

1093
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:07,184
Are you okay?

1094
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:11,840
What's wrong?

1095
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,803
Your story.

1096
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,892
Oh.

1097
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:21,850
You didn't like it?

1098
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,507
You have to choose
another author.

1099
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:30,032
Why?

1100
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,557
This is inappropriate.

1101
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,560
"Inappropriate."

1102
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:36,648
What does that mean?

1103
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:39,564
Why did you write this?

1104
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:40,913
- You asked me to.
- Uh-huh.

1105
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:43,916
Okay.

1106
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,483
Why did you choose
that material?

1107
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,354
You said,
"Write what you know."

1108
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:49,226
And this is what you know?

1109
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:50,749
This is...

1110
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:53,621
us.

1111
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:55,319
No.

1112
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:57,059
This is... This is you.

1113
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:58,713
I don't...

1114
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,324
I don't understand this.

1115
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:02,021
- Are you being serious?

1116
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,415
Okay. It's...

1117
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:07,113
It's about two like people
abnegating social convention.

1118
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,421
You know, it's commentary

1119
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:11,944
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

1120
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:14,294
that's super saturated
with pornography.

1121
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:17,254
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

1122
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,125
on young people's
expectations.

1123
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,476
It's about
inexorable attraction.

1124
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,175
It's layered.

1125
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,003
- This is pornography.
- Yes.

1126
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,528
So put it in your diary,
not on my fuckin' desk.

1127
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,705
Write a new story
with a new author.

1128
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:38,971
I'm not gonna indulge this.

1129
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,755
Are you talking about
the story or us?

1130
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,279
Both.

1131
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,893
You already have.
You inspired it.

1132
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,288
I can't accept it.

1133
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,769
But you can't or you won't?

1134
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,253
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

1135
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,385
- Hey. Hey.
- ...and it looks like

1136
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:02,647
you're measurin'.

1137
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,346
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

1138
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,043
- and say what you mean.
- Rewrite it.

1139
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,131
Why?

1140
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:11,656
- You know why.
- Tell me.

1141
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,266
- Say it.
- If you don't rewrite this,

1142
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:14,528
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

1143
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:15,921
- Tell me why.
- I don't have to tell you

1144
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:17,052
a goddamn thing.

1145
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,450
It made you feel something
that scared you.

1146
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:25,409
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Then say them yourself.

1147
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:27,889
Tell me what it made you feel.

1148
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,805
Incredibly foolish

1149
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,721
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

1150
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,073
What was I before you read it?

1151
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:49,911
A student.

1152
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:53,567
You built the world.

1153
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:58,311
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

1154
00:55:58,398 --> 00:55:59,791
but in real life.

1155
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:04,056
You can't blur the lines

1156
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:05,274
and then expect me to see
a boundary

1157
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,363
when I suddenly cross it.

1158
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:12,325
Let me be very, very clear...

1159
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:15,415
...with you.

1160
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:19,506
You're my student.

1161
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:21,943
And I'm your teacher.

1162
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,077
That's all.

1163
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:29,211
Any misconception of that
is something,

1164
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:31,431
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

1165
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:33,912
alone.

1166
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,426
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

1167
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,255
Yeah, I know what I said.

1168
00:57:13,342 --> 00:57:14,996
You don't know anything
you say.

1169
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:23,440
- This is good.
- Mm-hmm.

1170
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:26,007
And you know it is.

1171
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,752
So, let's examine
the real issue.

1172
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,191
It's not my writing.

1173
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:40,326
- It's yours.

1174
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:44,069
Good try.

1175
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,725
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

1176
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,074
What?

1177
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,163
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

1178
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,905
Right?

1179
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,085
"Overreaching
without ambition."

1180
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:07,266
Do you know what that means?

1181
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:13,925
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

1182
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,017
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

1183
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:25,632
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

1184
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:29,331
are mediocre.

1185
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,555
You wanna fail me?

1186
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,167
I fucking dare you.

1187
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,998
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

1188
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:47,698
And you better know
what it means.

1189
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:52,180
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

1190
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,534
And if you're not very,
very careful

1191
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:03,191
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

1192
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,761
it will devour you
until you are as small

1193
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:08,936
as you pretend to be.

1194
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:14,289
And you will disappear.

1195
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:20,295
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

1196
00:59:20,382 --> 00:59:22,036
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

1197
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,049
How disappointin' you must be

1198
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,703
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

1199
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:46,452
No wonder you're here.

1200
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,602
<i>Heartbreak is
a slow-motion car crash</i>

1201
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,429
<i>set to Mozart.</i>

1202
01:00:07,516 --> 01:00:10,171
<i>You know the one.</i> The Requiem.

1203
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:17,309
<i>It tastes like graveyard dirt.</i>

1204
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,490
<i>It smells
like burnin' flowers.</i>

1205
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,366
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

1206
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:07,228
How you doin', Professor?

1207
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:09,317
Had a bad day.

1208
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,854
- Oh, you want a drink?
- Thank you.

1209
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,862
What?
So, he was offended?

1210
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:34,255
He was affected.

1211
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:37,694
Are you still into him?

1212
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:44,962
He's a pretender.

1213
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:50,358
You know, at least what

1214
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:51,577
you see with Boris
is what you get.

1215
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:54,058
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

1216
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,063
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

1217
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,455
and gas station sushi.

1218
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:05,417
Aren't you in love with him?

1219
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,117
Mm.

1220
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,732
What happened?

1221
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,522
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

1222
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,219
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

1223
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:27,395
Was it with her?

1224
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,484
Your acolyte?

1225
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:34,751
She drafted something

1226
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:38,189
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

1227
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,408
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

1228
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:42,106
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

1229
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:44,804
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

1230
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,284
not his subject matter.

1231
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:47,415
Oh.

1232
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:50,505
What's the subject matter?

1233
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:52,116
An English teacher
and a student

1234
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:56,033
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

1235
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,425
- and "cherry popping."
- Oh.

1236
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,253
- Those words exactly.

1237
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,820
Show me right now.

1238
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:03,301
Don't...

1239
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:06,783
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

1240
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,570
You fuck Fillmore yet?

1241
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,357
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

1242
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,881

Baby, it's a love letter.

1246
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:35,594
She's got it bad.

1247
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:37,422
Tell me how she describes you.

1248
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:39,076
- You can read it right there.
- No.

1249
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:41,165
You tell me.

1250
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:44,646
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

1251
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,693
And I want you
to do the thing.

1252
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,825
No. No.

01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,503

you're drunk textin' him.

1280
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:23,528
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

you might be doin' drunkenly.

1282
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:26,879
Serious?

1283
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,055
Ask him what he's up to.

1284
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,671
- Oh, we've got company.

1285
01:05:36,758 --> 01:05:38,456
- They what?
- Hey, seriously.

1286
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,284
Stop leaving

1288
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,505
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello.

Get a room!

1290
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,382
What up, player?

1291
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,297
Slang? Get out.
- Fuck.

1292
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:54,994
Do you think he likes me?

1293
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:59,216
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

1294
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,265
'Cause those are very
different things

1296
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:09,704
I want both.

1297
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:21,978
You should tell him
you're with me.

1298
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,939
And that we're doing
what all girls do

1299
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,071
when they're alone at night.

1300
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:30,812
- Who is she?

1301
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:31,988
Not telling.

1302
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:41,388
"We are measuring

you've ever dated

a character

1310
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,012
- No, I can't.
- No. You can't.

1311
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,970
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

1312
01:06:58,057 --> 01:06:59,493
- Yeah, you bein' a snob.

1313
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,539
You and I know
Kristy was great.

1314
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,280
He hasn't said anything?

1315
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:11,244
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."

1316
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:12,550
So...

1317
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:21,428
Take off your shirt.

1318
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:26,955
What?

1319
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,132
- Why?
- We are gonna make out.

1320
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:31,525
For him, not for you.

1321
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,617
Well, it can be
a little for me.

1322
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,064
How is this?

1323
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:52,068
Yeah, good.

1324
01:07:56,898 --> 01:07:57,943

a fucking Dutch clock?

1328
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,053
I meant like this.

1329
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:24,187
Close.

01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:32,489
-  Another beer?
- Mm.

01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:34,186

01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:03,781
Joyce got the story.

1366
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:07,654
What?

1367
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:11,310
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.

01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:15,227

there's no mistakin'.

1370
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:19,100
And she'd like to speak
to me formally

1371
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:21,407
about the necessary paperwork.

1372
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,280
Paperwork for what?

1373
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:26,978
An incident report.

1374
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:28,109
Uh...

1375
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,242
I think she did it.

1376
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:33,419
Who did what, huh?

1377
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:36,640
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

1378
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:42,298
It's a short story, Jonathan.

1379
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:46,867
It's not

1380
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:48,216
Mm-hmm. I know.

1381
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:54,005
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...

1382
01:11:55,093 --> 01:11:56,399
it's the implication.

1383
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:59,532
Why if she can convince them

1384
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:01,882
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...

1385
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,321
Well, I could lose my job.

1386
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,457
That's not all you could lose.

1387
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:25,950
Did somethin' happen
between you?

1388
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:29,301
Nothin' I invited.

1389
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:35,002
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

1390
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:38,266
They're full
of emotional violence

1391
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,747
- and vituperation.
- Mm-hmm.

1392
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:44,969
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1393
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:34,758
Have you seen Cairo?

1394
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:39,110
- I haven't.
- I haven't seen her.

1395
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:40,503
And I just thought...

1396
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:44,681
- maybe you had.
- I haven't. No.

1397
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:51,731
- You don't text?
- She tell you we do?

1398
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:54,691
Well, you know...

1399
01:13:56,736 --> 01:14:00,566
Cairo says everything...

1400
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,136
And nothing.

1401
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:14,188
I don't understand
what's happening.

1402
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:19,629
Don't you, Winnie?

1403
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,830
How did it start?
In your own words.

1404
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,701
We recognized each other.

1405
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,312
She's exceptionally talented.

1406
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,620
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.

1407
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,404
Did you exhibit favoritism?

1408
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,624
- Give special mentorship?
- Of course.

1409
01:14:58,711 --> 01:14:59,799
He was excited to give me

1410
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:01,540
the midterm assignment
in advance.

1411
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,629
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

1412
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:04,891
It's 25%.

1413
01:15:04,978 --> 01:15:07,154
Enough to destroy my GPA.

1414
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:08,504
<i>You do know

01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:14,466
You know that.

1419
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,250
I wanted to help her
stand out.

1420
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:18,644
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

1421
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:22,169
Have you read his work?

1422
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,693
How often have you
been together

1423
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,782
beyond the classroom?

1424
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:27,392
We would see each other
before school,

1425
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:31,091
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

1426
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:33,703
And what would you do?

1427
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,313
We would talk about literature

1428
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,576
and things that
we cared about.

1429
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,840
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

1430
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,670
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

1431
01:15:44,757 --> 01:15:45,758
And that, well, that...

1432
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:47,368
That's how it started,
I guess.

1433
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:48,848
Not...

1434
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:51,721
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

1435
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:55,376
Do you see each other
socially?

1436
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:56,900
Absolutely not.

1437
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:59,337
We went to
a poetry reading together.

1438
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:01,034
Would you consider
yourself friends?

1439
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:02,253
Without question.

1440
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:05,430
We are as close,

1441
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:09,390
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

1442
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:10,827
Have you ever been
alone together

1443
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:12,176
outside of school?

1444
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:13,830
Only a couple of times.

1445
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:15,919
Y... Yes, sort of.

1446
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:19,792
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone

1447
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:22,795
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,

1448
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:27,147
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

1449
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,279
to Nashville.

1450
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:29,802
We didn't actually go,

1451
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:33,153
but, you know,
we were going to go.

1452
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:36,069
He came to my house.

1453
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:38,115
Were you alone?

1454
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,641
Yes.

1455
01:16:43,642 --> 01:16:45,078
My parents were out of town.

1456
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:46,558
What happened?

1457
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:49,866
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

1458
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,611
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

1459
01:16:57,569 --> 01:16:58,744
I returned her phone.

1460
01:16:58,831 --> 01:17:00,311
Did you go inside the house?

1461
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,143
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

1462
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:08,667
When she sent the story,

1463
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,756
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

1464
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:21,854
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

1465
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:23,813
uh,

1466
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:26,554
to defend my position here.

1467
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:30,123
'Cause there isn't.

1468
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:41,439
Jonathan...

1469
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:44,703
are you in love with her?

1470
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:50,404
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

1471
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,537
It's not about my feelings.

1472
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:56,672
It's what she implies.

1473
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:58,412
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

1474
01:17:58,499 --> 01:18:00,676
Oh, fuck me.
- ...while you're sittin' there

1475
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:02,199
swiping through pictures

1476
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:03,635
- of naked students.
- Oh, he's so smart, everybody.

1477
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:04,810
That's why I deleted it.

1478
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:05,898
You deleted it.

1479
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,465
- Oh, good.
- No. No.

1480
01:18:07,552 --> 01:18:09,162
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

1481
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:11,338
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

1482
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:12,949
- Come on. Jesus.
- Oh, I'm shakin'

1483
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:14,298
in my fuckin' boots.

1484
01:18:14,385 --> 01:18:15,603
You know the difference
between you and me?

1485
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:19,303
You cannot identify the line.

1486
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:21,653
So, you cross it.

1487
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:23,568
Right.

1488
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,222
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

1489
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,007
defensive.

1490
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:30,183
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

1491
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,271
You can't be serious.

1492
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:33,143
- Like you?
- Yes.

1493
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,927
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

1494
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,581
- Mm.
- I don't cross it.

1495
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,539
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

1496
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,414
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

1497
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,807
You don't know... Oh, man,

1498
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:46,504
you think
you're my collateral damage?

1499
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,596
- All right, man. Just go, man.
- All right. No, no.

1500
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,816
- Yeah, all right. I will.
- All right, yeah.

1501
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:55,556
- Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for your help.

1502
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:57,167
Appreciate that.

1503
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:12,791
I've been suspended.

1504
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:18,928
Did you fuck her?

1505
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:20,886
No.

1506
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:22,758
- Then what happened?

1507
01:19:24,194 --> 01:19:26,065
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

1508
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:29,242
She handed in the story,

1509
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:31,244
which I obviously
could not accept.

1510
01:19:31,331 --> 01:19:33,246
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

1511
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,118
- That's how I understand it.
- Hm.

1512
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:36,467
So you flirted with her,

1513
01:19:36,554 --> 01:19:37,729
- and then, you rejected her.
No,

1514
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:38,774
- it wasn't flirting.
- What was it then?

1515
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,210
- It was affection!

1516
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:44,388
Well, are you
attracted to her?

1517
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:49,959
I'll tell you.

1518
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:54,833
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

1519
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,530
who read your little book,

1520
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:58,881
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

1521
01:19:58,968 --> 01:20:01,579
You fucking fell for it.

1522
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,929
Finally. Finally!

1523
01:20:04,016 --> 01:20:07,106
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

1524
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,978
And you can't help
but get hard for it

1525
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:10,414
because, what, now suddenly

1526
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,024
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

1527
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:13,156
Yes!

1528
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:16,333
She made me feel
worth something.

1529
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,508
What does that tell you?

1530
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:23,383
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

1531
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,777
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

1532
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:27,561
- Fuck you.
- Oh, be my guest.

1533
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,825
Stop.

1534
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,609
- Did you?
- No, I didn't fuck her.

1535
01:20:31,696 --> 01:20:32,828
Why do you look so guilty?

1536
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,003
I haven't done anything wrong.

1537
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:37,180
- Oh, didn't you?

1538
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,490
God, I'm in hell.

1539
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:46,058
Well, make yourself at home.

1540
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:47,799
Why are you so punishing?

1541
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:49,583
You wanted her.

1542
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,542
I can read it all
in your face.

1543
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,891
How can you see anything
in this state,

1544
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,501
you fuckin' alcoholic?

1545
01:20:56,373 --> 01:20:58,766
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

1546
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:01,682
You are a cunt.

1547
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:03,249
And you're a liar.

1548
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:05,121
Liar!

1549
01:21:06,774 --> 01:21:09,386
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

1550
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:11,867
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

1551
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:15,087
like some middling
American hero.

1552
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:17,220
But, Jon, baby...

1553
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:20,440
you're the villain.

1554
01:21:25,228 --> 01:21:27,447
But you can't even see that,
can you?

1555
01:21:42,549 --> 01:21:43,986
Don't you worry for me at all?

1556
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,554
What would I possibly
worry about

1557
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:49,034
other than dying of boredom

1558
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:51,428
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

1559
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:55,214
You...

1560
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:57,173
are...

1561
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,827
vile.

1562
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:08,053
Why don't you write about it?

1563
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:36,516
Spit it out, Winnie.

1564
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,258
What are you doing?

1565
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,740
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

1566
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,439
Is that all?

1567
01:22:46,526 --> 01:22:47,832
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

1568
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:51,357
if you wish to be
very literal.

1569
01:22:51,444 --> 01:22:53,490
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

1570
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:06,590
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

1571
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:08,766
- Why?
- He underestimated me.

1572
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:11,160
I overestimated him.

1573
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:13,423
Are you okay?

1574
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,641
I'm inspired.

1575
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,515
- That's not funny.
- It is.

1576
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:20,778
A little.

1577
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:23,563
- Please don't do this.
- Why?

1578
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,480
You're gonna ruin his life.

1579
01:23:28,177 --> 01:23:29,221
And for what?

1580
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:35,053
To avenge your rejection?

1581
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:38,970
To punish him?

1582
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,409
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

1583
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:45,368
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

1584
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:47,109
Yes.

1585
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,114
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

1586
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:57,467
I'll testify against you.

1587
01:23:57,554 --> 01:23:58,598
No, you won't.

1588
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:01,949
Excuse me?

1589
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,300
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

1590
01:24:05,953 --> 01:24:07,912
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

1591
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:09,392
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

1592
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,571
Two teachers
