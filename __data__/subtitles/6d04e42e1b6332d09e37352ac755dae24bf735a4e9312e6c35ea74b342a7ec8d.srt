1
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,251
I told you
not to look for me.

2
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,588
Please, Father.

3
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,645
That's all I have.

4
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,774
The only proof
of what they've done.

5
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,443
But she looks so...

6
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,486
Human.

7
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,492
But don't let
yourself be fooled.

8
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,665
She wasn't
conceived naturally.

9
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
They found a volunteer.

10
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,595
Someone devoted.

11
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,558
But how did they...

12
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
No, please.

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,186
I can't, uh...

14
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,357
I can't talk about that.

15
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
What I can tell you...

16
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,134
is that the pregnancy
happened quickly.

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,393
She'll be in her teens now.

18
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,645
They're just waiting
until she's old enough.

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,190
Old enough for what?

20
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,902
Old enough for what?

21
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,653
Now, please.

22
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,581
I can't do this anymore.

23
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,751
I can't do this anymore.

24
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,920
I can't.

25
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,548
But please
don't let it touch me again.

26
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,106
Father?

27
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,740
Father Harris?

28
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,910
Father?

29
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,750
Hiding won't
absolve your sins.

30
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,839
You think I want
to be forgiven?

31
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,309
I don't want to be forgiven,
Father Brennan.

32
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,105
I just want it all to be over.

33
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,316
You'll understand...

34
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,944
soon enough.

35
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,993
Father, are you all right?

36
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,082
I'm fine.

37
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,806
Father.

38
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,173
Il volo sette quattro due,

39
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,758
in arrivo da Milano Linate,

40
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,803
arrivera con quindici minuti
di ritardo.

41
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,179
-Margaret Daino?
-Yes.

42
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,305
-Hi.
-Hi.

43
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,932
-I'm Father Gabriel.
-Hello.

44
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,725
Cardinal Lawrence sent me
to fetch you.

45
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,727
-Oh, sure. Thank you.
-Let me help you with that.

46
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,855
He's in the car outside.

47
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,690
I have heard
so much about you.

48
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,150
I feel like
I already know you.

49
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,652
Oh.

50
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
Maggie!

51
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,949
-I'm so happy to see you.
-Oh, me too.

52
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,243
Oh, it's so beautiful here.
It's like a dream.

53
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
Well, wait till you see
the actual city.

54
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,080
Look at you.

55
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,207
It hasn't been a year,
and somehow,
you've found a way

56
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,001
to grow up even more.

57
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,043
Is that
all you've got?

58
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,170
That's it.

59
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,338
Well, my word. Come on.

60
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,882
I'll show you
to your new home.

61
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,623
So, what do you think?

62
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,874
It's wild.

63
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,585
Everything's so different.

64
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,420
Every street that we pass,
there's something to look at.

65
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,255
I just wanna explore.

66
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,590
Isn't it beautiful?

67
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,510
What better place
for you to be taking the veil?

68
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,722
It's wonderful
to see you, Maggie.

69
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,098
Even when you were little,

70
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,851
I knew you were destined
for great things.

71
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,565
See if you can get
around them, Damiano.

72
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,153
These protests
have picked up recently,
I'm afraid.

73
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,239
What are they protesting?

74
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,281
For the workers,

75
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,741
it's about conditions
and wages.

76
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,619
But for the students, well,

77
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,038
it's a rejection
of authority,

78
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,540
even the church.

79
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,419
The world is changing,
Maggie, very fast.

80
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,255
The younger generation
no longer turn to us

81
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,382
-for guidance, I'm afraid.
-Ooh!

82
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,093
But it's
a challenge we've embraced.

83
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,469
Perhaps you'll play your part

84
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
and help
earn back their trust.

85
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,224
I'll try.

86
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,019
Come la treccia!

87
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,462
Tu devi essere
la nostra bella Americana.

88
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,839
This is Sister Silva,

89
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,965
the Abbess.

90
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,092
And she'll take
good care of you.

91
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,177
-Hello.
-Bellissima.

92
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,013
Welcome to our family.

93
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,348
Oh. Thank you.

94
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,308
Ooh.

95
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,770
Come. Come with me.

96
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,356
Let me give you a tour.

97
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,776
We're so happy
to have you here.

98
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,158
This way.

99
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,327
We take care of girls.

100
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,953
Girls only.

101
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,997
A total of 62.

102
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,292
Babies to 18 years of age.

103
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,627
Come this way.

104
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
Buongiorno.

105
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,465
Buongiorno. Hello.

106
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,508
Buongiorno.

107
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,637
The state has
contracted with us

108
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,472
to take in
many unmarried women

109
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,098
who are about to give birth.

110
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
We have
our birthing facilities

111
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,435
here in the hospital wing.

112
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,690
Come, come.

113
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,527
Our doctor will likely deliver
this baby within the week.

114
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,197
-Ciao, Lanoma.
-Salve.

115
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,908
-Come stai?
-Bene.

116
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,827
Tranquilla.
Tutto va bene.

117
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,664
Pazienza, hmm?

118
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,669
Andiamo.

119
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,346
Sister Anjelica.

120
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,769
This is Margaret Daino
from America.

121
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
She grew up here.

122
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,032
Abandoned on our front steps,

123
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,117
and very ill.

124
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,078
But she's very devoted

125
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,832
and she keeps
all the children smiling.

126
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,625
And they all seem very happy.

127
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,087
Scusi.

128
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,673
I should see
what the trouble is.

129
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
Of course.

130
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,678
Via dal
cancello faccello.

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,597
La tua
suora e sempre gentilissima.

132
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,855
Amen.

133
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,775
Hail Mary.

134
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,868
Um...

135
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,745
Ave Maria is my favorite, too.

136
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,999
Il mio preferito.

137
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,797
What's your name?

138
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,466
Come ti chiami?

139
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,139
I'm Margaret.

140
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,559
Mi chiami Margaret.

141
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,570
Hi.

142
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,303
Um...

143
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,680
What are you doing?

144
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,265
Get off of me!

145
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,730
Oh, there you are.

146
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,278
Have you been
behaving yourself, Carlita?

147
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,240
Carlita.

148
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,911
Did you do that drawing
outside, Carlita?

149
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
The one where
the girl's floating

150
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,123
above the other girls?

151
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,210
I thought it was very nice.

152
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,597
Thank you.

153
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,641
Come.

154
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,900
Why is she kept alone
like that

155
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,192
in the middle of the day?

156
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,402
It's safer.

157
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,196
She hurt another child
just yesterday.

158
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,618
Luca will be your driver.

159
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,494
Rome has become
a bit dangerous

160
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,829
with the protests.

161
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,486
Hello?

162
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,670
By Your divine mercy,
rein in the power of evil.

163
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,339
Build us into living stones
of a culture of life,

164
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,425
who demonstrates
in both deed and word,

165
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,635
the truth that every life,
no matter its conditions,

166
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,095
is precious and unrepeatable.

167
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,389
Lord, speak
to every human heart

168
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,640
and fill it
with the conviction:

169
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,975
I am wanted.

170
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,685
I have a task in history.

171
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,729
I am accepted, and I am loved.

172
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,647
It is good that I exist.

173
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,533
Margaret's one of

174
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,326
our worst-behaved children...

175
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,249
What if
she has another episode?

176
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,043
Then you must
tie her to the bed.

177
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,047
Here. Let me show you.

178
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,587
Hi.

179
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,047
Mierda.

180
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,466
Ah, you must be Margaretta.

181
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,717
Yes.

182
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,678
-I'm Luz.
-Oh.

183
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,763
Did I wake you?

184
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,182
No, no. Um...

185
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,892
-I was having a nightmare.
-Oh.

186
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,019
First night nerves?

187
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,855
Don't worry,
same thing happened for me.

188
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,357
If we can't admit
how we are feeling,

189
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,485
our dreams do it for us,
right?

190
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,072
You're a novitiate?

191
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,365
Oh, yeah.

192
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,492
I just figured a little
exploration is healthy

193
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,452
before the big day.

194
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,580
I mean, I will be hiding
this body

195
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,457
under a habit
for the rest of my life.

196
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,293
So, why not let it breathe
a little now?

197
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,382
Coffee?

198
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,430
So how does a girl from...

199
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,143
Uh, Pittsfield.
Massachusetts.

200
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,771
So how does a girl
from Pissfield

201
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,232
end up in Italy
about to take the veil?

202
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,153
Well, Cardinal Lawrence
was, um, a priest

203
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,571
at the orphanage
that I grew up in.

204
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,656
-Mm-hmm.
-And we got pretty close

205
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,241
because, uh,

206
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,577
well, I was somewhat
of a problem child.

207
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,661
Wait.

208
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,745
Wait, wait, wait.

209
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,873
You were a problem child?

210
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,915
Like how?

211
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,586
I don't know.
I guess, uh...

212
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,504
I mean,
I used to get punished a lot.

213
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,051
And how did they punish you?

214
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,595
And where did you get these?

215
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,721
Hey.

216
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,223
And you are a nosy girl.
Do you know that?

217
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,561
Well, would they beat you?

218
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,272
Would they beat me?

219
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,525
No, not really.

220
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,239
I used to have
a pretty active imagination.

221
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,409
I'd get so convinced sometimes

222
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,493
that what I was seeing
was real

223
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,288
that the sisters
would need to, um...

224
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,707
subdue me.

225
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,922
But then Cardinal Lawrence
came to the orphanage,

226
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,549
and, uh,
he was really great, you know.

227
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,717
He really helped me to see

228
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,385
that all that stuff
was just in my head.

229
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,805
Things got a lot better
for me after that.

230
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,227
For me,

231
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,646
it was a voice.

232
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,275
I was 16.

233
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,321
Just kicked out of the house.

234
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,366
It was so cold that night,
and I didn't know what to do.

235
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,830
And then...

236
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,876
this warm wind came...

237
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,255
out of nowhere.

238
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,262
And suddenly it was as if
His voice was all around me.

239
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,682
Inside me even.

240
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,977
So clearly.

241
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,230
And He told me
it didn't matter

242
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
if I had no earthly home

243
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,817
because my true home
was with Him.

244
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,821
And for the first time
in my life,

245
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,574
I felt like I belonged
on this Earth.

246
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,291
Yes, but

247
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,877
even with the most handsome
milkman in town,

248
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,796
we still had
a whole group of us

249
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,464
who took the veil together.

250
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,010
Yes. Now, instead,
girls go off to college

251
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,887
and poor Luz
is taking the veil alone. Hmm.

252
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,265
-Hmm. And Margaret...
-Mm.

253
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,809
Margaret will be alone
in the chapel, too.

254
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,104
Don't worry.
I'll warm it up for you.

255
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,484
Warm up?
What is this "warm it up"?

256
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,403
As if Mr. Milkman
didn't teach you.

257
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,532
I'm sorry!

258
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,367
It's true!

259
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,705
Practice it again.

260
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,333
Sono una farfalla.

261
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,420
E devo volare.

262
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,883
No, no, no. Shy American.

263
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,593
Say it with passione.

264
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,178
With passione?

265
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,472
Okay. All right.

266
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,307
Sono una...

267
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,309
-Farfalla.
-Farfalla.

268
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,894
E devo volare.

269
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,146
Good?

270
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,230
Good.

271
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,315
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

272
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,524
What does it mean?

273
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,069
"I am a teacher
and I love to teach."

274
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,572
Oh.

275
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,199
Hmm.

276
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,872
Silenzio.

277
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,209
Silenzio, ragazze.

278
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,422
Padre nostro,
che sei nei cieli,

279
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,386
sia santificato il tuo nome,

280
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,431
venga il tuo regno,

281
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,435
sia fatta la tua volonta,

282
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,688
come in cielo cosi in terra.

283
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,402
il nostro pane quotidiano,

284
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,695
e rimetti...

285
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,059
No! No!

286
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,104
Margaret.

287
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,230
There you are.

288
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,149
I'm sorry I scared you.
Come on.

289
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,194
I have something
to show you for tonight.

290
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,363
You're gonna love it.

291
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,005
Ah-ha!

292
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,549
There she is.

293
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,885
Oh, my God, you look hot.

294
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,429
-I look naked.
-Yes.

295
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,973
What do you mean, naked?
You look gorgeous.

296
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,099
Come on.

297
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,267
Up with your foot.

298
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,604
-The other one.
-Oh!

299
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,773
Mother Mary.

300
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,359
Don't be nervous.
Can you stand?

301
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,860
No.

302
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,195
Yes, you can.

303
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,988
Hmm? Whoop.

304
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,074
Perfect.

305
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,544
Luz?

306
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,212
Yeah?

307
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,549
I can't do this.

308
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,928
Tell me.

309
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,638
Have you ever been to a bar?

310
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,056
No.

311
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,808
-A disco?
-No.

312
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,101
Anything at all?

313
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,521
Because your whole life,
you've wanted

314
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,606
to give yourself
only to Him, right?

315
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,318
Look, I know.

316
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,612
I know it's scary coming out
from under the habit,

317
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,864
but look at you!

318
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,618
You're a very beautiful girl,
Margaretta.

319
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,122
And you have to understand
that about yourself.

320
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,791
If only to know
what it means to give it up.

321
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,671
So, let yourself feel it.
Okay?

322
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,673
Be brave.

323
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,001
So...

324
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,087
To the bravest girl I know.

325
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,130
Go.

326
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,179
Do you still feel your feet?

327
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,847
Oh, my.

328
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,973
Hmm?

329
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,516
Do you still feel your feet?

330
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,060
Yes.

331
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,353
Okay. Another, then.

332
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,896
Hello.

333
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,357
-Parlate italiano?
-What?

334
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,067
Parlate italiano?

335
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,860
Ah, no.
Not when I'm drinking.

336
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,028
Too hard.

337
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,073
Inglese, per favore, no?

338
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,660
If you can.

339
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,244
I'm Alfonzo,
and this is Paolo.

340
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,287
Hi.

341
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,832
Uh, we can buy you a drink
if you want.

342
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,153
Excuse me.

343
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,238
Um...

344
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,531
Can I have a sip of that?

345
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,409
Ah, yeah, eat it.

346
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,994
Eh...

347
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,040
-Eat it?
-Yes. Eat it.

348
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,002
I was watching this movie
with my mother yesterday.

349
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,212
-Yeah?
-And, um...

350
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,214
And was
with Barbara Streisand,

351
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,383
and I just... I don't know.
I love her and...

352
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,051
-You do?
-I do.

353
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,636
-Barbra?
-I love Barbara.

354
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,221
-Yes, Barbara Streisand.
-Barbara?

355
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,639
Barbra, yeah.

356
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,976
I mean, it was the part
with the "Hello, gorgeous."

357
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,561
Hello, gorgeous.

358
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,645
Gorgeous.

359
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,938
Gorgeous.

360
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,692
Uh, what? Gorgeous.

361
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,318
-Gor... Gorgeous.
-Gorgeous.

362
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,321
You know, it's... Sorry
if I'm not a "professional..."

363
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,407
-It was good.
-...like Barbra.

364
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,869
But, um, what do you...
what do you do?

365
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,955
Um...

366
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,461
Well, since you asked, um...

367
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,847
-Volare?
-Volare.

368
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,560
Okay.

369
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,276
-What?
-Dai... dai!

370
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,737
-Come on.
-Where are you going?

371
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,197
Come on.

372
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,823
This is the BBC World Service,

373
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,242
and it's the 3rd of June,
1971.

374
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,702
Riots have erupted in Rome,

375
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,329
with clashes between
the far left

376
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,664
and far right groups
escalating rapidly.

377
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,542
The unrest has caused
widespread damage to property

378
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,878
and has left
several people injured.

379
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,671
Italian authorities
are struggling

380
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,090
to contain the violence
and restore order.

381
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,884
Public transportation,
factories,

382
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,344
and schools
are heavily affected...

383
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,511
Good morning.

384
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,388
Good morning.

385
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,057
Did you have fun last night?

386
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,266
Yeah.

387
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,481
I'm guessing you've never
drunk like that before.

388
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,068
I didn't, like,

389
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,111
embarrass myself
or anything last night,
did I?

390
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,446
No. No.

391
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,906
Okay.

392
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,991
You were well-behaved.

393
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,953
Mostly.

394
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,833
Okay. I found you before
anything got out of control.

395
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,752
And for the record,
I was a very nice friend.

396
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,420
You came home with me.

397
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,132
Thanks.

398
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,551
But it wasn't easy
pulling you away from him.

399
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,058
What do you mean?
I didn't...

400
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,978
Uh...

401
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,941
Let's just say
you took my advice to heart.

402
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,152
You were a very brave girl,
Margaretta.

403
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,117
But, hey, don't worry.

404
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,827
It's our little secret. Okay?

405
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,068
I am loved. I am accepted.

406
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,282
It is good
to be a human being.

407
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,867
It is good to be alive.

408
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,150
Excuse me.

409
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,193
May I sit?

410
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,362
No, please, please stay.

411
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,406
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

412
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,158
My name is Father Brennan.

413
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,952
I apologize for startling you.
Please sit with me.

414
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,038
This will only take
a few minutes.

415
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,748
Your name is Margaret Daino.

416
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,541
You work at the orphanage.

417
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,584
You're new there.

418
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,921
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

419
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,672
It's about the girl. Scianna.

420
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,508
Carlita?

421
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,426
You must be very careful,
Margaret.

422
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,553
Bad things will start
to happen around her.

423
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,138
Evil things.

424
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,389
No, I have to go now.

425
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,767
No, no. Please, please.
Come see me tonight.

426
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,228
Saint Rita cloister, room 42.

427
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,270
I'll tell you everything.

428
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,864
Good morning, farfalla.

429
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,284
Good morning.

430
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,036
What's wrong?

431
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,956
Nothing.
Just a little tired,
that's all.

432
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,712
Where's Carlita?

433
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,216
She's in the bad room.

434
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,009
The bad room?

435
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,555
Dirty.

436
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,515
Dirty.

437
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,600
Dirty.

438
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,894
Dirty.

439
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,062
Sister.

440
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,231
Sister, I need your help.

441
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,274
Uh...

442
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,155
Carlita, she's locked
in a room.

443
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,573
That's right.

444
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,659
She bit Sister Romano
just this morning,

445
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,954
so she had to go
to the bad room.

446
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,876
Sister,
why is there a bad room?

447
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,300
Because some girls are bad.

448
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,531
This room is suffocating.

449
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,702
It's not meant to be pleasant.

450
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,788
The things we do
aren't always pleasant,

451
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,082
but they are
in the name of God.

452
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,588
Do you wanna talk about

453
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,964
why they put you in that room?

454
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,343
Sono cattiva.

455
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,262
I'm bad.

456
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,389
Oh. You're bad.

457
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,101
Well, guess who else was bad.

458
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,771
Who?

459
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,941
You?

460
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,901
Mm-hmm.

461
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,819
Oh, yeah.

462
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,697
But you know what?

463
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,701
I realized that I'm not bad.

464
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,914
They just tell you
that you are

465
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,333
because you're not doing
what they want you to do.

466
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,755
Back then, I used to think
that there was something

467
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,548
really, really wrong with me.

468
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,677
What did you do?

469
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,185
Well, I guess at first,
I tried to run away.

470
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,896
But, uh,

471
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,732
it didn't fix the feeling.

472
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,112
That's what I like
about you, actually.

473
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,863
What?

474
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,535
What do you like about me?

475
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,415
I think that you feel
the same way that I felt.

476
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,627
But you're not scared,
you don't run away.

477
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,754
You just...

478
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,382
You raise your little claws,
and you fight.

479
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,307
Carlita, go to
your room, okay?

480
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,434
I'll be right there.

481
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,367
-Infermiera, la regga.
- -Si, dottore.

482
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,286
Forcipe, per favore.

483
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
Forcipe.

484
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,676
Stia ferma.

485
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,726
No!

486
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,311
Stia buona!

487
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,372
Everything looks all right.

488
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,918
You did say you didn't
eat much in the morning.

489
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,212
-Mm.
-May be low blood sugar.

490
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,380
I'm so sorry.

491
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,592
Sorry? Margaret, what for?

492
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,427
You wouldn't be
the first to faint

493
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,137
witnessing the birth
of a child.

494
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,723
Frankly, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

495
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,726
The miracle of life
can be a messy business.

496
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,030
You guys mind if I join?

497
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,582
Carlita, did you do
this drawing?

498
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,253
This part is mine.

499
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,344
Uh, I don't think

500
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,012
that that's very
appropriate, Sister.

501
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,710
You all right?

502
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,840
Yes?

503
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,059
Andiamo!

504
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,687
Um...

505
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,355
Here. Let's...
Let's go for a walk.

506
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,321
-Join the group.
-Oh, not today, girls.

507
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,614
-Come on!
-Okay.

508
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,785
Venite, venite!

509
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,495
No, no, no, not me.

510
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,123
It's all right. It's okay.

511
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,917
You ready?

512
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,930
It's all for you.

513
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,688
Oh, no.

514
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,231
No, no, no, don't. Don't!

515
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,774
Don't!

516
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,270
Psst. Psst, psst.

517
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,235
Margaret. Come in.

518
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,677
Something happened, didn't it?

519
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,556
Yes. Um...

520
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,184
One of the sisters
took her own life.

521
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,981
You mentioned
the name "Scianna."

522
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,566
That's right.

523
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,492
I assume you know
these people.

524
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,954
The priest is named Spiletto.

525
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,205
He's a radical.

526
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,415
Yes, I've seen him.

527
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,458
Turn it over.

528
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,674
The baby
in this photo is Carlita?

529
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,425
I believe so.

530
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,052
And this is why
she's in danger?

531
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,890
I know these sisters.

532
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,475
They're women of God.

533
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,018
They belong to the Church.

534
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,187
Listen to me, Margaret.

535
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,691
The truth is
there are two Churches.

536
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,776
The one that follows
the teachings of Christ,

537
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,069
the one that you and I
are part of.

538
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,238
And the other.

539
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,449
The Church
that will turn a blind eye

540
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,994
to torture, to rape.

541
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,787
To commit murder
in the name of God.

542
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,456
All in the name
of supreme power.

543
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,001
What do you think that Church
is most frightened of?

544
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,670
The Devil?

545
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,006
Secularism.

546
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,510
We are living
in unprecedented times.

547
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,805
Look at what's been occurring
in your very own generation.

548
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,391
A culture that is outspoken,
rebelling.

549
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,560
Sometimes violently.

550
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,980
People are turning away
from the church in droves.

551
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,774
And, Margaret,
you know as well as I do

552
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,028
that belief is power.

553
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,864
Now, how do you control people
who no longer believe

554
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,158
in your stories
of fire and brimstone?

555
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,077
People who do not
seem to fear?

556
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,498
You create something to fear.

557
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,503
This Church has maintained
power for generations.

558
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,213
Thousands of years.

559
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,591
And they will stop at nothing
to keep it that way.

560
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,010
So,

561
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,098
a small,
but very powerful group

562
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,558
of priests and bishops,

563
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,685
even higher,

564
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,022
they decided

565
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,066
something drastic
had to be done.

566
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,903
These priests...

567
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,238
...believe they can birth
the Antichrist

568
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,531
and then control him.

569
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,410
Allow him to bring
his dark forces

570
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,204
to bear on the world
just enough

571
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,122
to drive people
back to the Church.

572
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,041
That's insane.

573
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,001
Yes. Don't you see?

574
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,046
If no one believes
such a thing can exist,

575
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,090
who will stand in their way?

576
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,426
Uh...

577
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,179
What does any of this
have to do with Carlita?

578
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,223
I was excommunicated.

579
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,642
My contacts within the Church
are very limited.

580
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,228
That photo is all I have
to go on.

581
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:45,440
But I believe the baby girl
in the picture

582
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,901
is to be the mother.

583
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,653
The mother of what?

584
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,244
Of the Antichrist?

585
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,787
Yes.

586
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,541
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

587
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,293
Look, if I am right,
Carlita would have been born

588
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,754
on the sixth day
of the sixth month at 6 a.m.

589
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,006
666.

590
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,173
It's the mark of the Devil

591
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,842
which she will have
on her body.

592
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,261
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

593
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,929
They're keeping her files
at the orphanage.

594
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,514
Locked away.

595
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,683
I need you to get them to me.

596
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,145
I need to know
how she was born.

597
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,980
What do you mean,
how she was born?

598
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,273
Listen to me, Margaret.

599
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,025
There is a beast
they're mating.

600
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,610
A jackal. That's the father.

601
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,155
-I have to go now.
-No, no, Margaret.

602
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,574
If Carlita is, in fact,
the mother,

603
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,036
the evil inside her will do
whatever it takes to stop us.

604
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,413
We must destroy it
at all costs.

605
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,290
-Do you understand?
-No.

606
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,709
Carlita is a little girl.

607
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,127
And she is not pregnant.

608
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,880
But we're not talking
about a human child!

609
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,174
It's almost June 6th.

610
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,634
Look, we haven't a lot of time
and I need your help.

611
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,219
No, you need a doctor.

612
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,138
I'm sorry
that I can't help you.

613
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,515
Will you let go of my arm?

614
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,671
Oh. Margaret.

615
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,632
-Hi.
-How are you feeling?

616
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,259
Um, I need to talk to you
about Carlita.

617
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:42,057
Do you know anything
about her history,

618
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,477
or how she came
to the orphanage?

619
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,731
Um, not off the top
of my head. Why?

620
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,485
Do you know where I could find
that kind of information?

621
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,574
I'm afraid this is not really
my area, you know?

622
00:52:59,009 --> 00:52:59,968
What?

623
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,138
Why do you keep
staring at me?

624
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,640
I'm not.

625
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,817
Will you come with me?

626
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,778
Come on.

627
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,993
I need to talk to you
about something.

628
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,412
But before I do, I...

629
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,415
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

630
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,043
Okay.

631
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,878
Um...

632
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,884
Has anyone ever
done anything to you

633
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,679
that might have scared you

634
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,181
or upset you?

635
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,229
Uh...

636
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:53,897
I don't know.

637
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,900
What don't you know?

638
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,656
Sometimes I get this...

639
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,408
bad feelings.

640
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,704
I see...

641
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,374
I see things.

642
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:18,213
And I can't tell
if they're real or not.

643
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,675
Listen to me.

644
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,011
When I was younger,

645
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,639
I... I used to have these

646
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,393
horrible visions.

647
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,479
They were so terrible that I

648
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,065
convinced myself
that they were real.

649
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:42,821
But I learned
that those thoughts,

650
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,408
they were just lies.

651
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,286
Just tricks that my brain
was playing on me

652
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,538
because I was so unhappy.

653
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,790
This isn't a lie.

654
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,458
How can you know that
for certain?

655
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,297
Carlita.

656
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,798
I'm sorry.

657
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,429
Carlita.

658
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,228
Carlita. I'm sorry.

659
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,294
There you are.

660
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,837
A riot's broken out.

661
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,339
We must go.

662
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,174
Deve andare adesso!

663
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,635
Deve andare adesso!

664
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,061
Listen.
It's all right, girls.

665
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,687
It's okay.
Stay close to me, okay?

666
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,772
Oh.

667
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,534
Stay close to me, okay?

668
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,293
Carlita!

669
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,051
Carlita!

670
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,493
Silenzio.

671
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,997
Silenzio.

672
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,462
Silenzio, ragazze.

673
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,798
Padre nostro,
che sei nei cieli,

674
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:54,512
sia santificato
il tuo nome,

675
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,764
venga il tuo regno...

676
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,016
Margaretta.

677
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,691
Sister Silva would like
to see you in her office.

678
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,492
Please take a seat.

679
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,625
Margaret...

680
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,880
Part of my job here
is to look out

681
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,840
for the well-being
of all those

682
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,718
who are under my care.

683
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,263
I'm sure this will come
as no surprise,

684
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,849
but I've become concerned.

685
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,394
I'm fine.

686
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,984
Perhaps I should have
put it this way.

687
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,737
We are concerned.

688
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,449
Myself and Cardinal Lawrence.

689
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,704
We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

690
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,831
And perhaps
we postpone your vows.

691
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,292
What? No. Why?

692
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:10,046
We're also concerned about
your attachment to Carlita.

693
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,297
Carlita?

694
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,217
-But...
-Cardinal Lawrence told me

695
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,469
about your troubles
growing up.

696
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,763
Your hallucinations.

697
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:23,768
Perhaps being around Carlita
is not what's right for you.

698
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:28,731
Carlita is disturbed.

699
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,651
And her illness
must not infect us

700
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,528
as her caretakers.

701
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,698
And clearly, it has.

702
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:39,951
Wait.

703
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,623
I'm not ill.

704
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,835
I understand
how hard you had to work

705
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,878
to get to where you are.

706
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,673
It would be a shame
to give it all up now.

707
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,384
I am the only one
who cares about her.

708
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,635
You don't let her play

709
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,012
-with the other girls.
-I've told you...

710
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,430
-You keep her in the bad room.
-...we're only doing

711
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,598
what's right for her.

712
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,057
The girl is sick in the head.

713
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,935
Because of you!

714
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:16,654
If there was any doubt
in our decision,

715
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,573
you've all but confirmed it.

716
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,199
You're clearly unwell.

717
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,162
And, Margaret,

718
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,040
you will keep your distance
from Carlita.

719
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,044
Or there will be consequences.

720
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,266
Stop the car, Luca.

721
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,313
I can just walk home
from here, okay?

722
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,689
You don't have to wait.

723
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,275
Paolo.

724
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,735
Paolo!

725
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,654
Paolo!

726
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,241
No, no, no.

727
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,826
Lasciami stare,
ti pego, ti prego.

728
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,288
Paolo?

729
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,998
Just leave me alone, please.

730
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,166
Hey!

731
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,877
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

732
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,921
-Really, I didn't know.
-You didn't know what?

733
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,631
Just stop following me!

734
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,888
Paolo, talk to me.

735
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,685
Just look for the mark.

736
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,295
Oh, okay.

737
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,965
All right. Oh, God. Okay.

738
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:01,008
All right. Um...

739
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,094
Hey, call an...
call an ambulance.

740
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,804
Call an ambulance.

741
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,681
-Help me.
- -I'm gonna help you.

742
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,142
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

743
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,351
I'm gonna help you.

744
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,311
-I can't move.
-I know.

745
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,605
-I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
-I know. Okay.

746
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,108
-I'm scared.
-Paolo,

747
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,443
you're gonna be fine,
I promise.

748
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,694
I don't wanna die.

749
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,070
No, no, no.
You're not gonna die,

750
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,197
you're gonna be okay.

751
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,492
You ready?

752
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,090
Oh, no, no.

753
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,843
Oh, God.

754
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,179
Oh, God.

755
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,722
Oh, no, God.

756
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,529
Shh.

757
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:49,987
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

758
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,989
Amen.

759
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,572
Deus,

760
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,742
benedice hunc anulum.

761
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:41,455
Da ut soror
quae induat altam fidem

762
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:46,293
in te habeat et remaneat
tibi fidelis in omni tempore.

763
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,006
Accipe hunc anulum,

764
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:53,551
nam aeterno Regi spondes.

765
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,970
Serva fidem cum sponso tuo

766
01:06:56,012 --> 01:07:00,433
ut ad cenam nuptialem
aeternae gaudii venias.

767
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,810
Amen.

768
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,270
Amen.

769
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,351
Oh, god.

770
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,192
Come on.

771
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,154
Farfalla! Farfalla!

772
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:06,280
Oh, God.

773
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,330
Carlita.

774
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,831
Come with me, Carlita.

775
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,552
Okay, you go to the bed.

776
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,105
I am so sorry
that I didn't believe you.

777
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,315
But I believe you now.

778
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,900
Okay?

779
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,276
I'm gonna keep you safe.

780
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,444
I'm gonna get you out of here.

781
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,029
Margaret.

782
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,781
Go, go, go. Over there.

783
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:57,748
-Margaret.
-You stay away.

784
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,041
I know what you're doing.

785
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,043
We don't want to hurt you.
Just put that down.

786
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,004
I know what you've done
with the babies.

787
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,215
You stay away! No!

788
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,218
You stay away from me!

789
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,222
-Remain calm!
-No, no, no!

790
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,867
Please, please, I'm sorry.

791
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,370
No, no, no!

792
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,955
Not in there! Not in there!
Not in there!

793
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,999
No! No! No!

794
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,880
Let me out!

795
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,467
Please let me out!

796
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,552
Please!

797
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,285
Breathe. Breathe.

798
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,345
Crucifxus mortuu.

799
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,347
Sede da divinum.

800
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:19,515
...conviction:

801
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,850
I am wanted.
I have a task in history.

802
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,563
I am accepted.
It is good that I exist.

803
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,106
It is good
to be a human being.

804
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,570
Let every human heart
experience your love.

805
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,999
It's not real.

806
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,460
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

807
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,628
What's not real?

808
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,297
Who said that?

809
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:44,743
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

810
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,009
No!

811
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:03,261
Margaret. We have to go.

812
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:05,097
We have to go.
I found the files.

813
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,224
We have to go now.
It's just me.

814
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,433
It's just me.

815
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,229
Get me out of here.

816
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,898
Yes. I know. I know.

817
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,280
All right, all right.

818
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,282
Father Gabriel. Margaret.

819
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,124
I don't understand.

820
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:35,877
How?

821
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:40,215
Oh, well done, Margaret.
Well done.

822
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,843
Were you followed?

823
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,010
What? No.

824
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,345
I don't think so.

825
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,098
Luca, Margaret's driver,
brought us.

826
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,559
We can trust him.
He's keeping watch outside.

827
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,477
You two know each other?

828
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:53,812
-Yes.
-No.

829
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,648
Uh, he tried approaching me.

830
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,066
I thought he was crazy.

831
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,236
It is crazy.

832
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,364
Carlita.

833
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,490
We have to go get her.

834
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,742
No, it's not safe.

835
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:08,076
Not safe?

836
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,578
She's the one who's not safe
right now, Gabriel.

837
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,037
Margaret,
after what just happened,

838
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,498
they're not gonna let us
anywhere near that orphanage.

839
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,833
Especially Carlita.

840
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,043
He's right.
It's only a matter of time

841
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,045
before they realize
we've got these.

842
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,423
And when they do,
they will come for us.

843
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,591
We have to help her.

844
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,301
The only path forward

845
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,553
is to prove what they've done.

846
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,346
Otherwise, no one will believe
a word we say.

847
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,273
There's so many of them.

848
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,316
Yes.

849
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,109
Too many.

850
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:45,280
I had no idea
they'd gone to such lengths.

851
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:53,205
I don't understand.

852
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,207
They need a male.

853
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,169
They've only birthed females.

854
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,254
They've all died
except for Carlita.

855
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,757
After all these years,
so many failures...

856
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,094
They believe the only way

857
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,680
is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

858
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,244
What is this?

859
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,329
I told you, it's the photo
from Carlita's birth.

860
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,372
No.

861
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,123
This.

862
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:44,464
It's the mark.

863
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,508
Carlita doesn't have the mark
on her head.

864
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,262
Hers is here.

865
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:51,888
What are you talking about?

866
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,931
I've seen it.

867
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,602
You see? Carlita.

868
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,229
No mark.

869
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,481
The baby in this photo
is not Carlita.

870
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,988
What does that mean?

871
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,074
Brennan?

872
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,701
I don't know.

873
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,414
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for,

874
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,623
then all we have to do

875
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,584
is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

876
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,043
We must have
missed something.

877
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:23,253
Right?

878
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,028
Where is it?

879
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,447
Why do they all
look like this?

880
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:53,199
The father.
He's not human.

881
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:28,902
It's her.

882
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:34,658
There was another survivor.

883
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,328
A sister?

884
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:40,664
Did you know about this?

885
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:41,915
No.

886
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,291
They must have kept it
hidden away.

887
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:15,532
Look for the mark.

888
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,619
How did he know?

889
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,999
He knew where it was.

890
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,282
Margaret, Margaret. Hush.

891
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,576
Margaret. Margaret.

892
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,328
Margaret.

893
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,704
Just let me have a look.

894
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:51,664
Let me look.

895
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:02,550
Uh...

896
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,985
Somebody say something.

897
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,365
How is that possible?

898
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,574
She's been
a ward of the Church

899
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:27,617
her entire life.

900
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:29,911
They must have
moved her around

901
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:30,954
to cover their tracks.

902
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,331
Carlita must be too young,

903
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,251
so they brought Margaret back
to Rome to...

904
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:37,293
To what?

905
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:41,172
To what?

906
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,138
I have to get out of here.

907
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,765
-You can't leave.
-Don't touch me.

908
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,849
-Margaret...
-Don't you touch me!

909
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:52,976
...you can't just leave.

910
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:55,436
Touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you!

911
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:08,533
I'm so sorry.

912
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:14,914
I'm so sorry this is happening
to you, my child.

913
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,333
But nothing will change
if you decide to leave.

914
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,546
It's June 6th.

915
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:22,714
Midnight.

916
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,215
They will be coming for you.

917
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:31,055
If this is true...

918
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:36,352
If I am pregnant...

919
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,648
then I need it out of me.

920
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,777
I need it out of me now.

921
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:55,371
Margaret,

922
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:57,832
you all right?

923
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,209
This doctor knows
what he's doing?

924
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,962
He's experienced, yes.

925
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,408
Wait. Stop.
What are you doing?

926
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,868
Don't stop.

927
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,953
Make like you're heading
for the main road

928
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,372
and then turn off
before the arch.

929
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,135
Margaret.

930
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,892
What's happening to me?

931
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,908
Hello?

932
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:44,910
hello?

933
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,581
Can anyone hear me?

934
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,999
Yes.

935
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,709
I can hear.

936
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:59,342
I can't tell
if this is real or not.

937
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:03,346
This is very real, Margaret.

938
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,057
Can you untie me?

939
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,101
Soon.

940
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,771
Soon it will be all over,
I promise.

941
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,193
No.

942
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,528
-No, no.
-Oh. Oh...

943
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,447
You don't have to be afraid.

944
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,368
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

945
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,456
I've watched over you

946
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,084
since you were a little girl.

947
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,130
The very first moment we met,

948
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:39,590
do you remember
what I said to you?

949
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,385
That you, Margaret,

950
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:45,388
were the bravest girl
I'd ever known.

951
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,975
Now you know how special
you are to me.

952
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,060
To us.

953
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:58,025
The baby you're about to bear
will redeem the Church.

954
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:01,278
Will bring the people
back to God.

955
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,865
All because of you.

956
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:06,867
Don't you understand,
Margaret?

957
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:10,621
Your whole life,
you've been searching,

958
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,665
waiting for His voice.

959
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,877
But the truth is...

960
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:22,550
He was always there with you.

961
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:29,014
He brought you here.

962
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,018
He chose you.

963
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,773
I... No.

964
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,208
There.

965
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,335
You're ready now.

966
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:01,547
Please know that I love you.

967
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,552
I'll be right here.

968
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,250
Stay down.

969
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:48,112
No, no.

970
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,447
No, no. Please.

971
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:04,003
Please, please, please.

972
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:05,754
No.

973
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:09,091
No, no, no.

974
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:11,468
No, please.

975
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:16,515
Please.

976
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:17,683
Please.

977
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,550
Help me, please.

978
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,887
Please help me. Please.

979
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,305
Please untie me.

980
01:38:57,556 --> 01:38:59,642
Please untie me, I'm in pain.

981
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,439
I'm in pain. Please.

982
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:09,818
Help.

983
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:12,363
Help me, please.

984
01:39:12,404 --> 01:39:14,323
Please help me.

985
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:16,575
Help me.

986
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,662
Help. I'm in pain.

987
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,976
What is it? A boy or girl?

988
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,202
And the other?

989
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,622
A boy!

990
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:50,669
We have him.

991
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,560
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

992
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:55,275
Help.

993
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:57,778
-Help. Help.
-Of course.

994
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,029
Of course, my dear.

995
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,864
-I'm in pain.
-Of course.

996
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:07,454
Can I hold him?

997
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,252
You're sure?

998
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:18,340
I'm his mother.
I'm his mother.

999
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:21,635
Bring him here.

1000
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:26,223
She's right.

1001
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:31,061
It is important for a child
to bond with its mother.

1002
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:39,862
We all need the comfort
of our mothers

1003
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:41,029
in the beginning.

1004
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:42,990
Don't we?

1005
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:50,164
You did so well, my child.

1006
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,965
You are doing
God's work.

1007
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,718
He would be so proud of you.

1008
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:05,095
Can't you hear Him
telling you?

1009
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,306
Don't you hear His voice?

1010
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,478
No.

1011
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:18,901
No, I only hear my own.

1012
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:24,156
No!

1013
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,143
Margaret.

1014
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:56,230
Stop this.

1015
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,108
Margaret,

1016
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:02,486
give me the baby.

1017
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,948
Just give me the baby.

1018
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,126
No!

1019
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,193
Burn everything.

1020
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:44,903
Leave them both to die.

1021
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:12,741
It's okay.

1022
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:05,228
The man
you are looking for.

1023
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,314
The US Ambassador to Rome.

1024
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:09,983
He will be the new father.

1025
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:15,155
He and his wife will suffer
a tragic loss,

1026
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:16,948
and be in need of a child.

1027
01:48:20,702 --> 01:48:23,246
The boy will inherit
their privilege

1028
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:24,372
and power.

1029
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:29,961
Soon, his darkness will spread

1030
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:34,090
and the world shall be saved.

1031
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:12,671
Baby, you're supposed
to eat them.

1032
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,589
You're supposed to
eat them like...

1033
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:15,632
Like that.

1034
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:20,387
What are you doing?

1035
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:23,557
Come here.

1036
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:29,688
No, no, no. Here.

1037
01:49:30,772 --> 01:49:31,815
This.

1038
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:33,066
No, not this.

1039
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:34,401
You want one?

1040
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:36,861
You want it?

1041
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:39,823
Give it to Mama.
Give it to Mama.

1042
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:40,865
Give it to Mama.

1043
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:04,431
I'm so sorry,
Margaret.

1044
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,019
I tried just to leave you be.

1045
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,232
You need to go.

1046
01:50:15,066 --> 01:50:17,485
Now.

1047
01:50:18,486 --> 01:50:19,863
I came to warn you.

1048
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:22,699
They know you're alive.

1049
01:50:23,825 --> 01:50:25,285
You weren't supposed
to survive.

1050
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:26,786
None of you were.

1051
01:50:26,828 --> 01:50:28,288
Especially the girl.

1052
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,001
She'll be important,
Margaret.

1053
01:50:35,795 --> 01:50:37,380
I just want to be left alone.

1054
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:40,216
I know.

1055
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:43,887
But they will come for you.

1056
01:51:01,988 --> 01:51:03,615
They've even
given it a name.

1057
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:06,910
Your son.

1058
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:10,413
Damien.
