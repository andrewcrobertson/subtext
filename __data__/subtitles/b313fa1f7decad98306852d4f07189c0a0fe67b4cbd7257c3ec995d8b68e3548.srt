1
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:39,680
Beautiful.

2
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,487
Focus more on the arm whip
than wrist snap, okay?

3
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,424
It'll give you more velocity.

4
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,119
I had a long talk
with Mom this morning.

5
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,432
She said your bad dreams
are getting worse.

6
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,037
She also said

7
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:58,701
there was something
you needed to tell me.

8
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:02,338
Remember... Remember that day

9
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:05,210
you let me ride my bike
to practice?

10
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,174
You rode through
the storm drain, didn't you?

11
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:08,579
By the old mine.

12
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:10,482
Why? Did something happen?

13
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,284
No. Nothing happened, Dad.

14
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,586
I just freaked myself out a bit.
That's all.

15
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,661
Is that why you started carrying
around Bunny Bear again?

16
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,527
Before you say no,

17
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,234
Mom thinks
one way of tackling this

18
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,301
is for you to let go
of some of the things

19
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,373
you needed
when you were little.

20
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,472
I agree.

21
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,780
But we also agree
that when that happens,

22
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,150
it's entirely up to you.

23
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,660
Let me toss the gear
in the shed,

24
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,873
and then we can
go grab some pizza.

25
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,232
Dad?

26
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:38,769
Dad?

27
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,375
Dad, are you in there?

28
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,610
Dad?

29
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,635
Dad?

30
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,201
Dad, what's happening?

31
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,736
Dad!

32
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,204
Run!

33
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,707
No!

34
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,651
<i>♪ Deep in the green wood

39
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:59,307
Five more minutes. Okay, dude?

40
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,370
I thought we said
no more <i>Bunny Hop.</i>

41
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,439
It's better than
<i>Little Baby Bum.</i>

42
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,047
Hey.

43
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,981
Hey, babe. You look awful.

44
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,915
You look like a waffle.

45
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,086
Yeah, well,
I didn't sleep for shit.

46
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,388
I thought you said you were
gonna stop working so late.

47
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,425
It wasn't that.

48
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,028
There were deer or something

49
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,632
- in the backyard again.
- Hmm.

50
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,436
What time is it?

51
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,439
10:17.

52
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,400
Why?

53
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,873
Oh, I don't know.

54
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,070
My sister?

55
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,344
Liam and the girls?

56
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,612
11:00 a.m. brunch?

57
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:41,577
Family brunch.

58
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,914
Okay. I am going to shower.

59
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,851
Come on.

60
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,589
You're a zombie.
You're a zombie.

61
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,239
I'm gonna... Come.
I'll get you!

62
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,900
You're gonna
give him nightmares.

63
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,561
You're a zombie!
Please, he loves it.

64
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't you, <i>ti cheri?</i>

65
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,967
Yes, let Auntie eat you!

66
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,966
Was there a blackout
last night?

67
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,267
Uh, no,
not that I know of. Why?

68
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,006
Clocks are all out of whack,
and the fridge is defrosted.

69
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,046
Oh!

70
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, wow.

71
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,215
Yeah, the place
looks amazing, Karina.

72
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,315
Thank you, Arlene.

73
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,251
Yeah, it's getting there.

74
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:21,251
Yeah, it's great.

75
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,823
It's so not getting there.

76
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,753
Mmm.

77
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,563
It was probably just a possum.

78
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,193
I caught one under my grill
the other night.

79
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,728
Almost shat myself.

80
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,131
It sounded like
a person to me.

81
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,788
Then it was kids
drinking forties

82
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,073
in the woods like
we used to do.

83
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,973
It sounded like one person.

84
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,836
Got a gun in the house?

85
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,415
Are you nuts?

86
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,346
All Dad ever needed
was his Henry Aaron.

87
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,522
Different era, my friend.

88
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,259
Hey, check this out.

89
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,667
Finally got the mechanics
working perfect.

90
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:17,478
My loan agent might be willing
to give me an extension.

91
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,011
But only if I cut
production costs by half.

92
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,247
I, uh...

93
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:29,183
You know, I thought we agreed
you were gonna let that go.

94
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:31,021
That you were gonna
get those loans paid off.

95
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,836
Whatever you say, boss.

96
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,607
<i>So how's Pat doing with
the move back to New Jersey?</i>

97
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,207
Stressed.

98
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,907
- Mmm.
- Barely sleeping.

99
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:50,706
It killed him
to come back here

100
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:51,940
and take the job with Liam,

101
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,312
but the reality
is he couldn't find anyone

102
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,043
to fund his designs.

103
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,484
Our medical benefits
are about to expire.

104
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,150
If his mom
hadn't moved to Arizona,

105
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,686
we would be
at the YMCA right now.

106
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,222
Ahh!

107
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,020
Hey, honey.

108
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:07,761
Please, please don't play
Fute so loud. Okay?

109
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:45,925
Screw this.

110
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,171
Hey, listen.

111
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,375
It's fine with me if you guys
are partying out here.

112
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,491
But don't blame me
if I bash someone's face in

113
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:18,811
'cause you don't
wanna get caught.

114
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:34,603
Shit.

115
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,407
Oh, my God.

116
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,483
Listen, Patty.

117
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,549
I know you're still down
about how things played out,

118
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,023
but you should be proud that
you had the balls to go for it.

119
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,256
Be careful what you wish for.

120
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,128
Remember when I took over
the yard after Dad died?

121
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,183
Had nightmares
every goddamn night

122
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,093
about them
repossessing our car

123
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,004
or foreclosing on the house.

124
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,041
Those are my good dreams,
Liam.

125
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:49,314
Ever since we moved back home,

126
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,915
I've been having these white-knucklers
about Jake getting snatched.

127
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,148
We're in the backyard.

128
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,219
Or maybe it's a park
or a playground.

129
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,290
I just get this bad feeling,
you know?

130
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,326
You know
who I blame for that shit?

131
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:13,809
Yeah, I could really
use him right now.

132
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:15,771
Yeah.

133
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,307
You and me both, brother.

134
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,312
Meet me over
at the kiln in 20.

135
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,218
Yeah.

136
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,026
<i>Can you please stop
doing that for three seconds?</i>

137
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:36,291
This is Irish Walnut.

138
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,930
If I leave it for too long,
it'll get chalky.

139
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,499
I don't care
if it's Scottish scrotum.

140
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,981
We're on a mission here.

141
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,382
Dad always says
to never come down here.

142
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,302
"Dad always said
never to come down here."

143
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,505
You're just scared of what
might be inside there.

144
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,845
Liam, have you ever thought...

145
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,345
What if the things
they say are true?

146
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,982
Don't be a moron.

147
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,350
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

148
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,355
Bingo!

149
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,901
Okay, we saw it.
Can we go home now?

150
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:15,217
I dare you to go over there.

151
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:17,936
I double dare you.

152
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,697
Or I'll tell everybody
what a pussy you were.

153
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,135
I triple dare you to do it.

154
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,435
I already did it,
like, 10 times.

155
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,739
Then you shouldn't
be afraid to do it again.

156
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,739
Should you?

157
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,062
I wanna go home.

158
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,998
Yeah.

159
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,132
Yeah, me too.

160
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:48,798
Holy crap.

161
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:53,370
- That's a wild plum tree.
- Who cares?

162
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,770
Grandpa said it's the softest wood
in the entire world.

163
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,770
Patty.

164
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,114
Pat.

165
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,117
Pat!

166
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,579
Get away from there, Patty.

167
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,116
Help me
pull this tree down first.

168
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,517
No frickin' way.

169
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,990
I'm not leaving
until I get a piece!

170
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,353
If you don't let go right now,

171
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,124
I'm totally telling Dad
we came here.

172
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,744
- Dude. You're the pussy.
- Screw you.

173
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,365
I'm leaving
if you don't get away...

174
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,351
Sweet.

175
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:25,679
You're too close.

176
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,008
Seriously, Patty.

177
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,452
Almost got it.

178
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,886
- Are you holding on?
- Yes, I am.

179
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,452
Okay, good.

180
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,527
How many more times
you wanna do it?

181
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:22,662
One thousand.

182
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,490
- I gotta stop, okay?
- Again.

183
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,534
No. I know you want
to go again, baby,

184
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:27,534
but I have to work, okay?

185
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,129
Stop.

186
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,838
All right. I know.

187
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,602
Come on, then.
Let's go over here.

188
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,805
So maybe we can go when Daddy
gets back from work, okay?

189
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:36,805
Okay.

190
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,519
Jakie.

191
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,361
Jakie, stop.

192
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,110
I said stop!

193
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,369
I'm sorry.

194
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,335
Mommy just needs
some quiet for a bit. Okay?

195
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,575
Can you do that for me, please?

196
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:12,245
Okay.

197
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,313
Thank you.

198
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,116
Jake?

199
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:51,948
Jake?

200
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,583
Jakie, where are you?

201
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:56,787
Jake?

202
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,096
Jakie?

203
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:04,027
If you don't come out
in three seconds,

204
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:05,430
no dessert tonight, okay?

205
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,999
Jakie?

206
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:13,504
Jakie?

207
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,071
Jakie!

208
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,138
Jake?

209
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,147
Jakie! Where are you?

210
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,129
I'll take the one.
That's the one.

211
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,631
Jakie! Come to Mommy, okay?

212
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,191
Hello. We're here.

213
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:08,328
Ooh! Look at this!

214
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,396
Jakie! Come out!

215
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:15,401
Jakie!

216
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,802
Jakie!

217
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,707
Jakie?

218
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:24,055
Jakie? Jakie!

219
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,873
Jakie! Jakie!

220
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,239
Jake.

221
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,809
Oh, my God.

222
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,477
Don't you ever run away
from me like that again, okay?

223
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:32,948
Let's go home. Okay, baby?

224
00:19:32,949 --> 00:19:34,214
Okay?

225
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,005
Let's go home, baby, okay?

226
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:46,597
We go home.

227
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,628
Hey, buddy.

228
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:24,052
How's your day been?

229
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,274
- Good, good.
- "Good, good," good?

230
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:32,676
Okay. All right.

231
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,997
- That's enough Fute now, okay?
- Slow down, buddy.

232
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,002
Jakie!

233
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,751
Oh, poor Daddy.

234
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,078
Oh, my God.

235
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,495
Put him down.

236
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:57,998
<i>♪ Ding, ding, dong ♪</i>

237
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,712
<i>Wanna watch that show</i>

238
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,347
<i>your sister
was telling us about?</i>

239
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:15,653
It's too heavy.

240
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,787
Anything on the queue?

241
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,554
Mm-hmm.

242
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:22,462
250 movies
we'll never actually watch.

243
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,472
What's wrong?

244
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,684
I almost lost him today.

245
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,990
Lost him how?

246
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,688
I... I was trying to work,

247
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,260
and he was just playing
the stupid recorder

248
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,762
and I just lost it. I snapped.

249
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,149
I took my eye off him
for one second,

250
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,964
and he wandered
into the woods...

251
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,836
and I... I panicked, and all
I could think about was...

252
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:17,886
Are we gonna be okay?

253
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,374
Again.

254
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:28,345
Again, again.

255
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,348
Hey, who you
talking to, buddy?

256
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,654
Dolly.

257
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:36,689
To Dolly?

258
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:38,223
Dolly.

259
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:42,057
Dolly.

260
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:53,552
Is there a moth in here?

261
00:24:53,553 --> 00:24:55,536
Mmm-mmm. Just Dolly.

262
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,007
Come on. Lie down, kiddo.

263
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:00,213
Let's get you tucked in.

264
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,014
Where did you go?
Where'd you go?

265
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:11,721
Okay, buddy, go into the light.

266
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,792
There's peace and tranquility
in the light.

267
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,191
All are welcome.

268
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:20,561
All are welcome.

269
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,608
All are not welcome.

270
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:47,952
Pat?

271
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:52,487
Pat?

272
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,257
I'm here.

273
00:26:58,761 --> 00:26:59,964
What are you doing?

274
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,193
I think there's somebody
out there.

275
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:06,135
Oh. What?

276
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:11,112
Don't bother.

277
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,141
The power's out again.

278
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:14,847
Just come here and listen.

279
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,080
You're freaking me out, Pat.

280
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:18,818
Just...

281
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:22,683
Just listen.

282
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,886
What am I listening for?

283
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:27,089
This weird zipping sound.

284
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,664
I couldn't, for the life of me,
place it until just now.

285
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,596
Like a rucksack or duffel bag.

286
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,531
Somebody's opening
and closing it

287
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:35,901
just to mess with my head.

288
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,936
Come on, Pat. Seriously?

289
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,807
As soon as I figure out
where this asshole is hiding,

290
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,374
I'm gonna kick his goddamn...

291
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,491
Oh, shit, Jake.

292
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,041
Hello. Hi. Yeah.

293
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,148
Yeah, someone's breaking
into our house.

294
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:50,109
Jake?

295
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,617
Yeah,
it's 109 Walter Ave.

296
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:52,948
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Daddy's here, all right?

297
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:54,468
- Yes. Yeah, please hurry.
- I got you.

298
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,915
Thank you. Please.

299
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:02,125
Go ahead, take him.

300
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,090
Where're you going?

301
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,728
- I'm going downstairs.
- Pat, no.

302
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,300
Just stay inside, okay?

303
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:10,300
Close the door.

304
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:17,772
You wanna
mess with me, man?

305
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:19,939
Yeah, I'm right here.

306
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,606
I'm right here!

307
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:50,963
Pat.

308
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:52,601
I said stay upstairs!

309
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:55,993
What the hell is going on?

310
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,577
Are you okay?

311
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,014
Are you okay, babe?

312
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,346
Come on. Go for it.

313
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,560
Hey.

314
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,125
Hey.

315
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,933
I'd say welcome home, Pat,

316
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:25,466
but somebody obviously
beat me to the punch.

317
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,389
- You must be Karina. Hey.
- Hi.

318
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,874
As far as the perp
gettin' inside...

319
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,340
there's not a lot to go on.

320
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:37,011
Well, I know for a fact
the doors were locked.

321
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:38,479
You guys have a hide-a-key?

322
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:40,484
Oh, yeah.

323
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,581
Yes. Yeah, we do.

324
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,857
Right here.

325
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:52,497
Ah. Okay.

326
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:54,559
Most likely scenario is,

327
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,967
somebody saw the length
of the grass in your yard,

328
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:59,667
thought you might be
outta town

329
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,239
and decided to make
an impulse buy.

330
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,810
So, why didn't
they steal anything?

331
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:06,451
You're positive
nothing's missing?

332
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:09,916
Yeah, not as far
as we can tell.

333
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,401
Do me a favor.
Go through the house again.

334
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:14,886
Make a list of anything
that's not where it should be.

335
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:16,919
No matter
how small or insignificant.

336
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,353
Yeah. I'll start
in the kitchen.

337
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:21,594
Yeah, it felt more like
he was trying to scare us.

338
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:23,392
Yeah, he did a good job too.

339
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,528
Hey, Chief, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

340
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:29,996
Pat...

341
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,334
Can you come upstairs?

342
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,670
Sure.

343
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,626
A lot of these break-ins
where it looks like

344
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:40,903
there was an ulterior motive
to robbery,

345
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,181
turns out somebody
is sendin' a message.

346
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,953
You sure
you didn't know this guy?

347
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,514
Well, I mean,
I never got a look at him.

348
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:56,326
You let me know
if you remember anything else.

349
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:58,364
Okay?

350
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,099
Okay.

351
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,770
What do we got, Rawls?

352
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,570
Well,
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

353
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:07,370
Don't suppose
you made these?

354
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:10,975
Yeah.

355
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:13,673
Uh, yeah,
all the time when I was a kid.

356
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:16,944
There're boxes of 'em
in the garage.

357
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,479
You know, it seems to me like someone was
squatting here like this, and, you know,

358
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,920
tossing them. Like so.

359
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,320
Maybe drawin'
your son's attention?

360
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,058
Look...

361
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,123
Tell 'em I sent you.

362
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:29,091
They'll rig your whole house
for a song.

363
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:32,131
And mow your lawn,
for chrissake.

364
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:57,689
Jakie.

365
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:27,450
Holy shit.

366
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,355
Daddy, look at this.

367
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:36,524
Very cool, buddy.

368
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:39,443
Hey, so, pile on the right
goes back on the shelves.

369
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:42,362
Everything on the left,
we can bag and toss outside.

370
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:43,856
This asshole
really did rob us,

371
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,351
he needs a new line of work.

372
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,550
Where the hell
did you find this?

373
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,672
Uh, I've never seen that
before in my life.

374
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,711
So, what's it doing in
the bottom of the wastebasket

375
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:55,711
in my office?

376
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,483
No idea.

377
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,051
It's, uh...

378
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,732
It's one of the first things
I ever carved.

379
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:05,824
Lost it years ago.

380
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:10,625
Speaking of things
carved out of wood...

381
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,733
Can you...

382
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,136
ditch this for me somewhere?

383
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:18,201
What for?

384
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:19,964
It's literally
his favorite thing in the world.

385
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,936
Yeah, and you need to find him
a new favorite thing, my love.

386
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,538
A quieter thing,

387
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,373
'cause if he blows this shit
in my ear one more time,

388
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,413
you are never
getting laid again.

389
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:28,548
Okay.

390
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,508
I'll hide it out here

391
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,448
until he drives you nuts
asking for it.

392
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,511
Thank you.

393
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,485
Uh, garbage goes
out front tonight.

394
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:46,861
<i>The score is now
two-zero in favor of Texas.</i>

395
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:48,032
Fute.

396
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,935
<i>- Anderson is trying...</i>
- Later, Jakie.

397
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,899
- You can play Fute later.
- Fute.

398
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,470
Fute.

399
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,906
Fute!

400
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,737
Okay. Okay, fine, I'll get it.

401
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:00,840
But you better play quietly,
or Mommy'll kill me.

402
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:03,783
Hey, what do you say
when I say,

403
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:04,903
"if you're okay in the tub?"

404
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:06,852
Fute.

405
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:08,850
No, no. What do you say?

406
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,049
"Okay."

407
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,885
Okay. All right.

408
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:14,388
Mommy and Auntie Anna are across
the hall if you need 'em.

409
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:16,122
I'm going downstairs
for a sec.

410
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,857
Okay.

411
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,229
Sis, I'm, like, juggling
four different campaigns.

412
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,232
You know, you promised me rose

413
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,998
- and <i>Real Housewives.</i>
- Are you okay?

414
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay!

415
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,810
Is that Dolly?

416
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,112
You okay up there?

417
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,418
Okay!

418
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,022
Huh.

419
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,659
Dolly!

420
00:35:57,837 --> 00:35:59,564
You okay, Jake?

421
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:05,743
Jake?

422
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:09,681
Jake?

423
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,151
What are you
supposed to say, Jake?

424
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,359
Daddy asked you
a question, Jakie.

425
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,359
Okay.

426
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,994
Did you
turn the lights off?

427
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:27,097
Nope.

428
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:28,378
Who are you playing with?

429
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh. There he is.

430
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,401
Dolly.

431
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,801
Where'd I put it?

432
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:36,202
Who are you
playing with?

433
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,541
Dolly.

434
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,797
The hell are you?

435
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,224
Have you been able to
stop thinking about what happened?

436
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,010
No.

437
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,747
Have you?

438
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:21,082
No.

439
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:01,394

440

441
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,047
Need to ask you a question.

442
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,265
Harvey says he spotted you

443
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:10,769
playing by the old
service steps.

444
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,297
Yeah, because...

445
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:14,978
I was just looking for softer wood
to carve than all this stupid oak.

446
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,712
All right.
Let's you and me take a walk.

447
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:24,816
Come on.

448
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:41,884
You gotta be shitting me.

449
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:57,380
<i>Your Promethian</i>

450
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,078

456

Karina!

457
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,110
Karina, wake up!

458
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,743
Pat!

459
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,345
Pat! What's going on?

460
00:43:26,346 --> 00:43:27,947
Did you see him?

461
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:29,388
- Did you see him?
- See who?

462
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,116
What?

463
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,920
- Just go back inside, okay?
- No, but what...

464
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:34,426
Just go back inside.
Lock the door.

465
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:36,027
- Pat, what... No! Pat!
- Just stay here.

466
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:40,997
Where are you?

467
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,164
Are you in here?

468
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:45,870
Where are you?

469
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:51,373
Come on.

00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,648

- Yeah.

473
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:03,951
And nobody's here.

474
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:05,752
I swear I saw something...

475
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,542
Alarm.

476
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:08,827
One sec.

477
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:12,991
No fingerprints

478
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:14,796
or any of the doors
or windows,

479
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:16,596
and none of the molds
in the backyard

480
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:18,869
came up a match.

481
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,070
Power company did confirm
13 separate interruptions,

482
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:25,673
but insist the problem
is not on their end.

483
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:26,746
Meaning what?

484
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:32,485
You haven't had a new face
show up, have you?

485
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,386
Different guy
checkin' the gas meter,

486
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:37,082
- or fixin' a cable?
- No.

487
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,692
And nothing missing
from the house?

488
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,931
Uh, Jake has this...

489
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:50,831
musical instrument, um...

490
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:53,135
a recorder
that he loves to play,

491
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:58,074
which I might have
thrown out by mistake.

492
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,679
But even if I did,
it would still be

493
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,442
in one of the garbage cans,
which it's not.

494
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,286
And I...

495
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:15,058
I could have sworn
I heard it being played.

496
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:17,929
You know, last night.

497
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,018
Hey.

498
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,826
Thought I said,
"Take some time off."

499
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,094
I need to show you something.

500
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,937
So, what?

501
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,971
There's a thousand more
like it back at the house.

502
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,273
That's the only owl
I ever made.

503
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:10,278
Do you remember
where I lost it?

504
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,824
Don't tell me
you went back there?

505
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,287
No.

506
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:25,293
I found it in a trash bin
at home yesterday.

507
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,133
How is that possible?

508
00:46:28,134 --> 00:46:29,231
It's not.

509
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,004
Look what else
I found in Mom's garage.

510
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,250
What are you saying, Patty?

511
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,825
You explain it. I...

512
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:55,994
Mom always had a knack
for finding lost stuff.

513
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:57,831
You know she did.

514
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:00,459
Keep digging
through that house

515
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,902
and I guarantee you'll find
all kinds'a crazy shit.

516
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,403
Maybe, in the meantime,

517
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,972
I think you should
give that shrink a call.

518
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:15,343
What was her name?

519
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:18,349
Mary?

520
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:21,119
Barbara.

521
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,317
Yeah, something's been bubbling up
in you for a long time now,

522
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:26,354
and she always seemed to help
back in the day.

523
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:51,379
Yeah, let your
brother have a go, all right?

524
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:53,953
Not too high.

525
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:56,555
Are you serious?

526
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:01,759
Gotta go.

527
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,127
Push it back.
Push it back.

528
00:48:04,563 --> 00:48:05,563
Push it back.

529
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:11,603
- Present.
- Jeez.

530
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:13,401
- Jakie, you scared me.
- Present.

531
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:15,219
It's from Dolly.

532
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,538
What is this?

533
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,510
It's a present.

534
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:20,642
Okay?

535
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:22,344
Okay.

536
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:39,861
What the hell?

537
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:55,942
Shit. Jakie.

538
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:57,016
Jakie, come out of there!

539
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Jakie!

540
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:03,950
Jakie.

541
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:08,390
Get away from him!

542
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:10,427
Get the hell away from my son!

543
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:11,459
Jakie!

544
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,230
Jakie!

545
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:17,147
Jakie. Come here.

546
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:18,631
Come here. Jakie.

547
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:20,737
Jakie!

548
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:55,821
What's happening
to you both is very normal.

549
00:49:55,822 --> 00:50:00,307
To have your home invaded
is a traumatic experience,

550
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:03,646
one that brings up
all kinds of issues.

551
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,646
Such as?

552
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:06,645
Such as,

553
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,221
"How will I ever let my son
out of my sight again?"

554
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,484
Or...

555
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:15,688
"Did I fulfill my obligation
as a husband

556
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:20,061
"and a father, and a man,

557
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:21,694
"to protect
my wife and child?"

558
00:50:23,198 --> 00:50:25,970
Karina, Pat's description.

559
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:28,507
It's quite evocative
of a persistent phobia

560
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:31,044
your husband
struggled with as a child.

561
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:34,175
Which, of course,

562
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:37,479
is how Pat and I
came to know each other.

563
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,138
What phobia was that?

564
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,555
<i>Patrick.</i>

565
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:46,789
<i>Patrick.</i>

566
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:49,557
<i>Let's you and me take a walk.</i>

567
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,661
Come on.

568
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:56,669
You know, long before
we built this yard,

569
00:50:57,737 --> 00:50:59,431
this whole forest

570
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,404
was basically
one big copper mine.

571
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,691
Kicked out half the product
for the entire state,

572
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,741
before they finally
dug the sucker dry.

573
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,718
This was how you got down
to the main entry shaft...

574
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:17,321
...back when it was owned
by the mining company.

575
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:19,652
Who owns it now?

576
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:21,823
Us?

577
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:31,368
Now it belongs to Bagman.

578
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:36,736
- Who's Bagman?
- Shh!

579
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:42,607
You never know
who might be listenin'.

580
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,611
I told your brother this story
last summer,

581
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:47,052
just like your granddad did me
when I was your age

582
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,151
and his granddad's
granddad before that.

583
00:51:49,152 --> 00:51:51,454
And all of them
swore it was true.

584
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,622
Just like
I'm swearing to you now.

585
00:51:56,564 --> 00:51:57,625
They say...

586
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,562
he wanders
the world each night,

587
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:02,427
searching for children

588
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:04,632
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

589
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,737
- Not just any children...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:09,574
Let me guess.

591
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,677
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen to their parents or...

592
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:13,575
Wrong, Patty.

593
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:16,314
It's the good kids he wants.

594
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,647
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

595
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:23,585
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

596
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,806
he won't rest
until he has them

597
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:29,093
slung over his bony shoulder.

598
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:31,494
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

599
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:37,684
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

600
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:39,002
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

601
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:40,236
<i>And scared you better be!</i>

602
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,501
<i>Wander too close,
he'll drag you in</i>

603
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:43,271
<i>and make pencils
out of your fingers,</i>

604
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:44,705
and gobble
the rest of you down!

605
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,676
Are you with me, boy?

606
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,520
<i>Good.</i>

607
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:55,188
Bagman?

608
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,710
You drew these?

609
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:26,783
Yep.

610
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,768
That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

611
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,632
Pat's was so intense,

612
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:46,201
I felt it was crucial
to give him

613
00:53:46,202 --> 00:53:48,601
as much context as possible

614
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,969
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

615
00:53:57,251 --> 00:54:01,287
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

616
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:05,324
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

617
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:09,227
Curiously, his methodology,

618
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:11,759
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

619
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,093
are remarkably consistent.

620
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:17,694
He has the power to paralyze

621
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:20,467
and incapacitate
parents and adults

622
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:23,240
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

623
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:26,439
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

624
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,744
It sustains him, nourishes him.

625
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:34,946
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

626
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,421
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

627
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:41,789
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

628
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:44,256
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

629
00:54:44,257 --> 00:54:45,758
On the contrary.

630
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,179
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

631
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,600
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

632
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:56,173
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

633
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:58,744
you're projecting
the supernatural

634
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:00,439
onto something...

635
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,727
all too painfully real.

636
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:07,016
And until you deal
with the real stuff

637
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,387
bubbling up for you,

638
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,683
the anger,

639
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:14,587
the feelings of vulnerability,
and violation,

640
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:17,026
your panic attacks
and nightmares

641
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,661
will only get worse.

642
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,531
Okay, so,

643
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,830
what do you suggest we do?

644
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:28,499
I see her.

645
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,443
I'm the zombie.

646
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:34,174
- Whoa! Hey, guys.
- Okay.

647
00:55:34,175 --> 00:55:35,642
So, he goes down 7:30
at the latest.

648
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:37,441
- We read two stories...
- Two stories, yeah.

649
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:38,983
...and then we sing <i>Frere Jacques</i>
when he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

650
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:40,684
Guys, check your phone.

651
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,981
I just texted you the confirmation number
for a room at the Hyatt.

652
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:44,350
Two blocks from here,
three from the restaurant.

653
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,951
Already paid for.

654
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,723
Dinner's one thing,
but there's no chance in hell

655
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:49,622
we're sleeping in a different place
than Jakie right now.

656
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:51,357
Who said anything
about sleeping?

657
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:53,630
Who said sleeping?

658
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:56,131
Will you just get her
out of here, Pat?

659
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:57,730
Who said...

660
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,037
Jakie,
listen to Auntie Anna, okay?

661
00:56:00,038 --> 00:56:01,205
Call any time!

662
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:03,281
We can be back,
five minutes tops, okay?

663
00:56:03,282 --> 00:56:05,358
Gonna play zombie.

664
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,880
I'm not sure
I'm up for this.

665
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:16,455
Yeah, me neither.

666
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,627
Worst case, we get dinner to go
and eat on Anna's couch.

667
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:26,727
Yep.

668
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:28,934
Let's at least try to make it
as far as dessert,

669
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:29,974
so she can put Jakie down.

670
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:38,076
So, what's the verdict?

671
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:42,982
Is your husband nuts?

672
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:47,915
Completely fricking crackers.

673
00:56:54,155 --> 00:56:57,430
So, what actually happened
with you and Liam at the mine?

674
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:03,095
Well, I thought I felt someone
cut off a lock of my hair.

675
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:06,101
I, uh...

676
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:08,699
I lost my shit

677
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,404
and then
we ran home screaming.

678
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,574
A lock of your hair?

679
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:15,842
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

680
00:57:15,843 --> 00:57:18,110
one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

681
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,178
That's how it starts.

682
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,318
What the hell for?

683
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,919
So he always knows
where to find you.

684
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,120
No matter where
you try to run or hide.

685
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:35,127
Your father was something else.

686
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:38,302
I think in his own way
he was just trying to protect me.

687
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,967
A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

688
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,591
All I remember
was Mom was furious

689
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,311
'cause every night
I was convinced

690
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:49,581
he was tapping on my window.

691
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,612
And then one night,

692
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,982
the old man came in
and he said,

693
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:00,823
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing as Bagman."

694
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:04,992
But I'm afraid
I can't do that.

695
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,228
What I can do...

696
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:14,771
is tell you a secret
he don't want you to know.

697
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:18,904
Truth is,

698
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:22,542
no matter how big, or fast,
or sneaky he is,

699
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,011
he has weaknesses as well.

700
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:28,521
Escape his grasp long enough,
he'll rot away.

701
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:33,251
And he cannot lay a single,
skinny finger on you.

702
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:35,561
Not as long...

703
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,427
as you have this.

704
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,296
You see,
every kid's got something

705
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:48,035
that means more to them
than anything else in the world.

706
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,104
Something they love so much,

707
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:55,614
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

708
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,913
And believe you me,

709
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:00,047
a child's love...

710
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:03,585
can be a magical thing.

711
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:05,822
It can turn even
the humblest object...

712
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:08,759
into a totem...

713
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:10,959
of great power.

714
00:59:15,062 --> 00:59:17,366
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

715
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,297
and he cannot touch you.

716
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,704
But lose it,

717
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:28,075
or even worse,
throw it away...

718
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:39,856
So, you keep ahold of it.

719
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,292
No matter what.

720
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,229
And now you're concerned...

721
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:52,384
that Fute has gone missing.

722
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:56,642
If the one thing that can
supposedly protect Jake...

723
00:59:58,145 --> 00:59:59,145
from you-know-who...

724
01:00:00,678 --> 01:00:02,078
is the thing
that he loves the most?

725
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:04,947
Honestly?

726
01:00:09,184 --> 01:00:11,718
Well, what I wanna
do right now is go back home

727
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:13,120
and dig through the trash again.

728
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:16,924
But if we go down
that thought track,

729
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:18,925
I'm not sure we'll make it
to the other side, so...

730
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:26,870
Did Barbara help
when you were eight?

731
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:29,972
Wouldn't have made it
to nine without her.

732
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:32,909
So, we have to trust her now.

733
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:54,498
No,
I do not miss you at all.

734
01:00:54,499 --> 01:00:56,367
<i>- What?</i>
- Mmm-mmm.

735
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:58,797
I have a real hot date tonight.

736
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:00,933
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
- Three feet tall,

737
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:03,603
talks gibberish
and craps his own pants.

738
01:01:03,604 --> 01:01:05,837
It is so, so sexy.

739
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:07,207
<i>Stop it.</i>

740
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,181
Okay, babe, um...

741
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:11,444
We'll see you tomorrow.

742
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:12,998
<i>Yeah.</i>

743
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:14,552
Yeah.

744
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:18,052
And why don't you
make me something sweet?

745
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:21,553
<i>Something sweet?
What do you mean?</i>

746
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:24,022
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

747
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:26,358
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

748
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:31,002
Okay. Okay, babe.

749
01:01:31,003 --> 01:01:32,100
Yeah. Bye.

750
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,844
<i>Hey.</i>

751
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:55,378
- Angelo.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

752
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,588
Is there something weird
happening on this floor?

753
01:02:58,589 --> 01:03:00,719
<i>Uh, what do you mean, "weird"?</i>

754
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,054
I don't know.

755
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:04,288
I'm hearing a voice
on a baby monitor.

756
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:06,727
<i>Everything's clear
on my security cams.</i>

757
01:03:06,728 --> 01:03:07,792
<i>You want me to come up?</i>

758
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:09,164
No, no. Um...

759
01:03:09,897 --> 01:03:11,665
I'm sure it's nothing.

760
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,434
<i>Okay. Take it easy.</i>

761
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:14,466
Yeah.

762
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:27,886
Angelo, has there been
a power surge?

763
01:03:29,884 --> 01:03:31,516
Angelo, are you there?

764
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:37,561
Come on.

765
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:40,833
Shit.

766
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:23,068
I don't know
what you want from me.

767
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:25,306
But the cops are on their way!

768
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,049
Did I mention I have a gun?

769
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:39,419
Don't play with me,
motherfucker!

770
01:04:57,177 --> 01:04:58,177
Sarah!

771
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,012
Sarah, call the police!

772
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:29,733
Stay back.

773
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:31,866
Karina.

774
01:06:33,068 --> 01:06:35,098
Anna? Anna, are you okay?

775
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,503
Are you okay?

776
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:39,222
What happened?

777
01:06:39,223 --> 01:06:40,441
Where's Jakie?

778
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:43,878
We got him. He's okay.

779
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:45,710
Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

780
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:47,717
There you go.

781
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,581
It's okay. Thank you.

782
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:53,337
We've got nothing
on the CCTV camera.

783
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:56,094
It was knocked out
when the power went down.

784
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,690
Thank God for the doorman.

785
01:07:00,428 --> 01:07:03,029
Once the camera
on Anna's floor went dark,

786
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,531
he headed straight up.

787
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:08,036
He must have
scared the guy off.

788
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:09,602
- Did Angelo get a look at him?
- No.

789
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:12,402
But, Pat,

790
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,357
apparently
there are similarities

791
01:07:14,358 --> 01:07:16,312
to a case from four years ago.

792
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:21,299
A girl named
Emily Greenberg went missing.

793
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,186
Her dad suffered
similar symptoms to Anna's,

794
01:07:24,187 --> 01:07:28,474
temporary paralysis
and loss of speech.

795
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:32,762
And these strange abrasions
on his face.

796
01:07:32,763 --> 01:07:34,099
He said he couldn't move.

797
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:36,098
He had to lie there

798
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,217
and watch this lunatic
stuff his daughter

799
01:07:38,218 --> 01:07:40,336
into a duffel bag
and run off with her.

800
01:07:47,475 --> 01:07:49,411
Look, we're gonna
get you somewhere safe.

801
01:07:50,244 --> 01:07:51,376
I'll post officers outside

802
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:53,085
who'll keep watch
around the clock.

803
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:56,513
Don't worry, Pat.

804
01:07:56,514 --> 01:07:58,321
We're gonna catch
this sick bastard.

805
01:08:06,027 --> 01:08:07,178
Thanks.

806
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:08,331
No problem.

807
01:08:09,363 --> 01:08:10,863
This way. Right here.

808
01:08:10,864 --> 01:08:12,636
Come on.

809
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:13,637
Watch your step, okay?

810
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:31,319
They're trying to figure out
what paralyzed Anna,

811
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,999
and the doctors
don't have a frickin' clue.

812
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:35,787
Who cares,
as long as Anna's okay.

813
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,655
She's far from okay.

814
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,593
All right, she refused to stay
in the hospital.

815
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,428
She wouldn't even let us
turn the lights off upstairs.

816
01:08:43,429 --> 01:08:44,963
Karina had to give her
a sedative

817
01:08:44,964 --> 01:08:46,498
and get in bed with her,
you know?

818
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:48,800
Well, she can stay here
as long as she needs to.

819
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:53,206
Thank you.

820
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:54,341
Please.

821
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:56,643
We'd be insulted
if you went anywhere else.

822
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:00,416
Come here.

823
01:09:10,357 --> 01:09:11,493
I'm sorry.

824
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:14,397
For what?

825
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,268
Protecting my son?

826
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,939
Get some sleep.

827
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,343
I'm not going anywhere.

828
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:50,235
'Bout time.

829
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:55,723
What are you doing awake?

830
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:30,440
We'll get through this.

831
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:33,007
I promise.

832
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:52,528
I can't believe
this is happening.

833
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,828
What do we do
if he really does exist...

834
01:10:58,064 --> 01:11:00,767
and we have lost the one thing
in the whole world...

835
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,309
that could keep our son safe?

836
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,776
I'll make him a new one.

837
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:13,780
No, that won't be the same.

838
01:11:16,516 --> 01:11:19,016
Hey, get some sleep, honey.

839
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:21,022
All right?

840
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:01,963
Jake!

841
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,295
- Pat?
- Jake!

842
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:14,711
Daddy. Daddy, help me.
Help me.

843
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:15,776
Jake.

844
01:12:16,176 --> 01:12:17,176
Jake!

845
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,177
He's got the boy!

846
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,721
Pat? Pat?

847
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:34,063
Help!

848
01:12:36,097 --> 01:12:37,097
Help!

849
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:39,404
Somebody stop him!

850
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:12,330
Stop right there!

851
01:13:12,331 --> 01:13:14,098
Daddy, help me.

852
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:45,967
Daddy! Help me!

853
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:46,999
Jake!

854
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,496
Jake!

855
01:14:14,428 --> 01:14:15,632
Daddy!

856
01:14:17,803 --> 01:14:18,965
Help.

857
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:22,738
Daddy! Help me!

858
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:27,479
Daddy, help me.

859
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,986
Jake?

860
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:42,222
Jake?

861
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:26,703
Jake? Are you in here?

862
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,540
Jake?

863
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:33,977
Jake?

864
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,945
God, please. God.

865
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:42,108
No, no, no.

866
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,210
What the heck?

867
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,195
<i>Daddy.</i>

868
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:42,674
<i>Daddy.</i>

869
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,043
<i>Daddy, help me!</i>

870
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,853
Mommy!

871
01:18:02,854 --> 01:18:04,124
Jakie?

872
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,775
Oh, my God, Jake.

873
01:18:07,776 --> 01:18:09,660
Oh, my gosh. Jake!

874
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:10,731
Karina!

875
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,802
Karina, what's happening?

876
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:19,337
It's not Jake that he came for.

877
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,881
Show yourself,
you sick bastard!

878
01:18:27,648 --> 01:18:29,149
Show yourself!

879
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:37,734
<i>First,
he steals a lock of your hair,</i>

880
01:19:37,735 --> 01:19:40,286
<i>so he always knows
where to find you.</i>

881
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,126
<i>And then he taunts you
and feeds off your fear.</i>

882
01:19:46,961 --> 01:19:48,598
<i>It's the good kids he wants.</i>

883
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:51,428
<i>The shiny ones
and the dreamers.</i>

884
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:54,099
<i>And once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,</i>

885
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,118
<i>he won't rest
until he has them</i>

886
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:58,136
<i>slung over his bony shoulder,</i>

887
01:19:58,137 --> 01:20:01,142
screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

888
01:20:03,748 --> 01:20:06,147
Why come
for me now, huh?

889
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,545
After all this time?

890
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:19,094
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

891
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:21,492
and he cannot touch you.

892
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,061
<i>But lose it,</i>

893
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:27,905
or even worse,
throw it away...

894
01:20:51,257 --> 01:20:54,456
The cold hard truth of it,
Patty,

895
01:20:54,457 --> 01:20:56,395
is that there are monsters
in this world.

896
01:20:57,897 --> 01:20:59,101
There is evil.

897
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,368
And bad things
do happen to good people.

898
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:06,372
Even little children.

899
01:21:41,873 --> 01:21:44,179
<i>The only thing that
gives me comfort at night...</i>

900
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:49,446
is a belief that there's
something good out there,

901
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,582
much more powerful
than all the bad stuff.

902
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:55,421
<i>Something that loves
and watches over us.</i>

903
01:21:56,692 --> 01:21:57,692
<i>No matter what.</i>

904
01:22:18,177 --> 01:22:19,643
And you really believe that?

905
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:24,615
I'm lookin' at the proof.

906
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,434
Come on! It's me you want!

907
01:23:48,373 --> 01:23:49,373
Come on.

908
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:25,173
Yeah, this way.

909
01:24:25,174 --> 01:24:26,572
Down here! On me! Keep going.

910
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:29,656
<i>I don't know who's on foot.</i>

911
01:24:29,657 --> 01:24:31,374
Down by the yard,
keep a guard here.

912
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:33,076
What is it? What is it?

913
01:24:33,077 --> 01:24:34,778
This is as far as she goes.

914
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:38,419
Pat must have
taken a different route.

915
01:24:42,354 --> 01:24:43,589
Yo, boss, we got something.

916
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,507
It's got blood on it.

917
01:24:46,508 --> 01:24:47,824
Let's fan out!

918
01:24:48,633 --> 01:24:49,699
What is that?

919
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,820
That's Jake's flute.

920
01:24:58,037 --> 01:24:59,276
Pat. Pat!

921
01:24:59,277 --> 01:25:00,441
Pat!

922
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,348
Pat!

923
01:25:04,009 --> 01:25:05,314
Pat!

924
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:07,917
Pat!

925
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,049
You need
to step away from...

926
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,451
Pat! Can you hear me?

927
01:25:11,557 --> 01:25:12,684
Pat!

928
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:15,954
Pat!

929
01:25:16,989 --> 01:25:18,327
Pat!

930
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,296
Pat!

931
01:25:41,615 --> 01:25:43,954
Mom said we could stay
as long as we need to.

932
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:45,621
I just can't be
in this house anymore.

933
01:25:45,622 --> 01:25:46,652
Not without Pat.

934
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:49,685
There's still hope, 'Rina.

935
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,657
I mean, they haven't
even found anything yet.

936
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,731
They're not going to.

937
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,564
And it's not over yet, either.

938
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:00,705
What do you mean?

939
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:04,868
He's gonna come back for Jake.
I can just feel it.

940
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:09,675
What are you gonna do?

941
01:26:13,917 --> 01:26:14,917
Whatever it takes.

942
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,290
Okay. Come here.

943
01:26:29,563 --> 01:26:33,129
Just call me
when you get there. Okay?

944
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,700
Yep. Yep.

945
01:26:35,606 --> 01:26:36,636
Yep.

946
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,706
Yeah.

947
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:14,740
Hey, so I got some
good news for you, pal.

948
01:27:16,309 --> 01:27:17,347
Look what Daddy found.

949
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:19,011
Fute.

950
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:26,785
You know, he gave everything
to get that back for you.

951
01:27:31,863 --> 01:27:33,759
And, um... And Daddy...

952
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:35,593
He also told me a secret

953
01:27:35,594 --> 01:27:37,194
that he really,
really wants you to know.

954
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,306
Okay, so how much
do you love Fute, Jakie?

955
01:27:43,704 --> 01:27:46,277
Yeah. So a child's love
is a magical thing.

956
01:27:49,376 --> 01:27:50,496
Keep it close to your heart.

957
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:54,417
And it will always
protect you.

958
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,618
- Okay?
- Okay.

959
01:27:58,183 --> 01:27:59,183
Okay.

960
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:01,556
Always.

961
01:28:02,088 --> 01:28:03,294
Always.
