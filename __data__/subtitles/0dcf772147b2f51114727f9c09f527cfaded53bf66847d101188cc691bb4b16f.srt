Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10

from The King's shadow.</i>

49

Lightning McQueen!</i>

McQueen is in the wreckage.

[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74

McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,577
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,788
Yeah! Ka-chow!

heads into the pits,

McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,385
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

[air wrench whirring]

87
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,559

A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,561
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,728
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,898
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,733
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,404
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,739
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,075
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,537
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,998
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,239
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [male] What?

101
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,450
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,745
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,246
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,999
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,753
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

[cars whizzing]

107
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:53,098
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,018
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,395
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

- [tire blows]

113
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,156
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,992
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

115
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,620
- You fool!
- [grunts]

116
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,457

- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

Come on. [grunting]

122
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,270
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

And it's, and it's...

- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

than just winning.</i>

Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

- That's it! Come on, guys.

- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

155
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,783

they themselves don't understand.

A little bit, but I'll be all right.

490
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,379
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

491

But listen. Be careful.

00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,406
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

different with your side view mirrors?

What do you want, Sally?

504
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,457

fix the road. The town needs this.

00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,710
No. I know his type. Racecar.

506
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,837
That's the last thing this town needs.

507
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:06,425
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

508
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:10,429
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

509
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,931
Here she goes again.

510
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,683
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

511
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,395
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

512
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:22,274
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

513
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,319
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

514
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,570
Ignore him.

515
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,990
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

516
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,409
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

517
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,287
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

518
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,831
And if no one can get to you?

519
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:41,252
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

520
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,130
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

521
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,633
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

522
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,220
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

523
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,807
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

524
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,977
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

525
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,646
- [all] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

526
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,524
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

527
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,819
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big AI!

528
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,155
Lizzie, Big AI left like, 15 years ago.

529
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,240
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

530
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,324
Oh, he can do it.

531
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,161
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

532
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,704
[all] Fix the road!

533
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:20,332
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

534
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,667
[all cheer]

535
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,962
[honking] Order in the court!

536
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,507
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

537
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,551
- [all] Yeah!
- No!

538
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,969
[VW van] Nice ruling.

539
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,182
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

540
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,144
[chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

541
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,021
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

542
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,732
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

543
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,484
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

544
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,278
[gurgling]

545
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:53,657
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

546
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,785
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

547
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,580
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

548
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,999
What? This place is crazy!

549
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,210
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

550
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,296
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

551
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,380
What?

552
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:12,009
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

553
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,677
You gotta be kidding me.

554
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,430
You start there where the road begins.

555
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,808
You finish down there
where the road ends.

556
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,021
[Mater] Holy shoot!

557
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,941
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

558
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,569
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

559
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,820
Five days?

560
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,823
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

561
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,868
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

562
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,454
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

563
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,625
[grunting]

564
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,170
[tires squealing, engine revving]

565
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,756
[Lightning] Freedom!

566
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,598
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

567
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:03,686
...and then...
then took the boot off.

568
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,523
Whoo-hoo!

569
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:12,278
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

570
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:16,198
California, here I come! Yeah!

571
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,577
Oh, feel that wind.

572
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,621
Yes!

573
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:23,706
[sputtering]

574
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,833
No. No, no, no.

575
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,419
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

576
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,462
How can I be outta gas?

577
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:34,508
[chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

578
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,927
[stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?

579
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,305
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

580
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,308
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

581
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,110
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

582
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,278
Hey, Sheriff.

583
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,613
- Why here?
<i>- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

584
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:59,158
- They were better before.
<i>- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

585
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,118
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

586
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,996
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

587
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,915
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

588
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,710
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

589
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,671
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

590
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:16,133
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

591
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,427
That's why we made him the judge.

592
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:22,765
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
<i>Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

593
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,183
Now, I'm not one to brag

594
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,603
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

595
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,063
Oh!

596
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,982
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

597
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,859
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

598
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,195
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

599
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:40,949
- [snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

600
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,369
That won't be necessary.

601
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,706
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

602
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,459
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

603
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:53,879
Where's he goin'?

604
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,383
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

605
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,967
I shouldn't put up with this.

606
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,887
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

607
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,015
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

608
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,477
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

609
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,188
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

610
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,234
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

611
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,611
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

612
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,780
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

613
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,865
I must scream it to the world!

614
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:26,161
My excitement from the top
of some place very high!

615
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,747
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,792
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

617
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:35,504
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

618
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,928
Is that what I think it is?

619
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,764
[Sally] Customers.

620
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:49,268
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

621
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,727
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

622
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,605
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

623
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:56,275
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

624
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,862
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

625
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,614
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

626
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:07,077
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:09,788
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

628
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:12,833
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

629
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,169
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

630
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,295
How can we help you?

631
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,424
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

632
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,719
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

633
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,221
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

634
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,141
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

635
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,269
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

636
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:36,398
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

637
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,150
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

638
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,445
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

639
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,823
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

640
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,242
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

641
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,661
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

642
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,873
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

643
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,668
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

644
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:00,214
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

645
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:04,218
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

646
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,469
No we just topped off.

647
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,389
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

648
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,934
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

649
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,354
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paintjob.

650
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,565
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

651
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,943
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

652
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,361
Maybe ghost flames!

653
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,988
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

654
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:28,951
- [both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

655
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,037
[chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

656
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,622
Ow!

657
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,917
[laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

658
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,211
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

659
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,798
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

660
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,468
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

661
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,804
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

662
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,974
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,226
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

664
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,937
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,480
No, not really. But listen.

666
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:02,192
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

667
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,778
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

668
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,699
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

669
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,910
<i>- [locks beeping]</i>
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

670
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:15,872
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

671
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:19,084
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

672
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,253
I'm becoming one of them!

673
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,088
- [Lightning echoes]
- [sighing]

674
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,257
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

675
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,092
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

676
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,053
<i>[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

677
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:32,848
- That's good.
<i>- ...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

678
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,810
<i>[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

679
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,355
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

680
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,609
<i>[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

681
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:47,446
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

682
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:48,947
[electronic music]

683
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,782
[laughing]

684
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,701
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

685
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:58,749
Ha-ha!

686
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:03,587
Yeah!

687
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,965
[crowd shouting and cheering]

688
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:15,140
[girls chattering and giggling]

689
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,559
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

690
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,811
[gasping] Oh!

691
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,271
Let me get this straight.

692
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,274
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

693
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,070
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

694
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,237
I got a road to finish.

695
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,949
[grunting and revving]

696
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,502
- He's done!
- Done?

697
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,921
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

698
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:51,176
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

699
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,137
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

700
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:58,433
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

701
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,602
Oh!

702
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,606
[vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

703
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:08,318
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

704
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,947
- Oh!
- [blubbering]

705
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,282
Red.

706
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,203
Who do you think you are?

707
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,581
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

708
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:25,085
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

709
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,629
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

710
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:31,341
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

711
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,884
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

712
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:37,222
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

713
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:41,059
- What?
- [chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

714
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:43,520
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

715
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,273
If I win, you do the road my way.

716
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,899
Doc, what're you doin'?

717
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,068
I don't mean to be rude here,

718
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:53,905
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

719
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,491
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

720
00:42:56,575 --> 00:43:01,246
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

721
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,500
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

722
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:10,088
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

723
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:13,091
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

724
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,677
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

725
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:20,891
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

726
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,726
and no lollygaggin'.

727
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,352
Speed. I'm speed.

728
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,980
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

729
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,106
[Luigi laughs]

730
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:33,028
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

731
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,614
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

732
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,575
The race is only one lap, guys.

733
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,119
<i>Uno</i> lappo! Don't need any help.

734
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:45,040
- I work <i>solo mio.</i>
- Fine. Race your way.

735
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:50,212
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

736
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,339
Gentlemen...

737
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,801
...start your engines!

738
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,596
[engine sputters]

739
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,474
[revving furiously]

740
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,935
- <i>¡Hijole!</i> Check that out!
- Whoa.

741
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:08,104
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

742
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,773
Luigi?

743
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,026
[chuckling] On your mark, get set...

744
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,320
<i>Uno</i> for the money,
<i>due</i> for the show,

745
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:21,117
<i>tre</i> to get ready, and <i>quattro</i>
to... I can't believe it. Go!

746
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,578
[giggling]

747
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,082
[cheering]

748
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,919
Huh?

749
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,089
Doc... the flag means go.

750
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,509
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

751
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,303
Doc, what are you doing, man?

752
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:43,932
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

753
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,143
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

754
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,980
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

755
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,108
You got your tow cable?

756
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,360
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

757
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,779
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

758
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,498
[yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

759
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:10,292
No, no, no, no, no!

760
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,836
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

761
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,881
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

762
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,382
[revving]

763
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:25,056
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

764
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,475
- I'm confused.
- [chuckling]

765
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,644
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

766
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:32,939
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

767
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,570
[gasps] Ah!

768
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:42,240
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

769
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:45,493
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

770
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,498
I can make a little turn on dirt.

771
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,000
You think?

772
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,546
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

773
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,090
Hey, <i>ése!</i>
You need a new paintjob, man!

774
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:02,093
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

775
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,554
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

776
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:09,100
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

777
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,769
Nah, not me, Flo.

778
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,271
I'm on one of them there special diets.

779
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:17,984
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

780
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,779
"You race like you fix roads."

781
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:25,659
[grunting] I'll show him.
[grunting] I will show him!

782
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,296
- [tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

783
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,050
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

784
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,804
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

785
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,598
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

786
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:51,726
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

787
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:58,066
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

788
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,163
Wow.

789
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,165
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

790
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:19,462
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

791
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,589
Yes! Uh, amazing!

792
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,677
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

793
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,931
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

794
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,559
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

795
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,771
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

796
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,024
<i>[Italian] È bellissima!</i> It's beautiful!

797
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,861
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

798
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,071
Boy, I tell you what.

799
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:47,991
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

800
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,743
Doc, look at this!

801
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,704
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

802
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,291
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

803
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,335
Guido, look at Luigi!

804
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,671
This is <i>fantastico!</i>

805
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:05,216
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

806
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,596
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

807
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,974
That crazy old devil woman.

808
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,811
[sighs] Oh!

809
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,730
She's right!

810
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,356
- Ah!
- Guido!

811
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,194
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

812
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:29,282
Well, now... where the heck is he?

813
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,333
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

814
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,753
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

815
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,214
and asked me if he could
come down here.

816
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,674
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

817
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,594
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

818
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,597
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

819
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:58,770
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

820
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,230
I'll keep an eye on him.

821
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:04,192
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

822
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,696
[engine revving]

823
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,035
[screaming]

824
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,872
[spitting]

825
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,042
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

826
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,837
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

827
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,257
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

828
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,802
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

829
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,972
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

830
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:37,142
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

831
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,852
I'll put it simple.

832
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:43,106
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

833
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,571
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

834
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,447
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

835
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:55,118
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

836
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:01,332
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

837
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:04,419
[groans]

838
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,925
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

839
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,179
Hmm...

840
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:15,305
Whoa!

841
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,100
- Oh!
- [car crashing]

842
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:23,563
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

843
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,484
[screaming] Ow!

844
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,198
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

845
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:36,367
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

846
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:39,829
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

847
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:43,833
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

848
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:54,260
- Oh, Guido, <i>è bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

849
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:58,723
- It looks great! This is great!
<i>- Tipiace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

850
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,226
[grunts, passes gas]

851
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,311
Oh, Lord.

852
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,021
- [chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

853
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,232
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

854
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:10,610
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

855
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,529
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

856
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:16,074
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

857
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,826
[groaning] Oh...

858
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,579
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

859
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,207
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

860
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,543
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

861
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,921
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

862
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,006
You make-a such a nice new road.

863
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,759
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

864
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,427
Even though you not a Ferrari.

865
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:40,598
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

866
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:44,519
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

867
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,106
[chuckling] I like your style, eh?

868
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,776
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

869
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,280
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

870
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,031
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

871
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,242
Ramone, Ramone!

872
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,411
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

873
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,455
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

874
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:08,167
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

875
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:12,964
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

876
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,883
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

877
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,218
[exhales deeply]

878
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,469
Ah!

879
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,680
Stop! Let me...

880
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,892
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

881
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,978
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

882
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,398
Stop, stop! That's cold!

883
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,984
Help! Please! Stop!

884
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,404
- [coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

885
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,906
What was that for?

886
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,117
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

887
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,660
If you do, you gotta be clean.

888
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,288
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

889
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,081
What, I...? I don't get it.

890
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,751
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

891
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:53,046
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

892
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:57,759
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

893
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,679
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

894
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,182
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

895
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,518
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

896
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,772
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

897
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:14,317
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

898
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,529
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

899
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:21,949
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

900
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,703
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

901
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,123
Cone number one, if you want.

902
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,627
Oh...

903
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:37,465
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

904
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,635
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

905
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,887
[both chuckle]

906
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,557
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

907
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,268
Gonna... Yeah.

908
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,567
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [gasps]

909
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,152
Good-lookin' girl.

910
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,531
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

911
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:05,118
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

912
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,663
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

913
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,875
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

914
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:17,088
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

915
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,758
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

916
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,094
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

917
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,929
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

918
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,015
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

919
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,435
I can handle anything.

920
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:35,356
- [whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

921
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,110
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

922
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,612
- [tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

923
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:45,700
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

924
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,618
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

925
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,580
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

926
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,081
Wait, Mater!

927
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,209
OK, here's what you do.

928
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:58,671
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

929
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,257
And they do the rest. Watch this.

930
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,141
- [honking loudly]
- Oh!

931
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:15,396
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

932
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,275
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

933
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,236
[laughing loudly]

934
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,448
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

935
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,327
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

936
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,996
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

937
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,543
- [honking]
- Oh!

938
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:41,214
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

939
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:44,175
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

940
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:48,262
[laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

941
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:50,097
Oh, your turn, bud.

942
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,558
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

943
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,852
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

944
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:55,937
[clucking]

945
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,440
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

946
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:09,408
[snoring]

947
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,919
- [revving engine]
- Oh!

948
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:24,340
[all exclaiming and mooing]

949
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:34,267
[all gurgling]

950
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:39,397
[all backfiring]

951
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:47,280
[angry mooing]

952
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,116
[mooing]

953
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,826
That's Frank.

954
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,914
- [bellowing angrily]
- [shouting]

955
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,669
- [mooing]
- [engine revving]

956
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:11,262
[Mater laughing]

957
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,056
Run!

958
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,142
- Here he comes, look out!
- [bellowing]

959
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,769
[laughing] Whoa!

960
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,355
[screaming]

961
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,734
Run! He's gonna get ya!

962
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:34,118
[Mater laughing]

963
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,212
Oh! Customers!

964
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,882
Oh!

965
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,302
Ah, no, no, no.

966
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,095
Oof! Oh!

967
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,516
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

968
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,103
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

969
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:05,483
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

970
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,485
Oh, yeah... yeah.

971
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:10,655
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

972
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,908
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

973
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:14,992
Oh...

974
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:20,331
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

975
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:24,669
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

976
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:28,631
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

977
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,425
- Where, where?
- [laughing]

978
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:34,095
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

979
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,347
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

980
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,598
- Way.
- Come on, look...

981
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:40,101
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

982
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,811
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

983
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,729
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

984
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:45,856
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

985
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,441
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

986
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,527
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

987
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,863
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

988
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:57,868
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

989
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:01,038
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

990
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,791
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

991
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,292
Mater? Mater!

992
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,963
- Mater!
- [laughing]

993
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,517
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

994
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,978
[screaming happily]

995
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,274
Oof!

996
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:31,777
[blubbering] Yee-hee!

997
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,113
[chuckling] He's nuts.

998
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:37,658
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

999
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,163
Just need to know where I've been.

1000
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:45,374
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

1001
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:49,420
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

1002
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:52,757
[chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

1003
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,343
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

1004
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:01,599
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1005
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,976
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1006
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,104
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

1007
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:10,733
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

1008
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,443
with private helicopters.

1009
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,780
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

1010
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,032
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

1011
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:23,454
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

1012
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,707
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

1013
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:31,712
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1014
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:36,383
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1015
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:39,261
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

1016
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:41,096
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

1017
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:45,142
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

1018
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,061
In what?

1019
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:49,897

1020
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,030

When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

1034

Something about a helicopter ride.

1035

Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

1036
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:43,993
- Did you mean it?
- What?

1037
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,078
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

1038
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,206
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

- What?

1043
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:06,724
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

Look, I'm exhausted.

- Get a good peek, city boy?

- Not Doc Hudson.

No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

Yeah, a drive.

Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

1123
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,838
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

1124
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,841
That's so too much!

1125
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,346
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

You know, I don't get you.

How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

1145
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,790
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

1146
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:14,044
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

1147

Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

1148
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,134
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

1149
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:24,554
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

1150
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,390
And you know what?

1151
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:30,102
It never felt... happy.

1152
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,815
Yeah. I mean... really?

1153
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:36,608
Yeah. So I left California.

1154
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,986
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1155
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,532
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1156
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:46,618
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1157
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,579
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1158
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:52,457
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1159
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:56,294
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1160

- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1327
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:48,501
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1328
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,753
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1329
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,172
[♪ The Chords: <i>Sh-Boom</i>]

1330
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,571
[gasping] They fixed their neon!

1331
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:29,959
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]

1332
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,670
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

1333
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:37,633
Just like in its heyday, right?

1334
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:41,053
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1335
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,077
[chuckling]

1336
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,915
Shall we cruise?

1337
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,335
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1338
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,836
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1339
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,257
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1340
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:21,177
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1341
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,638
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1342
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,976
[mooing]

1343
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:35,483
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1344
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:39,862
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1345
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:43,366
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1346
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,537
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

1347
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,002
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1348
01:26:55,086 --> 01:26:57,380
Good evenin', you two.

1349
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:05,137
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1350
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:13,020
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1351
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:18,734
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1352
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:21,404
Not that. That.

1353
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,906
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1354
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,617
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1355
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,828
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1356
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:29,912
[all gasp]

1357
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:32,581
It's the ghostlight!

1358
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,292
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1359
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,586
McQueen, over here!

1360
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,423
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1361
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:42,633
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1362
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:45,428
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1363
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:46,512
[Sally] Stickers!

1364
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,764
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1365
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:51,267
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1366
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,562
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1367
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:56,230
Sally! Sally!

1368
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,357
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1369
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,151
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1370
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:02,611
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [horn honking]

1371
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:07,199
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1372
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:10,619
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1373
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:14,582
[chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1374
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:17,376
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1375
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,295
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1376
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:21,964
<i>[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1377
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,592
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1378
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,138
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1379
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,475
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1380
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:34,810
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1381
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:36,729
- Harv?
- Come on!

1382
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,482
<i>- Kid, I'm over here!</i>
- How you doin', buddy?

1383
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:42,234
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1384
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:44,487
<i>- How do you think I'm doing?</i>
- I can explain.

1385
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:48,991
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1386
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:52,119
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1387
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,663
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1388
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:56,999
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1389
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,627
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1390
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:02,880
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
<i>- Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1391
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,173
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1392
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:08,052
<i>While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1393
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:09,845
<i>- Who are they gonna woo?</i>
- Chick!

1394
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:13,516
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1395
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:15,768
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1396
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:19,480
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1397
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:22,816
- Hey, that's my bit!
<i>- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1398
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,862
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1399
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:28,697
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1400
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,533
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1401
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:33,911
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1402
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,834
Sally, I... I want you to...

1403
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,588
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1404
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,884
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1405
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,011
[groans, chuckles]

1406
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:56,308
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1407
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,606
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1408
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,901
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1409
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:08,737
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1410
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:11,031
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1411
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:16,412
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1412
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,581
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1413
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:21,917
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1414
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,086
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1415
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,678
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.</i>
- Where's the old McQueen?

1416
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,097
- The bolt!
<i>- That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1417
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,891
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1418
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:40,269
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1419
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,355
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1420
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,066
[engine starts]

1421
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:48,360
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1422
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,870
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1423
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:00,372
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1424
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:12,551
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1425
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,347
Best for everyone or best for you?

1426
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,616
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1427
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:23,497
[light buzzing]

1428
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:38,512
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1429
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,889
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1430
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:43,183
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1431
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:45,728
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1432
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:48,355
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1433
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:52,735
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1434
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,404
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1435
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,782
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1436
01:32:58,866 --> 01:33:02,077
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1437
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:06,165
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1438
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,584
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1439
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:12,755
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1440
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,424
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1441
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:19,595
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1442
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:22,765
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1443
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:23,849
[Mia] He's hot!

1444
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,602
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1445
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:29,772
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1446
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:32,357
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1447
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:35,360
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1448
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:38,197
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1449
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:41,408
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1450
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:46,455
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1451
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:50,417
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1452
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:51,752
[guard] Sorry, pal.

1453
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:56,089
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1454
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:59,635
I am speed.

1455
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:01,303
[cars whizzing]

1456
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,596
Victory.

1457
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,807
One winner, two losers.

1458
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,809
[engine revving]

1459
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:12,439
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1460
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:15,067
[birds singing]

1461
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:17,528
[knock on door]

1462
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:19,196
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1463
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,990
[gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1464
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:28,247
[indistinct chatter]

1465
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,173
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1466
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:40,843
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1467
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:43,303
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1468
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:45,764
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1469
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:53,105
[all shouting]

1470
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:54,940
[gulping]

1471
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,449
Uh-oh

1472
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,081
- [cheering, laughing]
- [giggling]

1473
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:18,297
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1474
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,674
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1475
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:23,886
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1476
01:35:23,969 --> 01:35:26,346
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1477
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:29,474
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1478
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:33,729
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1479
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:34,980
[chuckling]

1480
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,399
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1481
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,360
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1482
01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:43,405
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1483
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:46,658
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1484
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,584
Agh! Shoot!

1485
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,795
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1486
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,968
[crowd cheering]

1487
01:36:05,052 --> 01:36:06,595
Come on, you can do it!

1488
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:08,722
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1489
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:13,101
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1490
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:16,438
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1491
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:20,776
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1492
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:23,236
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1493
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,030
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1494
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,407
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1495
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:34,331
- [soft music]
- [birds singing]

1496
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,750
[breaks squealing]

1497
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,877
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1498
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:40,003
[all gasp]

1499
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:45,467
[chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1500
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:49,054
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [all laugh]

1501
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,138
[groans]

1502
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:54,309
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1503
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:55,811
I don't think I...

1504
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:58,605
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1505
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:00,399
Doc?

1506
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:05,654
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1507
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:09,491
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1508
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,493
You said you'd never come back.

1509
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:15,163
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1510
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:18,125
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1511
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,085
[chuckles]

1512
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:25,590
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1513
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:28,927
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1514
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:31,013
Now, get back out there!

1515
01:37:33,265 --> 01:37:36,184
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1516
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:38,562
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1517
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:41,815
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1518
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:43,567
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1519
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:47,070
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1520
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:58,707
[murmuring]

1521
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,667
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1522
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:04,504
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1523
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:07,215
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1524
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:09,676
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1525
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,429
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1526
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:15,849
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1527
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:20,395
[crowd cheering]

1528
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:22,522
<i>[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

1529
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:25,484
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1530
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:26,943
Hey, Doc!

1531
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:31,198
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1532
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:39,915
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1533
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:42,876
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1534
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:45,837
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1535
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,506
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1536
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:50,467
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1537
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,970
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1538
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,097
[all laugh]

1539
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,766
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1540
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:01,019
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1541
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,245
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1542
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:21,081
What do you think of this?

1543
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:23,333
- [tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1544
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:27,921
What?

1545
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,798
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1546
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:35,804
- [laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1547
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,849
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1548
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:40,767
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1549
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:44,020
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1550
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:50,861
[chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1551
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:58,869
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1552
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:01,371
No, you don't.

1553
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,332
[tire blows]

1554
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,418
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1555
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:09,921
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1556
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:13,300
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1557
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,345
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1558
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:20,348
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1559
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:22,601
Guido! It's time.

1560
01:40:26,897 --> 01:40:29,983
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1561
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:35,113
[air wrench whirring]

1562
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:40,535
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1563
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:42,287
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1564
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,915
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1565
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:46,708
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1566
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:50,837
- Yeah, baby!
- [all hollering]

1567
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:52,297
<i>[Darrell] He's back in!</i>

1568
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,633
Peet stop.

1569
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:57,969
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1570
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:16,321
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1571
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,740
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1572
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:22,369
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1573
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:23,703
This is it, kiddo.

1574
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:26,248
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1575
01:41:26,331 --> 01:41:28,750
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1576
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,252
- Go!
- [revving]

1577
01:41:32,963 --> 01:41:34,089
We'll see about that!

1578
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,175
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1579
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:43,181
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1580
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:56,319
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1581
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:59,364
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1582
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:04,077
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1583
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:08,623
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1584
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:10,834
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1585
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:16,131
[grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1586
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,393
- Oh, no!
- [crowd gasps]

1587
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:39,821
[breaks screeching]

1588
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,575
[engine idling]

1589
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,080
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1590
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:52,917
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1591
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,338
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1592
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:06,639
[grunting, moaning]

1593
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:08,058
What are you doin', kid?

1594
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:11,394
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1595
01:43:14,564 --> 01:43:17,525
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1596
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:21,196
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1597
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,365
It's just an empty cup.

1598
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,036
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1599
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:31,748
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1600
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:34,125
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1601
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,878
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1602
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:39,214
- That's what I call racin'.
- [sobbing]

1603
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:40,799
[laughing]

1604
01:43:42,801 --> 01:43:45,804
[crowd cheers wildly]

1605
01:43:55,188 --> 01:43:58,233
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!</i>
- Way to go, buddy!

1606
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:00,902
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1607
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:05,532
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1608
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:10,995
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1609
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,455
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1610
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:15,500
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1611
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:18,711
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1612
01:44:18,795 --> 01:44:21,005
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1613
01:44:21,089 --> 01:44:24,676
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1614
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:28,054
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1615
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:29,597
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1616
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:31,266
- Boo!
- Boo!

1617
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,436
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1618
01:44:34,519 --> 01:44:36,646
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1619
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:45,029
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1620
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:49,868
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1621
01:44:49,951 --> 01:44:51,953
You're The King! Yeah!

1622
01:44:52,454 --> 01:44:54,706
[crowd cheers]

1623
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:02,297
[laughing and cheering]

1624
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:05,842
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1625
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:11,681
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1626
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,558
Thanks, Doc.

1627
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:15,977
Hey, Lightnin'.

1628
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,730
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1629
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:22,650
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1630
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:25,528
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1631
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,659
But I didn't win.

1632
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:35,413
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1633
01:45:35,497 --> 01:45:38,166
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1634
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:42,420
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [all laugh]

1635
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:44,214
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1636
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:48,051
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1637
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:51,304
I'm gonna stick with them.

1638
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:54,432
Well, I sure can respect that.

1639
01:45:54,516 --> 01:45:55,683
Still, you know,

1640
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:59,604
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1641
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:02,232
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1642
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:06,694
Actually, there is one thing.

1643
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:09,614
Whoo-hoo!

1644
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:13,576

- It is?

There's some rumor floating around
