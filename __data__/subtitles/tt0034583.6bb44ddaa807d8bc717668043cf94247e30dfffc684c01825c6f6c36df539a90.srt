LIKE THIS, YOU ARE
VERY MUCH MISTAKEN.

177
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:47,007
EXCUSE ME.
HELLO, RICK.

178
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:50,310
YOUR CASH IS GOOD
AT THE BAR.

179
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,312
WHAT? DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?

180
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,147
I DO. YOU'RE LUCKY
THE BAR'S OPEN TO YOU.

181
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:59,019
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! I SHALL
REPORT IT TO THE<i> ANGRIFF.</i>

182
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,122
RICK, WATCHING YOU
WITH THE DEUTSCHE BANK,

183
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:06,026
ONE WOULD THINK YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THIS ALL YOUR LIFE.

184
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,495
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I HAVEN'T?

185
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,063
NOTHING, BUT WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME

186
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:11,798
TO CASABLANCA,
I THOUGHT--

187
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,199
YOU THOUGHT WHAT?

188
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:17,204
WHAT RIGHT DO I
HAVE TO THINK?

189
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,108
MAY I?

190
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:25,211
TOO BAD ABOUT THOSE
2 GERMAN COURIERS.

191
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,145
THEY GOT A LUCKY BREAK.

192
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,114
YESTERDAY THEY WERE
JUST TWO GERMAN CLERKS.

193
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,150
TODAY THEY'RE
THE HONORED DEAD.

194
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,252
YOU ARE A VERY
CYNICAL PERSON.

195
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:33,787
FORGIVE ME
FOR SAYING SO.

196
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,088
I FORGIVE YOU.

197
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:37,390
WILL YOU HAVE
A DRINK WITH ME?

198
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,224
NO.

199
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,160
I FORGOT. YOU NEVER
DRINK WITH ANYONE.

200
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:41,294
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER,
PLEASE.

201
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,129
YOU DESPISE ME,
DON'T YOU?

202
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:46,833
IF I GAVE YOU ANY THOUGHT,
I PROBABLY WOULD.

203
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,368
WHY? YOU OBJECT

204
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:50,570
TO THE KIND OF
BUSINESS I DO, HUH?

205
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:53,173
THINK OF ALL THOSE
POOR REFUGEES

206
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,575
WHO'D ROT HERE IF I
DIDN'T HELP THEM.

207
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,110
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

208
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:58,111
THROUGH WAYS
OF MY OWN,

209
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:00,313
I PROVIDE THEM
WITH EXIT VISAS.

210
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:03,149
FOR A PRICE, UGARTE,
FOR A PRICE.

211
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,784
BUT THINK OF
ALL THE POOR DEVILS

212
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,853
WHO CAN'T MEET
RENAULT'S PRICE.

213
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,189
I GET IT
FOR THEM FOR HALF.

214
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,590
IS THAT SO PARASITIC?

215
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,128
I DON'T MIND A PARASITE.
I OBJECT TO A CUT-RATE ONE.

216
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:16,229
WELL, AFTER TONIGHT,

217
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:18,264
I'LL BE THROUGH WITH
THE WHOLE BUSINESS.

218
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,101
I'M LEAVING, FINALLY,
THIS CASABLANCA.

219
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:22,869
WHO'D YOU BRIBE
FOR YOUR VISA,

220
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,270
RENAULT OR YOURSELF?

221
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:28,508
MYSELF. I FOUND MYSELF
MUCH MORE REASONABLE.

222
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,843
LOOK, RICK.

223
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,478
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

224
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:34,380
SOMETHING THAT EVEN YOU
HAVE NEVER SEEN.

225
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:38,451
LETTERS OF TRANSIT
SIGNED BY GENERAL DE GAULLE.

226
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:42,155
CANNOT BE RESCINDED,
NOT EVEN QUESTIONED.

227
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,123
ONE MOMENT.

228
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,824
TONIGHT I'LL BE
SELLING THOSE

229
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,760
FOR MORE MONEY THAN EVEN
I'VE EVER DREAMED OF,

230
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:49,796
AND THEN<i> ADDIO,</i>
CASABLANCA.

231
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,898
YOU KNOW, RICK,
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS,

232
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,766
BUT SOMEHOW, BECAUSE
YOU DESPISE ME,

233
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,435
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I TRUST.

234
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,737
WILL YOU KEEP THESE
FOR ME?

235
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:58,604
FOR HOW LONG?

236
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,440
PERHAPS AN HOUR. PERHAPS
A LITTLE LONGER.

237
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,509
I DON'T WANT THEM HERE
OVERNIGHT.

238
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:03,810
DON'T BE AFRAID
OF THAT.

239
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:05,311
PLEASE KEEP THEM
FOR ME.

240
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:08,181
THANK YOU. I KNEW
I COULD TRUST YOU.

OH, WAITER. I'M
EXPECTING SOME PEOPLE.

242

IF ANYBODY ASKS FOR ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

243
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:14,754
YES, MONSIEUR.

244
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,391
RICK, I HOPE YOU'RE MORE
IMPRESSED WITH ME NOW.

245
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:22,228
IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME,
I'LL SHARE MY GOOD LUCK

ROULETTE WHEEL.

LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:05,390
I RECOGNIZE YOU FROM
THE NEWS PHOTOGRAPHS.

693
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:08,994
IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP,
ONE IS APT TO LOSE WEIGHT.

694
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:11,663
WE READ 5 TIMES
YOU WERE KILLED

695
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:12,831
IN 5 DIFFERENT
PLACES.

696
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,834
AS YOU SEE, IT WAS TRUE
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

697
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:17,769
THANK HEAVEN
I FOUND YOU, BERGER.

698
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:20,439
I'M LOOKING FOR
A MAN NAMED UGARTE.

699
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:22,341
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME.

700
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:24,376
UGARTE CANNOT EVEN
HELP HIMSELF.

701
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,378
HE'S UNDER ARREST
FOR MURDER.

702
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:29,848
HE WAS ARRESTED
HERE TONIGHT.

703
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:30,782
I SEE.

704
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,718
BUT WE
WHO ARE STILL FREE

705
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,353
WILL DO WHAT WE CAN.

706
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:36,321
WE ARE ORGANIZED,
MONSIEUR...

707
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,323
UNDERGROUND LIKE
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

708
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,659
TOMORROW NIGHT
THERE'S A MEETING.

709
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:41,727
IF YOU'LL COME--

710
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:44,430
Bartender: MONSIEUR.

711
00:30:51,872 --> 00:30:53,538
BRAVO!

712
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:54,205
BRAVO!

713
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,742
WILL YOU ASK
THE PIANO PLAYER

714
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,777
TO COME OVER HERE,
PLEASE?

715
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:01,380
VERY WELL,
MADEMOISELLE.

716
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,749
HOW'S THE JEWELRY
BUSINESS, BERGER?

717
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:04,783
NOT SO GOOD.
CHECK, PLEASE.

718
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,853
TOO BAD YOU WEREN'T HERE
EARLIER, MONSIEUR LASZLO.

719
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,821
WE HAD QUITE A BIT
OF EXCITEMENT,

720
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:10,922
DIDN'T WE, BERGER?

721
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,791
YES.
EXCUSE ME.

722
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:13,625
MY BILL.

723
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,829
NO. TWO CHAMPAGNE
COCKTAILS. PLEASE.

724
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:20,932
HELLO, SAM.

725
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,301
HELLO, MISS ILSA.

726
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:25,337
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

727
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,639
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

728
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:28,740
YES, MA'AM.

729
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:31,810
A LOT OF WATER
UNDER THE BRIDGE.

730
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:34,646
SOME OF THE OLD
SONGS, SAM.

731
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,749
YES, MA'AM.

732
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:40,586
[PLAYS PIANO]

733
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:46,325
WHERE IS RICK?

734
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,795
I DON'T KNOW.
I AIN'T SEEN HIM ALL NIGHT.

735
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,763
WHEN WILL HE
BE BACK?

736
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:53,899
NOT TONIGHT.
HE AIN'T COMIN'.

737
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,368
HE WENT HOME.

738
00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:59,738
DOES HE ALWAYS
LEAVE SO EARLY?

739
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:00,572
OH, HE NEVER--

740
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:03,742
HE'S GOT A GIRL
UP TO THE BLUE PARROT.

741
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,844
GOES UP THERE
ALL THE TIME.

742
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:09,681
YOU USED TO BE
A MUCH BETTER LIAR.

743
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:11,817
LEAVE HIM ALONE,
MISS ILSA.

744
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:14,653
YOU'RE BAD LUCK
TO HIM.

745
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:19,057
PLAY IT ONCE, SAM,
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

746
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:22,027
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN, MISS ILSA.

747
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,796
PLAY IT, SAM.

748
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:26,865
PLAY
<i>AS TIME GOES BY.</i>

749
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,836

I'M A LITTLE RUSTY ON IT.

750
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:33,839
I'LL HUM IT FOR YOU.

00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:48,513
YOU WERE ASKING
ABOUT RICK. HERE HE IS.

766
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,449
MADEMOISELLE,
MAY I PRESENT--

767
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:51,450
HELLO, ILSA.

768
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:52,284
HELLO, RICK.

769
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,819
YOU'VE ALREADY MET RICK,
MADEMOISELLE.

770
00:33:53,854 --> 00:33:55,120
THEN PERHAPS YOU ALSO--

771
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:56,988
THIS IS
MR. LASZLO.

772
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:57,989
HOW DO YOU DO?

773
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:00,725
ONE HEARS A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT RICK IN CASABLANCA.

774
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,961
AND ABOUT VICTOR LASZLO
EVERYWHERE.

775
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:05,697
WON'T YOU JOIN US
FOR A DRINK?

776
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:07,466
OH, NO. RICK NEVER--

777
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:08,333
THANKS. I WILL.

778
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,102
WELL...A PRECEDENT
IS BEING BROKEN. EMIL.

779
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,104
THIS IS A VERY
INTERESTING CAFE.

780
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,539
I CONGRATULATE YOU.

781
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,842
I CONGRATULATE YOU
FOR YOUR WORK.

782
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:18,577
THANK YOU. I TRY.

783
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:21,213
WE ALL TRY.
YOU SUCCEED.

784
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:23,114
I CAN'T GET OVER
YOU TWO.

785
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,983
SHE WAS ASKING
ABOUT YOU EARLIER

786
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,985
IN A WAY THAT MADE ME
EXTREMELY JEALOUS.

787
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,720
I WASN'T SURE
YOU WERE THE SAME.

788
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:30,822
THE LAST TIME WE MET--

789
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:33,091
IT WAS LA BELLE AURORE.

790
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:35,560
HOW NICE. YOU REMEMBERED.

791
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:38,697
THAT WAS THE DAY THE GERMANS
MARCHED INTO PARIS.

792
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:40,999
NOT AN EASY DAY
TO FORGET.

793
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,667
I REMEMBER
EVERY DETAIL.

794
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:46,505
THE GERMANS WORE GRAY.
YOU WORE BLUE.

795
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:48,807
YES. I PUT
THAT DRESS AWAY.

796
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:51,943
WHEN THE GERMANS MARCH
OUT, I'LL WEAR IT AGAIN.

797
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,912
RICKY, YOU'RE BECOMING
QUITE HUMAN.

798
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:57,516
I SUPPOSE WE HAVE
TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

799
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:58,550
ILSA,
IT'S LATE.

800
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:01,586
SO IT IS, AND WE HAVE
A CURFEW HERE IN CASABLANCA.

801
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:04,256
IT WOULD NEVER DO
FOR THE CHIEF OF POLICE

802
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,858
TO BE FOUND
DRINKING AFTER HOURS

803
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:07,692
AND HAVE TO FINE HIMSELF.

804
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,961
I HOPE WE DIDN'T
OVERSTAY OUR WELCOME.

805
00:35:09,996 --> 00:35:11,563
YOUR CHECK, SIR.

806
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:12,697
OH, IT'S MY PARTY.

807
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:13,899
ANOTHER PRECEDENT
GONE.

808
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:16,601
THIS HAS BEEN
A VERY INTERESTING EVENING.

809
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,803
I'LL CALL YOU A CAB.
GASOLINE RATIONING.

810
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:20,038
WE'LL
COME AGAIN.

811
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:20,705
ANY TIME.

812
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:22,841
SAY GOOD NIGHT
TO SAM FOR ME.

813
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:23,608
I WILL.

814
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:24,643
THERE'S STILL
NOBODY IN THE WORLD

815
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:28,780
WHO CAN PLAY
<i>AS TIME GOES BY</i> LIKE SAM.

816
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:31,917
HE HASN'T PLAYED IT
IN A LONG TIME.

817
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:34,252
GOOD NIGHT.

818
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,954
GOOD NIGHT.

819
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,756
GOOD NIGHT.

820
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:47,332
PUZZLING FELLOW, THIS RICK.
WHAT SORT IS HE?

821
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:48,667
I REALLY CAN'T SAY,

822
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,735
THOUGH I SAW HIM
QUITE OFTEN IN PARIS.

823
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,637
TOMORROW AT 10:00
AT THE PREFECT'S OFFICE.

824
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:55,741
WE'LL BE THERE.
GOOD NIGHT.

825
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,048
BOSS?

826
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,752
BOSS.

827
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:41,686
YEAH?

828
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:43,922
AIN'T YOU
GOING TO BED?

829
00:36:43,957 --> 00:36:45,023
NOT RIGHT NOW.

830
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:47,792
AIN'T YOU PLANNING ON GOING
TO BED IN THE NEAR FUTURE?

831
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:48,459
NO!

832
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:49,127
YOU EVER GOING
TO BED? NO!

833
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:51,196
WELL, I AIN'T SLEEPY
EITHER.

834
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:53,365
GOOD.
THEN HAVE A DRINK.

835
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
NO, NOT ME, BOSS.

836
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,235
THEN DON'T
HAVE A DRINK.

837
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,070
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

838
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:01,373
NO, SAM.
I'M WAITING FOR A LADY.

839
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:02,240
PLEASE, LET'S GO.

840
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,843
AIN'T NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
FOR YOU HERE.

841
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:07,679
SHE'S COMING BACK.
I KNOW SHE'S COMING BACK.

842
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,347
WE'LL DRIVE ALL NIGHT.
WE'LL GET DRUNK.

843
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:11,316
WE'LL GO FISHING AND STAY
AWAY TILL SHE'S GONE.

844
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,051
SHUT UP AND GO HOME.

845
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:16,755
NO, SIR.
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

846
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:23,228
THEY GRAB UGARTE,
THEN SHE WALKS IN.

847
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:25,864
WELL, THAT'S
THE WAY IT GOES.

848
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:28,099
ONE IN, ONE OUT.
SAM.

849
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,801
YES, BOSS.

850
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:32,237
IF IT'S DECEMBER 1941
IN CASABLANCA,

851
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:35,874
WHAT TIME IS IT
IN NEW YORK?

852
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:36,975
WHAT?

853
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,843
MY WATCH STOPPED.

854
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:41,012
I BET THEY'RE ASLEEP
IN NEW YORK.

855
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:45,384
I BET THEY'RE ASLEEP
ALL OVER AMERICA.

856
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:54,192
OF ALL THE GIN JOINTS
IN ALL THE TOWNS

857
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:56,161
IN ALL THE WORLD,

858
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:58,897
SHE WALKS INTO MINE.

859
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:05,804
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE PLAYING?

860
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,173
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING OF MY OWN.

861
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:08,874
WELL, STOP IT.

862
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,775
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO HEAR.

863
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,743
NO, I DON'T.

864
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,712
YOU PLAYED IT FOR HER,
YOU CAN PLAY IT FOR ME.

865
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,213
I DON'T THINK

1038
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:58,082
EVERYTHING SHE KNEW
OR EVER BECAME

1039
00:49:58,117 --> 00:49:58,916
WAS BECAUSE OF HIM.

1040
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:02,953
SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM
AND WORSHIPPED HIM

1041
00:50:02,988 --> 00:50:06,056
WITH A FEELING
SHE SUPPOSED WAS LOVE.

1042
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:08,759
YES. IT'S VERY PRETTY.
I HEARD A STORY ONCE.

1043
00:50:08,794 --> 00:50:11,662
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES
IN MY TIME.

1044
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:15,866
THEY WENT ALONG WITH THE SOUND
OF A TINNY PIANO

1045
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:17,701
PLAYING IN THE PARLOR
DOWNSTAIRS.

1046
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:22,173
"MISTER, I MET A MAN ONCE
WHEN I WAS A KID,"

1047
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,274
IT ALWAYS BEGINS.

1048
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:29,547
OH, I GUESS NEITHER ONE
OF OUR STORIES IS VERY FUNNY.

1049
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:32,650
TELL ME, WHO WAS IT
YOU LEFT ME FOR?

1050
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:36,754
WAS IT LASZLO, OR WERE THERE
OTHERS IN BETWEEN--

1051
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:40,792
OR AREN'T YOU
THE KIND THAT TELLS?

1052
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:55,940
[DOOR CLOSES]

1053
00:51:04,783 --> 00:51:05,882
I STRONGLY SUSPECT

1054
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:09,019
THAT UGARTE LEFT THE LETTERS
OF TRANSIT WITH MR. BLAINE.

1055
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,655
I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH THE CAFE
IMMEDIATELY AND THOROUGHLY.

1056
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,623
IF RICK HAS THE LETTERS,

1057
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:14,592
HE'S MUCH TOO SMART TO
LET YOU FIND THEM THERE.

1058
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:17,828
YOU GIVE HIM CREDIT
FOR TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS.

1059
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,730
HE'S JUST ANOTHER
BLUNDERING AMERICAN.

1060
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:22,266
WE MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE
AMERICAN BLUNDERING.

1061
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:23,801
I WAS WITH THEM

1062
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:26,804
WHEN THEY BLUNDERED
INTO BERLIN IN 1918.

1063
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:27,605
AS TO LASZLO,

1064
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,773
WE WANT HIM WATCHED
24 HOURS A DAY.

1065
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:33,911
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE.

1066
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:40,718
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

1067
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,686
I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU BOTH.

1068
00:51:42,721 --> 00:51:45,756
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST?

1069
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,924
I SLEPT VERY WELL.

1070
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:48,125
THAT'S STRANGE.
NOBODY'S SUPPOSED

1071
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,960
TO SLEEP WELL
IN CASABLANCA.

1072
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:52,596
MAY WE PROCEED
TO THE BUSINESS?

1073
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,632
WITH PLEASURE.
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

1074
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,800
VERY WELL.
LET'S NOT MINCE WORDS.

1075
00:51:56,835 --> 00:52:00,037
YOU ARE AN ESCAPED
PRISONER OF THE REICH.

1076
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:01,906
SO FAR YOU HAVE
ELUDED US.

1077
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:02,907
YOU HAVE REACHED
CASABLANCA.

1078
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:06,277
IT'S MY DUTY TO SEE THAT
YOU STAY IN CASABLANCA.

1079
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:08,913
WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUCCEED
IS PROBLEMATIC.

1080
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:10,548
CAPTAIN RENAULT'S
SIGNATURE

1081
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,850
IS NECESSARY
ON EVERY EXIT VISA.

1082
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:14,718
WILL HERR LASZLO
RECEIVE A VISA?

1083
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:17,021
I'M AFRAID NOT.
MY REGRETS, MONSIEUR.

1084
00:52:17,056 --> 00:52:20,591
PERHAPS I SHALL LIKE IT
IN CASABLANCA.

1085
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:21,825
AND
MADEMOISELLE?

1086
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,861
YOU NEEDN'T BE
CONCERNED ABOUT ME.

1087
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:25,329
IS THAT ALL
YOU WISH TO TELL US?

1088
00:52:25,364 --> 00:52:26,664
DON'T BE
IN SUCH A HURRY.

1089
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:27,731
YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

1090
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:30,267
YOU MAY BE IN CASABLANCA
INDEFINITELY,

1091
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:33,737
OR YOU MAY LEAVE
FOR LISBON TOMORROW

1092
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:35,039
ON ONE CONDITION.

1093
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:36,073
AND THAT IS?

1094
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:37,241
YOU KNOW THE LEADER

1095
00:52:37,276 --> 00:52:38,709
OF THE UNDERGROUND
MOVEMENT IN PARIS,

1096
00:52:38,744 --> 00:52:40,778
IN PRAGUE, IN BRUSSELS,
IN AMSTERDAM,

1097
00:52:40,813 --> 00:52:43,747
IN OSLO, IN BELGRADE,
AND ATHENS.

1098
00:52:43,782 --> 00:52:45,082
EVEN BERLIN.

1099
00:52:45,117 --> 00:52:46,183
YES, EVEN IN BERLIN.

1100
00:52:46,218 --> 00:52:48,652
IF YOU'LL FURNISH ME WITH
THEIR NAMES AND WHEREABOUTS,

1101
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,654
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR VISA
IN THE MORNING.

1102
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:53,357
AND THE HONOR OF HAVING
SERVED THE THIRD REICH.

1103
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:56,260
I WAS IN A GERMAN
CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR A YEAR.

1104
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:58,762
THAT'S HONOR ENOUGH
FOR A LIFETIME.

1105
00:52:58,797 --> 00:53:00,197
YOU'LL GIVE US
THE NAMES?

1106
00:53:00,232 --> 00:53:03,634
IF I DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO YOU
IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP,

1107
00:53:03,669 --> 00:53:06,337
WHERE YOU HAD
MORE PERSUASIVE METHODS

1108
00:53:06,372 --> 00:53:07,204
AT YOUR DISPOSAL,

1109
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,874
I CERTAINLY WON'T
GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW.

1110
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:13,243
WHAT IF YOU KILL THESE MEN?

1111
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:14,912
WHAT IF YOU
MURDERED ALL OF US?

1112
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:16,347
FROM EVERY CORNER
OF EUROPE, HUNDREDS,

1113
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,249
THOUSANDS WOULD RISE
TO TAKE OUR PLACES.

1114
00:53:19,284 --> 00:53:22,119
EVEN NAZIS CAN'T
KILL THAT FAST.

1115
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:24,388
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR ELOQUENCE

1116
00:53:24,423 --> 00:53:25,623
WHICH I NOW UNDERSTAND.

1117
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:28,125
BUT IN ONE RESPECT
YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

1118
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,128
YOU SAID THE REICH'S ENEMIES
COULD BE REPLACED.

1119
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:32,663
THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION.
NO ONE COULD REPLACE YOU

1120
00:53:32,698 --> 00:53:35,366
IF ANYTHING UNFORTUNATE
SHOULD OCCUR TO YOU

1121
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,801
WHILE YOU WERE
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1122
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:40,337
YOU WON'T DARE
TO INTERFERE WITH ME HERE.

1123
00:53:40,372 --> 00:53:42,039
THIS IS STILL
UNOCCUPIED FRANCE.

1124
00:53:42,074 --> 00:53:45,409
ANY VIOLATION OF NEUTRALITY
WOULD REFLECT ON RENAULT.

1125
00:53:45,444 --> 00:53:48,779
INSOFAR AS IT IS
IN MY POWER.

1126
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:49,813
THANK YOU.

1127
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:53,384
LAST NIGHT, YOU EVINCED
INTEREST IN SIGNOR UGARTE.

1128
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:54,018
YES.

1129
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:56,020
YOU HAVE
A MESSAGE FOR HIM.

1130
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:59,857
NOTHING IMPORTANT,
BUT MAY I SPEAK TO HIM NOW?

1131
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:02,159
YOU WOULD FIND
THE CONVERSATION

1132
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:04,094
A TRIFLE ONE-SIDED.

1133
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:06,364
SIGNOR UGARTE'S DEAD.

1134
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:13,704
I'M MAKING OUT
THE REPORT NOW.

1135
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:16,940
WE HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED
WHETHER HE COMMITTED SUICIDE

1136
00:54:16,975 --> 00:54:19,744
OR DIED
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1137
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:22,079
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH US?

1138
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:24,281
FOR THE TIME
BEING.

1139
00:54:24,316 --> 00:54:26,350
GOOD DAY.

1140
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:32,856
UNDOUBTEDLY THEIR NEXT STEP
WILL BE TO THE BLACK MARKET.

1141
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:36,760
ANOTHER VISA PROBLEM
HAS COME UP.

1142
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,395
SHOW HER IN.

1143
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,665
YES, SIR.

1144
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,408
SORRY. WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE POLICE.

1145
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:54,411
THIS IS A JOB
FOR SIGNOR FERRARI.

1146
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:56,847
IT CAN BE MOST HELPFUL
TO KNOW HIM.

1147
00:54:56,882 --> 00:54:59,383
HE HAS A MONOPOLY
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

1148
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:02,186
YOU'LL FIND HIM
AT THE BLUE PARROT.

1149
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,455
THANKS.

1150
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,501
DON'T BE TOO
DOWNHEARTED.

1151
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:20,204
PERHAPS YOU CAN
COME TO TERMS

1152
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:21,805
WITH CAPTAIN RENAULT.

1153
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,140
HELLO, FERRARI.

1154
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:24,341
GOOD MORNING,
RICK.

1155
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:25,442
I SEE THE BUS IS IN.

1156
00:55:25,477 --> 00:55:26,410
I'LL TAKE
MY SHIPMENT WITH ME.

1157
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:28,779
NO HURRY. I'LL HAVE IT
SENT OVER. HAVE A DRINK.

1158
00:55:28,814 --> 00:55:31,014
EVERY TIME YOU SEND
MY SHIPMENT OVER,

1159
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,349
IT'S ALWAYS
A LITTLE SHORT.

1160
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,785
CARRYING CHARGES,
MY BOY.

1161
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,753
HERE, SIT DOWN.

1162
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:39,857
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK OVER WITH YOU.

1163
00:55:39,892 --> 00:55:40,591
THE BOURBON.

1164
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:42,993
THE NEWS ABOUT UGARTE
UPSETS ME.

1165
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:43,994
YOU'RE A FAT HYPOCRITE.

1166
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:46,864
YOU DON'T FEEL ANY SORRIER
FOR UGARTE THAN I DO.

1167
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:47,665
OF COURSE NOT.

1168
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,299
WHAT UPSETS ME
IS THAT UGARTE'S DEAD,

1169
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:52,169
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THOSE
LETTERS OF TRANSIT ARE.

1170
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:53,470
PRACTICALLY NO ONE.

1171
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:55,405
IF I COULD
LAY MY HANDS ON THEM,

1172
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,272
I COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.

1173
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:58,408
SO COULD I, AND I'M
A POOR BUSINESSMAN.

1174
00:55:58,443 --> 00:55:59,376
I HAVE A PROPOSITION

1175
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:01,078
FOR WHOEVER HAS
THOSE LETTERS.

1176
00:56:01,113 --> 00:56:02,479
I'LL HANDLE
THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION,

1177
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:05,382
TAKE ALL THE RISK,
FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE.

1178
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:07,050
AND THE CARRYING
CHARGES?

1179
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:10,053
NATURALLY THERE WILL BE
A FEW INCIDENTAL EXPENSES.

1180
00:56:10,088 --> 00:56:11,455
THAT'S THE PROPOSITION
I HAVE

1181
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,056
FOR WHOEVER
HAS THOSE LETTERS.

1182
00:56:13,091 --> 00:56:14,525
I'LL TELL HIM
WHEN HE COMES IN.

1183
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,561
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHERE THOSE LETTERS ARE.

1184
00:56:17,596 --> 00:56:18,495
YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.

1185
00:56:18,531 --> 00:56:22,399
RENAULT AND STRASSER
PROBABLY THINK SO, TOO.

1186
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:27,838
THAT'S WHY
I CAME OVER HERE,

1187
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:30,207
TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO RANSACK MY PLACE.

1188
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:32,910
DON'T BE A FOOL. TAKE ME
INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE.

1189
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:33,644
YOU NEED A PARTNER.

1190
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,547
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE GETTING BACK.

1191
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,116
GOOD MORNING.

1192
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:43,354
SIGNOR FERRARI'S
THE FAT GENT AT THE TABLE.

1193
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:50,894
YOU WILL NOT FIND A TREASURE
LIKE THIS IN ALL MOROCCO.

1194
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:52,296
ONLY 700 FRANCS.

1195
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:53,430
YOU'RE BEING CHEATED.

1196
00:56:53,465 --> 00:56:54,965
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THANK YOU.

1197
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,966
THE LADY'S A FRIEND
OF RICK'S.

1198
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:58,435
FOR FRIENDS OF RICK'S,
WE HAVE A SMALL DISCOUNT.

1199
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,503
DID I SAY 700?

1200
00:56:59,538 --> 00:57:01,371
YOU CAN HAVE IT
FOR 200.

1201
00:57:01,406 --> 00:57:03,473
I'M SORRY I WAS
IN NO CONDITION

1202
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:05,175
TO RECEIVE YOU
LAST NIGHT.

1203
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,410
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1204

1205
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:09,279
A SPECIAL DISCOUNT--
100 FRANCS.

1206
00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:12,015
YOUR STORY HAD ME
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

1207
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,383
MAYBE IT WAS THE BOURBON.

1208
00:57:13,418 --> 00:57:15,252
I HAVE SOME TABLECLOTHS,
SOME NAPKINS.

1209
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:16,420
THANK YOU.
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

1210
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,088
PLEASE, ONE MINUTE.

1211
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:19,356
WHY DID YOU COME BACK,

1212
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:21,158
TO TELL ME WHY
YOU RAN OUT ON ME

1213
00:57:21,193 --> 00:57:22,893
AT THE RAILWAY STATION.

1214
00:57:22,928 --> 00:57:23,794
YES.

1215
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:26,163
YOU CAN TELL ME NOW.
I'M REASONABLY SOBER.

1216
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:27,097
I DON'T THINK I WILL.

1217
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:30,500
WHY NOT? I GOT STUCK
WITH THE RAILWAY TICKET.

1218

I THINK I'M ENTITLED
TO KNOW.

1219
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,538
LAST NIGHT, I SAW WHAT
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.

1220

IN PARIS,

1221

HE WOULD UNDERSTAND.

CASABLANCA SOON.

EACH OTHER AGAIN.

THOSE DAYS

1229

WHAT OF IT?

1541
01:11:34,245 --> 01:11:36,079
ISN'T IT STRANGE
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS

1542
01:11:36,114 --> 01:11:37,714
FIGHTING ON THE SIDE
OF THE UNDERDOG?

1543
01:11:37,749 --> 01:11:39,482
YES. I FOUND THAT
AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY, TOO,

1544
01:11:39,517 --> 01:11:41,918
BUT I NEVER WAS
MUCH OF A BUSINESSMAN.

1545
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:44,954
WOULD YOU APPRECIATE AN
OFFER OF 100,000 FRANCS?

1546
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:48,157
YES, I'D APPRECIATE IT,

THE SAME.

01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:10,820
YOU'RE A COWARD
AND A WEAKLING.

1706
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,756
NO. NO, RICHARD.
I'M SORRY.

1707
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:18,861
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU
ARE OUR LAST HOPE.

1708
01:21:18,896 --> 01:21:20,029
IF YOU DON'T HELP US,

1709
01:21:20,064 --> 01:21:21,864
VICTOR LASZLO
WILL DIE IN CASABLANCA.

1710
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:25,334
WHAT OF IT? I'M GOING
TO DIE IN CASABLANCA.

1711
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:28,337
IT'S A GOOD SPOT FOR IT.

1712
01:21:33,043 --> 01:21:35,478
NOW, IF YOU--

1713
01:21:35,746 --> 01:21:39,581
ALL RIGHT, I TRIED
TO REASON WITH YOU.

1714
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:41,650
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

1715
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:43,352
NOW I WANT
THOSE LETTERS.

1716
01:21:43,387 --> 01:21:44,186
GET THEM FOR ME.

1717
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:47,490
I DON'T HAVE TO.
I GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.

1718
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:51,360
PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.

1719
01:21:51,395 --> 01:21:52,761
NO.

1720
01:21:52,796 --> 01:21:56,031
FOR THE LAST TIME,
PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.

1721
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:59,068
IF LASZLO AND THE CAUSE
MEAN SO MUCH,

1722
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:01,036
YOU WON'T STOP AT ANYTHING.

1723
01:22:01,071 --> 01:22:05,808
ALL RIGHT. I'LL
MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU.

1724
01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:08,544
GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.

1725
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:11,981
YOU'LL BE
DOING ME A FAVOR.

1726
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:17,052
RICHARD.

1727
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:19,722
I TRIED TO STAY AWAY.

1728
01:22:19,757 --> 01:22:23,359
I THOUGHT I WOULD
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,

1729
01:22:23,394 --> 01:22:27,330
THAT YOU WERE
OUT OF MY LIFE.

1730
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:50,386
THE DAY
YOU LEFT PARIS...

1731
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:53,655
IF YOU KNEW WHAT
I WENT THROUGH.

1732
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:56,759
IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
I LOVED YOU.

1733
01:22:56,794 --> 01:23:01,497
HOW MUCH
I STILL LOVE YOU.

1734
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:15,844
AND THEN?

1735
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:18,847
IT WASN'T LONG
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED

1736
01:23:18,882 --> 01:23:21,583
THAT VICTOR WENT BACK
TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

1737
01:23:21,618 --> 01:23:23,085
THEY NEEDED HIM
IN PRAGUE,

1738
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,988
BUT THERE THE GESTAPO
WERE WAITING FOR HIM.

1739
01:23:26,023 --> 01:23:27,489
JUST A 2-LINE ITEM
IN THE PAPER,

1740
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:28,557
"VICTOR LASZLO
APPREHENDED.

1741
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:31,026
SENT TO
CONCENTRATION CAMP."

1742
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:32,194
I WAS FRANTIC.

1743
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:35,531
FOR MONTHS
I TRIED TO GET WORD.

1744
01:23:35,566 --> 01:23:36,332
THEN IT CAME.

1745
01:23:36,367 --> 01:23:39,535
HE WAS DEAD--
SHOT TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1746
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:41,770
I WAS LONELY.
I HAD NOTHING--

1747
01:23:41,805 --> 01:23:43,138
NOT EVEN HOPE.

1748
01:23:43,173 --> 01:23:44,673
THEN I MET YOU.

1749
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,508
WHY WEREN'T YOU
HONEST WITH ME?

1750
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:49,912
WHY DID YOU KEEP
YOUR MARRIAGE A SECRET?

1751
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:51,013
IT WASN'T MY SECRET.

1752
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:52,648
VICTOR WANTED IT
THAT WAY.

1753
01:23:52,683 --> 01:23:54,116
OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS
DIDN'T KNOW.

1754
01:23:54,151 --> 01:23:57,920
HE WANTED TO PROTECT ME.
I KNEW ABOUT HIS WORK.

1755
01:23:57,955 --> 01:24:00,189
IF THE GESTAPO KNEW
I WAS HIS WIFE,

1756
01:24:00,224 --> 01:24:01,557
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
FOR ME

1757
01:24:01,592 --> 01:24:02,825
AND FOR THOSE
WORKING WITH US.

1758
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:06,228
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
FIND OUT HE WAS ALIVE?

1759
01:24:06,263 --> 01:24:08,030
JUST BEFORE YOU AND I

1760
01:24:08,065 --> 01:24:09,965
WERE TO
LEAVE PARIS TOGETHER.

1761
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,234
A FRIEND TOLD ME
VICTOR WAS ALIVE.

1762
01:24:12,269 --> 01:24:14,236
THEY WERE HIDING HIM
IN A FREIGHT CAR

1763
01:24:14,271 --> 01:24:16,238
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF PARIS.

1764
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:18,207
HE WAS SICK.
HE NEEDED ME.

1765
01:24:18,242 --> 01:24:21,743
I WANTED TO TELL YOU,
BUT I DIDN'T DARE.

1766
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:24,713
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT PARIS

1767
01:24:24,748 --> 01:24:27,850
AND THE GESTAPO
WOULD HAVE CAUGHT YOU.

1768
01:24:27,885 --> 01:24:31,821
SO I...WELL,
YOU KNOW THE REST.

1769
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:36,658
WELL, IT'S STILL
A STORY WITHOUT AN ENDING.

1770
01:24:36,693 --> 01:24:38,794
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

1771
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:40,162
NOW?

1772
01:24:40,197 --> 01:24:41,029
I DON'T KNOW.

1773
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:45,067
I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER
HAVE THE STRENGTH

1774
01:24:45,102 --> 01:24:46,902
TO LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

1775
01:24:46,937 --> 01:24:48,871
AND LASZLO?

1776
01:24:48,906 --> 01:24:50,105
YOU'LL HELP HIM,
WON'T YOU?

1777
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,274
YOU'LL SEE
THAT HE GETS OUT.

1778
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:53,842
THEN HE'LL HAVE
HIS WORK--

1779
01:24:53,877 --> 01:24:56,111
ALL THAT HE'S
BEEN LIVING FOR.

1780
01:24:56,146 --> 01:24:57,779
ALL EXCEPT ONE.

1781
01:24:57,814 --> 01:25:00,916
HE WON'T HAVE YOU.

1782
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:04,953
I CAN'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE.

1783
01:25:04,988 --> 01:25:07,589
I RAN AWAY
FROM YOU ONCE.

1784
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:10,125
I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

1785
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:13,962
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT ANY LONGER.

1786
01:25:13,997 --> 01:25:17,165
YOU HAVE TO THINK
FOR BOTH OF US,

1787
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,002
FOR ALL OF US.

1788
01:25:22,973 --> 01:25:24,273
ALL RIGHT.

1789
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:26,509
I WILL.

1790
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:32,014
HERE'S LOOKING
AT YOU, KID.

1791
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:36,652
I WISH I DIDN'T
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1792
01:25:48,165 --> 01:25:49,898
I THINK
WE LOST THEM.

1793
01:25:49,933 --> 01:25:53,201
YES. I'M AFRAID THEY CAUGHT
SOME OF THE OTHERS.

1794
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:55,671
COME INSIDE.
COME.

1795
01:25:57,341 --> 01:25:59,207
COME, MR. LASZLO.

1796
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:02,945
I WILL HELP YOU...
IMMEDIATELY.

1797
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,580
THANK YOU.

1798
01:26:06,183 --> 01:26:09,118
[VOICES]

1799
01:26:22,633 --> 01:26:23,532
CARL, WHAT HAPPENED?

1800
01:26:23,568 --> 01:26:26,868
THE POLICE BREAK UP
OUR MEETING, HERR RICK.

1801
01:26:26,903 --> 01:26:29,171
WE ESCAPED
IN THE LAST MOMENT.

1802
01:26:29,206 --> 01:26:30,038
COME UP HERE.

1803
01:26:30,074 --> 01:26:33,075
TURN OUT THE LIGHT
IN THE REAR ENTRANCE.

1804
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,643
IT MIGHT
ATTRACT THE POLICE.

1805
01:26:34,678 --> 01:26:36,678
SACHA ALWAYS
PUTS IT OUT.

1806
01:26:36,713 --> 01:26:37,913
TONIGHT HE FORGOT.

1807
01:26:37,948 --> 01:26:40,783
I WILL DO IT.

1808
01:26:46,757 --> 01:26:50,058
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE MISS LUND HOME.

1809
01:26:50,093 --> 01:26:51,827
YES, SIR.

1810
01:27:01,204 --> 01:27:03,171
IT'S NOTHING.
JUST A LITTLE CUT.

1811
01:27:03,206 --> 01:27:05,273
WE HAD TO GET
THROUGH A WINDOW.

1812
01:27:05,308 --> 01:27:07,776
THIS MIGHT
COME IN HANDY.

1813
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:09,111
THANK YOU.

1814
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:11,246
HAD A CLOSE ONE, EH?

1815
01:27:11,281 --> 01:27:12,714
YES, RATHER.

1816
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:16,318
DON'T YOU SOMETIMES WONDER
IF IT'S WORTH ALL THIS?

1817
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:19,154
I MEAN, WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR.

1818
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:21,356
YOU MIGHT AS WELL QUESTION
WHY WE BREATHE.

1819
01:27:21,391 --> 01:27:23,825
IF WE STOP BREATHING,
WE'LL DIE.

1820
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,361
IF WE STOP FIGHTING OUR
ENEMIES, THE WORLD WILL DIE.

1821
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:28,864
WHAT OF IT? IT'LL BE
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

1822
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:29,898
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SOUND?

1823
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:33,168
LIKE A MAN TRYING TO CONVINCE
HIMSELF OF SOMETHING

1824
01:27:33,203 --> 01:27:35,904
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN HIS HEART.

1825
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:39,975
EACH OF US HAS A DESTINY--
FOR GOOD OR EVIL.

1826
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,243
I GET THE POINT.

1827
01:27:41,278 --> 01:27:42,277
I WONDER IF YOU DO.

1828
01:27:42,313 --> 01:27:45,914
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO ESCAPE FROM YOURSELF?

1829
01:27:45,949 --> 01:27:47,115
YOU'LL NEVER SUCCEED.

1830
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,951
YOU SEEM TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT MY DESTINY.

1831
01:27:49,986 --> 01:27:53,855
I KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE
ABOUT YOU THAN YOU SUSPECT.

1832
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:57,225
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.

1833
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,259
IT'S PERHAPS
A STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE

1834
01:27:58,295 --> 01:28:01,363
THAT WE BOTH SHOULD BE
IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN.

1835
01:28:01,398 --> 01:28:03,899
THE FIRST EVENING
I CAME TO THIS CAFE,

1836
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:07,202
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
BETWEEN YOU AND ILSA.

1837
01:28:07,237 --> 01:28:11,073
SINCE NO ONE'S TO BLAME,
I DEMAND NO EXPLANATION.

1838
01:28:11,108 --> 01:28:12,441
I ASK ONLY ONE THING.

1839
01:28:12,476 --> 01:28:15,210
YOU WON'T GIVE ME
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

1840
01:28:15,245 --> 01:28:18,113
ALL RIGHT, BUT I
WANT MY WIFE TO BE SAFE.

1841
01:28:18,148 --> 01:28:23,018
I ASK YOU TO USE THE LETTERS
TO TAKE HER AWAY.

1842
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,419
YOU LOVE HER
THAT MUCH?

1843
01:28:24,454 --> 01:28:29,024
YOU THINK OF ME
ONLY AS A LEADER OF A CAUSE.

1844
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:30,992
I'M ALSO A HUMAN BEING.

1845
01:28:31,027 --> 01:28:34,263
YES, I LOVE HER THAT MUCH.

1846
01:28:39,503 --> 01:28:41,069
MONSIEUR LASZLO?

1847
01:28:41,104 --> 01:28:42,070
YES?

1848
01:28:42,105 --> 01:28:45,173
COME WITH US. WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

1849
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,174
ON WHAT CHARGE?

1850
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:48,276
CAPTAIN RENAULT WILL
DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU LATER.

1851
01:28:48,311 --> 01:28:52,247
IT SEEMS THAT DESTINY
HAS TAKEN A HAND.

1852
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:04,526
YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T
ANY ACTUAL PROOF.

1853
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,129
THIS ISN'T GERMANY
OR OCCUPIED FRANCE.

1854
01:29:07,164 --> 01:29:10,098
YOU CAN ONLY FINE HIM
AND GIVE HIM 30 DAYS.

1855
01:29:10,133 --> 01:29:11,533
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
LET HIM GO NOW.

1856
01:29:11,568 --> 01:29:13,168
I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO BE
TOO INTERESTED

1857
01:29:13,203 --> 01:29:14,436
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO LASZLO.

1858
01:29:14,471 --> 01:29:15,337
IF YOU HELPED HIM
ESCAPE--

1859
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:19,074
WHY WOULD I STICK
MY NECK OUT FOR LASZLO?

1860
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:21,243
1--YOU BET 10,000 FRANCS
HE'D ESCAPE.

1861
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:23,345
2--YOU'VE GOT
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

1862
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,113
DON'T BOTHER TO DENY IT.

1863
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:26,214
AND YOU MIGHT DO IT

1864
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:28,416
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
STRASSER'S LOOKS.

1865
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:29,551
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1866
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:30,886
I DON'T LIKE THEM,
EITHER.

1867
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:31,720
THEY'RE ALL
EXCELLENT REASONS.

1868
01:29:31,755 --> 01:29:33,121
DON'T COUNT TOO MUCH
ON MY FRIENDSHIP.

1869
01:29:33,156 --> 01:29:35,524
IN THIS MATTER,
I'M POWERLESS.

1870
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:37,325
BESIDES, I MIGHT LOSE
THE 10,000 FRANCS.

1871
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,996
YOU'RE NOT VERY SUBTLE,
BUT YOU ARE EFFECTIVE.

1872
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:42,064
I GET THE POINT.

1873
01:29:42,099 --> 01:29:46,201
YES, I HAVE THE LETTERS.
I INTEND USING THEM MYSELF.

1874
01:29:46,236 --> 01:29:49,271
I'M LEAVING CASABLANCA
ON THE LAST PLANE TONIGHT.

1875
01:29:49,306 --> 01:29:53,074
I'M TAKING A FRIEND--
ONE YOU'LL APPRECIATE.

1876
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:54,109
WHAT FRIEND?

1877
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:55,110
ILSA LUND.

1878
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:57,546
THAT SHOULD PUT YOUR MIND
TO REST ABOUT LASZLO--

1879
01:29:57,581 --> 01:30:01,316
THE LAST MAN I WANT
TO SEE IN AMERICA.

1880
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:03,451
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TELL ME THIS.

1881
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:05,887
YOU HAVE THE LETTERS
OF TRANSIT.

1882
01:30:05,922 --> 01:30:07,989
YOU CAN LEAVE
ANYTIME YOU PLEASE.

1883
01:30:08,024 --> 01:30:10,125
WHY ARE YOU STILL
INTERESTED

1884
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,393
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO LASZLO?

1885
01:30:11,428 --> 01:30:13,328
I'M NOT.
BUT I AM INTERESTED

1886
01:30:13,363 --> 01:30:15,831
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO ILSA AND ME.

1887
01:30:15,866 --> 01:30:17,465
WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT
TO GO, THAT'S TRUE,

1888
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,303
BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD
IN SPITE OF THEIR RIGHTS.

1889
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:23,071
WHY SHOULD
WE HOLD YOU?

1890
01:30:23,106 --> 01:30:24,172
ILSA'S LASZLO'S WIFE.

1891
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:28,443
SHE PROBABLY KNOWS THINGS
STRASSER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

1892
01:30:28,478 --> 01:30:29,444
I'LL MAKE A DEAL.

1893
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:31,947
INSTEAD OF THIS PETTY CHARGE,
GET SOMETHING BIG

1894
01:30:31,982 --> 01:30:35,050
THAT WOULD CHUCK HIM IN
A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR YEARS.

1895
01:30:35,085 --> 01:30:38,119
IT'D BE QUITE A FEATHER
IN YOUR CAP, WOULDN'T IT?

1896
01:30:38,154 --> 01:30:39,254
IT CERTAINLY WOULD.

1897
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:41,456
GERMANY--VICHY
WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.

1898
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:42,490
THEN RELEASE HIM.

1899
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:45,994
BE AT MY PLACE A HALF HOUR
BEFORE THE PLANE LEAVES.

1900
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:47,229
I'LL HAVE LASZLO COME THERE

1901
01:30:47,264 --> 01:30:49,231
TO PICK UP
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT--

1902
01:30:49,266 --> 01:30:50,432
THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE CRIMINAL
GROUNDS FOR ARREST.

1903
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:53,068
YOU GET HIM,
AND WE GET AWAY.

1904
01:30:53,103 --> 01:30:56,872
TO THE GERMANS, THAT LAST ONE
WILL BE JUST A MINOR ANNOYANCE.

1905
01:30:56,907 --> 01:30:59,641
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.

1906
01:30:59,676 --> 01:31:02,177
MISS LUND--SHE'S
VERY BEAUTIFUL, YES,

1907
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:05,247
BUT YOU WERE NEVER
INTERESTED IN ANY WOMAN.

1908
01:31:05,282 --> 01:31:07,182
SHE ISN'T
JUST ANY WOMAN.

1909
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:11,086
I SEE. HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD?

1910
01:31:11,121 --> 01:31:13,255
I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS
RIGHT NOW WITH LASZLO

1911
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:14,356
IN THE VISITORS' PEN.

1912
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:15,624
RICKY,
I'LL MISS YOU.

1913
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:16,992
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN CASABLANCA

1914
01:31:17,027 --> 01:31:19,094
WHO HAS EVEN LESS
SCRUPLES THAN I.

1915
01:31:19,129 --> 01:31:20,161
THANKS.

1916
01:31:20,196 --> 01:31:21,095
GO AHEAD, RICKY.

1917
01:31:21,131 --> 01:31:24,065
CALL OFF YOUR WATCHDOGS
WHEN YOU LET HIM GO.

1918
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,034
I DON'T WANT THEM AROUND
THIS AFTERNOON.

1919
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:29,538
I'M TAKING NO CHANCES,
NOT EVEN WITH YOU.

1920
01:31:35,478 --> 01:31:37,045
SHALL WE
DRAW UP PAPERS,

1921
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,114
OR IS A HANDSHAKE
GOOD ENOUGH?

1922
01:31:39,149 --> 01:31:40,282
CERTAINLY
NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

1923
01:31:40,317 --> 01:31:42,517
BUT SINCE I'M IN A
HURRY, IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

1924
01:31:42,552 --> 01:31:45,253
AH, TO LEAVE CASABLANCA
AND GO TO AMERICA--

1925
01:31:45,288 --> 01:31:46,454
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

1926
01:31:46,489 --> 01:31:49,090
BY THE WAY,
MY AGREEMENT WITH SAM

1927
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:51,459
IS THAT HE GETS
25% OF THE PROFITS.

1928
01:31:51,494 --> 01:31:54,562
I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S 10%,
BUT HE'S WORTH 25.

1929
01:31:54,597 --> 01:31:57,632
ABDUL, CARL, AND SACHA
STAY, OR I DON'T SELL.

1930
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:01,169
OF COURSE. RICK'S WOULDN'T
BE RICK'S WITHOUT THEM.

1931
01:32:01,204 --> 01:32:02,370
WELL, SO LONG.

1932
01:32:02,405 --> 01:32:03,972
DON'T FORGET,
YOU OWE RICK'S

1933
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:05,941
100 CARTONS OF
AMERICAN CIGARETTES.

1934
01:32:05,976 --> 01:32:10,012
I SHALL REMEMBER
TO PAY IT TO MYSELF.

1935
01:32:27,664 --> 01:32:30,499
[BANGING ON DOOR]

1936
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:44,045
YOU'RE LATE.

1937
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,846
I WAS INFORMED

1938
01:32:44,881 --> 01:32:46,414
JUST AS LASZLO WAS
LEAVING THE HOTEL,

1939
01:32:46,449 --> 01:32:47,582
SO I KNEW
I'D BE ON TIME.

1940
01:32:47,617 --> 01:32:49,417
I ASKED YOU TO TIE UP
YOUR WATCHDOGS.

1941
01:32:49,452 --> 01:32:50,318
HE WON'T BE
FOLLOWED HERE.

1942
01:32:50,353 --> 01:32:52,020
THIS PLACE WON'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

1943
01:32:52,055 --> 01:32:53,555
I KNOW, BUT I'VE ALREADY
SPOKEN TO FERRARI.

1944
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,256
YOU'LL STILL
WIN AT ROULETTE.

1945
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,725
IS EVERYTHING READY?

1946
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:57,659
I HAVE
THE LETTERS.

1947
01:32:57,695 --> 01:33:01,096
WHEN WE SEARCHED THE PLACE,
WHERE WERE THEY?

1948
01:33:01,131 --> 01:33:01,930
SAM'S PIANO.

1949
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:04,332
SERVES ME RIGHT
FOR NOT BEING MUSICAL.

1950
01:33:04,367 --> 01:33:05,367
[BRAKES SQUEAL]

1951
01:33:05,402 --> 01:33:06,534
HERE THEY ARE.

1952
01:33:06,569 --> 01:33:09,504
YOU'D BETTER
WAIT IN MY OFFICE.

1953
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,480
HERE.

1954
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:20,715
RICHARD, VICTOR THINKS
I'M LEAVING WITH HIM.

1955
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,384
HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HIM?

1956
01:33:22,419 --> 01:33:23,251
NO, NOT YET.

1957
01:33:23,287 --> 01:33:25,520
IT'S ALL RIGHT?
YOU ARRANGED EVERYTHING?

1958
01:33:25,555 --> 01:33:26,554
YES. WE'LL TELL HIM
AT THE AIRPORT.

1959
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:29,257
THE LESS TIME TO THINK,
THE EASIER FOR ALL OF US.

1960
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,993
PLEASE TRUST ME.

1961
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:35,130
YES, I WILL.

1962
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:40,135
MONSIEUR BLAINE, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

1963
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:43,638
SAVE IT. WE'VE LOTS
OF THINGS TO DO.

1964
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,440
I BROUGHT
THE MONEY.

1965
01:33:45,475 --> 01:33:48,243
KEEP IT. YOU'LL
NEED IT IN AMERICA.

1966
01:33:48,278 --> 01:33:49,611
BUT WE
MADE A DEAL.

1967
01:33:49,646 --> 01:33:52,580
NEVER MIND. WILL YOU
HAVE TROUBLE IN LISBON?

1968
01:33:52,615 --> 01:33:53,514
NO. IT'S ALL ARRANGED.

1969
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:57,085
GOOD. THE LETTERS ARE
ALL MADE OUT IN BLANK.

1970
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,187
JUST FILL IN
THE SIGNATURES.

1971
01:33:59,222 --> 01:34:00,622

1972
01:34:00,657 --> 01:34:03,792
VICTOR LASZLO,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST...

1973
01:34:06,563 --> 01:34:07,695
ON THE CHARGE
OF ACCESSORY

1974
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:08,496
TO THE MURDER
OF THE COURIERS

1975
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:10,532
FROM WHOM THESE LETTERS
WERE STOLEN.

1976
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:13,201
YOU'RE SURPRISED
ABOUT MY FRIEND RICKY?

1977
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:15,236
THE EXPLANATION
IS QUITE SIMPLE.

LOVE, IT SEEMS, HAS
TRIUMPHED OVER VIRTUE.

1979
01:34:18,141 --> 01:34:19,207
NOT SO FAST, LOUIS.

01:34:19,242 --> 01:34:21,176
NOBODY IS GOING
TO BE ARRESTED,

1981
01:34:21,211 --> 01:34:22,777
NOT FOR A WHILE YET.

1982
01:34:22,812 --> 01:34:25,180
HAVE YOU TAKEN LEAVE
OF YOUR SENSES?

1983
01:34:25,215 --> 01:34:26,147
I HAVE.
SIT DOWN.

1984
01:34:26,182 --> 01:34:27,482
I WOULDN'T LIKE
TO SHOOT YOU,

1985
01:34:27,517 --> 01:34:29,217
BUT I WILL IF YOU
TAKE ONE MORE STEP.

1986
01:34:29,252 --> 01:34:33,588
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I WILL SIT DOWN.

1987
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:36,724

ON THE TABLE.

01:34:36,759 --> 01:34:39,861

WHAT THIS MEANS.

1989
01:34:39,896 --> 01:34:41,796
I DO. WE'LL DISCUSS
THAT LATER.

01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:42,730
"CALL OFF YOUR
WATCHDOGS," YOU SAID.

1991
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:46,101

ME HEAR YOU TELL THEM.

RIGHT AT YOUR HEART.

YES, SIR.

2018
01:36:09,385 --> 01:36:12,253
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
YOU FILL IN THE NAMES.

2021

01:36:41,385 --> 01:36:45,220

2036
01:36:45,255 --> 01:36:46,521
ISN'T THAT TRUE, LOUIS?

2037

WHY DON'T WE JUST GET HER
A POP-UP TOASTER?

2201
03:39:43,422 --> 03:39:48,025

A MAJOR IRRITATION...

03:49:57,969 --> 03:50:01,204
HMM. MISS KENTON, IF YOU WOULD
STOP TO THINK FOR A MOMENT,

2347
03:50:01,239 --> 03:50:04,741
YOU WOULD REALIZE
HOW INAPPROPRIATE IT IS...

2348
03:50:04,776 --> 03:50:09,312
FOR ONE, SUCH AS YOURSELF,
TO ADDRESS AS "WILLIAM"
SOMEONE SUCH AS MY FATHER.

2349
03:50:09,347 --> 03:50:14,184
WELL, I'M SURE, MR. STEVENS,
IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GALLING
FOR YOUR FATHER...

2350
03:50:14,219 --> 03:50:18,021
TO BE CALLED "WILLIAM"
BY ONE SUCH AS MYSELF.

2351
03:50:18,056 --> 03:50:20,690
<i>MISS KENTON, ALL I AM SAYING</i>
<i>IS THAT MY FATHER IS A PERSON</i>
<i>FROM WHOM,</i>

2352
03:50:20,725 --> 03:50:24,027
IF YOU WISH
TO BE MORE OBSERVANT,
YOU MAY LEARN MANY THINGS.

2353
03:50:24,062 --> 03:50:26,029
I'M MOST GRATEFUL FOR
YOUR ADVICE, MR. STEVENS,

2354
03:50:26,064 --> 03:50:29,265
BUT DO PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT MARVELOUS THINGS MIGHT
I LEARN FROM YOUR FATHER?

2355
03:50:29,300 --> 03:50:31,668
I MIGHT POINT OUT
THAT YOU ARE STILL...

2356
03:50:31,703 --> 03:50:34,571
OFTEN UNSURE OF WHAT GOES WHERE
AND WHICH ITEM IS WHICH.

2357
03:50:36,374 --> 03:50:40,176
I'M SURE MR. STEVENS, SR.,
IS VERY GOOD AT HIS JOB,

2358
03:50:40,211 --> 03:50:43,880
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU,
MR. STEVENS, THAT I AM
VERY GOOD AT MINE.

2359
03:50:43,915 --> 03:50:47,450
<i>- OH, OF COURSE.</i>
<i>- THANK YOU. AND NOW, IF YOU</i>
<i>WILL PLEASE EXCUSE ME.</i>

I'M SURE YOU SAID SOMETHING
WONDERFULLY WITTY, CHARLES,

SHARE WITH THE REST OF US,

AS ENOUGH TO HEAR YOU.

I SAID HOW THE SPROUTS

<i>- CRISP-LIKE, NOT MUSHY.</i>
<i>- "SPROUTS ARE DONE," CHARLES,</i>
<i>NOT "SPROUTS IS DONE."</i>

- ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GEORGE?
- YES, MR. STEVENS.

IN YOUR PROFESSION.

2375
03:51:34,466 --> 03:51:36,666
OH, YES, MR. STEVENS.
I'D LIKE TO BE A BUTLER,

2376
03:51:36,701 --> 03:51:38,668
TO BE CALLED MISTER
AND NOT CHARLIE,

2377
03:51:38,703 --> 03:51:42,872
AND SIT IN MY OWN PANTRY
BY MY OWN FIRE,
SMOKING MY CIGAR.

2378
03:51:42,907 --> 03:51:46,509
I WONDER IF YOU REALIZE
WHAT IT REALLY TAKES
TO BE A GREAT BUTLER?

TAKES DIGNITY,
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

03:51:49,380 --> 03:51:52,549
THANK YOU, MR. STEVENS.
DIGNITY, THAT'S RIGHT.

"...IN KEEPING

2385
03:52:05,363 --> 03:52:09,132
THERE WAS THIS
ENGLISH BUTLER IN INDIA.

2386
03:52:09,167 --> 03:52:11,801
ONE DAY HE GOES
IN THE DINING ROOM,

2387
03:52:11,836 --> 03:52:14,137
AND WHAT'S HE SEE
UNDER THE TABLE?

2388
03:52:14,172 --> 03:52:16,473
- A TIGER.

THREE GUNSHOTS.

WHY, THEY DON'T
THINK NOTHING OF IT,

MORNING, SIR.

2425
03:55:54,025 --> 03:55:56,225
I'VE INVITED

2426
03:55:56,260 --> 03:55:59,562
TO JOIN US
AS THE FRENCH DELEGATE.
HE'LL NEVER COME!

03:55:59,597 --> 03:56:02,065
I'M GLAD TO SAY
THAT I JUST HAD WORD
OF HIS ACCEPTANCE.

2428
03:56:02,100 --> 03:56:05,034
I SAY!
BUT DUPONT IS FANATICALLY
ANTI-GERMAN.

2429
03:56:05,069 --> 03:56:07,336
I REMEMBER A SPEECH
HE GAVE IN GENEVA IN '33...

2430
03:56:07,371 --> 03:56:10,673
THAT MADE ME ASHAMED TO BE SEEN
AS AN ALLY OF THE FRENCH.

2431
03:56:10,708 --> 03:56:12,709
I MEAN TO SAY, IT'S NOT
THE ENGLISH WAY OF CARRYING ON.

<i>NO, IT IS NOT.</i>
<i>AND IT IS PRECISELY</i>

<i>YES.</i>

YOUR HEAD OUTSIDE THIS DOOR

- IT WON'T TAKE A MOMENT.
- I WILL LOOK INTO THE MATTER
IN DUE COURSE, MISS KENTON.

2455
03:57:27,451 --> 03:57:29,519
YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE A FANTASY?

DUE TO MY INEXPERIENCE?

2457
03:57:32,723 --> 03:57:36,459
I'M BUSY IN THIS ROOM,

2463
03:58:52,036 --> 03:58:54,036
MISS KENTON, I WOULD ASK YOU
TO KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

2464
03:58:54,071 --> 03:58:57,974
WHAT WOULD THE OTHER
SERVANTS THINK TO HEAR US
SHOUTING ABOUT CHINAMEN?

2465
03:58:58,009 --> 03:59:00,142
I WOULD ASK YOU,
MR. STEVENS,

2466
03:59:00,177 --> 03:59:04,113
TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK
AT THE CHINAMAN.

2467
03:59:09,620 --> 03:59:11,587
IT IS A SMALL MISTAKE,
A TRIVIAL MISTAKE.

2468
03:59:11,622 --> 03:59:14,557
YOUR FATHER IS ENTRUSTED
WITH MORE THAN A MAN
OF HIS AGE CAN COPE WITH.

2469
03:59:14,592 --> 03:59:16,592
I'M CONCERNED FOR HIM.
MR. STEVENS.
PLEASE LET ME PASS.

2470
03:59:16,627 --> 03:59:19,962
MR. STEVENS, IT WAS YOUR
FATHER WHO LEFT THE DUSTPAN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

2471
03:59:19,997 --> 03:59:22,932
IT IS HE WHO IS LEAVING POLISH
ON THE CUTLERY. IT IS HE WHO
HAS CONFUSED THE CHINAMEN.

2472
03:59:22,967 --> 03:59:25,501
YOU MUST RECOGNIZE THIS
BEFORE HE COMMITS A MAJOR ERROR.

2473
03:59:25,536 --> 03:59:27,603
I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THIS, MISS KENTON.

2474
03:59:27,638 --> 03:59:31,941
I'M AFRAID I MUST, MR. STEVENS.
I'M GIVING YOU SERIOUS ADVICE.

2475
03:59:31,976 --> 03:59:37,446
YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE RELIEVED
OF A NUMBER OF HIS DUTIES
FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

2476
03:59:37,481 --> 03:59:42,251
WHATEVER YOUR FATHER ONCE WAS,
HE NO LONGER HAS THE SAME
ABILITY OR STRENGTHS.

2477
03:59:42,286 --> 03:59:45,621
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE,
MISS KENTON.

2478
03:59:45,656 --> 03:59:47,823

TO GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

03:59:47,858 --> 03:59:50,626

FROM YOUR BUSINESS, MR. STEVENS.

TO SEE ANYTHING OF THAT SORT
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN, DO WE?

<i>I MEAN, YOUR FATHER</i>
<i>COLLAPSING AND ALL THAT.</i>
<i>INDEED NOT, MY LORD.</i>

2512
04:01:44,308 --> 04:01:49,645
AND IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE,
AT ANY TIME.

2513
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:51,781
LOOK HERE, STEVENS. THE FIRST
OF THE FOREIGN DELEGATES...

2514
04:01:51,816 --> 04:01:54,083

YES, WE ARE
WELL PREPARED, MY LORD.
WELL, I'M SURE YOU ARE.

2516
04:01:57,455 --> 04:01:59,622
AND WHAT HAPPENS
WITHIN THIS HOUSE
DURING THE CONFERENCE...

2517
04:01:59,657 --> 04:02:03,959
COULD HAVE, UH, CONSIDERABLE
REPERCUSSIONS ON THE WHOLE
COURSE THAT EUROPE IS TAKING.

YES, IT MEANS
A GREAT DEAL.

2519
04:02:06,664 --> 04:02:09,832
AND I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU,
STEVENS, IT MEANS A GREAT
DEAL TO ME, PERSONALLY.

2520
04:02:09,867 --> 04:02:14,570
I HAD A GERMAN FRIEND,
KARL-HEINZ BREMANN.

2521
04:02:14,605 --> 04:02:17,740
WE FOUGHT ON OPPOSITE SIDES
IN THE WAR.

2522
04:02:17,775 --> 04:02:19,742
WE ALWAYS SAID WHEN THIS
WRETCHED BUSINESS IS OVER,

2523
04:02:19,777 --> 04:02:25,081
WE'LL SIT DOWN AND HAVE
A DRINK TOGETHER,
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

2524
04:02:25,116 --> 04:02:28,417
THE VERSAILLES TREATY
MADE A LIAR OF ME.

2525
04:02:28,452 --> 04:02:31,253
YES, A LIAR, STEVENS.

2526
04:02:31,288 --> 04:02:33,589
BECAUSE THE TERMS THAT WE,
THE VICTOR, IMPOSED...

2527
04:02:33,624 --> 04:02:35,791
WERE SO HARSH, THAT GERMANY
WAS SIMPLY FINISHED.

2528
04:02:35,826 --> 04:02:38,761
WELL, ONE DOESN'T DO THAT
TO A DEFEATED FOE.

2529
04:02:38,796 --> 04:02:42,131
NO, ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR
MAN ON THE CANVAS, THAT
OUGHT TO BE THE END OF IT.

2530
04:02:42,166 --> 04:02:47,269
MY FRIEND BREMANN WAS, UH,
RUINED BY INFLATION.

2533
04:02:53,811 --> 04:02:57,613
SHOT HIMSELF...
IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
BETWEEN HAMBURG AND BERLIN.

2534
04:02:57,648 --> 04:03:01,450
<i>WELL, EVER SINCE THAT TIME,</i>
<i>I FELT IT MY DUTY, MY JOB,</i>
<i>STEVENS,</i>

2535
04:03:01,485 --> 04:03:04,653
<i>TO HOLD OUT</i>
<i>A HELPING HAND TO GERMANY,</i>
<i>GIVE HER A FAIR CHANCE.</i>

2536
04:03:04,688 --> 04:03:07,123
SO, YOU SEE, STEVENS,
THIS CONFERENCE IS CRUCIAL,

2537
04:03:07,158 --> 04:03:10,726
AND WE REALLY CAN'T RUN
THE RISK OF ANY ACCIDENTS.

2538

IT ISN'T A QUESTION
OF YOUR FATHER LEAVING US.

2542
04:03:21,605 --> 04:03:24,573

YOU SCARED ME. WHERE
DID YOU COME FROM?

GOOD MORNING, SIR.

YOU'RE REALLY GETTING
THINGS GOING HERE.

3886
05:42:26,611 --> 05:42:29,913
THIS IS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
UM--

3887
05:42:29,948 --> 05:42:34,284
I'VE HAD TO ASK ANOTHER
THREE GIRLS FROM THE VILLAGE
TO COME UP, SIR.

3888
05:42:34,319 --> 05:42:37,954

I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT
THE HOUSE WILL BE READY...

A POSSIBLE NEW HOUSEKEEPER

EXCELLENT REFERENCES.

THAT BANQUET BACK IN '35.

DELIVERED OURSELVES

<i>ANYWAY, STEVENS?</i>

we'd have a bit of sun

how much you talked,

I was in attendance
when he had his appendectomy

and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

3942
05:47:17,367 --> 05:47:20,302
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

a lucky lawyer.

take him back.

The first time I rose
to make an objection,
my wig fell off.

05:50:18,515 --> 05:50:20,315
They've deprived me
of everything,

alcohol, tobacco,
female companionship.

4012
05:50:22,519 --> 05:50:23,885
If only they'd let me
function at my work

4013
05:50:23,920 --> 05:50:25,353
on something worthwhile.

4014
05:50:25,388 --> 05:50:27,355
Sorry, Sir Wilfrid.

4015
05:50:27,390 --> 05:50:28,823
Might as well get
a bigger box,
more mothballs,

4016
05:50:28,858 --> 05:50:30,325
put me away, too.

4017

get undressed and lie down.

prospect!

while on my sickbed,

4024
05:50:45,208 --> 05:50:47,876
I seriously considered
strangling you

with one of your own
rubber tubes?

4026
05:50:50,713 --> 05:50:52,180
I would then have
admitted the crime,

4027
05:50:52,215 --> 05:50:54,082
retained myself
for the defense.

05:50:56,619 --> 05:50:59,354

of justifiable homicide.

For four months,
this alleged angel of mercy

4031
05:51:05,094 --> 05:51:09,764
has pawed, probed,
punctured,

4032
05:51:09,799 --> 05:51:12,600
pillaged and plundered
my helpless body,

05:51:12,635 --> 05:51:16,538
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip
of baby talk.

4034
05:51:16,573 --> 05:51:19,541
Come along, now,
like a good boy. Oh, no!

4035
05:51:19,576 --> 05:51:20,942
You take your hands off me,
Miss Plimsoll,

4036
05:51:20,977 --> 05:51:22,444
or I'll strike you
with my cane.

4037
05:51:22,479 --> 05:51:24,446
Oh, you'd never do that.

4038
05:51:24,481 --> 05:51:26,047
You might break
your cigars.
Cigars? What cigars?

4039
05:51:26,082 --> 05:51:27,882
The ones you're smuggling
in your cane.

4040
05:51:27,917 --> 05:51:28,817
Cane?

4041
05:51:36,593 --> 05:51:40,061
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant
for my cane.

4042
05:51:40,096 --> 05:51:43,064
In hospital,
he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

4043
05:51:43,099 --> 05:51:45,800
We called him
Wilfrid the fox.

4044
05:51:45,835 --> 05:51:48,236
I'm confiscating these.

4045
05:51:48,271 --> 05:51:50,238
Can't I have just one?

4046
05:51:50,273 --> 05:51:51,940
No! Upstairs!

4047
05:51:53,776 --> 05:51:56,111
A few puffs after meals?
Please!

4048
05:51:57,514 --> 05:52:00,148
Well, I'll do it!

4049
05:52:00,183 --> 05:52:02,450
Some dark night
when her back is turned,
I'll snatch her thermometer

4050
05:52:02,485 --> 05:52:04,152
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades.

4051
05:52:04,187 --> 05:52:06,254
So help me, I will!

4052
05:52:06,289 --> 05:52:08,423
Oh, no, sir,
you mustn't walk up.

4053
05:52:08,458 --> 05:52:10,625
We've installed
something for you here.

4054
05:52:11,661 --> 05:52:13,428
It's a lift, sir.

4055
05:52:13,463 --> 05:52:15,597
A lift?
I'm getting sick
of this plot

4056
05:52:15,632 --> 05:52:17,098
to make me
a helpless invalid.

4057
05:52:17,133 --> 05:52:19,100
I think it's
a splendid idea.

4058
05:52:19,135 --> 05:52:21,002
Let's try it,
shall we?

4059
05:52:21,037 --> 05:52:22,971
Out of there.
I'll try it.

4060
05:52:23,006 --> 05:52:25,807
It's my lift,
because it was
my heart attack.

4061
05:52:25,842 --> 05:52:27,675
Here you are.

4062
05:52:27,710 --> 05:52:30,111
Simply press
this button for up,
and this one for down.

4063
05:52:30,146 --> 05:52:33,515
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption
should collapse...

4064
05:52:33,550 --> 05:52:36,218
If the barrister
should fall off
the banister...

4065
05:52:44,661 --> 05:52:46,628
This is remarkable, Carter.

4066
05:52:46,663 --> 05:52:49,197
Smoothest flight
I've had in years.
Upsy-daisy.

4067
05:52:49,232 --> 05:52:51,333
Once more,
to get the feel
of the controls.

4068
05:53:06,349 --> 05:53:07,815
Good afternoon,
Carter.

4069
05:53:07,850 --> 05:53:10,018
Would it be possible
to see Sir Wilfrid?

4070
05:53:10,053 --> 05:53:12,320
I'm sorry I didn't ring up
for an appointment,
but this is urgent.

4071
05:53:12,355 --> 05:53:14,155
If it's about a brief,
Mr. Mayhew,

4072
05:53:14,190 --> 05:53:15,390
I'm sorry,
but we're full up.

4073
05:53:15,425 --> 05:53:17,358
Sir Wilfrid has all
that he can handle.

4074
05:53:17,393 --> 05:53:19,661
I'm sure he'll want
this brief.

4075
05:53:19,696 --> 05:53:21,229
Serious criminal matter.

4076
05:53:24,233 --> 05:53:25,900
Absolutely not,
Mr. Mayhew.

4077
05:53:25,935 --> 05:53:27,869
Sir Wilfrid
is still convalescent.

4078
05:53:27,904 --> 05:53:29,337
He can't possibly
accept anything

4079
05:53:29,372 --> 05:53:31,573
of an over-stimulating
nature.

4080
05:53:31,608 --> 05:53:34,342
They've put me on a diet
of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

4081
05:53:34,377 --> 05:53:37,045
Hello, Wilfrid.
This is very distressing news
about your health.

4082
05:53:37,080 --> 05:53:39,047
Distressing?
It's tragic.

4083
05:53:39,082 --> 05:53:40,915
You better get yourself
a younger man
with younger arteries.

4084
05:53:40,950 --> 05:53:43,084
If you could just
give us a few minutes,
my client is here.

4085
05:53:43,119 --> 05:53:45,086
This is Mr. Leonard Vole.

4086
05:53:45,121 --> 05:53:47,021
He's in rather
a ghastly mess,
I'm afraid.

4087
05:53:47,056 --> 05:53:49,390
How do you do,
Mr. Vole?

4088
05:53:49,425 --> 05:53:51,859
Huh! Well, according
to Mr. Mayhew,

4089
05:53:51,894 --> 05:53:53,928
I--I'm not doing
at all well.

4090
05:53:53,963 --> 05:53:56,264
PLIMSOLL: Sir Wilfrid!
Sir Wilfrid!

4091
05:53:56,299 --> 05:53:58,232
You're dawdling again.

4092
05:53:58,267 --> 05:53:59,434
Oh, shut up!

4093
05:53:59,469 --> 05:54:02,036
Sorry, Mayhew.

4094
05:54:02,071 --> 05:54:04,272
Try me again some day
when you've something
not too stimulating,

4095
05:54:04,307 --> 05:54:06,608
like a postman
bitten by a stray dog.

4096
05:54:13,249 --> 05:54:16,050
Well, I wish you could
help us, Wilfrid,
but I quite understand.

4097
05:54:16,085 --> 05:54:17,619
Take care of yourself.

4098
05:54:19,489 --> 05:54:22,757
Mayhew! Mayhew!

4099
05:54:22,792 --> 05:54:25,760
CARTER: Oh, no.
Sir Wilfrid, please.

4100
05:54:25,795 --> 05:54:27,428
Don't worry, Carter,
we won't take the brief,

4101
05:54:27,463 --> 05:54:29,731
but Mr. Mayhew's an old friend
and he needs help.

4102
05:54:29,766 --> 05:54:31,899
Surely I can give him
a word of advice.

4103
05:54:31,934 --> 05:54:34,469
C-Come on, Mayhew,
I'll give you five minutes.

4104
05:54:34,504 --> 05:54:36,437
No, no, no, I don't want you,
just Mayhew.

4105
05:54:36,472 --> 05:54:37,739
Our nap!

4106
05:54:37,774 --> 05:54:39,240
Sir Wilfrid,
our nap!

4107
05:54:39,275 --> 05:54:41,643
You go ahead.
Start it without me.

4108
05:54:43,279 --> 05:54:44,612
This is your fault,
Mr. Carter.

4109
05:54:44,647 --> 05:54:46,080
You should not
have permitted it.

4110
05:54:46,115 --> 05:54:48,082
It is not
my fault.

4111
05:54:48,117 --> 05:54:50,118
I distinctly
told Sir Wilfrid,
"No criminal cases."

4112
05:54:50,153 --> 05:54:52,820
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

4113
05:54:52,855 --> 05:54:54,989
Seems silly to me,
but Mr. Mayhew thinks
it's very urgent.

4114
05:54:55,024 --> 05:54:57,425
He, uh, he thinks I may
be arrested at any minute.

4115
05:54:57,460 --> 05:54:59,761
Arrested for what?

4116
05:54:59,796 --> 05:55:01,929
Well, for murder.

4117
05:55:01,964 --> 05:55:04,098
Oh.

4118
05:55:04,133 --> 05:55:05,767
It's the case
of Mrs. Emily French.

4119
05:55:05,802 --> 05:55:07,835
You've probably
seen the reports
in the press.

4120
05:55:07,870 --> 05:55:10,004
She was a middle-aged widow,
rather well-off,

4121
05:55:10,039 --> 05:55:11,806
living with a housekeeper
at Hampstead.

4122
05:55:11,841 --> 05:55:14,442
Mr. Vole had been
with her earlier
in the evening.

4123
05:55:14,477 --> 05:55:17,278
When the housekeeper
returned from her day off,
she found her mistress dead,

4124
05:55:17,313 --> 05:55:19,313
struck on the back
of the head and killed.
I see.

4125
05:55:19,348 --> 05:55:20,948
Vole seems a harmless chap

4126
05:55:20,983 --> 05:55:22,617
caught in a web
of circumstantial evidence.

4127
05:55:22,652 --> 05:55:24,619
Perhaps if I were to give you
some more of the details,

4128
05:55:24,654 --> 05:55:27,121
you might suggest
the strongest line of defense.

4129
05:55:27,156 --> 05:55:29,323
I'd probably think
better if you gave me
one of those cigars.

4130
05:55:29,358 --> 05:55:30,958
Of course.

4131
05:55:30,993 --> 05:55:33,461
There are no previous
convictions, naturally.

4132
05:55:33,496 --> 05:55:35,963
He's a man of good character
with an excellent war record.
You'd like him a lot.

4133
05:55:35,998 --> 05:55:37,298
They've confiscated
the matches, too.

4134
05:55:37,333 --> 05:55:39,300
A light, please.
Give me a light.

4135
05:55:39,335 --> 05:55:40,968
As I see it,
the defense may turn

4136
05:55:41,003 --> 05:55:43,504
on establishing an alibi
for the night of the murder.

4137
05:55:43,539 --> 05:55:45,306
I'm sorry,
I haven't got any matches.
Let me get you some.

4138
05:55:45,341 --> 05:55:48,209
Lord, no.
You don't know
Miss Plimsoll.

4139
05:55:48,244 --> 05:55:50,512
This will take
all our cunning.

4140
05:55:55,852 --> 05:56:00,021
Young man,
you come here, please.

4141
05:56:00,056 --> 05:56:03,024
Uh, your solicitor and I
feel you may be able
to enlighten me

4142
05:56:03,059 --> 05:56:04,559
on a rather
important point.

4143
05:56:04,594 --> 05:56:06,327
Why, yes.
Thank you.
Really, Sir Wilfrid!

4144
05:56:06,362 --> 05:56:09,698
You're not in bed yet?
Upstairs!

4145
05:56:12,735 --> 05:56:14,068
Give me a match.

4146
05:56:14,103 --> 05:56:15,503
I'm sorry.
I never carry them.

4147
05:56:15,538 --> 05:56:17,071
What? You said
I'd like him.

4148
05:56:17,106 --> 05:56:18,539
But I do have
a lighter.

4149
05:56:18,574 --> 05:56:20,408
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him.

4150
05:56:20,443 --> 05:56:22,844
Thank you.

4151
05:56:22,879 --> 05:56:26,914
Can you imagine
Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

4152
05:56:26,949 --> 05:56:29,718
Then let's make
absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

4153
05:56:31,220 --> 05:56:33,187
Splendid.

4154
05:56:33,222 --> 05:56:35,356
With all the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

4155
05:56:35,391 --> 05:56:36,891
Thank you, sir.
Here.

4156
05:56:43,065 --> 05:56:45,733
Young man, you may
or may not have murdered
a middle-aged widow,

4157
05:56:45,768 --> 05:56:48,703
but you've certainly
saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

4158
05:56:48,738 --> 05:56:51,572
(LAUGHING) I haven't
murdered anybody.
It's absurd.

4159
05:56:51,607 --> 05:56:53,875
Christine, that's my wife,

4160
05:56:53,910 --> 05:56:55,877
she thought
I may be implicated,
and that I needed a lawyer.

4161
05:56:55,912 --> 05:56:57,745
That's why I went
to see Mr. Mayhew.

4162
05:56:57,780 --> 05:56:59,213
Now he thinks
he needs a lawyer,

4163
05:56:59,248 --> 05:57:00,748
and now I have two lawyers.

4164
05:57:00,783 --> 05:57:02,583
It's rather silly,
don't you...

4165
05:57:02,618 --> 05:57:04,886
Mr. Vole, I am a solicitor,
Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

4166
05:57:04,921 --> 05:57:07,555
Only a barrister
can actually plead
a case in court.

4167
05:57:07,590 --> 05:57:08,923
LEONARD: Oh, I see.

4168
05:57:08,958 --> 05:57:11,092
She shall not even
find the ashes.

4169
05:57:14,263 --> 05:57:15,596
Sit down.

4170
05:57:15,631 --> 05:57:18,232
Oh, thank you.

4171
05:57:18,267 --> 05:57:20,434
Well, I saw in the paper
that poor Mrs. French
had been found dead

4172
05:57:20,469 --> 05:57:21,903
with her head bashed in.

4173
05:57:21,938 --> 05:57:23,471
And it also said
in the papers

4174
05:57:23,506 --> 05:57:25,106
that the police were anxious
to interview me,

4175
05:57:25,141 --> 05:57:27,074
since I'd visited Mrs. French
that evening, so...

4176
05:57:27,109 --> 05:57:28,810
Well, naturally I went along
to the police station.

4177
05:57:28,845 --> 05:57:30,244
Did they caution you?

4178
05:57:30,279 --> 05:57:31,479
(SIGHS)

4179
05:57:31,514 --> 05:57:33,581
I--I don't quite know.
They...

4180
05:57:33,616 --> 05:57:34,749
They asked me
if I'd like to make
a statement,

4181
05:57:34,784 --> 05:57:36,450
and said that they'd
write it down,

4182
05:57:36,485 --> 05:57:37,618
and that it might be used
against me in court.

4183
05:57:37,653 --> 05:57:39,253
Would that be cautioning me?

4184
05:57:39,288 --> 05:57:41,823
Oh, well, it can't
be helped now.

4185
05:57:41,858 --> 05:57:43,925
Well, they were very polite
and they seemed
quite satisfied.

4186
05:57:43,960 --> 05:57:46,160
They seemed satisfied,
Mr. Vole.

4187
05:57:46,195 --> 05:57:48,629
He thinks that he made
a statement and that's
the end of it.

4188
05:57:48,664 --> 05:57:50,264
Isn't it obvious
to you, Mr. Vole,

4189
05:57:50,299 --> 05:57:51,599
that you will be regarded
as the principal

4190
05:57:51,634 --> 05:57:53,434
and logical suspect
in this case?

4191
05:57:53,469 --> 05:57:54,769
I'm very much afraid
you'll be arrested.

4192
05:57:54,804 --> 05:57:56,137
But I've done nothing!

4193
05:57:56,172 --> 05:57:57,605
Why should I be arrested?

4194
05:57:57,640 --> 05:57:59,774
I mean, this is England,

4195
05:57:59,809 --> 05:58:02,276
you don't get arrested
or convicted for something
you haven't done!

4196
05:58:02,311 --> 05:58:05,313
We try not to make
a habit of it.

4197
05:58:05,348 --> 05:58:07,649
But it does happen
though, doesn't it?

4198
05:58:08,317 --> 05:58:10,518
Of course.

4199
05:58:10,553 --> 05:58:11,652
There was the case
of that fellow,
what's his name,

4200
05:58:11,687 --> 05:58:13,120
Adolph Beck or Becker.

4201
05:58:13,155 --> 05:58:14,989
He'd been in jail
for eight years,

4202
05:58:15,024 --> 05:58:16,624
and they suddenly found
it was another chap,
altogether.

4203
05:58:16,659 --> 05:58:18,626
He'd been innocent
all along.

4204
05:58:18,661 --> 05:58:20,461
Very unfortunate,
but restitution
has been made.

4205
05:58:20,496 --> 05:58:22,964
He received a free pardon,
a bounty from the Crown,

4206
05:58:22,999 --> 05:58:24,799
and was restored
to his normal life.

4207
05:58:24,834 --> 05:58:26,000
LEONARD: Yes,
that's all right for him.

4208
05:58:26,035 --> 05:58:27,368
But what if it had
been murder?

4209
05:58:27,403 --> 05:58:29,670
What if he'd been hanged?

4210
05:58:29,705 --> 05:58:32,206
How would they have
restored him
to his normal life then, huh?

4211
05:58:32,241 --> 05:58:36,177
Mr. Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

4212
05:58:36,212 --> 05:58:38,045
I'm sorry.
It's just when you tell me

4213
05:58:38,080 --> 05:58:40,982
that all these things
are closing in on me,
it's like a nightmare.

4214
05:58:41,017 --> 05:58:43,484
Relax, Mr. Vole.
I'm putting you
in the hands of the finest

4215
05:58:43,519 --> 05:58:45,519
and most experienced
barrister in London.

4216
05:58:45,554 --> 05:58:47,488
Now, Mayhew,
let's get this straight.

4217
05:58:47,523 --> 05:58:49,523
I may have done
something highly unethical.

4218
05:58:49,558 --> 05:58:51,492
I've taken your cigar
and I'm not taking your case.

4219
05:58:51,527 --> 05:58:52,827
I can't.

4220
05:58:52,862 --> 05:58:54,161
I'm forbidden.

4221
05:58:54,196 --> 05:58:56,330
My doctors would
never allow it.

4222
05:58:56,365 --> 05:58:58,733
I'm truly sorry,
young man.

4223
05:58:58,768 --> 05:59:01,569
However, if you'd like
the case handled
by someone in these chambers,

4224
05:59:01,604 --> 05:59:03,537
I'd recommend
Mr. Brogan-Moore.
You know Brogan-Moore.

4225
05:59:03,572 --> 05:59:05,373
Yes, I do,
a very able man.

4226
05:59:05,408 --> 05:59:07,208
I second Sir Wilfrid's
recommendation.

4227
05:59:07,243 --> 05:59:09,377
All right, sir,
if you say so.

4228
05:59:13,883 --> 05:59:15,383
Hold this.

4229
05:59:19,088 --> 05:59:20,521
Carter?
Yes, sir?

4230
05:59:20,556 --> 05:59:22,523
I would like to see
Brogan-Moore here,

4231
05:59:22,558 --> 05:59:25,026
as soon as he comes in
from court.
Very well.

4232
05:59:25,061 --> 05:59:27,862
Sir Wilfrid,
I have never known
such insubordination.

4233
05:59:27,897 --> 05:59:30,264
No, not even when I was
a nurse in the front lines
during the war.

4234
05:59:30,299 --> 05:59:31,532
What war was that?

4235
05:59:31,567 --> 05:59:33,534
The Crimean War,
no doubt.

4236
05:59:33,569 --> 05:59:36,103
(DOOR SLAMMING)

4237
05:59:36,138 --> 05:59:38,706
You'll like Brogan-Moore.
He's had excellent training,
under me.

4238
05:59:38,741 --> 05:59:40,541
This morning I had
no lawyers at all.

4239
05:59:40,576 --> 05:59:42,443
And now, suddenly,
I have three lawyers.

4240
05:59:42,478 --> 05:59:44,111
Perhaps we should
explain to Sir Wilfrid

4241
05:59:44,146 --> 05:59:46,080
that I have very
little money.

4242
05:59:46,115 --> 05:59:48,282
I shan't be able
to pay all the costs
and fees.

4243
05:59:48,317 --> 05:59:50,451
Don't worry,
we will get a fourth
lawyer to sue you.

4244
05:59:50,486 --> 05:59:52,253
Well, you won't get
very much, I'm afraid.

4245
05:59:52,288 --> 05:59:53,721
I haven't had a job
in four months.

4246
05:59:53,756 --> 05:59:55,456
What sort of work
do you do?

4247
05:59:55,491 --> 05:59:58,092
Well, uh...

4248
05:59:58,127 --> 06:00:00,561
My last job was as
a mechanic with a--
with a motor servicing firm.

4249
06:00:00,596 --> 06:00:02,563
The--The foreman
kept riding me all the time.

4250
06:00:02,598 --> 06:00:04,565
I took it as long as I could,
and then I--I quit.

4251
06:00:04,600 --> 06:00:06,233
WILFRID: And before that?

4252
06:00:06,268 --> 06:00:08,269
I worked in a department store
in toys,

4253
06:00:08,304 --> 06:00:10,571
uh, demonstrating
children's building sets.

4254
06:00:10,606 --> 06:00:12,773
Of course,
that lasted only during
the Christmas rush.

4255
06:00:12,808 --> 06:00:15,476
And before that,
I had a job
testing electric blankets.

4256
06:00:15,511 --> 06:00:17,945
Electric blankets?

4257
06:00:17,980 --> 06:00:20,748
I suppose you're
thinking I'm a bit
of a drifter, sir.

4258
06:00:20,783 --> 06:00:23,250
Well, it's true
in a way, but I'm--
I'm really not like that.

4259
06:00:23,285 --> 06:00:26,153
Doing my army service
unsettled me a bit.
That and living abroad.

4260
06:00:26,188 --> 06:00:28,923
I was stationed in Germany.
It was fine there, though.

4261
06:00:28,958 --> 06:00:30,491
That's where I met Christine,
my wife.

4262
06:00:30,526 --> 06:00:33,160
She was an actress,
and a good one.

4263
06:00:33,195 --> 06:00:35,596
Ah, she's a wonderful wife
to me, too,

4264
06:00:35,631 --> 06:00:38,432
but I haven't been
much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

4265
06:00:38,467 --> 06:00:40,935
Somehow or other,
I--I just don't seem to be
able to settle down

4266
06:00:40,970 --> 06:00:43,104
now that I've come back
to this country.

4267
06:00:43,139 --> 06:00:45,106
Of course, if--if
I could just put
my eggbeater across...

4268
06:00:45,141 --> 06:00:47,641
Eggbeater?

4269
06:00:47,676 --> 06:00:50,811
(LAUGHING) Yes, sir. I, ah,
I'm a bit of an inventor.

4270
06:00:50,846 --> 06:00:54,348
Nothing big,
just little household things,
pocket pencil sharpeners,

4271
06:00:54,383 --> 06:00:56,283
key-chain flashlights
and that sort of thing.

4272
06:00:56,318 --> 06:00:57,785
But my best is really
this eggbeater.

4273
06:00:57,820 --> 06:01:00,287
You see, it not only
beats the egg,

4274
06:01:00,322 --> 06:01:02,490
but it also separates
the yolk from the white.

4275
06:01:02,525 --> 06:01:04,959
Is that really desirable?

4276
06:01:04,994 --> 06:01:07,328
LEONARD: If you were
a housewife, Sir Wilfrid,
you'd see it right away.

4277
06:01:07,363 --> 06:01:08,796
The only trouble is
that I need money

4278
06:01:08,831 --> 06:01:10,631
for manufacturing
and promotion.

4279
06:01:10,666 --> 06:01:12,466
I was really hoping
that that's what Mrs. French

4280
06:01:12,501 --> 06:01:15,136
might do for me
after I met her.
Oh.

4281
06:01:15,171 --> 06:01:18,339
Exactly how did you meet
this Mrs. French?

4282
06:01:18,374 --> 06:01:20,207
Well, that's rather funny
in itself.

4283
06:01:20,242 --> 06:01:22,343
It was the third of September

4284
06:01:22,378 --> 06:01:24,512
I remember distinctly
because it's my
wife's birthday.

4285
06:01:24,547 --> 06:01:27,481
I was window-shopping
on Oxford Street,

You don't think
it's too, uh, mad?

4290
06:02:23,405 --> 06:02:24,872
Mad? Not at all.

4291
06:02:24,907 --> 06:02:26,607
A little daring,
perhaps.

4292
06:02:26,642 --> 06:02:28,709
I wouldn't recommend it
to every woman.

4293
06:02:28,744 --> 06:02:30,444
But you,
why shouldn't you attract
some attention?

4294
06:02:30,479 --> 06:02:32,613
Oh, you really
think so?

4295
06:02:32,648 --> 06:02:35,583
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.
Yes?

4296
06:02:35,618 --> 06:02:38,285
Perhaps we could tip it
and bring it back
a bit like that.

4297
06:02:38,320 --> 06:02:41,122

There.

Oh, my bus.

that she seemed
to be very lonely,

06:05:21,250 --> 06:05:22,783
We'd better
get out of here.

4362
06:05:22,818 --> 06:05:25,719
Janet doesn't like visitors
in her kitchen.

4363
06:05:25,754 --> 06:05:26,754
(GIGGLING)

4364
06:05:31,627 --> 06:05:32,760
Hah!

4365
06:05:35,264 --> 06:05:37,398
Oh, it's a bit chilly
in here, isn't it?

4366
06:05:37,433 --> 06:05:38,899
Shall we have a fire?

4367
06:05:38,934 --> 06:05:41,068
Why not?

4368
06:05:41,103 --> 06:05:44,071
Now, this is
a charming room.

4369
06:05:44,106 --> 06:05:45,639
Hubert and I collected
all these things

4370
06:05:45,674 --> 06:05:47,408
when we lived
in Africa.

4371
06:05:47,443 --> 06:05:49,810
(SIGHS) Hubert was
my husband.

4372
06:05:51,647 --> 06:05:54,815
Well, now,
there's a lovable chap.

4373
06:05:54,850 --> 06:05:57,318
That's the mask
of the witch doctor.

4374
06:05:57,353 --> 06:05:59,920
He always wore it
when he pulled
our servants' teeth,

4375
06:05:59,955 --> 06:06:03,257
so Hubert used to call him
a witch dentist.

4376
06:06:03,292 --> 06:06:04,591
(LAUGHS)

4377
06:06:04,626 --> 06:06:06,160
Hubert was so witty.

4378
06:06:06,195 --> 06:06:07,628
Yes, I can see that.

4379
06:06:07,663 --> 06:06:09,463
Oh, here's tea.

4380
06:06:12,701 --> 06:06:15,602
Janet, let's use our good
silver and china.

4381
06:06:15,637 --> 06:06:17,338
(SIGHS)
Oh, no, don't bother,
Mrs. French,

4382
06:06:17,373 --> 06:06:18,939
this is perfectly
all right.

4383
06:06:18,974 --> 06:06:20,641
Lemon or milk, please?

4384
06:06:20,676 --> 06:06:22,676
Oh, I don't really care.

4385
06:06:22,711 --> 06:06:24,278
Would you prefer
some sherry?
Sherry would be fine.

4386
06:06:24,313 --> 06:06:25,679
We've not got any sherry.

4387
06:06:25,714 --> 06:06:27,147
Oh, but we have.
There's that bottle,

4388
06:06:27,182 --> 06:06:29,817
the one we bought
last Christmas.

4389
06:06:29,852 --> 06:06:32,286
If you care
for an eggnog,

4390
06:06:32,321 --> 06:06:34,788
there happens to be
a wasted egg in the kitchen,
all ready and separated.

4391
06:06:34,823 --> 06:06:37,658
Do sit down.
And don't mind Janet,
Mr. Vole.

4392
06:06:37,693 --> 06:06:39,793
It's just that
she's terribly Scotch.

4393
06:06:39,828 --> 06:06:41,295
Oh, is she?

4394
06:06:41,330 --> 06:06:42,663
I thought she came
with the collection.

4395
06:06:42,698 --> 06:06:44,998
(LAUGHS)

4396
06:06:45,033 --> 06:06:48,802
You know,
maybe I'll take a glass
of sherry myself.

4397
06:06:48,837 --> 06:06:51,004
I feel like Christmas,
somehow.

4398
06:06:51,039 --> 06:06:53,374
(GIGGLES)

4399
06:06:53,409 --> 06:06:55,309
<i>LEONARD: After that,</i>
<i>I used to see her</i>
<i>once or twice a week.</i>

4400
06:06:55,344 --> 06:06:57,378
She always kept a bottle
of sherry for me.

4401
06:06:57,413 --> 06:06:59,813
We'd talk a bit,
play canasta,

4402
06:06:59,848 --> 06:07:03,317
listen to her old
gramophone records,
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

4403
06:07:03,352 --> 06:07:04,651
It's so weird to think
of her now

4404
06:07:04,686 --> 06:07:07,488
lying in that living room,
murdered.

4405
06:07:07,523 --> 06:07:09,823
I assure you
she's been moved by now.

4406
06:07:09,858 --> 06:07:13,361
To leave her around
would be unfeeling,
unlawful and unsanitary.

4407
06:07:16,865 --> 06:07:20,234
MAYHEW: Suppose you tell
Sir Wilfrid about the evening
of the murder.

4408
06:07:20,269 --> 06:07:23,170
Well, I went around
to see her about 8:00
that evening.

4409
06:07:23,205 --> 06:07:26,039
She fixed me a sandwich,
we talked a bit,
listened to <i>The Mikado.</i>

4410
06:07:26,074 --> 06:07:27,574
I left about 9:00.

4411
06:07:27,609 --> 06:07:30,344
I walked home.
I got there about half-past.

4412
06:07:30,379 --> 06:07:32,546
I can prove that,
I can swear to it
in or out of court,

4413
06:07:32,581 --> 06:07:34,515
in the witness box,
anywhere.

4414
06:07:34,550 --> 06:07:36,049
How much money
did you get from her?

4415
06:07:36,084 --> 06:07:37,551
From whom?
From Mrs. French.

4416
06:07:37,586 --> 06:07:39,586
Nothing, not a quid.
The truth. How much?

4417
06:07:39,621 --> 06:07:41,021
Why should she give me
any money?

4418
06:07:41,056 --> 06:07:43,190
Because she was
in love with you.

4419
06:07:43,225 --> 06:07:45,526
That's ridiculous.
She liked me.

4420
06:07:45,561 --> 06:07:48,695
She--She pampered me
like--like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear!

4421
06:07:48,730 --> 06:07:50,531
Why didn't you tell her
you were a married man?

4422
06:07:50,566 --> 06:07:52,866
I did tell her.

4423
06:07:52,901 --> 06:07:53,901
But you never took
your wife along
when you went there, did you?

4424
06:07:53,936 --> 06:07:55,102
No, I didn't.
Why not?

4425
06:07:55,137 --> 06:07:57,037
Well, because...
Because what?

4426
06:07:57,072 --> 06:07:58,705
Because Mrs. French
was under the impression

4427
06:07:58,740 --> 06:08:00,874
Christine and I didn't
get along too well.

4428
06:08:00,909 --> 06:08:03,076
Is that true?
No, we love each other!

4429
06:08:03,111 --> 06:08:05,712
Then how did she get
that impression?
Did you give it to her?

4430
06:08:05,747 --> 06:08:07,548
No, she just seemed
to want to believe it
that way.

4431
06:08:07,583 --> 06:08:09,283
But you never corrected
that impression? Why?

4432
06:08:09,318 --> 06:08:11,285
Well, I was afraid
she'd lose interest in me.

4433
06:08:11,320 --> 06:08:12,886
Because she was rich?
Yes, I suppose so.

4434
06:08:12,921 --> 06:08:14,455
And you were after
her money.

4435
06:08:14,490 --> 06:08:17,224
Well, yes, in a way.

4436
06:08:17,259 --> 06:08:20,227
I was hoping for a loan
for my new invention.

4437
06:08:20,262 --> 06:08:22,229
Just a couple
of hundred pounds.

4438
06:08:22,264 --> 06:08:23,730
An honest business
proposition,

4439
06:08:23,765 --> 06:08:25,933
that's all it would have been.
Is that so wicked?

4440
06:08:25,968 --> 06:08:28,936
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?
Well, yes, I did.

4441
06:08:28,971 --> 06:08:31,238
So you went there
because you knew
she'd be alone?

4442
06:08:31,273 --> 06:08:33,941
No, I went there
because I thought
she might be lonely.

4443
06:08:33,976 --> 06:08:35,742
All right, lonely.
You and the rich,
lonely widow

4444
06:08:35,777 --> 06:08:37,311
all alone in that lonely house

4445
06:08:37,346 --> 06:08:40,247
with the gramophone
blaring <i>The Mikado.</i>

4446
06:08:40,282 --> 06:08:42,950
Perhaps you turned
up the volume
to drown out her cries.

4447
06:08:42,985 --> 06:08:44,785
No, when I left her
she was alive!

4448
06:08:44,820 --> 06:08:47,754
But when the housekeeper
came back, she was dead.

4449
06:08:47,789 --> 06:08:51,592
The house had been ransacked,
it said so in the papers.
It must have been a burglar.

4450
06:08:51,627 --> 06:08:53,093
Look, I didn't do it.

4451
06:08:53,128 --> 06:08:55,762
No matter how bad things look,
I didn't do it!

4452
06:08:55,797 --> 06:08:58,032
You must believe me!
You do believe me,
don't you?

4453
06:09:00,802 --> 06:09:03,103
I do now,
but I wasn't sure.

4454
06:09:03,138 --> 06:09:06,607
That's why I subjected
your eyes and my arteries
to that ordeal.

4455
06:09:06,642 --> 06:09:09,176
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

4456
06:09:09,211 --> 06:09:13,180
As for things looking bad,
they don't look bad, Mr. Vole,
they look terrible.

4457
06:09:13,215 --> 06:09:14,982
Apparently,
you've no alibi at all.

4458
06:09:15,017 --> 06:09:17,484
I have. I left
Mrs. French's at 9:00.

4459
06:09:17,519 --> 06:09:19,319
How did you go home,
by bus or underground?

4460
06:09:19,354 --> 06:09:20,821
No, I walked.
It was a fine night.

4461
06:09:20,856 --> 06:09:22,823
Did anyone see you?

4462
06:09:22,858 --> 06:09:24,291
Yes, of course,
Christine saw me
when I got home.

4463
06:09:24,326 --> 06:09:26,293
It was 9:26 exactly.

4464
06:09:26,328 --> 06:09:28,028
I know because
I went right to work
on this new sort

4465
06:09:28,063 --> 06:09:29,463
of clock thing
that I've been
tinkering with.

4466
06:09:29,498 --> 06:09:30,864
My wife
will tell you that.

4467
06:09:30,899 --> 06:09:32,332
Your wife loves you,
does she not?

4468
06:09:32,367 --> 06:09:33,667
Very much.
And I love her.

4469
06:09:33,702 --> 06:09:35,135
We're devoted
to each other.

4470
06:09:35,170 --> 06:09:36,703
Of course, you realize,
Mr. Vole,

4471
06:09:36,738 --> 06:09:38,472
that the testimony
of a devoted wife

4472
06:09:38,507 --> 06:09:40,841
does not carry
much weight.

4473
06:09:40,876 --> 06:09:43,143
You mean people might think
Christine would tell a lie
on my account?

4474
06:09:43,178 --> 06:09:45,145
It has been known,
Mr. Vole.

4475
06:09:45,180 --> 06:09:48,215
Blood is thicker
than evidence.

4476
06:09:48,250 --> 06:09:51,218
WILFRID: Ah, Brogan-Moore,
come in, come in.

4477
06:09:51,253 --> 06:09:53,353
So good to have you out
of hospital.

4478
06:09:53,388 --> 06:09:56,156
I didn't get
a full pardon,
I'm out on parole.

4479
06:09:56,191 --> 06:09:58,392
You know Mr. Mayhew,
I believe.

4480
06:09:58,427 --> 06:10:00,494
This is his client,
Mr. Leonard Vole.

4481
06:10:00,529 --> 06:10:01,662
How do you do?
How do you do?

4482
06:10:01,697 --> 06:10:03,564
The Emily French murder.

4483
06:10:03,599 --> 06:10:04,498
Oh, how do you do?

4484
06:10:04,533 --> 06:10:07,034
Badly, thank you.

4485
06:10:07,069 --> 06:10:08,902
There's a mass
of circumstantial evidence,
no alibi whatsoever.

4486
06:10:08,937 --> 06:10:10,203
It's a hot potato.

4487
06:10:10,238 --> 06:10:11,738
Tossing it
right into your lap.

4488
06:10:11,773 --> 06:10:13,373
(CHUCKLING) Much obliged.

4489
06:10:13,408 --> 06:10:16,009
Your line of defense, however,
will be lack of motive.

4490
06:10:16,044 --> 06:10:19,346
You will agree that
we can rule out
a crime of passion, hmm?

4491
06:10:19,381 --> 06:10:21,181
That leaves us
with a murder for profit.

4492
06:10:21,216 --> 06:10:24,217
Now then,
if Mr. Vole had been
sponging on Mrs. French,

4493
06:10:24,252 --> 06:10:26,420
why kill her and cut off
the source of supply?

4494
06:10:26,455 --> 06:10:29,189
Or, if he'd been hoping
for a golden egg,

4495
06:10:29,224 --> 06:10:31,224
why kill the goose
before it was laid?

4496
06:10:31,259 --> 06:10:33,060
No motive.
No motive whatsoever!

4497
06:10:35,897 --> 06:10:38,432
You find some flaw
in this line of reasoning?

4498
06:10:38,467 --> 06:10:40,934
No, no, it's very sound,
as far as it goes.

4499
06:10:40,969 --> 06:10:43,036
Well, it's all yours,
Brogan-Moore.

4500
06:10:43,071 --> 06:10:45,238
You'll find Mr. Vole
very responsive
and quite candid.

4501
06:10:45,273 --> 06:10:47,207
So candid, in fact,
he's already informed me

4502
06:10:47,242 --> 06:10:49,042
we'll have to sue him
for our fees.

4503
06:10:49,077 --> 06:10:51,779
Oh, we'll simply put a lien
on Mr. Vole's 680,000.

4504
06:10:52,648 --> 06:10:54,448
What 680,000?

4505
06:10:54,483 --> 06:10:56,950
The 680,000
Mrs. French left you.

4506
06:10:56,985 --> 06:10:59,252
Left me?

4507
06:10:59,287 --> 06:11:02,122
They opened Mrs. French's
bank vault today
and found her will.

4508
06:11:04,593 --> 06:11:05,826
Congratulations!

4509
06:11:06,962 --> 06:11:09,262
680,000!

4510
06:11:09,297 --> 06:11:11,398
And I was worried
about a couple of hundred

4511
06:11:11,433 --> 06:11:14,268
for that silly eggbeater
of mine, and now...
I must call Christine.

4512
06:11:18,807 --> 06:11:21,408
Oh.

4513
06:11:21,443 --> 06:11:23,610
This inheritance doesn't
make things look any better
for me though, does it?

4514
06:11:23,645 --> 06:11:26,146
No. I wouldn't think so.

4515
06:11:26,181 --> 06:11:28,315
So now they'll say
that I did have a motive.
They will, indeed.

4516
06:11:28,350 --> 06:11:30,951
680,000 makes
for a very handsome motive.

4517
06:11:32,521 --> 06:11:34,488
I thought you were crazy,

4518
06:11:34,523 --> 06:11:35,922
but I guess now
they will arrest me,
won't they?

4519
06:11:35,957 --> 06:11:37,458
It's not unlikely.

06:11:45,333 --> 06:11:46,767
As a matter of fact,
it's quite likely.

4523
06:11:46,802 --> 06:11:48,769
They're on their way up, now.

4524
06:11:48,804 --> 06:11:50,337
Look, I knew nothing
about that will.

4525
06:11:50,372 --> 06:11:51,938
I had no idea that
Mrs. French

4526
06:11:51,973 --> 06:11:53,440
had any intention
of leaving me her money.

4527
06:11:53,475 --> 06:11:55,809
And if I didn't know about it,
how could it be a motive?

4528
06:11:55,844 --> 06:11:58,145
Mr. Brogan-Moore
will certainly bring
that out in court.

4529
06:11:58,180 --> 06:12:00,280
It's our old friend,
Inspector Hearne.

4530
06:12:00,315 --> 06:12:02,449
Chief Inspector,
as of last month.

4531
06:12:02,484 --> 06:12:04,284
Chief Inspector!

4532
06:12:04,319 --> 06:12:06,453
They must think a lot of you
at Scotland Yard.

4533
06:12:06,488 --> 06:12:08,989
You're getting
the de luxe treatment.

4534
06:12:09,024 --> 06:12:12,292
Oh, in here,
Chief Inspector.

4535
06:12:12,327 --> 06:12:14,995
Sorry to disturb you
in your chambers,
Sir Wilfrid.

4536
06:12:15,030 --> 06:12:16,630
That's perfectly
all right.

4537
06:12:16,665 --> 06:12:18,632
I never object
to the actions
of the police,

4538
06:12:18,667 --> 06:12:20,867
except once in a great while
in court.

4539
06:12:20,902 --> 06:12:22,669
Yes, sir.
I still have the scars.

4540
06:12:22,704 --> 06:12:25,305
You know Mr. Mayhew,
Mr. Brogan-Moore.

4541
06:12:25,340 --> 06:12:27,207
This is dangerous
Leonard Vole.

4542
06:12:27,242 --> 06:12:29,876
You'd better search him,
he may be armed
with an eggbeater.

4543
06:12:29,911 --> 06:12:31,311
INSPECTOR: Is your name
Leonard Vole?

4544
06:12:31,346 --> 06:12:32,846
Yes, it is.

4545
06:12:32,881 --> 06:12:35,215
I have here a warrant
for your arrest

4546
06:12:35,250 --> 06:12:38,485
on the charge
of murdering Emily French
on October the 14th, last.

4547
06:12:38,520 --> 06:12:40,220
I must warn you
that anything you say

4548
06:12:40,255 --> 06:12:42,523
may be taken down
and used in evidence.

4549
06:12:43,558 --> 06:12:44,991
Well, I'm ready.

4550
06:12:45,026 --> 06:12:46,660
But must I be handcuffed?

4551
06:12:46,695 --> 06:12:49,162
That won't be necessary, sir.

4552
06:12:49,197 --> 06:12:50,697
See, I've never been
arrested before,

4553
06:12:50,732 --> 06:12:53,166
not even for walking
a dog off a lead

4554
06:12:53,201 --> 06:12:54,868
or having a beer
after hours.

4555
06:12:54,903 --> 06:12:57,003
There's no disgrace
in being arrested, Mr. Vole.

4556
06:12:57,038 --> 06:13:00,540
Kings, prime ministers,
archbishops, even barristers

4557
06:13:00,575 --> 06:13:02,076
have stood in the dock.

4558
06:13:07,082 --> 06:13:09,049
Somebody better call
my wife and tell her
where they're taking me.

4559
06:13:09,084 --> 06:13:11,518
I will,
don't worry.

4560
06:13:11,553 --> 06:13:13,353
I'll go to the station
with you and see that
you're properly charged.

4561
06:13:13,388 --> 06:13:15,589
You will see to it
that Mr. Vole
is well treated?

4562
06:13:15,624 --> 06:13:17,924
We will.
Would you like a cigar?

4563
06:13:17,959 --> 06:13:18,959
Pardon me.

4564
06:13:21,296 --> 06:13:22,929
That's very kind of you,
Sir Wilfrid.

4565
06:13:22,964 --> 06:13:25,566
I'd better not.
It would constitute
a bribe.

4566
06:13:26,568 --> 06:13:28,068
(SIGHS)

4567
06:13:28,103 --> 06:13:29,436
We ought to be going,
Mr. Vole.

4568
06:13:34,242 --> 06:13:36,042
Well, there's one thing
I've learned for sure,

4569
06:13:36,077 --> 06:13:38,078
never look in a window
where there are women's hats.

4570
06:13:38,113 --> 06:13:39,480
Good day, sir.

4571
06:13:42,417 --> 06:13:44,384
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

4572
06:13:44,419 --> 06:13:45,886
Yes, rather.

4573
06:13:45,921 --> 06:13:47,387
Did you give him
the monocle test?

4574
06:13:47,422 --> 06:13:49,289
Passed with flying colors.

4575
06:13:49,324 --> 06:13:51,725
Yes, I hope he does
as well in the dock.
Yeah.

4576
06:13:51,760 --> 06:13:53,560
This is sticky,
you know?
Of course it is.

4577
06:13:53,595 --> 06:13:56,630
The prosecution will blast him
with their heaviest artillery.

4578
06:13:56,665 --> 06:13:58,398
All you'll have
is one little popgun,

4579
06:13:58,433 --> 06:14:01,434
an alibi furnished
by his wife.

4580
06:14:01,469 --> 06:14:03,904
Isn't that
an intriguing challenge?

4581
06:14:03,939 --> 06:14:05,739
I think I'd like it more
if it was less
of a challenge

4582
06:14:05,774 --> 06:14:07,808
and less intriguing.

4583
06:14:07,843 --> 06:14:09,743
Sorry, Sir Wilfrid,

4584
06:14:09,778 --> 06:14:11,778
but Miss Plimsoll
has issued
an ultimatum,

4585
06:14:11,813 --> 06:14:13,780
if you're not in bed
in one minute,
she will resign.

4586
06:14:13,815 --> 06:14:14,981
Splendid.
Give her a month's pay

4587
06:14:15,016 --> 06:14:17,083
and kick her
down the stairs.

4588
06:14:17,118 --> 06:14:19,085
Sir Wilfrid,
either you take proper
care of yourself

4589
06:14:19,120 --> 06:14:20,587
or I, too,
shall resign.

4590
06:14:20,622 --> 06:14:21,955
This is blackmail.

4591
06:14:21,990 --> 06:14:23,824
But you're quite right,
Carter.

4592
06:14:23,859 --> 06:14:25,258
For my first day,
this has already
been rather hectic.

4593
06:14:25,293 --> 06:14:26,927
I should be in bed.

4594
06:14:26,962 --> 06:14:27,795
Ah.

4595
06:14:31,499 --> 06:14:34,634
Oh, I'd-- I'd better
get in touch with Mrs. Vole
and have her come over.

4596
06:14:34,669 --> 06:14:37,003
Will you sit in?
Thank you, no.

4597
06:14:37,038 --> 06:14:39,706
I'm in no condition
to cope with emotional wives
drenched in tears.

4598
06:14:42,210 --> 06:14:45,512
Ah, Miss Plimsoll,
how alluring you look!

4599
06:14:45,547 --> 06:14:47,781
Waiting like a hangman
on the scaffold.

4600
06:14:47,816 --> 06:14:50,317
Take me, I'm yours.

4601
06:14:52,487 --> 06:14:55,789
Oh, uh, about Mrs. Vole,
handle her gently,

4602
06:14:55,824 --> 06:14:57,991
especially when
you break the news
of the arrest.

4603
06:14:58,026 --> 06:14:59,159
Bear in mind,
she's a foreigner,

4604
06:14:59,194 --> 06:15:01,027
so be prepared
for hysterics

4605
06:15:01,062 --> 06:15:02,796
and even a fainting spell.

4606
06:15:02,831 --> 06:15:04,631
Better have smelling
salts ready,

4607
06:15:04,666 --> 06:15:07,000
a box of tissues
and a nip of brandy.

4608
06:15:07,035 --> 06:15:09,670
WOMAN: I do not think
that will be necessary.

4609
06:15:13,875 --> 06:15:16,543
I never faint
because I'm not sure that
I will fall gracefully,

4610
06:15:16,578 --> 06:15:20,380
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

4611
06:15:20,415 --> 06:15:22,983
I am Christine Vole.

4612
06:15:23,018 --> 06:15:25,719
How do you do?
This is Mr. Brogan-Moore.

4613
06:15:25,754 --> 06:15:27,654
How do you do?
How do you do?

4614
06:15:27,689 --> 06:15:29,489
I am Wilfrid Robarts.

4615
06:15:29,524 --> 06:15:31,992
How do you do?

4616
06:15:32,027 --> 06:15:34,527
My dear Mrs. Vole,
I'm afraid we have
rather bad news for you.

4617
06:15:34,562 --> 06:15:37,364
Don't be afraid,
Sir Wilfrid.
I'm quite disciplined.

4618
06:15:37,399 --> 06:15:39,666
There's nothing
to be alarmed about as yet.

4619
06:15:39,701 --> 06:15:43,003
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder,
is that it?

4620
06:15:43,038 --> 06:15:46,406
Yes.
I knew he would be.
I told him so.

4621
06:15:46,441 --> 06:15:49,075
I'm glad you're showing
such fortitude.

4622
06:15:49,110 --> 06:15:51,011
Call it what you like.

4623
06:15:51,046 --> 06:15:53,013
What is the next step?

4624
06:15:53,048 --> 06:15:55,682
Your husband
will have to stand trial,
I'm afraid.

4625
06:15:55,717 --> 06:15:58,184
Will you take
Mrs. Vole inside
and explain the procedure?

4626
06:15:58,219 --> 06:16:00,587
Mr. Brogan-Moore
will lead the defense.

4627
06:16:00,622 --> 06:16:02,522
Oh?

4628
06:16:02,557 --> 06:16:04,424
You will not personally
defend Leonard?

4629
06:16:04,459 --> 06:16:06,426
Regrettably, not.

4630
06:16:06,461 --> 06:16:08,194
My health,
or rather the lack of it,
forbids me.

4631
06:16:08,229 --> 06:16:10,530
It is regrettable.

4632
06:16:10,565 --> 06:16:13,233
Mr. Mayhew described you
as the champion
of the hopeless cause.

4633
06:16:16,805 --> 06:16:19,940
Is it perhaps
that this cause
is too hopeless?

4634
06:16:28,249 --> 06:16:30,884
I shall have
a very serious talk
with Dr. Harrison.

4635
06:16:30,919 --> 06:16:33,053
It was a mistake
to let you come back here.

4636
06:16:33,088 --> 06:16:35,789
I should've taken you
directly to a rest home
or a resort.

4637
06:16:35,824 --> 06:16:38,591
Some place quiet,
far off, like Bermuda.

4638
06:16:38,626 --> 06:16:41,394
Shut up.
You just want to see me
in those nasty shorts.

4639
06:16:41,429 --> 06:16:42,896
Come, now, Sir Wilfrid.

4640
06:16:42,931 --> 06:16:45,065
You must not
think of it.

4641
06:16:45,100 --> 06:16:46,266
You must get ready
for sleep.

4642
06:16:46,301 --> 06:16:47,768
Think beautiful
thoughts.

4643
06:16:49,604 --> 06:16:51,771
Now, let's get undressed.

4644
06:16:51,806 --> 06:16:55,141
Put these on,
tops and the bottoms,
while I make your bed.

4645
06:16:55,176 --> 06:16:58,611
Now, after your rest,
we'll have a nice cup
of cocoa,

4646
06:16:58,646 --> 06:17:01,614
and then perhaps
we'll have a walk
around the square.

4647
06:17:01,649 --> 06:17:04,417
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr. Vole.

4648
06:17:04,452 --> 06:17:06,252
And not just because
he was arrested,

4649
06:17:06,287 --> 06:17:08,421
but that wife of his,
she must be German.

4650
06:17:08,456 --> 06:17:10,457
I suppose that's
what happens

4651
06:17:10,492 --> 06:17:12,959
when we let our boys
cross the channel,
they go crazy.

4652
06:17:12,994 --> 06:17:14,761
Personally,
I think the government

4653
06:17:14,796 --> 06:17:18,665
should do something
about those foreign wives,
like an embargo.

4654
06:17:18,700 --> 06:17:21,101
How else can we take care
of our own surplus?

4655
06:17:21,136 --> 06:17:22,635
Don't you agree,
Sir Wilfrid?

4656
06:17:22,670 --> 06:17:24,304
All right, hop in.

4657
06:17:26,207 --> 06:17:27,207
Sir Wilfrid?

4658
06:17:31,312 --> 06:17:32,312
Sir Wilfrid!

4659
06:17:33,148 --> 06:17:35,181
Come back!

4660
06:17:35,216 --> 06:17:36,783
Yes, of course I knew
that Leonard

4661
06:17:36,818 --> 06:17:38,852
had been seeing Mrs. French
quite frequently.

4662
06:17:40,221 --> 06:17:41,688
Go on, go on.

4663
06:17:41,723 --> 06:17:43,490
I knew it from the day
when he came home

4664
06:17:43,525 --> 06:17:45,792
with a pair of green socks
she had knitted for him.

4665
06:17:45,827 --> 06:17:49,129
Well, that's quite natural.
I'm sure the jury will find it
rather endearing.

4666
06:17:49,164 --> 06:17:50,964
Oh, Leonard can be
very endearing.

4667
06:17:50,999 --> 06:17:53,033
He hates that particular
shade of green

4668
06:17:53,068 --> 06:17:55,301
and the socks were two sizes
too large,

4669
06:17:55,336 --> 06:17:58,138
but he wore them
just the same,
just to give her pleasure.

4670
06:17:58,173 --> 06:18:00,373
Leonard has a way
with women.

4671
06:18:00,408 --> 06:18:03,143
I only hope he will have
an all-woman jury.

4672
06:18:03,178 --> 06:18:06,046
They will carry him
from the courtroom in triumph.

4673
06:18:06,081 --> 06:18:08,181
(CHUCKLING) A simple
acquittal will do.

4674
06:18:08,216 --> 06:18:11,518
Now, Mrs. Vole,
you know that Mrs. French
left your husband money?

4675
06:18:11,553 --> 06:18:14,154
Yes, a lot of money.

4676
06:18:14,189 --> 06:18:18,224
Of course, your husband
had no previous knowledge
of this bequest.

4677
06:18:18,259 --> 06:18:21,161
Is that what he told you?

4678
06:18:21,196 --> 06:18:23,663
Well, surely, Mrs. Vole,
you're not suggesting
anything different?

4679
06:18:23,698 --> 06:18:25,565
Oh, no. No.

4680
06:18:25,600 --> 06:18:28,234
I do not suggest anything.

4681
06:18:28,269 --> 06:18:31,337
Quite obviously, Mrs. French
had come to look
upon your husband

4682
06:18:31,372 --> 06:18:34,374
as a son or, perhaps,
a favorite nephew.

4683
06:18:34,409 --> 06:18:38,011
You think Mrs. French
looked upon Leonard
as a son or a nephew?

4684
06:18:38,046 --> 06:18:39,879
I do. An entirely natural

4685
06:18:39,914 --> 06:18:42,182
and understandable
relationship.

4686
06:18:42,217 --> 06:18:44,217
What hypocrites
you are in this country.

4687
06:18:47,122 --> 06:18:49,923
Pardon me,
Brogan-Moore.

4688
06:18:49,958 --> 06:18:53,026
Mrs. Vole, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

4689
06:18:53,061 --> 06:18:55,428
Go right ahead,
Sir Wilfrid.

4690
06:18:55,463 --> 06:18:58,698
Mrs. Vole, you realize
your husband's entire defense
rests on his word and yours.

4691
06:18:58,733 --> 06:19:00,533
I realize that.

4692
06:19:00,568 --> 06:19:02,368
And that the jury
will be quite skeptical

4693
06:19:02,403 --> 06:19:04,037
of the word of a man
accused of murder

4694
06:19:04,072 --> 06:19:06,272
when supported only
by the word of his wife?

4695
06:19:06,307 --> 06:19:08,575
I realize that, too.

4696
06:19:08,610 --> 06:19:11,711
Let us then at least
make sure that the two
are not in conflict.

4697
06:19:11,746 --> 06:19:13,746
CHRISTINE: By all means,
let's.

4698
06:19:13,781 --> 06:19:16,249
Mrs. Vole, I assume
you want to help
your husband?

4699
06:19:16,284 --> 06:19:17,617
Of course I want
to help Leonard,

4700
06:19:17,652 --> 06:19:19,285
I want to help
Mr. Brogan-Moore,

4701
06:19:19,320 --> 06:19:21,554
and I want to help you,
Sir Wilfrid.

4702
06:19:21,589 --> 06:19:23,957
There.

4703
06:19:23,992 --> 06:19:26,726
Isn't that more
comfortable for you?

4704
06:19:26,761 --> 06:19:30,130
Now, Mrs. Vole,
this is very important.

4705
06:19:30,165 --> 06:19:33,399
On the night of the murder,
your husband came home
before 9:30.

4706
06:19:33,434 --> 06:19:35,568
Is that correct?
CHRISTINE: Precisely.

4707
06:19:35,603 --> 06:19:37,570
Isn't that what
he wants me to say?

4708
06:19:37,605 --> 06:19:39,639
Isn't it the truth?

4709
06:19:39,674 --> 06:19:41,574
Of course.

4710
06:19:41,609 --> 06:19:43,109
But when I told it
to the police,

4711
06:19:43,144 --> 06:19:44,744
I do not think
they believed me.

4712
06:19:44,779 --> 06:19:46,446
Maybe I didn't say it well.

4713
06:19:46,481 --> 06:19:48,114
Maybe because
of my accent.

4714
06:19:48,149 --> 06:19:50,650
My dear Mrs. Vole,
in our courts

4715
06:19:50,685 --> 06:19:54,254
we will accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak
only Bulgarian

4716
06:19:54,289 --> 06:19:56,923
and who must have
an interpreter.

4717
06:19:56,958 --> 06:20:00,260
We will accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot
speak at all,

4718
06:20:00,295 --> 06:20:02,262
as long as they tell
the truth.

4719
06:20:02,297 --> 06:20:03,763
You're aware,
of course,

4720
06:20:03,798 --> 06:20:05,798
that when I put you
in the witness box,

4721
06:20:05,833 --> 06:20:07,467
you will be sworn
and you will testify
under oath?

4722
06:20:07,502 --> 06:20:09,302
Yes.

4723
06:20:09,337 --> 06:20:11,938
Leonard came home
at 9:26 precisely

4724
06:20:11,973 --> 06:20:13,640
and did not go out again.

4725
06:20:13,675 --> 06:20:16,943
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

4726
06:20:16,978 --> 06:20:18,211
Is that better?

4727
06:20:20,315 --> 06:20:24,284
Mrs. Vole, do you love
your husband?

4728
06:20:24,319 --> 06:20:27,453
Leonard thinks I do.
Well, do you?

4729
06:20:27,488 --> 06:20:29,622
Am I already under oath?

4730
06:20:29,657 --> 06:20:31,457
Mrs. Vole, whatever
your gambit may be,

4731
06:20:31,492 --> 06:20:33,793
do you know
that under British law

4732
06:20:33,828 --> 06:20:37,130
you cannot be called
to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

4733
06:20:37,165 --> 06:20:39,199
How very convenient.

4734
06:20:39,234 --> 06:20:41,668
We are dealing
with a capital crime.

4735
06:20:41,703 --> 06:20:46,005
The prosecution will try
to hang your husband.

4736
06:20:46,040 --> 06:20:47,574
He is not my husband.

4737
06:20:55,350 --> 06:20:58,151
Leonard and I went
through a form of marriage
in Hamburg,

4738
06:20:58,186 --> 06:21:00,553
but I had a husband
living at the time,
somewhere in East Germany

4739
06:21:00,588 --> 06:21:02,188
in the Russian zone.

4740
06:21:02,223 --> 06:21:04,324
Did you tell Leonard?
I did not.

4741
06:21:04,359 --> 06:21:06,059
It would have been stupid
to tell him.

4742
06:21:06,094 --> 06:21:07,493
He would not
have married me

4743
06:21:07,528 --> 06:21:08,661
and I would have
been left behind,

4744
06:21:08,696 --> 06:21:11,164
to starve in the rubble.

4745
06:21:11,199 --> 06:21:13,333
But he did marry you
and brought you safely
to this country.

4746
06:21:13,368 --> 06:21:15,735
Don't you think you should
be very grateful to him?

4747
06:21:15,770 --> 06:21:18,071
One can get very tired
of gratitude.

4748
06:21:18,106 --> 06:21:20,340
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

4749
06:21:20,375 --> 06:21:22,041
Leonard?

4750
06:21:22,076 --> 06:21:24,177
He worships the ground
I walk on.

4751
06:21:24,212 --> 06:21:26,579
And you?

4752
06:21:26,614 --> 06:21:29,015
You want to know
too much.

4753
06:21:29,050 --> 06:21:30,717
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i>
gentlemen.

4754
06:21:32,553 --> 06:21:34,187
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Vole.

4755
06:21:34,222 --> 06:21:36,723
Your visit has been
most reassuring.

4756
06:21:38,092 --> 06:21:40,193
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid.

4757
06:21:40,228 --> 06:21:43,062
I will give him an alibi
and I shall be
very convincing.

4758
06:21:43,097 --> 06:21:45,265
There will be tears
in my eyes when I say,

4759
06:21:45,300 --> 06:21:48,401
"Leonard came home
at 9:26 precisely."

4760
06:21:48,436 --> 06:21:51,438
You're a very remarkable
woman, Mrs. Vole.

4761
06:21:53,074 --> 06:21:55,541
And you're satisfied,
I hope?

4762
06:21:55,576 --> 06:21:56,776
(DOOR CLOSING)

4763
06:21:56,811 --> 06:22:00,580
I'm damned
if I'm satisfied.

4764
06:22:00,615 --> 06:22:02,782
Care to join me
in a whiff of those
smelling salts?

4765
06:22:02,817 --> 06:22:05,451
The woman's
up to something,
but what?

4766
06:22:05,486 --> 06:22:07,387
The prosecution
will break her
down in no time

4767
06:22:07,422 --> 06:22:09,222
when I put her
in the witness box.

4768
06:22:09,257 --> 06:22:10,557
You know,
defending this case

4769
06:22:10,592 --> 06:22:13,426
is going to be
rather like <i>The Charge</i>
<i>Of The Light Brigade</i>

4770
06:22:13,461 --> 06:22:15,461
or one of those Japanese
suicide pilots.

4771
06:22:15,496 --> 06:22:19,465
Quite one-sided,
with the odds
all on the other side.

4772
06:22:19,500 --> 06:22:22,135
I haven't got
much to go on,
have I?

4773
06:22:22,170 --> 06:22:23,770
The fact is,
I've got nothing.

4774
06:22:25,807 --> 06:22:28,241
Let me ask you something.

4775
06:22:28,276 --> 06:22:31,144
Do you believe
Leonard Vole is innocent?

4776
06:22:34,449 --> 06:22:35,615
Do you?

4777
06:22:37,785 --> 06:22:39,119
Do you?

4778
06:22:40,488 --> 06:22:42,922
I'm not sure.

4779
06:22:42,957 --> 06:22:46,659
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

4780
06:22:46,694 --> 06:22:49,128
It's all right,
Brogan-Moore.

4781
06:22:49,163 --> 06:22:53,433
I'll take it from here.

4782
06:22:53,468 --> 06:22:55,335
I have called
Dr. Harrison
and given him

4783
06:22:55,370 --> 06:22:57,503
a complete report
on your shocking behavior.

4784
06:22:57,538 --> 06:22:59,439
I can no longer...

4785
06:22:59,474 --> 06:23:01,107
Give me a match,
Miss Plimsoll.
Sir Wilfrid!

4786
06:23:01,142 --> 06:23:03,510
Did you hear me?
A match!

4787
06:23:35,910 --> 06:23:37,643
Hello, Mr. Mayhew.

4788
06:23:37,678 --> 06:23:40,012
Sir Wilfrid.

4789
06:23:40,047 --> 06:23:41,814
Mr. Mayhew tells me
that you are going
to represent me.

4790
06:23:41,849 --> 06:23:44,016
I'm very grateful.
I struck a bargain
with my doctors.

4791
06:23:44,051 --> 06:23:45,885
I let them exile me
to Bermuda

4792
06:23:45,920 --> 06:23:48,721
as soon as
we finish your case.
Thank you.

4793
06:23:48,756 --> 06:23:50,323
Let's hope
that we shall
both survive.

4794
06:23:50,358 --> 06:23:52,058
Get into these, will you.
We need a photograph.

4795
06:23:52,093 --> 06:23:53,826
What for?
Cause these were what
you were wearing

4796
06:23:53,861 --> 06:23:55,161
on the night
of the murder.

4797
06:23:55,196 --> 06:23:56,562
We want to circulate
a photograph

4798
06:23:56,597 --> 06:23:58,164
on the chance
that someone did see you

4799
06:23:58,199 --> 06:23:59,365
leaving Mrs. French
on your way home.

4800
06:23:59,400 --> 06:24:00,934
Over here
against the wall, please.

4801
06:24:03,538 --> 06:24:05,338
Now, hold it.

4802
06:24:05,373 --> 06:24:07,173
Now, one more
in profile, please.

4803
06:24:07,208 --> 06:24:08,875
I mean, after all,
do we really need this?

4804
06:24:08,910 --> 06:24:10,710
My wife knows
what time I came
home that night.

4805
06:24:10,745 --> 06:24:13,679
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

4806
06:24:13,714 --> 06:24:16,682
Yes, of course.
Christine is an
interested witness.

4807
06:24:16,717 --> 06:24:18,551
I'll pick up
the negatives later,
thank you.

4808
06:24:18,586 --> 06:24:20,520
I don't understand it.

4809
06:24:20,555 --> 06:24:22,555
Why hasn't she come
to see me?

4810
06:24:24,058 --> 06:24:25,691
Won't they
let her see me?

4811
06:24:25,726 --> 06:24:27,693
I mean, it's been
two weeks now.

4812
06:24:27,728 --> 06:24:30,696
Mayhew, give me
the reports.

4813
06:24:30,731 --> 06:24:32,265
Have you been
talking to her?

4814
06:24:32,300 --> 06:24:34,066
Is there something
the matter with her?

4815
06:24:34,101 --> 06:24:36,269
I want to read you
a portion of the evidence

4816
06:24:36,304 --> 06:24:38,238
of Janet McKenzie,
the housekeeper.

4817
06:24:43,277 --> 06:24:46,946
"Mr. Vole helped Mrs. French
with her business affairs

4818
06:24:46,981 --> 06:24:48,581
"particularly
her income tax returns."

4819
06:24:48,616 --> 06:24:50,383
LEONARD: Oh, yes, I did.

4820
06:24:50,418 --> 06:24:52,552
Some of those forms
are very complicated.

4821
06:24:52,587 --> 06:24:55,455
There's also a hint
you may have helped her
draft her new will.

4822
06:24:55,490 --> 06:24:56,789
Oh, that's not true!

4823
06:24:56,824 --> 06:24:58,724
If Janet said that,
she's lying!

4824
06:24:58,759 --> 06:24:59,725
She was always against me.

4825
06:24:59,760 --> 06:25:01,127
I--I don't know why.

4826
06:25:01,162 --> 06:25:02,628
Well, it's quite obvious.

4827
06:25:02,663 --> 06:25:04,464
You threw an eggbeater

4828
06:25:04,499 --> 06:25:07,900
into the wheels
of her Victorian household.

4829
06:25:07,935 --> 06:25:09,735
Now, um, what about
this cut on your wrist?

4830
06:25:09,770 --> 06:25:11,604
You told the police
you cut yourself with a knife.

4831
06:25:11,639 --> 06:25:13,473
Well, that's true. I did.

4832
06:25:13,508 --> 06:25:15,608
I was cutting bread
and the knife slipped.

4833
06:25:15,643 --> 06:25:18,077
But that was two days
after the murder.

4834
06:25:18,112 --> 06:25:21,314
Christine was there.
She'll tell them
when she gives evidence.

4835
06:25:23,317 --> 06:25:25,751
Are you keeping
something from me?

4836
06:25:25,786 --> 06:25:28,421
Is she ill?
Was she shocked
by what happened to me?

4837
06:25:28,456 --> 06:25:30,256
All things considered,
I think she took it very well.

4838
06:25:30,291 --> 06:25:32,258
Of course, that may have
only been on the surface.

4839
06:25:32,293 --> 06:25:35,595
Wives are often
profoundly disturbed
at such a time.

4840
06:25:35,630 --> 06:25:37,263
Yes, it must
be hard on her.

4841
06:25:37,298 --> 06:25:38,631
We've never been
separated before

4842
06:25:38,666 --> 06:25:40,266
not since
our first meeting.

4843
06:25:40,301 --> 06:25:43,169
How did you meet
your wife, Mr. Vole?

4844
06:25:43,204 --> 06:25:45,004
In Germany, in 1945.

4845
06:25:46,641 --> 06:25:47,840
It's rather funny.

4846
06:25:47,875 --> 06:25:49,275
The very first time
I saw her,

4847
06:25:49,310 --> 06:25:52,278
the ceiling fell
right in on me.

4848
06:25:52,313 --> 06:25:53,980
<i>LEONARD: I was stationed</i>
<i>outside Hamburg,</i>

4849
06:25:54,015 --> 06:25:56,282
<i>with an RAF</i>
<i>Maintenance unit.</i>

4850
06:25:56,317 --> 06:25:58,317
<i>I'd just installed</i>
<i>a shower in the</i>

5001
06:33:37,611 --> 06:33:40,245

I am not putting her
in the witness box.

You're not? Why not?

5011
06:34:02,336 --> 06:34:04,436
Well, for one thing,
she's a foreigner,

with the subtleties
of our language.

5013

wish each other luck.

But I can't face
this without Christine.

5026

I tell you,
I'm scared.

5027
06:34:41,008 --> 06:34:42,675
I need her.
Without her, I'm sunk.

5028
06:34:44,678 --> 06:34:46,545
Touching, isn't it?

5029
06:34:46,580 --> 06:34:49,481
The way he counts
on his wife.
Yes.

5030
06:34:49,516 --> 06:34:52,885

on indictment

5033

for that you,
on the 14th day of October,

in the county
of London,

06:35:18,712 --> 06:35:22,014
murdered
Emily Jane French.

How say you,

5037
06:35:24,551 --> 06:35:26,018
Are you guilty

5038
06:35:26,053 --> 06:35:27,086
or not guilty?

5039
06:35:29,556 --> 06:35:30,790
Not guilty.

on the 14th day of October

5043
06:35:40,300 --> 06:35:43,368
murdered

5044
06:35:43,403 --> 06:35:45,537
To this indictment
he has pleaded,

5045
06:35:45,572 --> 06:35:47,206
"Not guilty,"

5046
06:35:47,241 --> 06:35:49,208
and it is your
charge to say,

5047
06:35:49,243 --> 06:35:51,043
having heard
the evidence,

5048
06:35:51,078 --> 06:35:53,779
whether he be guilty
or not.

which you have just taken,

to try this case
on the evidence.

from your minds

what will take
place in this court.

for the prosecution,

with my learned
friend, Mr. Barton,

5059
06:36:22,676 --> 06:36:24,076

and Mr. Brogan-Moore,

appear for the defense.

5063
06:36:34,454 --> 06:36:37,089
I trust we are not
to be deprived

5064
06:36:37,124 --> 06:36:40,259
of the learned
and stimulating presence
of Sir Wilfrid.

5065
06:36:40,294 --> 06:36:42,928
Ah, my Lord, may I assure
my learned friend
of the prosecution

5066
06:36:42,963 --> 06:36:44,596
that Sir Wilfrid is
in the Old Bailey.

5067
06:36:44,631 --> 06:36:45,797
He's slightly
incapacitated,

5068
06:36:45,832 --> 06:36:47,599
but he'll be
in his seat presently.

5069
06:36:47,634 --> 06:36:50,135
My Lord,
may I express my regret

5070
06:36:50,170 --> 06:36:52,804
that Sir Wilfrid
is even slightly
incapacitated?

5071
06:36:52,839 --> 06:36:54,940
You may, Mr. Myers.

5072
06:36:54,975 --> 06:36:58,677
You may also proceed
with the case
for the prosecution.

5073

Thank you, my Lord.

5074

Uh, the facts in this case
are simple

5075
06:37:02,849 --> 06:37:04,816
and to a point,
not in dispute.

5076
06:37:04,851 --> 06:37:06,852
You will hear
how the prisoner

5077
06:37:06,887 --> 06:37:09,154
made the acquaintance
of Mrs. Emily French,

5078
06:37:09,189 --> 06:37:11,323
a woman of 56.

5079
06:37:11,358 --> 06:37:15,360
How he was treated
by her with kindness
and even affection.

5080
06:37:15,395 --> 06:37:18,130
On the night of
October the 14th last,

5081
06:37:18,165 --> 06:37:19,698
between 9:30 and 10:00,

5082
06:37:19,733 --> 06:37:23,302
Mrs. French was murdered.

5083
06:37:23,337 --> 06:37:25,003
Medical testimony
will be introduced

5084
06:37:25,038 --> 06:37:27,172
to prove that
death was caused

5085
06:37:27,207 --> 06:37:29,374
by a blow from a blunt
and heavy instrument.

5086
06:37:29,409 --> 06:37:32,010
And it is the case
for the prosecution

5087
06:37:32,045 --> 06:37:33,645
that the blow was dealt

5088
06:37:33,680 --> 06:37:35,347
by the prisoner,
Leonard Vole.

5089
06:37:35,382 --> 06:37:37,216

I didn't do it!

None. Just the one blow.

had taken Mrs. French
by surprise?

was a man or a woman.

have been the murderess.

from the witness
an opinion

to do better than that,

that a robbery
had been committed?

5195
06:41:41,161 --> 06:41:44,062
Yes.
Things were strewn about

5196
06:41:44,097 --> 06:41:46,398
and the window
had been broken
near the catch.

5197
06:41:46,433 --> 06:41:48,233
There was glass
on the floor

5198
06:41:48,268 --> 06:41:50,469
and fragments
were found outside.

5199
06:41:50,504 --> 06:41:53,572
The glass outside
was not consistent

5200
06:41:53,607 --> 06:41:55,941
with the window
having been forced
from the outside.

5201
06:41:55,976 --> 06:41:57,642
What you are saying

5202
06:41:57,677 --> 06:42:00,245
is that someone attempted
to make it look

5203
06:42:00,280 --> 06:42:01,746
as if the window
had been forced

5204
06:42:01,781 --> 06:42:03,081
from the outside,
isn't that so?

5205
06:42:03,116 --> 06:42:05,250
My Lord, I must object.

5206
06:42:05,285 --> 06:42:07,986
My learned friend
is putting words
in the witness' mouth.

5207
06:42:08,021 --> 06:42:10,956
After all,
if he insists on answering
his own questions,

5208
06:42:10,991 --> 06:42:13,992
the presence
of the witness
would seem superfluous.

5209
06:42:14,027 --> 06:42:16,628
Quite.
Don't you think so,
Mr. Myers?

5210
06:42:16,663 --> 06:42:18,130
MYERS: Yes, my Lord.

5211
06:42:19,866 --> 06:42:22,434
Inspector,
did you ascertain

5212
06:42:22,469 --> 06:42:25,437
if any of
the murdered woman's
property was missing?

5213
06:42:25,472 --> 06:42:28,340
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

5214
06:42:28,375 --> 06:42:30,775
In your experience,
Inspector,

5215
06:42:30,810 --> 06:42:31,943
when burglars

5216
06:42:31,978 --> 06:42:34,513
or burglaresses

5217
06:42:34,548 --> 06:42:37,949
break into a house,
do they leave
without taking anything?

5218
06:42:37,984 --> 06:42:39,451
No, sir.

5219
06:42:39,486 --> 06:42:41,319
Do you produce
a jacket, Inspector?

5220
06:42:41,354 --> 06:42:42,454
Yes, sir.

5221
06:42:42,489 --> 06:42:43,889
Is that the jacket?

5222
06:42:47,661 --> 06:42:49,127
Yes, sir.

5223
06:42:49,162 --> 06:42:52,030
That is exhibit P1,
my Lord.

5224
06:42:52,065 --> 06:42:54,132
Where did you
find this, Inspector?

5225
06:42:54,167 --> 06:42:56,968
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

5226
06:42:57,003 --> 06:42:59,337
which I handed
to our lab to test
for bloodstains.

5227
06:42:59,372 --> 06:43:01,640
And did you find
any bloodstains?

5228
06:43:01,675 --> 06:43:04,676
Yes, though an attempt
had been made
to wash them out.

5229
06:43:04,711 --> 06:43:07,145
What tests
did the laboratory make?

5230
06:43:07,180 --> 06:43:11,049
First, to determine
if the stains were made
by human blood,

5231
06:43:11,084 --> 06:43:14,019
then to classify it
by group or type.

5232
06:43:14,054 --> 06:43:16,488
And was the blood
of a particular
group or type?

5233
06:43:16,523 --> 06:43:19,658
Yes, sir.
It is type O.

5234
06:43:19,693 --> 06:43:22,561
And did you subsequently test
the blood of the dead woman?

5235
06:43:22,596 --> 06:43:23,662
Yes, sir.

5236
06:43:23,697 --> 06:43:24,763
What type was that?

5237
06:43:26,700 --> 06:43:29,334
The same, type O.

5238
06:43:29,369 --> 06:43:32,037
MYERS:
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

5239
06:43:32,939 --> 06:43:34,839
Inspector,

5240
06:43:34,874 --> 06:43:36,741
you say that
the only fingerprints
you found

5241
06:43:36,776 --> 06:43:38,710
were those
of Mrs. French,

5242
06:43:38,745 --> 06:43:40,712
Janet McKenzie
and the prisoner,
Leonard Vole.

5243
06:43:40,747 --> 06:43:44,349
In your experience,
when a burglar breaks in,

5244
06:43:44,384 --> 06:43:46,051
does he usually
leave fingerprints,

5245
06:43:46,086 --> 06:43:47,185
or does he
wear gloves?

5246
06:43:47,220 --> 06:43:49,020
He wears gloves.

5247
06:43:49,055 --> 06:43:51,022
So the absence
of fingerprints
in the case of robbery

5248
06:43:51,057 --> 06:43:52,023
would hardly
surprise you?

5249
06:43:52,058 --> 06:43:53,058
No, sir.

5250
06:43:53,093 --> 06:43:54,426
Can't we then surmise

5251
06:43:54,461 --> 06:43:56,061
that the burglar
might have entered

5252
06:43:56,096 --> 06:43:58,263
what was presumably
an empty house,

5253
06:43:58,298 --> 06:44:00,031
might have
suddenly encountered
Mrs. French and struck her,

5254
06:44:00,066 --> 06:44:01,533
then realizing
she was dead,

5255
06:44:01,568 --> 06:44:03,902
panicked and fled
without taking anything?

5256
06:44:03,937 --> 06:44:07,772
I submit, my Lord,
that it is entirely impossible
to guess what went on

5257
06:44:07,807 --> 06:44:10,909
in the mind
of some entirely
imaginary burglar,

5258
06:44:10,944 --> 06:44:13,378
uh, with or
without gloves.

5259
06:44:13,413 --> 06:44:15,614
Let us not surmise,
Sir Wilfrid,

5260
06:44:15,649 --> 06:44:17,583
but confine ourselves
to facts.

5261
06:44:20,086 --> 06:44:22,454
Inspector,
when you questioned
the prisoner

5262
06:44:22,489 --> 06:44:24,623
as to the stains
on his jacket,

5263
06:44:24,658 --> 06:44:28,560
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar
on his wrist,

5264
06:44:28,595 --> 06:44:29,794
and tell you that
he had cut himself

5265
06:44:29,829 --> 06:44:31,463
with a kitchen knife
while slicing bread?

5266
06:44:31,498 --> 06:44:33,932
Yes, sir,
that is what he said.

5267
06:44:33,967 --> 06:44:35,900
WILFRID: And were you not
told the same thing
by the prisoner's wife?

5268
06:44:35,935 --> 06:44:37,569
Yes, sir,
but afterwards...

5269
06:44:37,604 --> 06:44:40,138
Just a simple "yes"
or "no," please.

5270
06:44:40,173 --> 06:44:42,474
Did the prisoner's wife
show you a knife,

5271
06:44:42,509 --> 06:44:44,242
and tell you
that her husband

5272
06:44:44,277 --> 06:44:46,444
had cut his wrist
while slicing bread?

5273
06:44:46,479 --> 06:44:48,413
Yes, sir.

5274
06:44:48,448 --> 06:44:50,983
I will ask you to examine
this knife, Inspector.

5275
06:44:55,822 --> 06:44:57,622
Just test
the edge of it
with your finger.

5276
06:44:57,657 --> 06:44:59,257
Carefully!

5277
06:44:59,292 --> 06:45:01,159
You, uh, agree
that the point

5278
06:45:01,194 --> 06:45:03,094
and the cutting edge
are razor-sharp?

5279
06:45:03,129 --> 06:45:04,929
Yes, sir.

5280
06:45:04,964 --> 06:45:06,164
Now then,
if such a knife
were to slip,

5281
06:45:06,199 --> 06:45:07,599
might it not
inflict a cut

5282
06:45:07,634 --> 06:45:08,967
that would bleed
profusely?

5283
06:45:09,002 --> 06:45:11,102
Yes, sir, it might.

5284
06:45:11,137 --> 06:45:13,938
Now, Inspector,
you have stated
that the bloodstains

5285
06:45:13,973 --> 06:45:16,107
on the prisoner's jacket
were analyzed,

5286
06:45:16,142 --> 06:45:18,276
as was the blood
of Mrs. French,

5287
06:45:18,311 --> 06:45:20,979
and they were both found
to be of the same group,
group O?

5288
06:45:21,014 --> 06:45:23,314
That is correct.
However,

5289
06:45:23,349 --> 06:45:25,283
if the prisoner's blood

5290
06:45:25,318 --> 06:45:26,951
were also
of this same group,

5291
06:45:26,986 --> 06:45:29,120
then the stains
on his jacket

5292
06:45:29,155 --> 06:45:31,623
might very well
have resulted
from the household accident

5293
06:45:31,658 --> 06:45:32,657
he described to you.

5294
06:45:32,692 --> 06:45:35,460
Yes, sir.

5295
06:45:35,495 --> 06:45:38,163
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood,
Inspector?

5296
06:45:39,199 --> 06:45:40,232
No, sir.

5297
06:45:42,402 --> 06:45:45,704
I have here a certificate

5298
06:45:45,739 --> 06:45:49,808
stating that
Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

5299
06:45:49,843 --> 06:45:52,343
at the North London hospital

5300
06:45:52,378 --> 06:45:54,312
and that his blood is

5301
06:45:54,347 --> 06:45:55,814
group O.

5302
06:45:55,849 --> 06:45:57,416
(CROWD MURMURING)

5303
06:46:00,186 --> 06:46:01,753
Thank you, Inspector.

5304
06:46:05,859 --> 06:46:08,660
Inspector, granted that
the cut on the wrist

5305
06:46:08,695 --> 06:46:10,662
was caused
by that knife,

5306
06:46:10,697 --> 06:46:12,063
is there
anything to show

5307
06:46:12,098 --> 06:46:13,998
whether it was
an accident

5308
06:46:14,033 --> 06:46:16,868
or done deliberately
after the murder

5309
06:46:16,903 --> 06:46:18,203
to account for
the bloodstains?

5310
06:46:18,238 --> 06:46:19,671
Oh, really,
my Lord!

5311
06:46:19,706 --> 06:46:21,172
I withdraw
the question.

5312
06:46:21,207 --> 06:46:22,874
You may stand
down, Inspector.

5313
06:46:25,278 --> 06:46:26,845
MYERS: Call Janet McKenzie.

5314
06:46:26,880 --> 06:46:28,246

that the evidence
that I shall give

JANET: Aye,
that's my name.

5324
06:47:10,490 --> 06:47:12,457
When did you
first come to London?

5325
06:47:12,492 --> 06:47:15,560
That was many years ago.
Twenty eight years ago.

5326
06:47:15,595 --> 06:47:17,428
Where do you live?

5327
06:47:17,463 --> 06:47:20,231
Now that Mrs. French,
poor soul, is dead,

5328
06:47:20,266 --> 06:47:23,902
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

5329
06:47:23,937 --> 06:47:26,070
Uh, you were
companion-housekeeper

5330
06:47:26,105 --> 06:47:27,405
to the late
Mrs. Emily French?

5331
06:47:27,440 --> 06:47:29,240
I was her housekeeper.

5332
06:47:29,275 --> 06:47:30,742
I've no opinion
of companions

afraid to do
a bit of honest
domestic work.

5335
06:47:34,280 --> 06:47:35,246
Quite.
What I meant was,

5336
06:47:35,281 --> 06:47:37,248
you were on
friendly terms

5337
06:47:37,283 --> 06:47:39,417
not altogether
those of a mistress
and a servant.

5338
06:47:39,452 --> 06:47:41,085
Aye.

5339
06:47:41,120 --> 06:47:42,754
Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

5340
06:47:42,789 --> 06:47:45,256
She knew me and
she trusted me.

5341
06:47:45,291 --> 06:47:48,760
Ah, many's the time
I prevented her of doing
a foolish thing.

5342
06:47:48,795 --> 06:47:50,795
Please tell us,
in your own words,

5343
06:47:50,830 --> 06:47:54,165
about the events
of the evening
of October the 14.

5344
06:47:54,200 --> 06:47:55,967
It was a Friday
and my night out.

5345
06:47:56,002 --> 06:47:58,102
I was going round
to see my niece

5346
06:47:58,137 --> 06:48:00,305
at Glenister Road,
which is about
five minutes' walk.

5347
06:48:00,340 --> 06:48:03,141
I left the house
at half past seven.

5348
06:48:03,176 --> 06:48:05,610
I'd promised to take her
a dress pattern
that she admired.

(GASPING)

5350
06:48:07,380 --> 06:48:09,113
Oh, is this thing
necessary?

5351
06:48:09,148 --> 06:48:11,115
An excellent
question.

5352
06:48:11,150 --> 06:48:12,617
However,
it has been installed

5353
06:48:12,652 --> 06:48:15,687
at considerable expense
to the taxpayers,

5354
06:48:15,722 --> 06:48:17,655
so let us take
advantage of it.

5355
06:48:17,690 --> 06:48:19,290
Please continue.

5356
06:48:19,325 --> 06:48:21,459
Well, when I got
to my niece's,

5357
06:48:21,494 --> 06:48:23,361
I found I'd left
the pattern behind.

5358
06:48:23,396 --> 06:48:24,863
So after supper,
I slipped back to get it,

5359
06:48:24,898 --> 06:48:26,798
as it was no distance.

5360
06:48:26,833 --> 06:48:30,301
I got back to the house
at 25 past nine.

5361
06:48:30,336 --> 06:48:32,637
I let myself in
and I went upstairs
to my room.

5362
06:48:32,672 --> 06:48:34,873
As I passed
the sitting room,

5363
06:48:34,908 --> 06:48:38,176
I heard the prisoner
in there, talking

06:48:45,885 --> 06:48:48,219

I fetched my pattern.

very exact as to the time.

you reentered the house

was on a shelf in my room
next to my clock,

5372

And then I said
good night to them
and I come home.

5381
06:49:19,385 --> 06:49:20,752
I went into
the sitting room then

5382
06:49:20,787 --> 06:49:23,021
to see if the mistress
wanted anything

5383
06:49:23,056 --> 06:49:25,056
before she went to bed,

5384
06:49:25,091 --> 06:49:26,591

hither and thither.

that a burglary
had been committed?

were you aware

5391
06:49:41,407 --> 06:49:43,408
that Leonard Vole
was a married man?

5392
06:49:43,443 --> 06:49:45,043
No, indeed.

5393
06:49:45,078 --> 06:49:46,544

is pure conjecture
on Janet McKenzie's part.

5397
06:49:55,288 --> 06:49:58,089
Let me put it this way,
you formed the opinion

5398
06:49:58,124 --> 06:50:01,392
that Mrs. French
thought Leonard Vole
was a single man?

5399
06:50:01,427 --> 06:50:03,394
Have you any facts
to support that opinion?

5400
06:50:03,429 --> 06:50:05,129
Well, there were the books
that she ordered.

that married men

than themselves.

06:50:34,160 --> 06:50:36,160
were you aware
of what arrangements

5415
06:50:36,195 --> 06:50:38,296
Mrs. French had made
for the disposal
of her money?

5416
06:50:38,331 --> 06:50:39,831
She had
her old will revoked

5417
06:50:39,866 --> 06:50:41,833
and a new one drawn up.

5418
06:50:41,868 --> 06:50:44,268
I heard her
calling Mr. Stokes,
her solicitor.

5419
06:50:44,303 --> 06:50:47,605
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

5420
06:50:47,640 --> 06:50:49,841
You heard Mrs. French
and the prisoner

5421

discussing her new will?

5422
06:50:51,878 --> 06:50:54,345
Yes. He was to have
all her money,
she told him,

5423
06:50:54,380 --> 06:50:55,980
as she had
no near relations,

5424
06:50:56,015 --> 06:50:58,683
nor anybody
that meant to her
what he did.

take place?

06:51:02,488 --> 06:51:05,957

before she was murdered.

you have given evidence
about two wills.

06:51:21,374 --> 06:51:24,175
In the old will,
the will that was revoked,

5435
06:51:24,210 --> 06:51:27,478
were you
not to receive the bulk
of Mrs. French's estate?

5436
06:51:27,513 --> 06:51:28,980
Aye, that's so.

5437
06:51:29,015 --> 06:51:30,481
Whereas
in the new will,

except for a bequest
to you of a small annuity,

5439
06:51:33,386 --> 06:51:37,155

is the prisoner,
Leonard Vole?

a wicked injustice

what they actually said.

heard the voices?

the man's voice
was Leonard Vole's?

Aye, that's so.

You were no doubt
in a hurry
to get the pattern,

5465
06:52:30,743 --> 06:52:33,878
so you probably
walked quickly
past the closed door,

5466

yet you are sure
you heard
Leonard Vole's voice?

to hear what I heard.

wish to suggest

eavesdropping.

in there with her.

could it have been?

you wanted it to be him.

was the television,

5533
06:55:18,244 --> 06:55:19,944
Police Constable Jeffries.

5534
06:55:31,490 --> 06:55:34,558
JEFFRIES:
I swear by almighty God,
that the evidence I shall give

5535
06:55:34,593 --> 06:55:37,929
shall be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

5536
06:55:52,945 --> 06:55:55,479
JUDGE:
Mr. Myers, does that
conclude your case?

5537
06:55:55,514 --> 06:55:57,748
No, my Lord.

5538
06:55:57,783 --> 06:55:59,583
I now call
the final witness
for the prosecution,

5539
06:55:59,618 --> 06:56:01,252
Christine Helm.

5540
06:56:01,287 --> 06:56:02,620
USHER: Christine Helm.

5541
06:56:02,655 --> 06:56:03,921
POLICEMAN 1:
Christine Helm.

5542
06:56:03,956 --> 06:56:05,523
POLICEMAN 2:
Christine Helm.

5543
06:56:16,168 --> 06:56:17,335
Christine!

5544
06:56:29,348 --> 06:56:32,316
I swear by almighty God,
that the evidence I shall give

5545
06:56:32,351 --> 06:56:35,786
shall be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

5546
06:56:35,821 --> 06:56:38,956
My Lord, I have the most
serious objection

5547
06:56:38,991 --> 06:56:41,125
to this witness
being summoned
by the prosecution,

5548
06:56:41,160 --> 06:56:42,793
as she is the wife
of the prisoner,
Leonard Vole.

5549
06:56:42,828 --> 06:56:45,162
My Lord, I call
my learned friend's attention

5550
06:56:45,197 --> 06:56:49,633
to the fact that
I summoned not Mrs. Vole,
but Mrs. Helm.

5551
06:56:49,668 --> 06:56:51,836
Your name, in fact,
is Christine Helm?

5552
06:56:51,871 --> 06:56:53,971
Yes, Christine Helm.

5553
06:56:54,006 --> 06:56:55,973
And you have been
living as the wife

5554
06:56:56,008 --> 06:56:58,542
of the prisoner,
Leonard Vole?
CHRISTINE: Yes.

5555
06:56:58,577 --> 06:57:00,478
Are you actually
his wife?

5556
06:57:00,513 --> 06:57:02,847
No.

5557
06:57:02,882 --> 06:57:05,716
I went through
a marriage ceremony
with him in Hamburg,

5558
06:57:05,751 --> 06:57:07,985
but I already
had a husband.
He's still alive.

5559
06:57:08,020 --> 06:57:10,154
Christine, that's not true!

5560
06:57:10,189 --> 06:57:11,822
My Lord, there is proof
of a marriage

5561
06:57:11,857 --> 06:57:13,724
between the witness
and the prisoner.

5562
06:57:13,759 --> 06:57:16,827
But is there any proof
of a so-called
previous marriage?

5563
06:57:16,862 --> 06:57:19,997
My Lord, the so-called
previous marriage

5564
06:57:20,032 --> 06:57:22,166
is, in fact,
well documented.

5565
06:57:22,201 --> 06:57:23,534
Mrs. Helm,

5566
06:57:23,569 --> 06:57:25,336
is this a certificate
of marriage

5567
06:57:25,371 --> 06:57:28,906
between yourself and
one Otto Ludwig Helm?

5568
06:57:28,941 --> 06:57:33,544
The ceremony having
taken place in Breslau
on April 18, 1942?

5569
06:57:33,579 --> 06:57:36,380
Yes, that is the paper
of my marriage.

5570
06:57:36,415 --> 06:57:39,016
I don't see any reason
why this witness

5571
06:57:39,051 --> 06:57:41,052
should not be qualified
to give evidence.

5572
06:57:46,425 --> 06:57:48,692
Uh, Mrs. Helm, are you willing
to give evidence

5573
06:57:48,727 --> 06:57:50,761
against the man you've been
calling your husband?

5574
06:57:50,796 --> 06:57:53,197
Yes.

5575
06:57:53,232 --> 06:57:54,865
You stated to the police
that on the night

5576
06:57:54,900 --> 06:57:57,034
that Mrs. French was murdered,

5577
06:57:57,069 --> 06:57:59,103
Leonard Vole left the house
at 7:30

5578
06:57:59,138 --> 06:58:02,406
and returned at 9:25.

5579
06:58:02,441 --> 06:58:04,809
Did he, in fact,
return at 9:25?

5580
06:58:06,479 --> 06:58:07,745
No.

5581
06:58:07,780 --> 06:58:09,580
He returned at 10:10.

5582
06:58:09,615 --> 06:58:11,415
Christine,
what are you saying?

5583
06:58:11,450 --> 06:58:14,084
It's not true!
You know it's not true!

5586
06:58:20,259 --> 06:58:21,759
I must have silence.

5587
06:58:23,929 --> 06:58:25,896
As your counsel
will tell you, Vole,

5588
06:58:25,931 --> 06:58:28,098
you will very shortly
have an opportunity

5589
06:58:28,133 --> 06:58:30,301
of speaking
in your own defense.

5590
06:58:30,336 --> 06:58:33,971
Leonard Vole returned,
you say, at 10:10.

5591
06:58:34,006 --> 06:58:35,773
And what happened next?

5592
06:58:35,808 --> 06:58:38,075
He was breathing hard,
very excited.

5593
06:58:38,110 --> 06:58:40,811
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

5594
06:58:40,846 --> 06:58:42,913
Then he told me
to wash the cuffs.

5595
06:58:42,948 --> 06:58:44,248
They had blood on them.

5596
06:58:44,283 --> 06:58:45,749
MYERS: Go on.

5597
06:58:45,784 --> 06:58:47,251
I said, "Leonard,
what have you done?"

5598
06:58:47,286 --> 06:58:48,819
And what did the prisoner
say to that?

5599
06:58:48,854 --> 06:58:51,088
He said, "I've killed her."

5600
06:58:51,123 --> 06:58:52,756
Christine, why are you lying?

5601
06:58:52,791 --> 06:58:54,492
Why are you saying
these things?

(CROWD MURMURING)

5603
06:58:55,694 --> 06:58:57,428
What an awful woman.

5604
06:58:57,463 --> 06:58:59,763
Oh, she's evil, that one.

(CROWD MURMURING)

5606
06:59:03,135 --> 06:59:06,770
If the defense so desires,
I will adjourn
for a short time

5607
06:59:06,805 --> 06:59:09,940
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

5608
06:59:09,975 --> 06:59:11,442
My Lord is most gracious,

5609
06:59:11,477 --> 06:59:13,777
but pray let
the witness continue.

5610

We are all of us caught up
in the suspense

5611
06:59:15,981 --> 06:59:18,148
of this horror fiction.

5612
06:59:18,183 --> 06:59:22,119
To have to hear it
in installments
might prove unendurable.

5613
06:59:22,154 --> 06:59:23,787
JUDGE: Proceed, Mr. Myers.

5614
06:59:23,822 --> 06:59:25,623
Uh, Mrs. Helm,

5615
06:59:25,658 --> 06:59:28,492
when the prisoner said,
"I have killed her,"

5616
06:59:28,527 --> 06:59:30,661
did you know
to whom he referred?

5617
06:59:30,696 --> 06:59:32,796
It was that woman
he had been going
to see so often.

5618
06:59:32,831 --> 06:59:34,865
Now then, when questioned
by the police,

5619
06:59:34,900 --> 06:59:38,035
you told them
that the prisoner
returned at 9:25?

5620
06:59:38,070 --> 06:59:40,638
Yes, because Leonard
asked me to say that.

5621
06:59:40,673 --> 06:59:42,973
MYERS: But you've changed
your story now. Why?

5622
06:59:43,008 --> 06:59:45,175
CHRISTINE:
I cannot go on lying
to save him.

5623
06:59:45,210 --> 06:59:48,812
I said to the police
what he wanted me to say
because I'm grateful to him.

5624
06:59:48,847 --> 06:59:51,515
He married me
and brought me
to this country.

5625
06:59:51,550 --> 06:59:54,985
What he has asked me to do,
I've always done
because I was grateful.

5626
06:59:55,020 --> 06:59:57,821
It was not because
he was your husband
and you loved him?

5627
06:59:57,856 --> 07:00:00,224
I never loved him.

5628
07:00:00,259 --> 07:00:02,493
MYERS: It was gratitude
to the prisoner, then,

5629
07:00:02,528 --> 07:00:04,995
that prompted you to give him
an alibi in your statement
to the police?

5630
07:00:05,030 --> 07:00:07,031
That is it, exactly.

5631
07:00:07,066 --> 07:00:09,166
But now you think
it was wrong to do so?

5632
07:00:09,201 --> 07:00:10,868
Because it is murder.

5633
07:00:10,903 --> 07:00:13,203
That woman,
she was a harmless old fool,

5634
07:00:13,238 --> 07:00:15,739
and he makes of me
an accomplice
to the murder.

5635
07:00:15,774 --> 07:00:17,841
I cannot come into court
and swear

5636
07:00:17,876 --> 07:00:19,677
that he was with me
at the time
when it was done.

5637
07:00:19,712 --> 07:00:21,078
I cannot do it!

5638
07:00:21,113 --> 07:00:22,680
I cannot do it!

5639
07:00:22,715 --> 07:00:25,015
Then this is the truth,

5640
07:00:25,050 --> 07:00:28,686
that Leonard Vole returned
that night at 10:10,

5641
07:00:28,721 --> 07:00:30,721
that he had blood
on the sleeves of his coat,

5642
07:00:30,756 --> 07:00:32,856
and that he said to you,

5643
07:00:32,891 --> 07:00:34,559
"I have killed her"?

5644
07:00:36,595 --> 07:00:38,429
That is the truth.

5645
07:00:38,464 --> 07:00:40,898
MYERS: That is the truth
before God?

5646
07:00:41,767 --> 07:00:43,401
That is the truth.

5647
07:00:44,470 --> 07:00:45,736
Thank you.

5648
07:00:51,610 --> 07:00:53,877
Mrs. Vole

5649
07:00:53,912 --> 07:00:55,379
or Mrs. Helm,
which do you prefer
to be called?

5650
07:00:55,414 --> 07:00:56,580
CHRISTINE: It does not matter.

5651
07:00:56,615 --> 07:00:57,915
Does it not?

5652
07:00:57,950 --> 07:00:59,717
In this country,
we are inclined

5653
07:00:59,752 --> 07:01:01,752
to take a rather more serious
view of marriage.

5654
07:01:01,787 --> 07:01:05,222
However, <i>Frau</i> Helm,
it would appear

5655
07:01:05,257 --> 07:01:07,257
that when you first met
the prisoner in Hamburg,

5656
07:01:07,292 --> 07:01:10,094
you lied to him
about your marital status?

5657
07:01:10,129 --> 07:01:11,929
I wanted to get out
of Germany, so...

5658
07:01:11,964 --> 07:01:13,097
WILFRID:
You lied, did you not?

5659
07:01:13,132 --> 07:01:14,465
Just yes or no, please.

5660
07:01:14,500 --> 07:01:15,733
Yes.

5661
07:01:15,768 --> 07:01:17,401
Thank you.

5662
07:01:17,436 --> 07:01:19,069
Then subsequently,
in arranging the marriage,

5663
07:01:19,104 --> 07:01:20,738
you lied to the authorities?

5664
07:01:20,773 --> 07:01:23,273
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

5665
07:01:23,308 --> 07:01:24,575
You lied to them?

5666
07:01:24,610 --> 07:01:26,276
Yes.

5667
07:01:26,311 --> 07:01:27,911
And in the ceremony
of marriage itself,

5668
07:01:27,946 --> 07:01:29,580
when you swore
to love and to honor

5669
07:01:29,615 --> 07:01:31,448
and to cherish your husband,
that too was a lie?

5670
07:01:31,483 --> 07:01:33,651
CHRISTINE: Yes.

5671
07:01:33,686 --> 07:01:36,654
And when the police
questioned you
about this wretched man

5672
07:01:36,689 --> 07:01:39,590
who believes himself
married and loved,
you told them...

5673
07:01:39,625 --> 07:01:41,759
I told them what Leonard
wanted me to say.

5674
07:01:41,794 --> 07:01:45,596
You told them
that he was at home
with you at 9:25,

5675
07:01:45,631 --> 07:01:48,132
and now you say
that that was a lie?

5676
07:01:48,167 --> 07:01:50,634
Yes, a lie.

5677
07:01:50,669 --> 07:01:54,104
And when you said
that he had accidentally cut
his wrist, again you lied?

5678
07:01:54,139 --> 07:01:56,440
Yes!

were you lying then,
are you lying now?

5681
07:02:02,981 --> 07:02:06,784

5687
07:02:19,398 --> 07:02:21,999

this is a capital charge,

My Lord, may I also remind
my learned friend

5691
07:02:33,846 --> 07:02:35,813
that his witness,

so many oaths,

from her hand

you know the meaning

5700
07:02:58,203 --> 07:03:00,671
of the English word "perjury"?

5701
07:03:00,706 --> 07:03:02,673
In German,
the word is <i>"Meineid."</i>

5702
07:03:02,708 --> 07:03:04,374
Yes, <i>Meineid.</i>

5703
07:03:04,409 --> 07:03:07,010
It means to swear
falsely under oath.

5704
07:03:07,045 --> 07:03:08,679
And are you aware,
Mrs. Helm,

5705
07:03:08,714 --> 07:03:10,881
that the penalty
in this country for perjury

5706
07:03:10,916 --> 07:03:13,584
is a heavy term
of imprisonment?

5707
07:03:13,619 --> 07:03:16,053
CHRISTINE: Yes, I'm aware.

5708
07:03:16,088 --> 07:03:18,355
Mindful of this fact,

5709
07:03:18,390 --> 07:03:21,191
I ask you once more,
is the evidence
that you have given,

5710
07:03:21,226 --> 07:03:24,728
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

5711
07:03:24,763 --> 07:03:28,031
So help me, God.

5712
07:03:28,066 --> 07:03:30,901
Then that, My Lord,
is the case
for the prosecution.

5713
07:03:47,486 --> 07:03:48,753
(CRYING)

5714
07:03:49,755 --> 07:03:51,722
Oh, want a tissue?

5715
07:03:51,757 --> 07:03:54,124
Yes, thanks.

5716
07:03:54,159 --> 07:03:56,760
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to.

5717
07:03:56,795 --> 07:03:58,729
It's terrible.

5718
07:03:58,764 --> 07:04:00,131
USHER: Silence!

5719
07:04:02,467 --> 07:04:05,269
Sir Wilfrid, are you ready
for the defense?

5720
07:04:07,973 --> 07:04:09,640
My Lord,

5721
07:04:09,675 --> 07:04:12,109
members of the jury,

5722
07:04:12,144 --> 07:04:14,578
the prosecution has
very ably presented

5723
07:04:14,613 --> 07:04:17,648
against the prisoner,
Leonard Vole,

5724
07:04:17,683 --> 07:04:21,919
a case with the most
overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

5725
07:04:21,954 --> 07:04:23,921
Among the witnesses,
you have heard

5726
07:04:23,956 --> 07:04:26,156
Chief Inspector Hearne,

5727
07:04:26,191 --> 07:04:28,325
who has given
his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner,

5728
07:04:28,360 --> 07:04:30,761
as he always does
in these cases.

5729
07:04:30,796 --> 07:04:32,796
He has evolved
and put before you

5730
07:04:32,831 --> 07:04:35,766
a clever theory of how
this crime was committed.

5731
07:04:35,801 --> 07:04:37,301
Whether it is theory

5732
07:04:37,336 --> 07:04:39,937
or actual fact, however,

5733
07:04:39,972 --> 07:04:43,607
you will decide
for yourselves.

5734
07:04:43,642 --> 07:04:46,677
And then you have heard
the evidence
of Janet McKenzie.

5735
07:04:46,712 --> 07:04:48,679
A worthy and devoted
housekeeper

5736
07:04:48,714 --> 07:04:51,114
who has suffered
two most grievous losses,

5737
07:04:51,149 --> 07:04:53,283
one, the death
of her beloved mistress

5738
07:04:53,318 --> 07:04:55,452
and second,

5739
07:04:55,487 --> 07:04:59,356
in being deprived
of an inheritance
of 80,000 pounds,

5740
07:04:59,391 --> 07:05:02,292
which she'd fully
expected to receive.

5741
07:05:02,327 --> 07:05:07,197
I will not comment further
on her evidence,

5742
07:05:07,232 --> 07:05:11,134
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

5743
07:05:11,169 --> 07:05:14,838
in both these mishaps.

5744
07:05:14,873 --> 07:05:18,642
And finally,
most damaging of all,

5745
07:05:18,677 --> 07:05:20,711
the prosecution has produced
a surprise witness,

5746
07:05:20,746 --> 07:05:23,180
one Christine Helm,

5747
07:05:23,215 --> 07:05:25,816
whom the prisoner married
and brought from the rubble
of her homeland

5748
07:05:25,851 --> 07:05:27,517
to the safety of this country,

5749
07:05:27,552 --> 07:05:30,354
giving her his love and
the protection of his name.

5750
07:05:30,389 --> 07:05:32,222
I objected to her testimony

5751
07:05:32,257 --> 07:05:34,157
because a wife cannot
give evidence

5752
07:05:34,192 --> 07:05:36,860
harmful to her husband.

5753
07:05:36,895 --> 07:05:38,862
But it has been proven

5754
07:05:38,897 --> 07:05:42,399
that her marriage
to Leonard Vole was fraudulent

5755
07:05:42,434 --> 07:05:43,667
and bigamous.

5756
07:05:43,702 --> 07:05:45,669
Therefore,

5757
07:05:45,704 --> 07:05:48,906
her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it

5758
07:05:50,042 --> 07:05:52,376
for what it is worth.

5759
07:05:54,713 --> 07:05:56,413
Such is
the prosecution's case.

5760
07:05:56,448 --> 07:05:59,182
Now it is the turn
of the defense.

5761
07:05:59,217 --> 07:06:01,551
We could present,
on behalf of the prisoner,

5762
07:06:01,586 --> 07:06:04,755
a variety of witnesses
to his character,
his war record,

5763
07:06:04,790 --> 07:06:07,391
the lack of criminal
or evil association
in his past.

5764
07:06:07,426 --> 07:06:09,092
However,

5765
07:06:09,127 --> 07:06:13,096
only one witness
can shed new light

5766
07:06:13,131 --> 07:06:15,766
on this tragic riddle.

5767
07:06:17,135 --> 07:06:18,936
The prisoner himself.

5768
07:06:20,772 --> 07:06:22,873
Members of the jury,

5769
07:06:22,908 --> 07:06:26,277
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

5770
07:06:45,931 --> 07:06:48,632
I swear by almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

5771
07:06:48,667 --> 07:06:51,301
will be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

5772
07:06:51,336 --> 07:06:53,603
No.

5773
07:06:53,638 --> 07:06:56,606
Is your name
Leonard Stephen Vole?

5774
07:06:56,641 --> 07:06:57,808
It is.

5775
07:06:57,843 --> 07:06:59,576
WILFRID: Where do you live?

5776
07:06:59,611 --> 07:07:01,745
620, Edgware road.

5777
07:07:01,780 --> 07:07:04,915
Leonard Stephen Vole,
did you or did you not,

5778
07:07:04,950 --> 07:07:09,486
on the night of
October the 14th last,
murder Emily Jane French?

5779
07:07:09,521 --> 07:07:10,821
I did not.

5780
07:07:10,856 --> 07:07:13,423
Thank you. That will be all.

5781
07:07:13,458 --> 07:07:15,959
(CROWD MURMURING)

5782
07:07:15,994 --> 07:07:20,263
Have you, in fact,
concluded your examination
of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

5783
07:07:20,298 --> 07:07:22,799
My Lord, the prisoner
has endured three days

5784
07:07:22,834 --> 07:07:25,268
of the most profound
mental agony and shock.

5785
07:07:25,303 --> 07:07:27,637
The defense feels
that his faculties

5786
07:07:27,672 --> 07:07:29,606
should be spared
for the cross-examination

5787
07:07:29,641 --> 07:07:31,942
by my learned friend
for the prosecution.

5788
07:07:31,977 --> 07:07:34,845
This is not a plea
for any indulgence.

5789
07:07:34,880 --> 07:07:38,148
I am confident that no matter
how searching this may be,

5790
07:07:38,183 --> 07:07:40,317
the prisoner
will withstand it.

5791
07:07:42,721 --> 07:07:44,654
Mr. Vole, at the time
that you made the acquaintance

5792
07:07:44,689 --> 07:07:47,024
of Mrs. French,
were you employed?
No, sir.

5793
07:07:47,059 --> 07:07:49,459
How much money did you have?
Just a few pounds.

5794
07:07:49,494 --> 07:07:51,695
Did she ever give you
any money?
No, not a penny.

5795
07:07:51,730 --> 07:07:53,830
Did you expect to receive any?
No, sir.

5796
07:07:53,865 --> 07:07:55,999
And did you know
that in her new will,

5797
07:07:56,034 --> 07:07:58,802
you were the beneficiary
to the extent
of 80,000 pounds?

5798
07:07:58,837 --> 07:08:00,670
No, I didn't.

5799
07:08:00,705 --> 07:08:02,973
Now, Mr. Vole, when you went
to visit Mrs. French

5800
07:08:03,008 --> 07:08:05,475
for the last time,

5801
07:08:05,510 --> 07:08:07,845
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

5802
07:08:09,548 --> 07:08:10,814
Yes, I did.

5803
07:08:10,849 --> 07:08:12,850
Was it this coat and hat?

5804
07:08:14,586 --> 07:08:16,486
Yes, sir.

5805
07:08:16,521 --> 07:08:18,655
My Lord, the defense,
leaving no stone unturned

5806
07:08:18,690 --> 07:08:21,358
in its efforts to establish
an alibi for the prisoner,

5807
07:08:21,393 --> 07:08:24,661
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth
a witness

5808
07:08:24,696 --> 07:08:27,164
who had seen him leaving
Mrs. French's house

5809
07:08:27,199 --> 07:08:30,867
or entering his own
at the times
that he has stated.

5810
07:08:30,902 --> 07:08:34,538
Apparently, this splendid
effort was without results.

5811
07:08:34,573 --> 07:08:36,673
However, the defense
will be pleased to learn

5812
07:08:36,708 --> 07:08:40,177
that at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

5813
07:08:40,212 --> 07:08:42,212
and that the prisoner
had been seen

5814
07:08:42,247 --> 07:08:45,348
wearing this coat
and this hat.

5815
07:08:45,383 --> 07:08:48,051
Lamentably,
he had not been seen
on the night of the murder,

5816
07:08:48,086 --> 07:08:50,520
but exactly one week before.

5817
07:08:50,555 --> 07:08:52,722
On the afternoon
of October the eighth,

5818
07:08:52,757 --> 07:08:55,358
were you or were you not
in a travel agency
on Regent Street?

5819
07:08:55,393 --> 07:08:57,194
And did you or did you not
make inquiries

5820
07:08:57,229 --> 07:08:59,096
about prices and schedules
of foreign cruises?

5821
07:08:59,131 --> 07:09:01,098
Well, supposing I did?

5822
07:09:01,133 --> 07:09:02,532
That's not a crime, is it?

5823
07:09:02,567 --> 07:09:04,868
Not at all.
Many people go on a cruise

5824
07:09:04,903 --> 07:09:06,770
when they can afford
to pay for it.

5825
07:09:06,805 --> 07:09:09,873
But you couldn't pay for it,
could you, Mr. Vole?

5826
07:09:09,908 --> 07:09:12,075
Well, I--I was hard up.
I told you that.

5827
07:09:12,110 --> 07:09:14,244
And yet you came
to this particular
travel agency

5828
07:09:14,279 --> 07:09:17,214
with a clinging brunette.

5829
07:09:17,249 --> 07:09:19,382
"A clinging brunette,"
Mr. Myers?

5830
07:09:19,417 --> 07:09:21,051
(CROWD CHUCKLING)

5831
07:09:21,086 --> 07:09:23,053
My Lord, the young lady
was so described to me.

5832
07:09:23,088 --> 07:09:25,055
She was very affectionate
with the prisoner,

5833
07:09:25,090 --> 07:09:27,224
constantly clinging
to his arm.

5834
07:09:27,259 --> 07:09:28,125
Oh.

5835
07:09:29,995 --> 07:09:31,761
You then admit
that you made inquiries

5836
07:09:31,796 --> 07:09:34,764
about the most expensive
and luxurious cruises.

5837
07:09:34,799 --> 07:09:37,067
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

5838
07:09:37,102 --> 07:09:38,602
I don't know. It was...

5839
07:09:38,637 --> 07:09:41,071
If you don't know,
perhaps I can help you.

5840
07:09:41,106 --> 07:09:43,640
On the morning
of the very same day,
according to Mr. Stokes,

5841
07:09:43,675 --> 07:09:46,476
you heard Mrs. French
change her will, leaving you
the bulk of her money.

5842
07:09:46,511 --> 07:09:49,079
I didn't! I knew nothing
about the will!

5843
07:09:49,114 --> 07:09:50,981
And in the afternoon,
you started to make plans
to dispose of that money.

5844
07:09:51,016 --> 07:09:53,116
No! It was nothing
of the kind!

5845
07:09:53,151 --> 07:09:54,918
I was in a pub
and I met this girl.

5846
07:09:54,953 --> 07:09:56,653
I don't even remember
her name now.

5847
07:09:56,688 --> 07:09:58,655
And we had a couple of drinks
and walked out together.

5848
07:09:58,690 --> 07:10:00,090
And we passed
that display window

5849
07:10:00,125 --> 07:10:01,925
and saw those fancy posters,

5850
07:10:01,960 --> 07:10:04,661
all blue seas and palm trees,

5851
07:10:04,696 --> 07:10:07,264
Grecian isles
or some such place.

5852
07:10:07,299 --> 07:10:10,600
So we went in just for fun
and I started
asking for folders.

5853
07:10:10,635 --> 07:10:12,435
Well, the man gave me
a sort of a funny look,

5854
07:10:12,470 --> 07:10:14,437
because I did look
a bit shabby.

5855
07:10:14,472 --> 07:10:16,106
Well, anyway,
it irritated me,

5856
07:10:16,141 --> 07:10:17,774
so I kept asking
for the swankiest tours,

5857
07:10:17,809 --> 07:10:19,476
all de luxe and a cabin
on the boat deck,

5858
07:10:19,511 --> 07:10:21,278
but it was just
putting on an act.

5859
07:10:21,313 --> 07:10:23,613
An act?

5860
07:10:23,648 --> 07:10:25,682
You knew that
in a week you were going
to inherit 80,000 pounds.

5861
07:10:25,717 --> 07:10:27,851
No, it wasn't
that way at all!

5862
07:10:27,886 --> 07:10:30,287
It was make-believe
and childish, but...

5863
07:10:30,322 --> 07:10:32,522
It was fun
and I enjoyed it.

5864
07:10:32,557 --> 07:10:35,025
I never thought of
killing anyone
or of inheriting any money.

5865
07:10:35,060 --> 07:10:37,127
It was just
a remarkable coincidence

5866
07:10:37,162 --> 07:10:39,129
that Mrs. French
should be killed
only one week later?

5867
07:10:39,164 --> 07:10:42,199
I told you.
I didn't kill her!

5868
07:10:42,234 --> 07:10:44,634
Do you know any reason
why the witness,
Christine Helm,

5869
07:10:44,669 --> 07:10:47,370
should deliberately give
the evidence she has given
if it were not true?

5870
07:10:47,405 --> 07:10:51,141
No, I don't know
why my wife...

5871
07:10:51,176 --> 07:10:54,144
I don't even know why
I still call her my wife.

5872
07:10:54,179 --> 07:10:56,213
She must have been lying
or out of her mind.

5873
07:10:56,248 --> 07:10:58,982
She seemed remarkably sane
and self-possessed.

5874
07:10:59,017 --> 07:11:01,685
But insanity
is the only reason
that you can suggest?

5875
07:11:01,720 --> 07:11:03,887
I don't understand it.

5876
07:11:03,922 --> 07:11:06,156
Oh, God, what's happened?
What's changed her?

5877
07:11:06,191 --> 07:11:08,325
Very effective, I'm sure.

5878
07:11:08,360 --> 07:11:10,527
But in this court,
we deal with fact.

5879
07:11:10,562 --> 07:11:13,697
And the fact, Mr. Vole,
is that we have
only your word for it,

5880
07:11:13,732 --> 07:11:16,666
that you left
Mrs. French's house
at the time you say you did,

5881
07:11:16,701 --> 07:11:19,502
that you came home at 9:25,

5882
07:11:19,537 --> 07:11:21,705
and that you did not
go out again!

5883
07:11:21,740 --> 07:11:25,008
But somebody must have
seen me in the street
or going into the house.

5884
07:11:25,043 --> 07:11:27,177
One would
certainly think so.

5885
07:11:27,212 --> 07:11:29,346
But the only person
who did see you
come home that night

5886
07:11:29,381 --> 07:11:31,214
says that it was 10:10

5887
07:11:31,249 --> 07:11:32,682
and she says that
you had blood
on your hands.

5888
07:11:32,717 --> 07:11:34,251
I cut my wrist!

5889
07:11:34,286 --> 07:11:36,353
You cut your wrist
deliberately!

5890
07:11:36,388 --> 07:11:38,355
No, I didn't!
I didn't do anything,

5891
07:11:38,390 --> 07:11:41,057
but you make it sound
as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

5892

MYERS: You came home
at 10:10?

5893

You've got to believe me.

5895
07:11:46,097 --> 07:11:47,864
You've got to believe me!

5896
07:11:47,899 --> 07:11:50,367
You killed Emily French!

5897
07:11:50,402 --> 07:11:52,369
No, I didn't!
I didn't do it!

5898
07:11:52,404 --> 07:11:53,903
I didn't kill her!

5899
07:11:53,938 --> 07:11:56,606
I never killed anybody!

5900
07:11:56,641 --> 07:11:58,608
God, it's like a nightmare,

5901
07:11:58,643 --> 07:12:00,477
some ghastly, horrible dream.

5902
07:12:07,085 --> 07:12:09,552
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

5904

ready by tomorrow.

of a murder trial.

It'll all be over
by tomorrow afternoon

5911
07:12:26,338 --> 07:12:28,305
and the boat train
doesn't go until 9:40.

you've stabbed it
often enough.

5914
07:12:31,943 --> 07:12:34,477
Upstairs, Sir Wilfrid.
You need a lukewarm bath

5915
07:12:34,512 --> 07:12:36,079
and your calcium injection.

5916
07:12:36,114 --> 07:12:38,515
Oh, and there's a lot more
packing to be done still.

5917
07:12:40,652 --> 07:12:42,919
It's ridiculous having
those boat reservations.

5918
07:12:42,954 --> 07:12:45,588
How do we know?
The jury may be
out for days.

5919
07:12:45,623 --> 07:12:47,090
Not on this case,
I'm afraid.

5920
07:12:47,125 --> 07:12:48,658

They didn't like her.

07:12:55,633 --> 07:12:57,801
No, they didn't like her,
but they believed her.

5924

They liked Leonard Vole,
but they didn't believe him.

5925

No.

5927
07:13:04,342 --> 07:13:05,942
Wilfrid, do you think
she lied?

5928
07:13:05,977 --> 07:13:07,177
Well, don't you?

5929
07:13:07,212 --> 07:13:08,611
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

5930
07:13:08,646 --> 07:13:10,113
I am. She lied.

5931
07:13:10,148 --> 07:13:12,482
Whether she called it <i>meineid</i>
or perjury, she lied.

5932
07:13:12,517 --> 07:13:14,517
The only question
in my mind is, "Why?"

5933
07:13:14,552 --> 07:13:17,954
What's her game?
What is she up to?
What?

5934
07:13:17,989 --> 07:13:20,857
Sir Wilfrid, I hope that
in your final speech tomorrow,

5935
07:13:20,892 --> 07:13:23,460
you won't let yourself become
too emotionally involved.

5936
07:13:23,495 --> 07:13:25,662
You must think
of your physical condition.

5937
07:13:25,697 --> 07:13:28,465
He's right, you know.
I want to see you
save yourself.

I'm still a barrister.

His life.

5943

He's entitled to the best
that I can do.

5944
07:13:41,346 --> 07:13:44,981
If I can't stand up to make
my final appeal for him,
I'll make it sitting down.

07:34:54,351 --> 07:34:56,251
It took me hours
to write them, to invent Max.

6368
07:34:56,286 --> 07:34:57,986
There never was a Max.

6369
07:34:58,021 --> 07:35:00,589
There's never been anyone
but Leonard, only Leonard.

6370
07:35:00,624 --> 07:35:02,991
My dear, could you not
have trusted me,

6371
07:35:03,026 --> 07:35:05,293
worked with me
truthfully and honorably?

6372
07:35:05,328 --> 07:35:07,596
We would have won!

6373
07:35:07,631 --> 07:35:09,931
I could not run that risk.
You see, you thought
he was innocent.

6374
07:35:09,966 --> 07:35:13,468
And you knew
he was innocent,
I understand.

6375
07:35:13,503 --> 07:35:16,605
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

6376
07:35:16,640 --> 07:35:18,173
I knew he was guilty.

6377
07:35:22,646 --> 07:35:24,446
That can't be true!

6378
07:35:24,481 --> 07:35:25,314
No!

6379
07:35:26,983 --> 07:35:29,451
Listen to me once and for all.

6380
07:35:29,486 --> 07:35:31,186
Leonard came home
a few minutes past 10:00.

6381
07:35:31,221 --> 07:35:32,454
He did have blood
on his sleeves,

6382
07:35:32,489 --> 07:35:33,989
he did tell me
he had killed the woman.

6383
07:35:34,024 --> 07:35:35,624
Only I could save him.
He pleaded with me.

6384
07:35:35,659 --> 07:35:36,958
And you saved him.

6385
07:35:36,993 --> 07:35:39,127
A murderer?

6386
07:35:39,162 --> 07:35:41,029
Again, you don't understand.

6387
07:35:41,064 --> 07:35:42,331
I love him.

6388
07:35:49,172 --> 07:35:51,640
I told you she was an actress
and a good one.

6389
07:35:51,675 --> 07:35:53,475
CHRISTINE: Leonard.

6390
07:35:53,510 --> 07:35:55,310
I knew she was going
to do something for me,

6391
07:35:55,345 --> 07:35:56,712
but I just didn't know
what or how.

6392
07:35:56,747 --> 07:35:58,346
Leonard! Leonard!

6393
07:35:58,381 --> 07:36:00,682
(SIGHING)

6394
07:36:00,717 --> 07:36:02,317
Fooled you completely,
didn't she?

6395
07:36:02,352 --> 07:36:04,853
It was you, Vole,
who fooled me.

6396
07:36:05,522 --> 07:36:06,688
Oh!

6397
07:36:06,723 --> 07:36:09,991
Easy, easy.

6398
07:36:10,026 --> 07:36:12,160
Now, we both got
out of this alive.
Let's stay this way.

6399
07:36:12,195 --> 07:36:13,729
Where are your pills?

6400
07:36:13,764 --> 07:36:15,664
Vole, you have made
a mockery of English law.

6401
07:36:15,699 --> 07:36:17,999
Who did?

6402
07:36:18,034 --> 07:36:19,334
You got me off,
and I can't be tried
again for this.

6403
07:36:19,369 --> 07:36:20,736
That's English law, too,
isn't it?

6404
07:36:20,771 --> 07:36:22,337
You can't touch him now.

6405
07:36:22,372 --> 07:36:24,172
Nobody can.

6406
07:36:24,207 --> 07:36:27,008
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

6407
07:36:27,043 --> 07:36:29,878
but ultimately
they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

6408
07:36:29,913 --> 07:36:32,013
Oh, ultimately's
a long way off.

6409
07:36:32,048 --> 07:36:34,349
I'd rather pay for it
as soon as possible
and in cash.

6410
07:36:34,384 --> 07:36:36,585
Suppose we double your fee.

6411
07:36:36,620 --> 07:36:39,354
There'll be plenty of money
as soon as the will
goes through.

6412
07:36:39,389 --> 07:36:42,357
I'm not cheap.
I want everybody to get
something out of this.

6413
07:36:42,392 --> 07:36:45,761
Now, there's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her
that new hearing aid.

6414
07:36:45,796 --> 07:36:47,429
And we'll get you
a new one of these.

6415
07:36:47,464 --> 07:36:50,732
18 karat gold,
if they make them.

6416
07:36:50,767 --> 07:36:52,901
When they try you
for perjury,

6417
07:36:52,936 --> 07:36:54,736
there'll be 5,000 pounds
for the best defense
you can get.

6418
07:36:54,771 --> 07:36:56,271
I don't care, Leonard,

6419
07:36:56,306 --> 07:36:58,240
just so we'll be
together again.

6420
07:36:58,275 --> 07:37:00,208
You don't know
what I went through,

6421
07:37:00,243 --> 07:37:02,043
standing in the witness box,
having to face you
in the dock,

6422
07:37:02,078 --> 07:37:04,713
saying I never loved you.

6423
07:37:04,748 --> 07:37:06,214
What is it, Leonard?

6424
07:37:06,249 --> 07:37:07,716
Sir Wilfrid,
the luggage is in the car

6425
07:37:07,751 --> 07:37:10,385
and we've only 20 minutes
to catch the boat train.

6426
07:37:10,420 --> 07:37:12,554
This is a nice young lady
I met in the gallery
during the trial.

6427
07:37:12,589 --> 07:37:14,923
Len! Oh, Len!

6428
07:37:19,262 --> 07:37:21,630
Oh, Len, they've been
trying to keep me
away from you.

6429
07:37:21,665 --> 07:37:23,131
It's had me nearly crazy.

6430
07:37:23,166 --> 07:37:25,734
Leonard,
who is this girl?

6431
07:37:25,769 --> 07:37:28,470
I'm not "This girl."
I'm his girl.

6432
07:37:28,505 --> 07:37:30,806
Tell her, Len.

6433
07:37:30,841 --> 07:37:34,242
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you
in the travel bureau?

6434
07:37:34,277 --> 07:37:37,445
The girl you said
you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

6435
07:37:37,480 --> 07:37:39,080
That's right.

6436
07:37:39,115 --> 07:37:41,750
That's who I am,
and I know all about you.

6437
07:37:41,785 --> 07:37:45,487
You're not his wife,
never have been.
You're years older than he is.

6438
07:37:45,522 --> 07:37:46,822
We've been going
together for months,

6439
07:37:46,857 --> 07:37:48,924
and we're going away
on one of those cruises,

6440
07:37:48,959 --> 07:37:51,827
just like they said in court.
Tell her yourself, Len.

6441
07:37:52,495 --> 07:37:54,129
Yes, Len.

6442
07:37:54,164 --> 07:37:56,431
Tell me yourself.

6443
07:37:56,466 --> 07:37:58,433
All right, Diana.
Come along.

6444
07:37:58,468 --> 07:38:00,836
You can't, Leonard.
Not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

6445
07:38:00,871 --> 07:38:03,839
Don't be silly.
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany.

6446
07:38:03,874 --> 07:38:05,974
You saved mine getting me
out of this mess.

6447
07:38:06,009 --> 07:38:08,009
So we're even.
It's all over now.
Don't, Leonard!

6448
07:38:08,044 --> 07:38:09,344
Don't leave me!

6449
07:38:09,379 --> 07:38:11,613
(SHUSHING)
Don't, Leonard, don't!

6450
07:38:11,648 --> 07:38:13,481
Pull yourself together.

6451
07:38:13,516 --> 07:38:14,850
They'll have you up here
for perjury.

6452
07:38:14,885 --> 07:38:16,318
Well, don't make it worse

6453
07:38:16,353 --> 07:38:19,487
or they'll try you
as an accessory.

6454
07:38:19,522 --> 07:38:21,857
And you know what that means.

6455
07:38:21,892 --> 07:38:23,625
CHRISTINE: I don't care.
Let them.

6456
07:38:23,660 --> 07:38:27,295
Let them try me for perjury
or an accessory or...

6457
07:38:27,330 --> 07:38:29,130
LEONARD: Ready?
Or better yet...

6458
07:38:29,165 --> 07:38:30,365
(PANTING)

6459
07:38:30,400 --> 07:38:32,367
Let them try me for...

6460
07:38:32,402 --> 07:38:33,669
(GRUNTS)

6461
07:38:37,507 --> 07:38:39,575
(DIANA SCREAMING)

6462
07:38:41,011 --> 07:38:42,678
(DIANA SOBBING)

6463
07:38:55,859 --> 07:38:58,026
Call a doctor.

6464
07:38:58,061 --> 07:39:00,229
It's no use.
No doctor can help now.

6465
07:39:01,531 --> 07:39:02,731
What happened?

6466
07:39:02,766 --> 07:39:03,865
She killed him.

6467
07:39:03,900 --> 07:39:04,933
Killed him?

6468
07:39:06,036 --> 07:39:07,936
She executed him.

6469
07:39:10,106 --> 07:39:12,507
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

6470
07:39:12,542 --> 07:39:14,342
I--I sent it on ahead
to the station

6471
07:39:14,377 --> 07:39:16,445
and I've got a cab
waiting outside.

6472
07:39:25,388 --> 07:39:27,522
A remarkable woman.

6473
07:39:27,557 --> 07:39:29,257
You can just barely
catch the boat train,
Sir Wilfrid.

6474
07:39:29,292 --> 07:39:30,859
Better bring
the luggage back

6475
07:39:30,894 --> 07:39:32,761
and you can dismiss the cab.

6476
07:39:32,796 --> 07:39:34,596
We are not going yet,

6477
07:39:34,631 --> 07:39:35,898
are we?

6478
07:39:38,435 --> 07:39:41,770
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

6479
07:39:41,805 --> 07:39:44,706
Get Brogan-Moore
to my chambers
and have Mayhew there, too.

6480
07:39:44,741 --> 07:39:47,910
We're appearing
for the defense in the trial
