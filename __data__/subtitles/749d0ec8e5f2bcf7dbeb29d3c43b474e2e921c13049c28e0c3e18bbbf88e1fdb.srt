This Logan has the same

793
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,506
And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

794
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,883
like he's not embarrassed to be
in a superhero movie for once.

795

I don't understand.

796
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,178
You said my universe is dying

797

got himself killed.

- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

799
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,646
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

800
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,022
with this?

801
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,401
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

802
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,444
But you have outdone yourself

803
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,613
and brought me the worst Wolverine!

804
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,907
- What do you mean, the worst one?
- Mr. Wilson.

805
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,536
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

806
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,289
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

807
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,957
And what he did,

808
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,542
well,

809
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,752
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

810
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,047
Okay.

811
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,884
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

812
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,345
I gave you a chance at greatness.

813
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,973
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

814
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,600
Clearly not special in a good way.

815
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,603
Apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

816
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,770
With Thor. He holds me.

817
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,898
But I did my duty.

818
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,900
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

819
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:48,278
And instead of accepting my offering
with humility and gratitude,

820
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,279
you broke my nose.

821
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,447
[sighs] It looks great.

822
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,407
And you decimated dozens of my men

823
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,117
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

824
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,328
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

825
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,537
What are you, the Internet?

826
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,956

Thank you very much.

828
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,542
And there's no stopping it.

829
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,505
[muffled] The humane thing to do
is to make it quick.

830
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,258
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
making you peckish?

831
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,843
I'm eating my feelings.

832
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,720

that I've ever cared about

As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,026
I want you to get him on the phone

839
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,070
and you tell him, her, or them,

that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

841
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,745

842
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,456

You're off grid.

you sick fucks are doing down here.

Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen...

847
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,633
And I'm gonna go upstairs

848
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,760
and I'm gonna tell 'em
all about you and your--

849

Oh, silence is nice, isn't it?

850
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,639

[Deadpool] Thor!

1554
01:06:12,262 --> 01:06:13,263
Where are we?

1555
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:16,182
No clue, but... I like it here.

1556
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,352
- [door opens]
- [♪ cryptic music intensifies]

1557
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:23,481
[grunting]

1558
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:26,067
[Deadpool] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1559
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:28,611
[♪ sentimental music playing]

1560
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,328

[cat meows]

1564

[♪ music fades out]

1565
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:16,075
Okay.

1566
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,537
Look at you... all.
You must be the others.

1567
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,372
Terrific.

1568
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:24,667
So just to refresh, you are

1569
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:26,002
- Wonder--
- Elektra.

1570
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:27,795
[Deadpool] Elektra?
Yes. Who could forget?

1571
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:31,591
And you. I was not expecting
to see you here.

1572
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:33,343
I thought you were, you know,

1573
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,011
retired. [chuckles]

1574
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,346
Retarded?

1575
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:38,890
[Deadpool] "Retired."

1576
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,184
I'm already in The Void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1577
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,478
- I don't like you.
- [Deadpool] You never did.

1578
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:48,650
And who's this succulent reminder
of my own inadequacies?

1579
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:49,901
Look at you.

1580
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:52,654
You look like
the superhero version of Hawkeye.

1581
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:56,074
The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>

1582
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:58,117
But you can call me the Gambit.

1583
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,995
[Deadpool] It's been a while since
I've seen <i>Sling Blade.</i> Hit me again.

1584
01:08:01,621 --> 01:08:03,206
- They call me the Gambit.
- [Deadpool] Do they?

1585
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:05,458
Are you sure you didn't
just really, really want them to,

1586
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:06,793
but it never quite worked out?

1587
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:09,003
[speaks indistinctly]

1588
01:08:09,504 --> 01:08:11,673
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

1589
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:13,800
But I can tell you now,

1590
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:15,635
it's just a common courtesy to ask

1591
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:17,262
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1592
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:19,597
Well, it's a good thing
I don't give a fuck.

1593
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:22,100
[laughs, speaks indistinctly]

1594
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:23,893
Fuck.

1595
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,897
- [bottle smashes]
- [Deadpool] So embarrassing.

1596
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,066
Boo, boo, boo.

1597
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,777
Well, now that that's settled, look,
we came a long way to find you three.

1598
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,612
- There's four of us.
- [Deadpool] There's four...

1599
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:36,572
Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1600
01:08:36,656 --> 01:08:38,574
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto,

1601
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:39,784
- because with him--
- He's dead.

1602
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:41,953
[Deadpool] Fuck! Now Disney gets cheap?

1603
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:44,038
It's like Pinocchio jammed
his face in my ass

1604
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:46,082
- and started lying like crazy.
- Ooh, you nasty!

1605
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:48,710
<i>Mon petit rouge.
Laissez les bons temps rouler, huh?</i>

1606
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:51,587
[Deadpool] Not a single word.
What do you do exactly?

1607
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:54,340
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1608
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:56,342
[Deadpool] Your power's close-up magic.
That's good.

1609
01:08:56,426 --> 01:08:58,261
We're not totally fucked at all.

1610
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:00,054
So who brought us here?

1611
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:01,264
[Voice] That would be me.

1612
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:05,476
[♪ pensive music playing]

1613
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:12,233
Don't make me regret it.

1614
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:17,488
[Deadpool] Holy shit. Logan.
That's her. That's X-23.

1615
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:19,157
She's the one I told you about.

1616
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,705
Hey, how did you all get stuck
in The Void?

1617
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:27,415
There was a knock at the door.

1618
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:29,417
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1619
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,919
Well, maybe I was born here.
It's... It's hard to know for sure.

1620
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:34,464
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1621
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:37,342
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1622
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,388
[Elektra] People like us
don't go quietly.

1623
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,265
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1624
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,976
[smooches] The answer is yes. I'm in.

1625
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,686
- In what?
- [Deadpool] A team.

1626
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,230
Me, you, you, and me.
All of us together.

1627
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:52,732
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1628
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:54,484
Don't listen to him.
He's a fucking liar!

1629
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:55,943
[Deadpool] It was an educated wish!

1630
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:57,945
- Ha!
- [Deadpool] Look.

1631
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:01,032
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1632
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:03,910
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1633
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,828
She can get us home. She told us.

1634
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:07,663
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1635
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,333
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1636
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,335
- Nobody's ever done that.
- [Deadpool] We did.

1637
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:14,295
Every time one of us
has gone up against her,

1638
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:16,047
they die.

1639
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,716
The Punisher, the Quicksilver,
the Daredevil.

1640
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,385
[Deadpool] Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1641
01:10:20,468 --> 01:10:21,969
- It's fine.
- [Deadpool] Okay.

1642
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,307
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1643
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,601
He up and gone missing like,

1644
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:30,019
what, two days ago?

1645
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,438
[Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.

1646
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:35,775
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1647
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:36,901
[Wolverine chuckles]

1648
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:39,070
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1649
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,988
All right? Us... plus, you guys.

1650
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:44,075
We can put Cassandra over our knee
and force her to let us out of The Void.

1651
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:45,618
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1652
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:47,370
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1653
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:49,414
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1654
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:51,124
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1655
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:54,127
[Deadpool] You guys may not have
been able to save your universes.

1656
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,670
But you can avenge them.

1657
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:57,713
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1658
01:10:57,797 --> 01:11:00,550
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1659
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:02,844
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1660
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:04,929
Dickhead here talked him into a team-up,

1661
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:07,390
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1662
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:09,183
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1663
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:11,102
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1664
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,688
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1665
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:15,440
[Deadpool] Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!

1666
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:17,608
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1667
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:18,943
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1668
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,945
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1669
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:22,029
Look.

1670
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:24,282
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1671
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:25,908
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1672
01:11:25,992 --> 01:11:28,578
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1673
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:31,205
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1674
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,582
He was like a brother to me.

1675
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:36,252
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1676
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,253
[laughs]

1677
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,297
Look, maybe you couldn't
save your worlds, but...

1678
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,549
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1679
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,135
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1680
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:47,138
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1681
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,056
we can get back in and take her down.

1682
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,642
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chére.</i>

1683
01:11:51,726 --> 01:11:54,145
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1684
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,022
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1685
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:57,523
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1686
01:11:58,191 --> 01:12:00,651
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1687
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:02,653
- around here somewhere--
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1688
01:12:02,737 --> 01:12:03,905
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1689
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,865
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don't play.

1690
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:07,492
She knows that helmet was the only way

1691
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,076
to protect anyone from her powers.

1692
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,953
The only other helmet that strong
is Juggernaut's,

1693
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:12,079
but he works for Cassandra.

1694
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:13,706
[Deadpool] Juggernaut's helmet.
That's it.

1695
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,416
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1696
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,876
without that dome gonna come off wit'it.

1697
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,086
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry, beautiful.
I want this to be gentle.

1698
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,589
Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?

1699
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:24,383
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1700
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,221
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1701
01:12:30,014 --> 01:12:31,933
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1702
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,726
Or never learned about us.

1703
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,061
The heroes we were.

1704
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:36,479
Lives we saved.

1705
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,980
Or wanted to save.

1706
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:39,815
Maybe these two are our chance.

1707
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,234
[gurgling]

1708
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:42,944
To be remembered.

1709
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,070
The way we deserve.

1710
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,615
- [Deadpool] Yes.
- An ending.

1711
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:49,283
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1712
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,035
Yes! Let this man cook.

1713
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:52,453
This is what I'm talking about.

1714
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,455
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1715
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:55,748
Everybody working together.

1716
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,583
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1717
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,044
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1718
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,129
- [Deadpool] Yes! Gambit?
