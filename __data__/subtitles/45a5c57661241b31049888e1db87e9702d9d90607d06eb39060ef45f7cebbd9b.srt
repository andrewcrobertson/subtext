Yeah, that's the problem.

166

we could all retire!

167
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,805

168
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:24,942

I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

it's relevant to the modern

my friend.

If you'll come help me

182
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:54,301
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

183
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,709
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

184
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,172
I have my own problems.

185
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,042
What problems?

186
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,538
Internal.

187
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,111
- Internal?
- Yes.

188
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,816
I don't know
how else to put it.

189
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,082
Problems with
what I feel internally.

190
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,985
How can you have
internal problems?

191
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,987
You got your ass all bricked up.

192
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:13,155
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

193
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:17,192
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

194
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,997
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

195
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,198
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

196
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,937
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

197
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,071
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

198
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,809
Please don't eat those peas.

199
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,405
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

200
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,012
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

201
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,717
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

202
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:37,784
Where are you going?

203
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,379
Tallahassee, Florida.

204
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,689
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

205
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,350
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

206
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,989
Can't she move?

207
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,057
Tallahassee is very nice.

208
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,059
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

209
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,588
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

210
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,833
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

211
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,066
There's good birding.

212
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,738
Birding?

213
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,465
How have I missed out on this?

214
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,071
It's very pleasant.

215
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,074
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

216
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:06,175
I've been unhappy,

217
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,408
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

218
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,849
and it's not fair to them.

219
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,643
I'm only impatient with myself.

220
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,348
Well, we can fix that.

221
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,185
We'll have you running right
in no time.

222
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,220
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

223
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,058
We get our shit together, together.

224
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,829
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

225
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,359
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

226
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,734
Now you can come with me,

227
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,736
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

228
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,397
What's a drive-away?

229
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,739
Free one-way rental.

230
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,741
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

231
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,072
of the drive-away company
wants it,

232
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,173
if they got one going
near your destination.

233
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,879
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

234
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,244
Are you kidding? A birder?

235
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:45,247
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

236
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:48,217
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

237
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:50,054
You know how
parents and such love me.

238
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,825
They think I got charisma.

239
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,256
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

240
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,763
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

241
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:56,830
Isn't she something?"

242
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm not sure.

243
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't go finding a problem here.

244
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,626
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

245
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,134
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

246
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,697
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

247
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,204
SUKIE: <i>Oh, God!</i>

248
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:09,876
- (sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!
- (power drill whirring)

249
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,109
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

250
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,474
- I don't want it anymore.
- (dog barking)

251
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,476
(hushed): You said
she wouldn't be here.

252
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,919
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

253
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,448
That was a gift.

254
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,021
I wanted you to have it.

255
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:27,586
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

256
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,962
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

257
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,524
No, no, no, no.

258
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,295
And take Alice, too.

259
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,967
I never liked her.

260
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,661
And she won't stop barking!

261
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,103
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

262
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,599
Remember, you kicked me out?

263
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,732
(continues sobbing)

264
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,636
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

265
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,781
It's your dildo,
Susanne.

266
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:49,674
(Alice barks, growls)

267
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,181
Curlie's Drive-Away,

268
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,249
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

269
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,613
Curlie speaking.

270
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,955
MAN (on phone): <i>Okay,
it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

271
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,682
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

272
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,552
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

273
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,753
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>- To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

274
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:03,831
Right.
<i>- Tallahassee.</i>

275
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:04,997
Sure.
<i>- You got it?</i>

276
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:06,625
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

277
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,935
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

278
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,728
By tomorrow.
<i>- No later.</i>

279
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,235
Uh-huh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

280
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:14,336
Okay.
<i>- Over and out.</i>

281
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:18,241
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

282
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,310
$250 deposit and a reference.

283
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,707
A reference?

284
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:24,544
Somebody local
I can break his balls

285
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,744
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

286
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,449
His balls.

287
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,287
Can the reference
be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

288
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,487
No kidding.

289
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,160
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

290
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,130
Tallahassee?

291
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,429
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

292
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,101
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

293
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:44,234
I think Curlie here...

294
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,972
Don't call me Curlie.

295
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,909
Isn't your name Curlie?

296
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,075
My name is Curlie.

297
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,879
We just met. It's too familiar.

298
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,947
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

299
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,245
No, I got good sense.

300
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,017
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

301
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,547
Okay. Is that a good car?

302
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,120
Not really.

303
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,750
You sell those shirts?

304
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,785
JAMIE: There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

305
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,754
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

306
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,965
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

307
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,824
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

308
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,034
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

309
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,332
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

310
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,498
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

311
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,763
Down and across.

312
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,270
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

313
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,832
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

314
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,570
MARIAN:
Direct route, down and across.

315
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,243
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

316
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:29,048
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

317
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:31,413
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

318
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,921
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

319
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,351
The interstate is not life.

320
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,287
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

321
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,223
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

322
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:40,587
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

323
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,589
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

324
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,063
He said it was a rush job.

325
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,196
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

326
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,560
Tomorrow can wait a day.

327
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,067
We could even go to Miami.

328
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,332
Bikinis and high heels.

329
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,400
(engine revs, tires squeal)

330
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,072
A medical doctor?

331
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,667
Or a reverend?

332
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,836
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

333
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,014
No, not for medical doctors, either.

334
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,708
Make up your mind--
which are you?

335
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,513
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

336
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,956
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

337
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,321
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

338
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,962
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

339
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:18,526
Well, we're here.

340
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,067
Okay. Who are you?

341
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,697
- The car.
- The car?

342
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,369
The Dodge Aries.

343
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,635
The Dodge Aries?

344
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,977
What are you, a mynah bird?

345
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,143
I'm Curlie.

346
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,013
I understand that.

347
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,674
You're not the Dodge.

348
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,744
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

349
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,647
♪ ♪

350
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:45,058
(doors open and close)

351
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,621
(engine starts, tires squeal)

352
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,756
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

353
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,297
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

354
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:56,531
And once we get to Tallahassee,
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

355
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,731
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

356
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,370
- soap and water.
- It won't.

357
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,339
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

358
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,803
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

359
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,871
Marian, it's art.

360
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,213
Stop saying it's art.

361
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,874
That doesn't end all discussion.

362
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,084
We're gonna be driving through

363
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,152
some conservative towns--
the South.

364
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,945
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

365
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,914
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

366
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,685
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

367
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,951
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

368
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,393
That's "Peck-us,"
honey darling.

369
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:26,000
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

370
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,232
My project.

371
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,267
What's your project?

372
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,974
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

373
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,372
How long's it been?

374
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,145
Weeks?

375
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,346
Months?

376
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:44,612
Oh, my God, Marian.

377
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,977
Don't tell me it's been years.

378
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:48,913
H-How many years? Who was it?

379
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,256
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

380
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:52,851
Donna.

381
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,358
Yeah, Donna.

382
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:59,099
Oh, my God.

383
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,761
Oh, my God. Donna?

384
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,929
(sighs)
She work for Al Gore now?

385
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,304
Nader.

386
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:08,636
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

387
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,375
CURLIE:
Wait a minute.

388
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,313
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

389
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,976
Yes, I did.

390
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,320
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

391
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,816
and then these broads come in

392
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,291
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

393
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,326
You gave them the car.

394
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,130
You don't know who they were?

395
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,824
CURLIE:
I told you their names.

396
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,265
Their names, yes, but...

397
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:35,102
This place is a dump.

398
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,203
They drive the car
instead of you.

399
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,369
Is that bad?

400
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:39,931
Bad if they find the goods.

401
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,406
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

402
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,001
CURLIE:
I like clutter.

403
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,343
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

404
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,575
Sterile doesn't work for me.

405
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,247
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

406
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,809
- Dick-yank?
- CHIEF: Flint.

407
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,041
I'm a dick-yank?

408
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,449
Don't antagonize.

409
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,044
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

410
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,980
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

411
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,586
And you would?

412
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,951
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

413
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,623
(footsteps approaching)

414
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:02,822
Not per se.

415
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,296
"Per se"?!

416
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:06,760
They left a local number.

417
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,895
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

418
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,666
Someone whose balls I can break.

419
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,173
(grunts)

420
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:15,901
(groaning)

421
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,079
Now you've gone and done it.

422
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,116
(grunting)

423
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:26,043
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

424
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,848
- (thumping)
- (grunting and groaning)

425
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,554
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

426
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,326
Tomorrow.

427
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,592
(grunting and groaning continue)

428
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,232
(sighs) This is great.

429
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,597
This is so slutty.
I love this.

430
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,303
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

431
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,206
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

432
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,405
The Butter Churn awaits.

433
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,802
Jamie,
I think I'd prefer to...

434
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,771
No. No, don't even.

435
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,036
You come with me.

436
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,807
I'll show you how this is done.

437
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,944
(chatter in foreign language,
audience laughter over TV)

438
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,617
(door opens, closes)

439
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,752
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

440
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,358
It's a dyke bar.

441
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,592
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

442
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,529
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

443
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,531
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

444
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:17,666
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

445
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,669
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

446
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,345
Hello?

447
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,678
(engine idling)

448
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:31,878
- (engine shuts off)
- (muffled music playing inside)

449
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,550
JAMIE: Confidence.

450
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,113
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

451
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:38,489
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

452
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,458
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

453
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,196
Jamie, I have done this before.

454
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,791
It's just like this.

455
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,298
One message.

456
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,861
You dig the female body.

457
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,203
Your body.

458
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,238
You're like this.

459
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,032
Not like this.

460
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,101
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

461
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,168
I have done this before.

462
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,576
I am not a schoolmarm.

463
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,138
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

464
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,074
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

465
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,779
Three years.

466
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,617
(hushed):
And four months and 14 days.

467
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,652

Fine?

478
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:31,707
Like, "You'll do"?

"Please, please

"You seem totally okay.

Are there any other mediocre

482
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,384
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

483
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,748
I said they all looked fine.

484
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,520
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

485
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,358
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

486
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,261
Why are you jousting with me?

487
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,659
I'm not jousting.

488
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:50,891
I'm asking which of these women

00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,629
you want to throw up
against the wall

490
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,191
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

491
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:56,435
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

492
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,305
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

493
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,801
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

494
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,067
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

495
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,233
They sense it,

496
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,575
whether you want to fuck them

497
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,038
or you think they're just fine.

498
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,512
I have to be me.

499
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,547
It has to be done
with authenticity.

500
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:11,549
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

501
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,244
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

502
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:15,751
You don't know
what our life was like.

503
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,489
You know nothing
about its worth.

504
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,919
Then why didn't
the two of you move

505
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,921
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

506
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,087
That didn't happen.

507
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,188
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

508
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,530

No, I'm not.

510
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:28,863
This is not me.

511
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,996
You're right.
I can't do this.

No, Marian.

I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

You can do this.

515
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,313
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

Your best self.

517
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:41,876
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

518
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,581
but this really isn't
right for me.

519
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:46,518

00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,191
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

1059
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:42,753
(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

1060
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,459
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

1061
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,461
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

1062
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,034
I guarantee you someone's there.

1063
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,630
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

1064
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,072
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

1065
00:48:54,072 --> 00:48:55,898
I'll take Alice.

1066
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,504
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

1067
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:59,737
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

1068
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,509
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

1069
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,611
CHIEF (over phone):
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

1070
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,646
Wetumpka, Alabama.

1071
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:09,285
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

1072
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:10,550
They hadn't been there,

1073
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,982
but a very personable
music lover

1074
00:49:13,982 --> 00:49:15,654
told us of another juke joint

1075
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:17,557
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

1076
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:18,756
Stop!

1077
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,527
Called Ike's.

1078
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:23,398
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

1079
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,136
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

1080
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,303
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

1081
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:29,173
I think the soccer team
was just confused

1082
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:31,175
about which joint
these girls were going to,

1083
00:49:31,175 --> 00:49:32,737
so we're gonna drive...

1084
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,443
Stop saying words.

1085
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:38,116
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

1086
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,678
They arrived in Tallahassee

1087
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:43,220
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

1088
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,420
Tallahassee.

1089
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,059
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

1090
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,160
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

1091
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,656
Not a juke joint.

1092
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,295
You should arrive
by early morning.

1093
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:53,428
I'll meet you there.

1094
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:55,694
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

1095
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:57,663
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

1096
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,599
We have not slept
since the night before last,

1097
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,700
- and we...
- (click, dial tone)

1098
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,306
Hello?

1099
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,738
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

1100
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,213
DESK CLERK:
Certainly.

1101
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:11,149
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

1102
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,579
or right here at the hotel,

1103
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,120
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

1104
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,748
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

1105
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:19,784
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

1106
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,226
Maybe we should stay here.

1107
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:23,755
Replenish the ice.

1108
00:50:26,463 --> 00:50:28,265
(piano playing
"Fly Me to the Moon")

1109
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:30,366
This is great, but how...

1110
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,764
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

1111
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:36,438
(softly):
Rainbow.

1112
00:50:36,438 --> 00:50:37,571
Yes.

1113
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:40,035
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

1114
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:41,773
Like, a really, really good one?

1115
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:42,840
WAITER: Of course.

1116
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,877
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

1117
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,483
Theoretically.

1118
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,388
(Jamie sighs)

1119
00:50:56,922 --> 00:50:58,163
So...

1120
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,201
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1121
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,063
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1122
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:11,770
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1123
00:51:12,608 --> 00:51:14,674
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1124
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:17,677
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1125
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:19,613
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1126
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:22,451
but I usually have stuff to do.

1127
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,256
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1128
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,786
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1129
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:32,329
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1130
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,331
- (cork pops)
- Something I decided

1131
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:35,827
last night
while I was lying in bed

1132
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,830
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1133
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,098
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1134
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:44,572
Especially since, with you,

1135
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:46,607
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1136
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,675
Am I right?

1137
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:51,183
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1138
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,252
- Thank you.
- WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

1139
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:55,781
Yes, please.

1140
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:57,981
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1141
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,587
I mean, we're good friends,

1142
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:01,589
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1143
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,019
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1144
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,627
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1145
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,597
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1146
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:11,797
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1147
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:13,766
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1148
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:16,373
She was always saying
that this or that

1149
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,243
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1150
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:20,509
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1151
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,446
the sex was great.

1152
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:25,316
Ladies, have we decided?

1153
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:29,716
Don't rush us, buddy.

1154
00:52:30,455 --> 00:52:33,753
First, we'll dance.

1155
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:37,361
("You Belong to Me"
by Diana Krall playing)

1156
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,570
Maybe I do overthink things.

1157
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:51,573
Yeah.

1158
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,577

I was with Debbie Augenblick.

Ah, you know Debbie.

1162
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:07,182
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1163

circular sander,

1164

01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:34,035
Oh, my God.

1233
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:35,366
Marian.

1234
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:38,270
CHAUFFEUR: Sir?

1235
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,876
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1236
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,879
Tallahassee, sir.

1237
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,640
- Where to, exactly?
- (sighs)

1238
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,851
Yes, um...

1239
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,787
The track.

1240
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,855
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1241
01:00:51,855 --> 01:00:53,648
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1242
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,122
JAMIE:
Oh, come on now.

1243
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:57,960
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1244
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,896
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1245
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:02,195
No. I like this one.

1246
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:05,770
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1247
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:07,596
Last night was beautiful,

1248
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:09,268
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1249
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:10,874
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1250
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:12,700
- Okay! -All right!
- (Jamie and Marian screaming)

1251
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,109
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1252
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:17,045
We're here for two things.

1253
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:18,376
- (screaming continues)
- (grunts)

1254
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:20,180
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1255
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,885
- Screw you!
- (screaming)

1256
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:23,711
We're here for two items.

1257
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:25,119
Whoa. She's naked.

1258
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,517
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1259
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,892
We're here for two items.

1260
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:31,026
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1261
01:01:31,026 --> 01:01:33,127
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1262
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:34,931
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1263
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:36,999
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1264
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:39,034
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1265
01:01:39,034 --> 01:01:41,663
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1266
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:43,907
Let's get this show on the road.

1267
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:45,601
(screaming continues)

1268
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,845
Yeah, baby.

1269
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:55,083
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1270
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:58,889
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1271
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,387
Whoa.

1272
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,796
This is so groovy.

1273
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:07,799
Now I can love you forever.

1274
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:09,427
Whoa.

1275
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:10,835
And ever

1276
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:15,400
and ever and ever

1277
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,537
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1278
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:25,014
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1279
01:02:25,014 --> 01:02:29,117
BOTH: Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1280
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:33,748
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1281
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:38,060
(echoing): Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1282
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:41,789
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1283
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:45,463
Never to wilt...

1284
01:02:45,463 --> 01:02:46,794
(bell rings)

1285
01:02:46,794 --> 01:02:49,269
(snarling)

1286
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,007
Took 'em straight here.

1287
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,173
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1288
01:02:52,173 --> 01:02:54,175
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1289
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,477
This is all they had?

1290
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:01,215
What's all they had?

1291
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,891
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1292
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:08,926
GOON:
What are you talking about?

1293
01:03:08,926 --> 01:03:11,159
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1294
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,656
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1295
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,328
Come on, girls.

1296
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,033
Where's the last phallus?

1297
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,234
(muffled chattering)

1298
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,533
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1299
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:24,502
I-I...

1300
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:26,141
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1301
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,044
What have you done, jerk-off?

1302
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:29,914
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1303
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:31,377
They gave you the combination,

1304
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,379
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1305
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:35,084
- FLINT: I never slip up.
- GOON: Right, left,

1306
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:36,888
- past the first number.
- (yells)

1307
01:03:37,715 --> 01:03:39,957
(snarling)

1308
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:53,267
The senator is a good man.

1309
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:57,040
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1310
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,404
Many of us did.

1311
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:00,912
- It was a different time.
- (muffled muttering)

1312
01:04:00,912 --> 01:04:03,981
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1313
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:06,511
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1314
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:13,958
Housekeeping.

1315
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,883
(snarling)

1316
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:20,228
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1317
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,264
...thing.

1318
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,566
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1319
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:30,106
(beeping)

1320
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,703
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1321
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,948
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1322
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:39,577
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1323
01:04:41,647 --> 01:04:42,877
He was just a kid.

1324
01:04:42,877 --> 01:04:46,188
(humming an upbeat tune)

1325
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:50,192
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1326
01:04:50,192 --> 01:04:52,326
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1327
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:55,230
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1328
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,629
(hushed):
You saw him, sort of.

1329
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,141
(continues humming)

1330
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,606
(stops humming)

1331
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:13,545
(housekeeper screaming)

1332
01:05:13,545 --> 01:05:16,845
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1333
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:19,485
Think of it: eBay,

1334
01:05:19,485 --> 01:05:23,786
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1335
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:26,261
Comments, reviews.

1336
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:28,659
Think of what
it would do to him.

1337
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:33,037
His children, his family,
his career.

1338
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,303
(gasps)

1339
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:39,241
- (goons yelling in distance)
- We're not unreasonable.

1340
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:41,012
We'll gladly pay for it.

1341
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,970
We just...

1342
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,939
Will you please shut up!

1343
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:46,149
That wasn't my idea!

1344
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,777
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1345
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,844
I was experimenting.

1346
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,120
But you liked it.

1347
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,418
- FLINT: No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1348
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:53,156
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1349
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,586
Drunk on cock.

1350
01:05:54,586 --> 01:05:56,390
- FLINT: No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1351
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,062
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1352
01:05:58,062 --> 01:05:59,954
- To understand life.
- No!

1353
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:02,561
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1354
01:06:02,561 --> 01:06:03,826
(groaning)

1355
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,135
(screaming)

1356
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:08,072
CHIEF: God, man,
what are you doing?!

1357
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:10,239
- (both screaming)
- (Flint yelling)

1358
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,243
(Marian and Jamie whimpering)

1359
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,388
(Marian and Jamie
whimpering loudly)

1360
01:06:31,262 --> 01:06:33,130
(gun clicks)

1361
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:37,563
(clicking)

1362
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:42,568
Mommy.

1363
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,803
(crying)

1364
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:55,977
(door opens, closes)

1365
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:58,518
(dogs barking, yelping
in distance)

1366
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:02,687
(dogs barking in distance)

1367
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:06,229
MARIAN: All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1368
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:07,725
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1369
01:07:07,725 --> 01:07:08,990
Then we switch hotels.

1370
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,102
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1371
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:12,532
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1372
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:14,930
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1373
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,174
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1374
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:24,346
(barking)

1375
01:07:24,346 --> 01:07:26,513
WOMAN:
Next customer, please.

1376
01:07:26,513 --> 01:07:29,318
SUKIE: Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1377
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,045
Don't ask me why.

1378
01:07:31,045 --> 01:07:33,850
(line ringing)

1379
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,621
MAN (over phone):
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1380
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:37,458
JAMIE:
I need to speak to the senator.

1381
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:40,989
MAN: <i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1382
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:43,398
Someone who has his...

1383
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:47,105
...personal effects.

1384
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,220
- (airplane engine whirring)
- (barking)

1385
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:20,534
- (line clicks)
- GARY (over phone): <i>Who is this?</i>

1386
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:21,865
Senator?

1387
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:24,340
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1388
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:27,211
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1389
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:30,808
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1390
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:32,447
Everybody's things.

1391
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:35,219
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1392
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,221
If you're not alone,

1393
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:39,256
believe me, I'll know it.

1394
01:08:39,256 --> 01:08:41,522
(Alice barking)

1395
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:50,498
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1396
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:52,093
made a phone call
from here last night.

1397
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:53,369
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1398
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,867
Well, this is for her.

1399
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:58,308
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1400
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,573
You've missed them.

1401
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:02,312
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1402
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,823
♪ ♪

1403
01:09:22,268 --> 01:09:23,894
JAMIE: Done.

1404
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:26,930
With what?

1405
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,273
Tell you later.
