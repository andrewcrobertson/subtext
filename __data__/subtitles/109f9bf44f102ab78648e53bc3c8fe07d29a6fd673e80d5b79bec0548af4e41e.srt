1
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,236
Another glass of...

2
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,601
rosé?

3
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,737
No.
The hour is long past.

4
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:53,805
Check.

5
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,073
Check!

6
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,805
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:30,005
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,347
Do not advance!

9
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,975
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:35,186
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,485
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:40,654
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,797
Oh, God.

14
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:20,121
Go.

15
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,983
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,919
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

17
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,261
<i>Leave a message.</i>

18
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,625
<i>Hey, Jamie.</i>

19
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,121
<i>Are you there?</i>

20
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,991
<i>Just wondering,
are you and Sukie</i>

21
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,059
- <i>going to shot night tonight?</i>
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,336
<i>I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.</i>

23
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,469
<i>Maybe Carla's going.</i>

24
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,965
<i>Do you know if Carla's going?</i>

25
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,032
Are you going?

26
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:05,606
<i>Anyway, call me if you would.</i>

27
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,069
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,807
<i>Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.</i>

29
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,777
<i>Miss you, friend. It's Marian.</i>

30
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,353
Hey. Marian.

31
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,684
Hi, Bart.

32
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,654
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,117
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:23,459
What?

35
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,395
Phish concert.

36
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,695
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,257
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,258
P-H.

39
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,403
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,196
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,902
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,168
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,170
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,446
That's fine.

45
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,382
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:47,417
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,353
- What expression?
- "Anyhoo."

48
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:51,718
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,391
What is it?

50
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,052
A word.

51
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,054
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,595
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,992
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,631
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,501
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,030
It's very good.

57
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,900
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,310
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,379
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,878
People don't usually
call them "engagements."

61
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,485
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,882
Yes.

63
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,587
The fact remains.

64
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:26,984
The engagement.

65
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,624
That's right.

66
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,273
Oh, my.

67
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,012
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,310
My God!

69
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,725
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

70
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,991
<i>Leave a message.</i>

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,158
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,731
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,293
<i>During sex?</i>

74
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,131
- Hi, Sukie.
<i>- Wow.</i>

75
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,707
- Who? Here?
<i>- Yes, there.</i>

76
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,479
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,372
- I was just masturbating.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

78
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,615
Me... me time.

79
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,686
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:42,764
No.

81
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,700
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,536
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,066
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:51,332
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,509
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,841
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,107
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,713
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:00,550
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,013
Why else would you be here?

91
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,619
To socialize.

92
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,214
Hello, girls.

93
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:10,351
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:12,353
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:14,421
Why not 2K?

96
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,425
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:24,365
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,839
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,204
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,580
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,210
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,785
So, first lick...

103
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,381
Here.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,692
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:44,759
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,420
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,290
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,601
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,702
Ooh!
Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,463
Here.

111
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,269
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,975
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:04,713
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,308
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,178
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,520
Here.

117
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,721
She's a free spirit.

118
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:14,151
I admire her.

119
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,856
Free.
Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:18,452
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,761
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:24,898
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,429
Pull that out!

124
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,739
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,104
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,307
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,914
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,850
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,281
20th... soon-to-be 21st...
Century lesbian.

130
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,184
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,791
- This right here is what it gets you.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,628
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:52,959
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,257
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

135
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:55,665
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,128
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,998
What problems?

138
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,494
Internal.

139
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,067
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,772
I don't know how else to put it.

141
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,038
Problems with
what I feel internally.

142
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,941
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,943
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:13,111
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:17,148
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,953
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:23,154
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,893
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,027
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,765
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,361
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,968
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,673
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:37,740
Where are you going?

155
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,335
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,645
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,306
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:44,945
Can't she move?

159
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,013
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:49,015
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,544
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:53,789
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,022
There's good birding.

164
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,694
Birding?

165
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,421
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,027
It's very pleasant.

167
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,031
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,131
I've been unhappy,

169
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,364
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,805
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,599
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,304
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,141
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,176
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,014
We get our shit together, together.

176
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,785
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,315
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,690
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,692
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,353
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,695
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,697
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,028
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,129
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,835
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,200
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:45,203
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

188
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,173
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,010
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,781
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,212
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,719
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,786
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,216
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,756
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:01,582
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,090
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,653
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,160
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,832
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,065
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,430
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,432
You said she wouldn't be here.

204
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,875
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,404
That was a gift.

206
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:22,977
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:27,542
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,918
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,480
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,251
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:34,923
I never liked her.

212
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,617
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,059
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,555
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,592
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,737
It's your dildo, Susanne.

217
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,137
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,205
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,569
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,911
<i>Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

221
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,638
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,508
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

223
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,709
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

224
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,787
Right.
<i>Tallahassee.</i>

225
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,953
Sure.
<i>You got it?</i>

226
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,581
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,891
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

228
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,684
By tomorrow.
<i>No later.</i>

229
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,191
Uh-huh.
<i>Okay.</i>

230
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,293
Okay.
<i>Over and out.</i>

231
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:18,197
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,266
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,663
A reference?

234
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,500
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,700
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,405
His balls.

237
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,244
Can the reference be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,443
No kidding.

239
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,117
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

240
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,086
Tallahassee?

241
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,385
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

242
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,057
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

243
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,190
I think Curlie here...

244
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,929
Don't call me Curlie.

245
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,865
Isn't your name Curlie?

246
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,031
My name is Curlie.

247
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,835
We just met. It's too familiar.

248
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,903
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

249
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,201
No, I got good sense.

250
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,973
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

251
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,503
Okay. Is that a good car?

252
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,077
Not really.

253
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,706
You sell those shirts?

254
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,741
There's also a place
here in Wilmington...

255
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,710
Fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

256
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:11,921
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

257
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,780
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

258
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,990
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

259
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:16,288
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

260
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,454
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

261
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,719
Down and across.

262
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,226
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

263
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,788
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

264
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,526
Direct route, down and across.

265
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:26,199
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,004
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

267
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,369
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

268
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,877
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

269
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,307
The interstate is not life.

270
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,243
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

271
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,179
You're the one that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

272
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,543
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

273
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,545
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

274
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,019
He said it was a rush job.

275
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,152
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

276
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,516
Tomorrow can wait a day.

277
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,023
We could even go to Miami.

278
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,288
Bikinis and high heels.

279
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:53,028
A medical doctor?

280
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,623
Or a reverend?

281
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,792
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

282
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,970
No, not for medical doctors, either.

283
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,664
Make up your mind...
Which are you?

284
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,469
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

285
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,912
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

286
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,278
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

287
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,918
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

288
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,482
Well, we're here.

289
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,024
Okay. Who are you?

290
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,653
- The car.
- The car?

291
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,326
The Dodge Aries.

292
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,591
The Dodge Aries?

293
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:29,933
What are you, a mynah bird?

294
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,099
I'm Curlie.

295
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,969
I understand that.

296
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,631
You're not the Dodge.

297
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,700
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

298
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,712
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

299
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,253
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

300
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,487
And once we get to Tallahassee, it stops
being art and starts being vandalism.

301
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,687
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

302
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,326
- soap and water.
- It won't.

303
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,295
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

304
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,759
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

305
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,827
Marian, it's art.

306
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:08,169
Stop saying it's art.

307
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,830
That doesn't end all discussion.

308
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,040
We're gonna be driving through

309
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,108
some conservative towns...
The South.

310
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,901
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

311
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,870
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

312
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,641
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

313
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,907
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

314
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,349
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

315
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,956
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

316
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,188
My project.

317
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,223
What's your project?

318
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,931
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,329
How long's it been?

320
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,102
Weeks?

321
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,303
Months?

322
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:44,569
Oh, my God, Marian.

323
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,933
Don't tell me it's been years.

324
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,869
H-How many years? Who was it?

325
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,213
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

326
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,807
Donna.

327
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,315
Yeah, Donna.

328
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,056
Oh, my God.

329
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,718
Oh, my God. Donna?

330
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,885
She work for Al Gore now?

331
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,260
Nader.

332
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,593
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

333
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,332
Wait a minute.

334
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,270
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

335
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,932
Yes, I did.

336
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,276
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

337
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,772
and then these broads come in

338
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,247
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

339
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,282
You gave them the car.

340
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,086
You don't know who they were?

341
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,780
I told you their names.

342
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,221
Their names, yes, but...

343
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,058
This place is a dump.

344
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,159
They drive the car
instead of you.

345
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,325
Is that bad?

346
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,887
Bad if they find the goods.

347
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,362
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

348
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,957
I like clutter.

349
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,299
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

350
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,531
Sterile doesn't work for me.

351
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:48,203
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

352
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,765
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

353
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:50,997
I'm a dick-yank?

354
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,405
Don't antagonize.

355
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,000
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

356
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,936
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

357
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:57,542
And you would?

358
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,907
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

359
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,778
Not per se.

360
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,252
"Per se"?!

361
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,716
They left a local number.

362
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,851
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

363
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,622
Someone whose balls I can break.

364
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,036
Now you've gone and done it.

365
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:25,999
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

366
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,511
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

367
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,282
Tomorrow.

368
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,188
This is great.

369
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,553
This is so slutty.
I love this.

370
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,259
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

371
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,162
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

372
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,361
The Butter Churn awaits.

373
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,758
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

374
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,727
No. No, don't even.

375
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:51,992
You come with me.

376
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,764
I'll show you how this is done.

377
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,708
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

378
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,315
It's a dyke bar.

379
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,548
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

380
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,485
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

381
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,487
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

382
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:17,622
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

383
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,626
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

384
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,302
Hello?

385
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,506
Confidence.

386
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,069
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

387
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,445
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

388
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,414
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

389
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,152
Jamie, I have done this before.

390
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,747
It's just like this.

391
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,254
One message.

392
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,817
You dig the female body.

393
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,159
Your body.

394
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,195
You're like this.

395
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,989
Not like this.

396
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,057
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

397
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,124
I have done this before.

398
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,532
I am not a schoolmarm.

399
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,094
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

400
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,030
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

401
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:04,736
Three years.

402
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,573
And four months and 14 days.

403
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,479
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter ♪</i>

404
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,041
Okay.

405
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,383
<i>♪ Yeah, it tasted real good,
but it stuck to my teeth... ♪</i>

406
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:17,044
You feeling your body?

407
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,881
Very much so.

408
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,488
Okay.

409
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,458
Who looks good to you?

410
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,757
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter... ♪</i>

411
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,265
They all look fine.

412
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,365
Fine?

413
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,663
Like, "You'll do"?

414
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,533
"Please, please
come home with me, baby.

415
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:34,996
"You seem totally okay.

416
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:36,701
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

417
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,340
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

418
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:39,704
I said they all looked fine.

419
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,476
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

420
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,314
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

421
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,218
Why are you jousting with me?

422
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,615
I'm not jousting.

423
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:50,847
I'm asking which of these women

424
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,585
you want to throw up
against the wall

425
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,147
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

426
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,391
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

427
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,261
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

428
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,757
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

429
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:02,023
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

430
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,189
They sense it,

431
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,531
whether you want to fuck them

432
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,994
or you think they're just fine.

433
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,468
I have to be me.

434
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,503
It has to be done
with authenticity.

435
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,505
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

436
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,200
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

437
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,707
You don't know
what our life was like.

438
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,445
You know nothing
about its worth.

439
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,875
Then why didn't
the two of you move

440
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,877
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

441
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,043
That didn't happen.

442
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,144
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

443
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,486
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

444
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,884
No, I'm not.

445
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:28,820
This is not me.

446
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,952
You're right.
I can't do this.

447
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,855
No, Marian.

448
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,727
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

449
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,333
You can do this.

450
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,269
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

451
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,567
Your best self.

452
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:41,832
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

453
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,537
but this really isn't
right for me.

454
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,475
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

455
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,840
<i>♪ Yeah, come on,

456
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,138

00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:04,217
Right here. Look.

461
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:05,559
Hold it. Better.

462
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,726
Great. Turn.

463
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,598
Oh.

464
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,766
Hello.

465
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,274
Good evening.

466
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,738
I'm Amber.

467
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,543
Marian.

468
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,547
What you reading?

469
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,209
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

470
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,850
Wow. Thick one.

471
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,788
Hello, Marian.

472
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,395
Hello.

473
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,827
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

474
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:43,861
No.

475
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,830
No, no.

476
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:48,063
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

477
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,506
Rats.

478
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:54,708
Well...

479
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,546
I'll just...

480
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:25,502
How was it?

481
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,164
Bouncy.

482
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,708
How's your book?

483
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,841
Good.

484
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:38,041
It's about two free spirits

485
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,010
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

486
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:43,816
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

487
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:46,379
That is why we are going
the other way.

488
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,787
Although there was
this one chick

489
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,459
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

490
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,120
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

491
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,287
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

492
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,860
No, I'm not kidding.

493
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,763
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

494
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,501
in India supposedly
who can do that.

495
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:00,503
Black belts in cunnilingus.

496
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,868
They can even
cunniling themselves.

497
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,167
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

498
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,476
You got to ask the librarian.

499
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:08,434
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

500
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,074
Who wrote your book?

501
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,615
Henry James...

502
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,848
American writer.

503
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:18,015
Famous family. His brother, too.

504
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:19,083
Rick?

505
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,557
No, I'm kidding.

506
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,416
I know who Henry James is.

507
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,957
White and uptight.

508
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:29,257
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

509
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,127
Boy, that was a great read.

510
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:34,130
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

511
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,935
That's a very apt simile.

512
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,608
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,039
Put me off the whole book thing.

514
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,272
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

515
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,340
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

516
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,301
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't think you should've
brought someone back to the room.

517
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:51,444
Okay.

518
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,786
I knew this was coming.

519
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,524
How do you think I felt?

520
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,119
You told me to have
a night on the town.

521
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,352
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

522
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,662
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

523
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,026
We operate on a handshake basis.

524
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,896
- What does that mean?
- "Hiya. How you doing?

525
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,260
"How much for that Cadillac car?

526
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:07,295
How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

527
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:08,901
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

528
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,133
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

529
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,432
- Well, then why'd you ask?
- I...

No. I'm sorry.

538
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,959
Why are you sorry?

539
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,456
You're good. I'm a little...

540
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:37,831
No, I'm a big baby sometimes.

541
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:40,802
Uncle Gino's!

542
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:44,542
You are not going
to believe this.

543
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,269
See over there?

544
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,677
UNG soccer team.

545
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:49,975
Uh-huh.

546
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:52,109
I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

547
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,242
Uh-huh.

548
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:54,914
They're very committed lesbians,

549
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:56,080
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

550
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,719
which is practically on our way.

551
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,017
Not exactly.

552
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:00,722
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

553
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,086
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

554
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:04,154
Forget the map.
After today's game,

555
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:06,420
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

556
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,762
And guess who's invited.

557
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,192
I'm sure you are.

558
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,260
Nuh-uh.

00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,064

00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,230
You see?

561
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:16,706

you eat at Uncle Gino's.

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,236

Home.

647
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,310
And where's that?

648
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:33,180
Some motel. I don't know.

649
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,116
You don't know?

650
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:37,085
I can't remember the name.

651
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,087
A motel on the highway.

652
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:40,649
And where you coming from?

653
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,914
A house.

654
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,520
Whose house?

655
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,719
I don't know.

656
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,392
It was a slumber party.

657
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:50,330
Little old for slumber parties,
aren't you, miss?

658
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:54,004
Look, mister...

659
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,618
You know what?

660
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,786
I'm gonna drop you off at home.

661
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:20,953
Aw.

662
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:55,614
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

663
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,041
Hey, handsome.

664
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,142
Want to get plastered?

665
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,521
I'll drive when it's my turn.

666
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,523
At the end of three hours.

667
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:39,624
I have no sympathy for you,
my friend.

668
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,791
You could've just asked her,
and you'd be fine right now.

669
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,365
I just asked. She answered.

670
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:45,927
But you cannot relate
to the public,

671
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,237
which, in a service profession,
is a big fucking handicap.

672
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:49,601
And that sound

673
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,240
is beginning to get irritating.

674
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,736
Well, your lectures
are getting irritating.

675
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:55,244
I don't lecture, my friend.
That's my point.

676
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,378
I take people in. I react.

677
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:59,545
I read people
to get what I want.

678
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:01,613
You, though,
you think life is this

679
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,780
orderly series of people
to beat the shit out of.

680
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,013
Well, real life
is not like that.

681
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,422
You only see it that way
because you're not nourished

682
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:11,590
by human contact, the human
give-and-take, so forth.

683
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,592
Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

684
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,022
That's what you're
comfortable with.

685
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,529
- Yeah, yeah.
- Caveman shit.

686
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,893
You don't engage
the whole person.

687
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:20,027
Well, you did a great job
helping me engage

688
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:23,228
that very agile harpy.

689
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,768
Didn't have to.

690
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,869
No need whatsoever
for the physical approach,

691
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,168
which you couldn't see
because you don't savor

692
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,675
the stuff of life.

693
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm not a sissy boy,
if that's what you mean.

694
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,614
Kiss my ass. I...

695
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,386

Georgia.

700
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,707
Thank you.

701
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:03,775
For what?

702
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,612
Just picking me up.

703
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,449
Am I not gonna pick you up?

704
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,275
Hard not to.

705
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:12,585
"Ma'am, your friend here is in the
hoosegow. Care to come get her?"

706
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:14,389
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

707
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,281
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

708
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,492
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

709
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:21,628
And so I say thank you.

710
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,635
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

711
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:32,231
and I've been careful
not to ask,

712
00:38:32,232 --> 00:38:34,706
but damn, Marian,

713
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:38,237
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

714
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:40,239
I think it was jail, not prison.

715
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,779
Oh. I'm sorry.

716
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,177
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

717
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,981
It wasn't hell-raising.

718
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,752
Sorry to disappoint.

719
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:50,623
A policeman didn't like my tone.

720
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,922
Oh.

721
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,595
You copped some attitude.

722
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,861
I don't have attitude.

723
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,468
Marian, if I may,

724
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,734
there are certain things in life

725
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:05,539
which you got to sense
and understand

726
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,673
in order to live life,

727
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:10,709
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

728
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,041
well, all these
funny little creatures

729
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,516
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

730
00:39:15,517 --> 00:39:17,079
we call 'em human beings.

731
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,883
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

732
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:22,424
And your whole social situation,

733
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,887
you got to understand
what that is.

734
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:24,790
Uh-huh.

735
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,219
You know what that means?

736
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,561
"Social situation"?

737
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:29,464
I know what
"social situation" means.

738
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,663
Okay, good.

739
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,632
So, the whole thing
with a cop is...

740
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,898
And you should remember this
for future reference...

741
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:38,363
When you're in
a social situation with a cop,

742
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:40,266
there ain't no social situation.

743
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:43,203
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

744
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,271
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

745
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,339
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

746
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,846
for two years now, and...

747
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,551
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

748
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,949
Thank you. I understand.

749
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,116
But if authority
is being abused,

750
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:57,724
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

751
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,760
Florida.

752
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,732
Lesbian...

753
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:11,539
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

754
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:34,056
You okay?

755
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,993
Spare tire.

756
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:52,013
What?

757
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,783
Something burning?

758
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,834
Jamie, it's cold.

759
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:18,640
Don't touch it.

760
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:21,939
I saw this movie once where

761
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,546
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

762
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,042
and they opened the box,

763
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:29,849
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

764
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:46,997
Head!

765
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,272
No, I'm kidding.

766
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,044
It was a minor traffic accident.

767
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:02,507
Fast stop.

768
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:05,785
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

769
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:07,952
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

770
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,692
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

771
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,959
That's right.

772
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,830
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

773
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:20,668
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

774
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,494
Just drove off
with something we need.

775
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:24,100
Didn't even know they had it.

776
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,906
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

777
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:30,304
Just making out.

778
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:32,207
Oh, yeah?

779
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,714
With who?

780
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:38,048
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

781
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:42,119
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

782
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,989
sample case back.

783
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,794
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

784
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:49,389
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

785
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,029
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

786
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,296
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

787
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:00,499
No, no.

788
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,841
We should just call the cops.

789
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:03,238
We will, Jamie.

790
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,472
First, we should see
what's in here.

791
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:08,012
Why? I don't want to look.

792
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:10,047
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

793
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,478
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

794
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:14,051
This might tell us who they are,

795
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,020
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

796
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:18,385
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

797
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:20,189
Protect us?

798
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,521
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

799
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:23,996
What do we lose by looking?

800
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,900
Look.

801
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:30,035
I just want to know
what's going on.

802
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,038
This might tell us.

803
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:35,139
I bet it's locked.

804
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,868
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

805
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,232
That was awful.

806
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,201
You just said
not to call the cops.

807
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,807
In ignorance.

808
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:08,204
No, what you said was true.

809
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:09,975
The cops could think
you're involved.

810
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,537
You just spent
the night in jail.

811
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:12,978
For vagrancy.

812
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:15,376
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

813
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:16,718
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

814
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,950
Here's what we do.

815
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,952
First, we get to Tallahassee.

816
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,383
Bye!

817
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,892
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

818
00:44:25,893 --> 00:44:27,421
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

819
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:29,192
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

820
00:44:29,193 --> 00:44:31,095
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

821
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,360
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

822
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:33,867
the address
where they're headed?

823
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,100
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

824
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,003
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

825
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:40,038
Bye!

826
00:44:44,144 --> 00:44:45,846
Welcome to El Conquistador.

827
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:48,409
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

828
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,851
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

829
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:53,414
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

830
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:54,822
You take the Rainbow Card?

831
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:56,384
Uh, I'm sure we do.

832
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,452
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

833
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:00,322
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

834
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,423
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

835
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,963
You do that, right?

836
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:05,195
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

837
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:06,735
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

838
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,330
for sensitive materials?

839
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,771
We do have in-room safes

840
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:11,806
for any valuables
that you may have.

841
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,566
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

842
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,370
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

843
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:17,273
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

844
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:18,340
Do you have ice?

845
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:29,286
This is it?

846
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:32,223
They said Farm Road 80.

847
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,763
What's the matter?

848
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,930
Afraid of the stuff of life?

849
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:02,054
Is this, um... Slappy's?

850
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:03,991
That's right.

851
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:10,722
Have you seen two, um,
nonlocal women come in here?

852
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,164
That's one of them.

853
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:15,397
I was sittin' here listening

854
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,102
to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

855
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:20,369
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

856
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,472
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

857
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,575
Now, that's true.

858
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:30,479
Love will bite your ass.

859
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:43,095
Oh, I can send Sukie.

860
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:45,130
But why would these people
just be waiting there

861
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:46,593
in the drive-away office?

862
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,869
Well, clearly, this was not

863
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,497
your garden-variety
decapitation.

864
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:51,004
This was some kind of a...

865
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,940
Well, I don't know what it was,

866
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:55,602
but they know
we have their stuff.

867
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:56,845
Yeah?

868
00:46:56,846 --> 00:46:59,540
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

869
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,213
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

870
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:04,116
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

871
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:06,284
But why would we get
in touch with them?

872
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,187
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

873
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:11,783
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

874
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,191
Jamie.

875
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,896
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

876
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,898
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

877
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,295
She hates you.

878
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:21,364
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

879
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:23,532
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

880
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,908
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

881
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,339
Attorney?
Are you a college boy?

882
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,507
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

883
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,839
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

884
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,544
I'm running booking, jackass.

885
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,678
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

886
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,284
and kick your number-running ass

887
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,286
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

888
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:45,124
Who's running booking?

889
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,895
- You are.
- Who is?

890
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:49,029
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

891
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,690
- Shink!
- Yeah.

892
00:47:50,691 --> 00:47:52,066
Telephone.

893
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,793
Sergeant Shinkleman.

894
00:47:54,794 --> 00:47:56,762
Hey. It's me.

895
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:58,467
<i>Oh, what a lovely surprise.</i>

896
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,799
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

897
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,274
Did the two creeps find you?
<i>What?</i>

898
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,243
The two weirdos looking for you.

899
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,509
I tried to be helpful.

900
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:09,412
Uh, but who were they?
<i>How should I know?</i>

901
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,315
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

902
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:13,185
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

903
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:15,991
<i>- George and Lennie.</i>
- George and Lennie?

904
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,851
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

905
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:21,523
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

906
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,393
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

907
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:25,692
"Break a big murder case"?

908
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:28,497
<i>Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.</i>

909
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,532
Curlie's Drive-Away?
<i>Yeah.</i>

910
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,304
<i>And you ask Curlie about...</i>

911
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:35,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

912
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,771
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

913
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:41,147
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

914
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:42,709
Jamie, that is about

915
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,415
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

916
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,417
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

917
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:48,990
I guarantee you someone's there.

918
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:51,586
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

919
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:54,028
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

920
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,854
I'll take Alice.

921
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,460
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

922
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,693
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

923
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:02,466
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

924
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,567
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

925
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,602
Wetumpka, Alabama.

926
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:09,241
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

927
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:10,506
They hadn't been there,

928
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:13,938
but a very personable
music lover

929
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,610
told us of another juke joint

930
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,513
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

931
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:18,712
Stop!

932
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:20,484
Called Ike's.

933
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:23,354
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

934
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,092
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

935
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:27,259
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

936
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,129
I think the soccer team
was just confused

937
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,131
about which joint
these girls were going to,

938
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:32,693
so we're gonna drive...

939
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:35,399
Stop saying words.

940
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,072
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

941
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,634
They arrived in Tallahassee

942
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:43,177
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

943
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:45,376
Tallahassee.

944
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,015
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

945
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,116
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

946
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:50,612
Not a juke joint.

947
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,251
You should arrive
by early morning.

948
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,384
I'll meet you there.

949
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:55,650
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

950
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:57,619
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

951
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,555
We have not slept
since the night before last,

952
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,656
and we...

953
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:03,263
Hello?

954
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:06,695
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

955
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:09,169
Certainly.

956
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,105
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

957
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:12,535
or right here at the hotel,

958
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:15,076
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

959
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,704
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

960
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:19,741
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

961
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,182
Maybe we should stay here.

962
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,712
Replenish the ice.

963
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,322
This is great, but how...

964
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:32,721
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

965
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,394
Rainbow.

966
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:37,527
Yes.

967
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:39,991
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

968
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:41,729
Like, a really, really good one?

969
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,797
Of course.

970
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,833
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

971
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,440
Theoretically.

972
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,120
So...

973
00:51:00,014 --> 00:51:03,158
I've been thinking
about it, and...

974
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:08,019
finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

975
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,727
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

976
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,630
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

977
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:17,633
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

978
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,569
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

979
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,408
but I usually have stuff to do.

980
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,212
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

981
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,743
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

982
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,285
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

983
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,287
Something I decided

984
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,783
last night
while I was lying in bed

985
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:38,786
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

986
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:43,054
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

987
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:44,528
Especially since, with you,

988
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,563
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

989
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:47,632
Am I right?

990
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:51,140
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

991
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,208
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

992
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:55,737
Yes, please.

993
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,937
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

994
00:51:57,938 --> 00:51:59,543
I mean, we're good friends,

995
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:01,545
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

996
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:02,975
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

997
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:06,583
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

998
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,553
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

999
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:11,753
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1000
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,722
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1001
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:16,329
She was always saying
that this or that

1002
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,199
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1003
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,466
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1004
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,402
the sex was great.

1005
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:25,273
Ladies, have we decided?

1006
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,673
Don't rush us, buddy.

1007
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:33,709
First, we'll dance.

1008
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:48,527
Maybe I do overthink things.

1009
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,530
Yeah.

1010
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:55,534
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1011
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:02,738
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1012
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:04,069
Ah, you know Debbie.

1013
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,138
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1014
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,711
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1015
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:11,879
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1016
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,650
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1017
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:16,081
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

1018
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:10,321
One accomplishment.

1019
00:56:10,322 --> 00:56:12,565
Huh? Name me one.

1020
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:15,029
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1021
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,966
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1022
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:20,771
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1023
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:22,509
on a creaky porch swing

1024
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,236
on a warm summer evening...
Crickets, so forth?

1025
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:27,547
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1026
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:29,417
trousers around your ankles,

1027
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:31,815
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1028
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:34,554
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1029
00:56:34,555 --> 00:56:36,589
Yes, people might stroll by

1030
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,118
and see you
looking foolish up there

1031
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,559
slapping ham on the veranda,

1032
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,595
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1033
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:45,125
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1034
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:47,765
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1035
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:50,801
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1036
00:56:50,802 --> 00:56:52,165
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1037
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:54,508
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1038
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:56,444
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1039
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:58,138
that I've been carrying
on my back

1040
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:00,416
all the way from Philadelphia!

1041
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:20,161
Help.

1042
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:30,677
"Big case."

1043
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:33,075
That woman.

1044
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:39,377
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1045
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:02,169
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1046
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,842
Yes, sir.

1047
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,760
Honey, we eating soon?

1048
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:29,598
Okay.

1049
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:33,833
Oh. All right.

1050
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,393
Jamie?

1051
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:12,366
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1052
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,612
Jamie, no!

1053
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,346
Jamie, why?

1054
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,991
Oh, my God.

1055
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:35,323
Marian.

1056
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,226
Sir?

1057
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:39,833
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1058
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,835
Tallahassee, sir.

1059
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,596
Where to, exactly?

1060
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:47,808
Yes, um...

1061
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:49,743
The track.

1062
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,811
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1063
01:00:51,812 --> 01:00:53,604
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1064
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:55,078
Oh, come on now.

1065
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,916
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1066
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,852
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1067
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:02,152
No. I like this one.

1068
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:05,727
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1069
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:07,552
Last night was beautiful,

1070
01:01:07,553 --> 01:01:09,224
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1071
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:10,830
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1072
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:12,656
Okay!
All right!

1073
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:15,065
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1074
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:17,001
We're here for two things.

1075
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,136
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1076
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,841
Screw you!

1077
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,667
We're here for two items.

1078
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:25,075
Whoa. She's naked.

1079
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:27,473
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1080
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:28,848
We're here for two items.

1081
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,982
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1082
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,083
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1083
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:34,887
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1084
01:01:34,888 --> 01:01:36,955
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1085
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,990
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1086
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,619
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1087
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,863
Let's get this show on the road.

1088
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:47,801
Yeah, baby.

1089
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:55,040
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1090
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:58,846
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1091
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:02,343
Whoa.

1092
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,752
This is so groovy.

1093
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,755
Now I can love you forever.

1094
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,383
Whoa.

1095
01:02:09,384 --> 01:02:10,792
And ever

1096
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:15,356
and ever and ever

1097
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:20,493
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1098
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:24,970
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1099
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:29,073
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1100
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:33,704
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1101
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:38,016
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1102
01:02:38,017 --> 01:02:41,745
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1103
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:45,419
Never to wilt...

1104
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:50,963
Took 'em straight here.

1105
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:52,129
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1106
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,132
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1107
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,433
This is all they had?

1108
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,172
What's all they had?

1109
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:06,847
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1110
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,882
What are you talking about?

1111
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:11,115
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1112
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:13,612
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1113
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:15,284
Come on, girls.

1114
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:16,990
Where's the last phallus?

1115
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,490
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1116
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,458
I-I...

1117
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,097
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1118
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,000
What have you done, jerk-off?

1119
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,870
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1120
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,333
They gave you the combination,

1121
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:33,335
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1122
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:35,040
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1123
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,845
past the first number.

1124
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,224
The senator is a good man.

1125
01:03:54,095 --> 01:03:56,996
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1126
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,360
Many of us did.

1127
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:00,868
It was a different time.

1128
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:03,937
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1129
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:06,468
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1130
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:13,914
Housekeeping.

1131
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,185
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1132
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:23,221
thing.

1133
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:28,522
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1134
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:33,659
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1135
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,904
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1136
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:39,534
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1137
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,833
He was just a kid.

1138
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:50,148
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1139
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:52,282
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1140
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:55,186
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1141
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,586
You saw him, sort of.

1142
01:05:13,502 --> 01:05:16,801
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1143
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:19,441
Think of it: eBay,

1144
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,742
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1145
01:05:23,743 --> 01:05:26,217
Comments, reviews.

1146
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,615
Think of what
it would do to him.

1147
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:32,994
His children, his family,
his career.

1148
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:39,197
We're not unreasonable.

1149
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,969
We'll gladly pay for it.

1150
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:42,926
We just...

1151
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:44,895
Will you please shut up!

1152
01:05:44,896 --> 01:05:46,105
That wasn't my idea!

1153
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:47,733
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1154
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:48,800
I was experimenting.

1155
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:50,076
But you liked it.

1156
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,374
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1157
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,112
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1158
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,542
Drunk on cock.

1159
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:56,346
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1160
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,018
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1161
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,910
- To understand life.
- No!

1162
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,517
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1163
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:08,028
God, man, what are you doing?!

1164
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:42,525
Mommy.

1165
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,185
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1166
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:07,681
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1167
01:07:07,682 --> 01:07:08,946
Then we switch hotels.

1168
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:11,058
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1169
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:12,488
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1170
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,886
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1171
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,131
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1172
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,469
Next customer, please.

1173
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:29,274
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1174
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:31,001
Don't ask me why.

1175
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:35,577
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1176
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:37,414
I need to speak to the senator.

1177
01:07:37,415 --> 01:07:40,945
<i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1178
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:43,355
Someone who has his...

1179
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,062
personal effects.

1180
01:08:17,985 --> 01:08:20,490
<i>Who is this?</i>

1181
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:21,821
Senator?

1182
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,296
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1183
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:27,167
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1184
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:30,764
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1185
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,403
Everybody's things.

1186
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:35,175
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1187
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,177
If you're not alone,

1188
01:08:37,178 --> 01:08:39,212
believe me, I'll know it.

1189
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,454
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1190
01:08:50,455 --> 01:08:52,049
made a phone call
from here last night.

1191
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,326
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1192
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,823
Well, this is for her.

1193
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,264
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1194
01:08:58,265 --> 01:08:59,529
You've missed them.

1195
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:02,269
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1196
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,851
Done.

1197
01:09:25,855 --> 01:09:26,886
With what?

1198
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:29,230
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1199
01:09:30,057 --> 01:09:31,594
Want to join me?

1200
01:10:01,055 --> 01:10:02,593
Jamie.

1201
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:06,332
I want...

1202
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,927
Uh-huh?

1203
01:10:07,928 --> 01:10:10,996
I... I-I want...

1204
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:13,505
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1205
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:18,102
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

1206
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:40,757
Who are you?

1207
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:43,858
Democrats.

1208
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:45,431
Mind if we sit down?

1209
01:11:53,902 --> 01:11:55,342
Are they all there?

1210
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:00,678
Count 'em.

1211
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:18,696
We didn't deserve this...

1212
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:21,798
this commodification.

1213
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:25,966
These are all good people.

1214
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:28,739
Important people, too,
some of them.

1215
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:33,579
There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.

1216
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:37,649
The owner of
a large-market football team.

1217
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:40,850
A Supreme Court justice.

1218
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:48,428
You little people
titillate yourselves

1219
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,958
with something
that was never meant for you,

1220
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:55,226
trafficking in
other people's attainments.

1221
01:12:55,227 --> 01:12:56,799
Senator, save the sanctimony.

1222
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,803
And hand over
the million smackers.

1223
01:13:01,906 --> 01:13:04,972
I used to believe in
the unfettered free market.

1224
01:13:10,946 --> 01:13:12,079
I don't know.

1225
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:18,656
Whose head, Senator?

1226
01:13:18,657 --> 01:13:22,958
Don't get lofty with me, women.

1227
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:28,029
Did we do the wrong thing?

1228
01:13:29,296 --> 01:13:31,164
What if he's the next president?

1229
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,935
You girls are cute.

1230
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:37,103
My friends and me are having
a little basement party later.

1231
01:13:37,104 --> 01:13:38,545
You want to join?

1232
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:48,456
Not tonight.

1233
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,021
Sukie?

1234
01:13:54,022 --> 01:13:55,154
There you are.

1235
01:13:55,155 --> 01:13:57,189
So what was that
crackhead phone call about?

1236
01:13:57,190 --> 01:13:59,191
Wha-What do you mean?
How'd you know I'd be here?

1237
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,534
How many dyke bars are there
in Tallahassee?

1238
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:03,800
What, are you an executive now?

1239
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:05,571
Did they, uh, make you
the president

1240
01:14:05,572 --> 01:14:07,167
of Little Miss Liar Pants, Inc.?

1241
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,235
Oh, this? No, I just, uh...

1242
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,886
'Cause we thought
they didn't know where we were,

1243
01:14:23,887 --> 01:14:25,591
but somehow they did,
and this morning,

1244
01:14:25,592 --> 01:14:27,219
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1245
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,023
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1246
01:14:29,024 --> 01:14:30,893
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1247
01:14:30,894 --> 01:14:32,697
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1248
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:35,932
Well, you've had a full day.

1249
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:41,102
She's yours now.

1250
01:14:42,468 --> 01:14:45,141
Hang on. This doesn't look good.

1251
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,927
Motherfucker.

1252
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:14,607
What's she chasing?

1253
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:16,038
Yeah.

1254
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:18,105
We forgot to tell you about

1255
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:20,338
the suave guy's head
in the hatbox.

1256
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,656
Boy, I think
I could win against him.

1257
01:15:30,657 --> 01:15:32,658
And now we get to just
keep on going.

1258
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:35,089
Who's gonna complain
if we keep the car?

1259
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,388
Things could not have
worked out better.

1260
01:15:37,389 --> 01:15:39,633
Well, I guess.

1261
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,030
What's wrong?

1262
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:46,100
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1263
01:15:46,101 --> 01:15:48,465
but I have to admit,

1264
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:50,335
I'll miss his...

1265
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:51,744
No worries, girl.

1266
01:15:52,505 --> 01:15:54,240
I made a cast.

1267
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:55,880
And two copies.

1268
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,113
Great.

1269
01:15:59,114 --> 01:16:00,686
But why two?

1270
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:02,281
For each other.

1271
01:16:02,282 --> 01:16:04,448
Ladies, your visitor is here.

1272
01:16:04,449 --> 01:16:06,483
Can we get our car?

1273
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:09,960
You know, hers and hers.

1274
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,965
Aunt Ellis.

1275
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:17,769
Oh, hello, darling.

1276
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:19,364
- She's your aunt?
- Uh-huh.

1277
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:20,772
Uncle John met her in church.

1278
01:16:20,773 --> 01:16:22,565
Watch what you say.
She's very religious.

1279
01:16:22,566 --> 01:16:24,810
So good to see you.

1280
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,009
This is my friend Jamie.

1281
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,615
Oh, how are you, young lady?

1282
01:16:28,616 --> 01:16:30,111
This your first time
in Tallahassee?

1283
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:32,883
Yes, ma'am,
and what a beautiful city.

1284
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,688
- Not like Miami.
- Oh, no, no.

1285
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,921
Not like Miami.

1286
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:39,890
You able to stay with us long?

1287
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:41,353
No, unfortunately...

1288
01:16:41,354 --> 01:16:43,058
Right after birding,
we're off to Massachusetts.

1289
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:45,126
- We just decided last night.
- Jamie.

1290
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:46,930
Well, what do they have
in Massachusetts

1291
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:49,526
that we don't have right here
in North Florida?

1292
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:51,639
Women can get married there.

1293
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,205
To each other?

1294
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,011
Hmm.

1295
01:17:02,014 --> 01:17:04,783
Well, that's an innovation.

1296
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,295
Ladies!
