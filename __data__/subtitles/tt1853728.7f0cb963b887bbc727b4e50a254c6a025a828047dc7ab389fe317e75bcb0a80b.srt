1
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,846
Who's that stumbling around
in the dark?

2
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,850
State your business
or prepare to get winged.

3
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,772
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
I mean you no harm.

4
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,983
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

5
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,194
Whoa, boy.

6
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,238
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

7
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,743
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that
go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

8
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,328
Might that be you?

9
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,665
-Who wants to know?
-Well, I do.

10
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,543
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

11
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,506
-What kind of doctor?
-Dentist.

12
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,382
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

13
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,385
Did you purchase those men
at the Greenville auction?

14
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,138
-So what?
-So I wish to parley with you.

15
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,348
Speak English.

16
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,642
I'm sorry.

17
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

18
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,564
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe...

19
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,025
...is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

20
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,652
Hello, you poor devils.

21
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,823
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident...

22
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,992
...of the Carrucan plantation?

23
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,037
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

24
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,249
Who said that?

25
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,964
What's your name?

26
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,720
Django.

27
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,556
Then you are exactly the one
I'm looking for.

28
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,727
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

29
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,273
Who are they?

30
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,444
Big John.

31
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,571
Ellis.

32
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,073
Roger.

33
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,035
Sometime they call him Little Raj.

34
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,412
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

35
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,664
Not anymore.

36
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,047
Tell me, if you were to see any
of these three gentlemen again...

37
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,507
-...would you recognize them?
-Hey.

38
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,719
-Stop talking to him like that.
-Like what?

39
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,179
Like that.

40
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,848
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain--

41
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,892
Speak English, goddamn it.

42
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,061
Everybody calm down.

43
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,898
I'm simply a customer trying to
conduct a transaction.

44
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,026
I don't care. No sale. Now, off with you.

45
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,112
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

46
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,448
Move it.

47
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,411
My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture...

48
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,415
...or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention?

49
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,418
Last chance, fancy pants.

50
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,089
Oh, very well.

51
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,288
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast.
I didn't want you to do anything rash...

52
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,041
...before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

53
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,586
You goddamn son of a bitch.

54
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,213
You shot Roscoe!

55
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,464
Well....

56
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,091
And you killed Ace!

57
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,302
I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.

58
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
And I do believe I have--

59
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,347
One, two, three, four.

60
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,434
--five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

61
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,103
-Damn leg's busted.
-No doubt.

62
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,440
Now, if you could keep your caterwauling
down to a minimum...

63
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,110
...I'd like to finish my line of inquiry
with young Django.

64
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,407
God-fucking-damn it!

65
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,075
As I was saying...

66
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,455
...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers
again, you could recognize them?

67
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,998
Yeah.

68
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,708
Sold American!

69
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,001
So, Mr. Speck?

70
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,879
Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

71
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,928
That iron is nasty business.

72
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,603
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

73
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,272
Thank you.

74
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,983
Django? Get up on that horse.

75
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,735
Also, if I were you...

76
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,281
...I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

77
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:51,174
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

78
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,687
Goddamn it!

79
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,402
One hundred, 10...

80
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,404
...20...

81
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,406
...and 5...

82
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,951
...for young Django here.

83
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,328
And since he won't be
needing it anymore...

84
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,831
...I'd like to purchase
your brother's nag.

85
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,708
Also, Mr. Speck...

86
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,796
...I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.
Do you have one?

87
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,466
You go to hell, dentist.

88
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,593
I thought not.

89
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,472
No worries. I come prepared.

90
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,103
Thank you.

91
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,065
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

92
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,919
Now, as to you poor devils....

93
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,046
So, as I see it...

94
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,133
...when it comes to the subject
of what to do next...

95
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,136
...you gentlemen have two choices.

96
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,429
One:

97
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,391
Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck...

98
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,560
...then carry him to the nearest town.

99
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,314
Which would be at least 37 miles
back the way you came.

100
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,732
Or two:

101
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,651
You could unshackle yourselves...

102
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,111
...take that rifle...

103
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,281
...put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep...

104
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,160
...and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

105
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,745
Choice is yours.

106
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:48,249
Oh, and on the off chance there are any
astronomy aficionados amongst you...

107
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,502
...the North Star is that one.

108
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,464
Ta-ta.

109
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,609
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this.

110
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,367
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this.

111
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doing my job.

112
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,208
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

113
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,626
Tell you what, boys:

114
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,546
Take me to the doc in El Paso,
I'll get you your freedom.

115
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,881
No. No, please.

116
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,139
All right, now.

117
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,807
I'd like you to take two of these
tonight...

118
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,935
...and then in the morning....

119
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,647
That's a nigger on a horse.

120
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,008
What's everybody staring at?

121
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,136
They ain't never seen no nigger
on a horse before.

122
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,244
Good morning, innkeeper.

123
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,915
Two beers for two weary travelers.

124
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,378
It's still a bit early.
We won't be open for another hour.

125
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,463
By then, we'll be serving breakfast.

126
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,927
What the hell
you think you're doing, boy?

127
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,388
Get that nigger out of here.

128
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,685
Help! Help!

129
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,895
Innkeeper!

130
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,273
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

131
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,526
Sheriff! Help!

132
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,403
Alas...

133
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,448
...now we must act
as our own bartender.

134
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,285
Sit down, my boy.

135
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,880
What kind of dentist are you?

136
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:29,512
Despite that cart,
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.

137
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,769
But these days,
I practice a new profession:

138
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,565
Bounty hunter.

139
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,490
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

140
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,825
No.

141
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,160
Well...

142
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,748
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash...

143
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,585
...a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

144
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,004
Hat.

145
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,895
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

146
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,731
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

147
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,943
After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities.

148
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,821
Sometimes that's easier said
than done.

149
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,618
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving indeed, I truly have killed him.

150
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,537
At which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

151
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,208
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh-for-cash business.

152
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,835
What's a bounty?

153
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,216
It's like a reward.

154
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,761
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

155
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,804
Certain people, yeah.

156
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,765
Bad people?

157
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,935
Badder they are, bigger the reward.

158
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,437
Which brings me to you.

159
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,608
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

160
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

161
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,989
On the other hand, I need your help.

162
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

163
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:21,040
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.

164
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,252
Still, having said that...

165
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,170
...I feel guilty.

166
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,177
So I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

167
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

168
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,111
However, at this endeavor,
I'm at a slight disadvantage...

169
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,489
...insofar as I don't know
what they look like.

170
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,535
But you do. Don't you?

171
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,912
I know what they look like, all right.

172
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,205
Good.

173
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,541
So here's my agreement.

174
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,793
You travel with me until we find them.

175
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,169
Where we going?

176
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,924
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

177
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,846
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

178
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,639
And when we find them...

179
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,225
...you point them out and I kill them.

180
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,687
You do that...

181
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,233
...I agree to give you your freedom,
$25 per Brittle Brother.

182
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,776
That's $75.

183
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,323
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

184
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,833
Okay, boys. Fun's over.

185
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,419
Come on out.

186
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,509
All right, folks, calm down.

187
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,262
Go about your business.

188
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,182
These jokers will be gone soon.

189
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:08,314
Now, why y'all wanna come into my town
and start trouble?

190
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,859
And scare all these nice people.

191
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,863
You ain't got nothing better to do...

192
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,158
...than to come into Bill Sharp's town...

193
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,411
...and show your ass?

194
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,463
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

195
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,478
Now you can get the marshal.

196
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,148
Marshal! Marshal!

197
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,651
-Should we wait inside?
-Can we just leave?

198
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,152
After you.

199
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,367
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

200
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,704
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

201
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,123
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

202
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,417
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

203
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,461
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

204
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,923
Somebody get poor Bill
out of the goddamn street.

205
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,843
You in the saloon.

206
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,972
We got 100 rifles aimed at
every way out of that building.

207
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,726
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

208
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:32,106
You and your nigger come out right now,
and I mean right now.

209
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,736
Is this the marshal I have the pleasure
of addressing?

210
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,654
Yes, it is.

211
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,948
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

212
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,284
<i>Na wunderbar, </i>marshal.

213
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,496
I have relieved myself of all weapons...

214
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,624
...and just as you have instructed...

215
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,461
...I am ready to step outside...

216
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,548
...with my hands raised
above my head.

217
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,093
I trust, as a representative...

218
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,805
...of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America...

219
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,975
...I shan't be shot down in the street...

220
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,811
...by either you or your deputies...

221
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,731
...before I've had my day in court.

222
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,983
You mean like you did our sheriff?

223
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,194
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

224
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

225
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,865
Do I have your word as a lawman...

226
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,827
...not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

227
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,334
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that...

228
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,462
...ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

229
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,299
Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.

230
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,220
They're a little tense out there...

231
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,098
...so don't make any quick movements
and let me do the talking.

232
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,935
Come ahead.

233
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,986
-You unarmed?
-Yes, indeed we are.

234
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,949
Marshal Tatum,
may I address you and your deputies...

235
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,660
...and apparently the entire town
of Daughtrey...

236
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,454
...as to the incident that just occurred?

237
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,414
Go on.

238
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,791
Thank you.

239
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,960
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

240
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,505
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

241
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,465
The man lying dead in the dirt...

242
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,427
...who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff...

243
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,721
...who went by the name of Bill Sharp...

244
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,934
...is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck...

245
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,687
...with a price on his head of $200.

246
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,857
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

247
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,316
The hell, you say.

248
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,404
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

249
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,030
But I'm willing to wager...

250
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,451
...this man was elected sheriff
sometime in the past two years?

251
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,622
-Yeah.
-I know this because three years ago...

252
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,251
...he was rustling cattle from the
B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company...

253
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,669
...of Lubbock, Texas.

254
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,547
Now, this is a warrant...

255
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:06,302
...made out by circuit court judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk...

256
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,429
...of Austin, Texas.

257
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,347
You're encouraged to wire him.

258
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,349
He'll back up who I am...

259
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,686
...and who your
dear departed sheriff was.

260
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,571
In other words, marshal...

261
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,032
...you owe me $200.

262
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,750
I'll be damned.

263
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,906
After this Brittle business
is behind us...

264
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,449
...you'll be a free man...

265
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,621
...with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket.

266
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,249
What's your plan after that?

267
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,337
Find my wife...

268
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,547
...and buy her freedom.

269
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,385
Django...

270
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,721
...I had no idea
you were a married man.

271
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,016
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

272
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,560
Me and my wife do.

273
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:43,774
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we run off.

274
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,568
Django.

275
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,446
Django, Django.

276
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,241
You got sand, Django.

277
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,369
The boy's got sand.

278
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,832
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

279
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,170
I want you to burn a runaway "R"
right here on his cheek.

280
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,380
And the girl too.

281
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,593
And I want you to take them
to the Greenville auction...

282
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,637
...and sell them.

283
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,723
Both of them.

284
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,142
Separately.

285
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,979
And this one...

286
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,276
...you will sell him cheap.

287
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,654
In Greenville...

288
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,534
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

289
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,753
You know when she was sold...

290
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,423
...you know where she came from...

291
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,800
...and you know her name.

292
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,178
What is her name?

293
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,305
Broomhilda.

294
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,599
What?

295
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,851
Broomhilda.

296
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,853
Broomhilda?

297
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,815
Were her owners German?

298
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,400
Yeah, how you know?

299
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,945
She wasn't born on the plantation.
She was raised by a German.

300
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,280
The Von Shafts.

301
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,324
She speak a little German too.

302
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,618
-Your wife?
-When she was little...

303
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,497
...her mistress taught her so she'd
have someone to speak German with.

304
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,666
Well, let me get this straight.

305
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,797
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

306
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,340
Yep.

307
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,387
They call me Hildi.

308
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,991
When we gain access
to these plantations...

309
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,786
...we'll be putting on an act.

310
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,622
You'll be playing a character.

311
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,675
No?

312
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,353
Now, during the act,
you can never break character.

313
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,605
Do you understand?

314
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,317
Yeah. Don't break character.

315
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,532
And your character
is that of the Valet.

316
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,367
What that is?

317
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,745
That's a fancy word for servant.

318
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,455
Valet?

319
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:51,336
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

320
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,507
Youse gonna let me pick out
my own clothes?

321
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,301
But of course.

322
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,463
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

323
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,966
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

324
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,260
I said niggers on horses--

325
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,222
His name is Django. He's a free man.

326
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,015
He can ride what he pleases.

327
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,518
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

328
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,396
My good sir...

329
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,233
...perhaps we got off
on the wrong boot.

330
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,944
Allow me to unring this bell.

331
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,656
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

332
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,784
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

333
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,330
Mr. Bennett?

334
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:13,126
I've been led to believe that you are
a gentleman and a businessman.

335
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,964
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee...

336
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,924
...to parley with you now.

337
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,262
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

338
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,850
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee...

339
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,811
...to buy one of my nigger gals?

340
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,604
No appointment, no nothing?

341
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,690
Oh, I'm afraid so.

342
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,359
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you...

343
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,111
...or your fancy-pants nigger?

344
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,488
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

345
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,366
Now, what you got to say about that?

346
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,829
Mr. Bennett...

347
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,541
...if you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be...

348
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:57,629
...I have 5000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

349
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:05,220
Well, come on inside and get yourself
something cool to drink.

350
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,278
Maybe while we discuss business...

351
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,489
...you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures...

352
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,367
...to escort Django around
your magnificent grounds.

353
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,702
Oh, well, absolutely.

354
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,288
-Betina.
-Yes, sir, Big Daddy?

355
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,248
What your Jimmie's name again?

356
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,875
-Django.
-Django.

357
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,377
Betina, sugar,
could you take Django there...

358
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,714
...and take him around
and show him all the pretty stuff?

359
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,633
-As you please, Big Daddy.
-Oh, Mr. Bennett...

360
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,178
...I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

361
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,263
He cannot be treated like a slave.

362
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,517
Within the bounds of good taste, he must
be treated as an extension of myself.

363
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,978
-Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
-Yes'm?

364
00:30:55,604 --> 00:31:00,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

365
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,945
You can't treat him
like the other niggers...

366
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,990
...because he ain't like the other niggers.
You got it?

367
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,035
You want I should treat him
like white folks?

368
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,495
No.

369
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,330
That's not what I said.

370
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,957
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

371
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,252
Yes, I can see that.

372
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,592
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

373
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,803
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

374
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,680
-Oh, you mean Jerry.
-That's the boy's name. Jerry.

375
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,600
-You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
-Yes'm, Big Daddy.

376
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:38,772
Well, that's it, then.
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

377
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,448
That house we just left from
is the Big House.

378
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,827
Big Daddy call it that because it's big.

379
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
That there is the pantry.

380
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,333
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

381
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,961
Poor little squirrels.

382
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,673
What you do for your master?

383
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,008
Didn't you hear him? I ain't no slave.

384
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,469
-So you really free?
-Yes, I's free.

385
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,139
You mean you wanna dress like that?

386
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,560
-Betina, I need to ask you something.
-What you want?

387
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,813
I'm looking for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

388
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,607
-Their name is Brittle. You know them?
-Brittle?

389
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,612
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Little Raj.

390
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,781
I don't know them.

391
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
They could be using a different name.

392
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,704
-They would have come this past year.
-You mean the Shaffers?

393
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,790
Maybe. Three brothers?

394
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,876
They here?

395
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,545
Could you point one of them out to me?

396
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,755
Well, one's over in that field.

397
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,563
Old Man Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

398
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,566
She work in the house, John.
You mess her up...

399
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,860
...she ain't gonna be worth
a damn thing.

400
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,778
Now, your Bible say....

401
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,619
I told you that I was one
that made her do it.

402
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,622
-You ready?
-She didn't wanna run off with me.

403
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,625
If anybody should be getting whupped,
it should be me.

404
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,544
I been here long enough,
you know me a long time now.

405
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,099
You know Master Carrucan ain't gonna
appreciate this. She's a house slave.

406
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,792
I'm asking you, please.
Ain't this what you want?

407
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,461
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

408
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,634
I's on my knees, John.

409
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,428
I like the way you beg, boy.

410
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,059
Is that who you was looking for?

411
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,104
Yep.

412
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,606
Where the other two at?

413
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,652
They by the stable, punishing
Little Jody for breaking eggs.

414
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,529
They whipping Little Jody?

415
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,906
Point me in that direction.

416
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,535
You go to that tree
and keep going thattaway.

417
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,667
Go get that white man
I came here with.

418
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,295
-Come on, now.
-No, no, please!

419
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,922
Come on, girlie. Come on.

420
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,632
Get you set up now.

421
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,885
And the Lord said, "The fear of ye...

422
00:34:56,386 --> 00:35:01,641
...and the dread of ye shall be
on every beast of the earth.'"

423
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,518
Hey, give me that arm!

424
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,105
You better give me that arm.
You better give me that arm.

425
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,832
Okay, she ready!

426
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,142
And after this,
we'll see if you break eggs again.

427
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,772
John Brittle!

428
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,461
You remember me?

429
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,850
I like the way you die, boy.

430
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,108
Goddamn son of a bitch.

431
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,545
Keep it funny!

432
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,989
Y'all wanna see something?

433
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,577
No!

434
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,338
Who were they?

435
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,340
That's Big John.

436
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,050
That's Little Raj.

437
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,552
Where's Ellis?

438
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,097
He's the one hightailing it
across that field right now.

439
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,519
-You sure that's him?
-Yeah.

440
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,021
-Positive?
-I don't know.

441
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,107
-If you're positive?
-I don't know what "positive" mean.

442
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,692
-It means you're sure.
-Yes.

443
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,820
-"Yes," what?
-Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

444
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,084
I'm positive he dead.

445
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,757
Django!

446
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:27,472
Everybody calm down.
We mean no one else any harm.

447
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,182
Who are you two jokers?

448
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,352
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative...

449
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,188
...of the criminal justice system
of the United States.

450
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:39,734
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

451
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,028
In my pocket is a warrant...

452
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:46,574
...signed by circuit court judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas...

453
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,370
...for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive...

454
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:55,291
...of John Brittle, Roger Brittle
and Ellis Brittle.

455
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,669
They were going by the name Shaffer.

456
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,341
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

457
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,803
These are wanted men.
The law wants them for murder.

458
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,388
Now, I reiterate:

459
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,224
The warrant states "dead or alive"...

460
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,727
...so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight...

461
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,064
...we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

462
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:23,361
I realize passions are high...

463
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,572
...but I must warn you:

464
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,409
The penalty for taking deadly force
against an officer of the court...

465
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,703
...in the performance of his duty is...

466
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,747
...you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

467
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:42,505
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

468
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,508
Gimme.

469
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,818
Satisfied?

470
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,285
May I have that back, please?

471
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,083
Get off my land.

472
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,044
Posthaste.

473
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:26,215
Load up the bodies as quickly
as you can and let's get out of here.

474
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,286
Yeah, that's them sons of bitches.

475
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,577
Come on, men!

476
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,082
We're coming for you, nigger!

477
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,137
Now, unless they start shooting first...

478
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,930
...nobody shoot them.

479
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,266
That's way too simple for these jokers.

480
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,936
We're gonna whup that nigger lover
to death.

481
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:06,566
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.

482
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,280
Damn.

483
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,117
I can't see fucking shit
out of this thing.

484
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,619
We ready or what?

485
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,788
Hold on, I'm fucking with my eyeholes.

486
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,543
Oh, shit. I just made it worse.

487
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,796
-Who made this goddamn shit?
-Willard's wife.

488
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,923
Well, make your own goddamn masks.

489
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,802
Look, nobody's saying they don't
appreciate what Jenny did.

490
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,390
If all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,
I could have cut it better than this.

491
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,226
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

492
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,728
Not too good.

493
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:48,232
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

494
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,903
When I start riding, the bag's
moving all over and I'm riding blind.

495
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,404
Shit.

496
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,240
I just made mine worse.

497
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,036
Anybody bring any extra bags?

498
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,164
No, nobody brought an extra bag.

499
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,918
-I'm just asking.
-Do we have to wear them when we ride?

500
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,088
Well, shitfire.
If you don't wear them as you ride up...

501
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,633
-...that defeats the purpose.
-I can't see in this fucking thing!

502
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,552
I can't breathe
and I can't ride in this thing.

503
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,013
Well, fuck all y'all. I'm going home.

504
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,265
Now, I watched my wife work all day...

505
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,311
...getting 30 bags together
for you ungrateful sons of bitches...

506
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,232
...and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize.

507
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,944
From now on,
don't ask me or mine for nothing.

508
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,823
Now, look.
Let's not forget why we're here.

509
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,577
We got a killer nigger over that hill there,
and we gotta make a lesson out of him.

510
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,540
Okay, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

511
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:50,461
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

512
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,671
Yeah.

513
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,675
But, not pointing any fingers,
they could have been done better.

514
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,555
So how about no bags this time...

515
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:05,476
...but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

516
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,687
-I like that idea.
-You get my vote.

517
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,896
Wait a minute.

518
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
I didn't say no bags.

519
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,484
But nobody can see.

520
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,779
-So?
-So it'd be nice to see.

521
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:21,701
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see.

522
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:27,206
So what? All that matters is can
the fucking horse see. That's a raid!

523
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,042
Sons of bitches!

524
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,670
I can't see shit!

525
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,883
There he is. Get that nigger
out from under that wagon.

526
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,260
And get that nigger lover
out of the wagon.

527
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,888
-That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy.
-What?

528
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,931
-They tricked us.
-Where are they?

529
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,233
Bull's-eye.

530
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,070
Look at them run.

531
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,745
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

532
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,588
Goddamn it!

533
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,510
Would you care to?

534
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
Can't see shit out of this.

535
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,897
-He's getting away.
-I got him.

536
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,525
Big Daddy's getting away.

537
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,860
I got him.

538
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,126
Got him.

539
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,385
The kid's a natural.

540
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,815
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

541
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,609
Broomhilda's a German name.

542
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,862
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

543
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,907
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

544
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,994
Broomhilda is the name
of a character...

545
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,081
...in the most popular
of all the German legends.

546
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,125
There's a story about Broomhilda?

547
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,127
Oh, yes, there is.

548
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,217
Do you know it?

549
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,553
Oh, every German knows that story.

550
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,228
Would you like me to tell you?

551
00:46:55,021 --> 00:47:01,610
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

552
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,741
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

553
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:11,078
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

554
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,455
What she do?

555
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,957
I can't exactly remember.

556
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,793
She disobeys him in some way.

557
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,130
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

558
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,923
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

559
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,094
It's a German legend, there's going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

560
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:31,599
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

561
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:38,689
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

562
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:44,445
And there, Broomhilda shall remain...

563
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:50,534
...unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

564
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,371
Does a fella arise?

565
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,540
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

566
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,542
A fella named Siegfried.

567
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,379
Does Siegfried save her?

568
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,299
Quite spectacularly so.

569
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:10,221
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

570
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,059
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

571
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,312
And he walks through hellfire...

572
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,025
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

573
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,531
I know how he feel.

574
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,909
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

575
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:42,628
Now, look, Django...

576
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,677
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

577
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:54,223
...but I can't let you go to Greenville
in a good conscience.

578
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:59,603
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

579
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,731
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

580
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,987
But let me ask you a question.

581
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,913
How do you like
the bounty hunting business?

582
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,667
Kill white folks and they pay you for it?

583
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,627
What's not to like?

584
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,962
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

585
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,467
I thought you was mad at me
for killing Big John and Little Raj.

586
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,846
Yeah, you were a tad overzealous,
but normally that's a good thing.

587
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,724
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

588
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,559
What you mean, "partner up"?

589
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:43,063
You work with me
through the winter till the snow melts...

590
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,192
...I give you a third of my bounties.

591
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:51,447
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts...

592
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,658
...I'll take you to Greenville myself...

593
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,162
...and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

594
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,418
Why you care what happen to me?

595
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,671
Why you care if I find my wife?

596
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,131
Frankly...

597
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

598
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,681
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

599
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:22,645
Plus, when a German meets a real-life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

600
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,899
As a German, I'm obliged to help you...

601
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,736
...on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.

602
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,741
You got her.

603
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,586
What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

604
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,129
His son's with him.

605
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,216
Well, good.
He'll have a loved one with him.

606
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,219
Maybe even share a last word.

607
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,764
That's better than most of them get.

608
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,558
Damn sight better than he deserves.

609
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,068
Put down the rifle.

610
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,948
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

611
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,118
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

612
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,456
Now, read it aloud.

613
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,208
Consider that today's lesson.

614
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,089
"Wanted. Dead or alive.

615
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,217
Smitty Bacall
and the Smitty Bacall G--"

616
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,887
-Gang.
-"Gang."

617
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,975
"For murder and stagecoach...

618
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,894
...robbery.

619
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,604
Seven-zero-zero-zero--"

620
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,064
Seven thousand.

621
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,649
Thousand.

622
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:59,778
"Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall...

623
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:05,241
...$1500 for each of his...

624
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,994
...gang m--"

625
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,620
Mem...?

626
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,289
"Members.

627
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:15,251
Known members of the Smitty Bacall
Gang are as follas:"

628
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,337
-Follows.
-"Follows."

629
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,924
"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and--"

630
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,344
Crazy Craig Koons.

631
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,556
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

632
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:33,020
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm
at 22, they would never have printed that.

633
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,815
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches...

634
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,359
...and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

635
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,322
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

636
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,200
This is what I do.

637
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:50,078
I kill people and sell their corpses
for cash.

638
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,374
This corpse is worth $7000.

639
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,336
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

640
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,347
Pa?

641
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,057
Pa!

642
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,152
Here. You need to keep
this Smitty Bacall handbill.

643
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,362
Why?

644
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:27,825
It's good luck. You always keep
the handbill of your first bounty.

645
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,790
That's accurate.

646
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,278
Doctor, Django, how the hell are you?

647
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,448
Who the hell have you got there?

648
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,700
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

649
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,745
Who the hell
is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

650
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:42,125
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

651
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,963
Leave them out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

652
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,342
Why don't you come in out of the snow
and get yourselves some coffee?

653
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,178
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

654
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,138
Pretty good.

655
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,633
Keep moving.
Get on up to that auction block.

656
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,971
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

657
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,434
Come on.

658
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,572
Keep going.

659
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,367
"Broomhilda Von Shaft.

660
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,453
Age 27.

661
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,913
'R' on right cheek.

662
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,125
Calvin Candie."

663
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:09,713
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

664
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,173
Candyland?

665
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,843
-Oh, you've heard of it.
-Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

666
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,387
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

667
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,390
...and that's the repellant gentleman
who owns her.

668
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,101
Let's hope she works
in the house, not the field.

669
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,312
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

670
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,856
She-- She pretty.

671
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,400
And she talk good too.

672
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,737
But when they tore her back up...

673
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,365
...and then they burned
that runaway "R" on her cheek...

674
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,409
...they goddamned her.

675
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,667
She ain't no field nigger but ain't good
enough for the house no more.

676
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,171
-They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
-What's a comfort--?

677
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,340
Not while I got freedom.

678
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,094
Not while I got my gun.

679
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,848
So do we offer to buy her?

680
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,894
So...

681
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,855
...say...

682
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,069
...a man wants to buy a horse.

683
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,530
Needs to buy a horse.

684
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,242
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
knocks on the door...

685
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:24,162
...and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
You know what the farmer says?

686
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,873
The farmer says no.

687
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,879
Well, I say fuck that farmer.
And I'm stealing that horse.

688
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,340
Fair enough.
But now you're a horse thief...

689
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,259
...and they hang horse thieves.

690
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:41,429
The horse goes back to its original owner
because the horse is his property.

691
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,100
We need her and we need
a bill of sale.

692
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,811
If we ain't gonna buy her,
how we gonna get her?

693
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,566
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

694
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,234
Go ahead.

695
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,986
So...

696
01:00:56,278 --> 01:01:01,283
...the man walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door...

697
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:06,413
...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

698
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,125
And makes an offer so ridiculous...

699
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,794
...the farmer is forced to say yes.

700
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,673
-We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
-No, it's far too big.

701
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,177
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

702
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,513
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

703
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,723
What?

704
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,225
Can you convincingly masquerade
as someone...

705
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,519
...who is an expert
on Mandingo fighting?

706
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,729
Why?

707
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,608
<i>Because my character is that of</i>
<i>a big money buyer from Düsseldorf...</i>

708
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,153
<i>...here in Greenville to buy my way</i>
<i>into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

709
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,157
<i>And your character is a Mandingo expert</i>
<i>I hired to help me do it.</i>

710
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,326
<i>They call that "One-Eyed Charly."</i>

711
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,878
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

712
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,842
Thank you.

713
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,095
You want me to play a black slaver?

714
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,057
Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.

715
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,977
A black slaver is lower than
the head house nigger...

716
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,772
...and, buddy, that's pretty fucking low.

717
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,483
Then play him that way.

718
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,820
Give me your black slaver.

719
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,084
Dr. Schultz.

720
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,962
-Good to see you again.
-Mr. Moguy.

721
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:41,299
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.

722
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,260
Nonsense, it's my job.

723
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,346
So this is the One-Eyed Charly
I've heard so much about.

724
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,890
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

725
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,851
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

726
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,770
Just call me Leo.

727
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,274
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

728
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,026
How long have you been associated
with Mr. Candie?

729
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:04,406
Calvin's father and I were about 11 when
we went to boarding school together.

730
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,450
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

731
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,745
One could almost say I was raised
to be Calvin's lawyer.

732
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,164
One could almost say youse a nigger.

733
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,000
What did you say?

734
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,794
-I said--
-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

735
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:22,757
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

736
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,135
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

737
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,845
What civilized people aren't?

738
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

739
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:36,396
{\an8}He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

740
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,318
Get back on top, now. Turn around.

741
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,986
There you go.

742
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,738
There you go.

743
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,908
Why do you want to get
in the Mandingo business?

744
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,415
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

745
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,544
Quit stalling, now.
Answer the question.

746
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,132
The awful truth?

747
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:08,261
I'm bored.
This seems like a good bit of fun.

748
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,226
Well, come on over.

749
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,146
We got us a fight going on
that's a good bit of fun.

750
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,651
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

751
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,164
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.

752
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,882
-Dr. Schultz.
-What a rare pleasure.

753
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,467
Keep fighting, niggers.

754
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,427
And I might add, an honor.

755
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,389
Honor to meet you.
Have a seat, the pleasure's mine.

756
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,017
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

757
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,520
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

758
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:21,292
Use your weight, boy, use your weight!
There you go.

759
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,753
He's much bigger and stronger!

760
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,463
Come on, now!

761
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,174
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

762
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,552
Bravo, bravo, Luigi.

763
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,515
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

764
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,268
You either hit him or are you ain't?

765
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,820
Big Fred, come on!

766
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,739
Turn him around! Now, come--!

767
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,369
Use your strength, boy!

768
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,497
Come on, now! Use your strength!

769
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,792
There you go.

770
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,670
There you go!

771
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:06,880
Look at that.

772
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,800
See, I told you to put some more power
in there.

773
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,969
Do what I told you, boy.

774
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,804
There you go.

775
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,139
No.

776
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,348
Do what I told you!

777
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:21,019
Blind him black, boy! Blind him black!

778
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,230
Oh, no, Luigi.

779
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,525
Yeah!

780
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,085
Finish him.

781
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,091
Go on, boy, finish him.

782
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,807
That's why they call him Big Fred.
Worth every penny.

783
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,060
Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

784
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,479
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

785
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,440
You did a fine job. A real fine job.

786
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,609
Mercedes.

787
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,340
Tequila.

788
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,810
What's your name?

789
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,438
Django.

790
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,526
Can you spell it?

791
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,532
D-J-A-N-G-O.

792
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,618
The D is silent.

793
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,745
I know.

794
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,840
Mr. Moguy, I want you to take care
of my new boy here.

795
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:18,303
You find him a room with a soft bed,
then bring him up a pony to lick his pole.

796
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,556
Be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, you hear?

797
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,099
-Yes, sir.
-Before you go--

798
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:27,020
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

799
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,568
You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.

800
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,111
Yes, sir.

801
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,288
What's your name, boy?

802
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,708
His name is Django Freeman.

803
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,379
Where'd you dig him up?

804
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,467
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

805
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,720
I've heard tell about you.

806
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,098
You been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no good.

807
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:08,019
Nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying. I'm curious.

808
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,688
What makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

809
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

810
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,240
-What did you say, boy?
-Calm down, Butch.

811
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:22,825
No offense given...

812
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,786
...none taken.

813
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,537
Monsieur Candie...

814
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:30,500
...I'd appreciate if you could direct
your line of inquiry toward me.

815
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,001
One...

816
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,922
...you do not have a drink.
Can I get you a refreshment?

817
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,591
Yes. I'll have a beer.

818
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,052
Roscoe, a beer for the man
with the beard...

819
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,056
...and I will have a Polynesian
Pearl Diver. Do not spare the rum.

820
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,683
Doc...

821
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,728
...I am a seasoned slaver. You are--
Well, you are a neophyte.

822
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,981
I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy here...

823
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,109
...is taking advantage of you.

824
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,988
With all due respect,
Monsieur Candie...

825
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,324
...I didn't seek you out for your advice.

826
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:07,870
I sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top-dollar market price.

827
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,290
I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience...

828
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,710
...it would be to discuss business.

829
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,673
Well, we weren't talking business yet.

830
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,509
We were discussing my curiosity.

831
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,470
Thank you.

832
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,515
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

833
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,603
Sheba, you stay right there.

834
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,439
I know you didn't mean me.

835
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,235
German.

836
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,320
Now, according to Moguy...

837
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,531
...if I do business with you...

838
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,700
...I'm doing business with both y'all.

839
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,327
He does the eyeballing,
you the billfold?

840
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,248
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

841
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:55,877
So...

842
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,964
...Bright Boy, Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh...

843
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,383
...and you was none too impressed,
huh?

844
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,051
Not for top dollar.

845
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,055
Then we got nothing more
to talk about.

846
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,391
You wanna buy a beat-ass
nigger from me...

847
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,019
...those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell.

848
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,813
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

849
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,192
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

850
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,988
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

851
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,619
Well, you won't sell your best.

852
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,163
You won't even sell your second best.

853
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,833
But your third best?
You don't want to sell him either.

854
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,379
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

855
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,882
...who knows what could happen?

856
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

857
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:53,017
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

858
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,354
How much would you say, Django?

859
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,943
Twelve thousand dollars.

860
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,034
Well, gentlemen,
you had my curiosity...

861
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,495
...but now you have my attention.

862
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,135
Willie. Willie.

863
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,596
Hold up. Hold up.

864
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,183
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good Dr. Schultz.

865
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,187
-Beautiful morning, isn't it?
-You couldn't have picked a better one.

866
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,315
Won't you take a ride with us
here in the victoria?

867
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,775
Oh, thank you very much.

868
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:45,403
You can tie your horse up back there.

869
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,996
Django.

870
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,212
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues...

871
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,465
...is I believe there is a level
above bright...

872
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,427
...above talented, above loyal...

873
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:12,805
...that a nigger can aspire to.

874
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:17,476
Say, one nigger that just pops up
in 10,000.

875
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,270
The exceptional nigger.

876
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,815
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

877
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,650
The sun is up.

878
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,695
It's shining on all of us.

879
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,201
Have a seat, doc.

880
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,829
Thank you. Quite an honor.

881
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,789
-The honor is all ours.
-Thank you.

882
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:42,335
<i>But I do believe that given time...</i>

883
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,713
...exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

884
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,674
...become if not frequent...

885
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,218
...more frequent.

886
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,096
Right, boy?

887
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,475
You are that 1 in 10,000.

888
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,770
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

889
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,413
-Touch your guns, you die.
-Everybody calm down.

890
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,832
Now, I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

891
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,169
-Are you kidding me? This nigger just--
-I said no harm done!

892
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,338
Now take your hand off your pistol!

893
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,176
Butch, that means you too.

894
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,137
Everybody stop antagonizing
my guest.

895
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,642
Hoot, get back up on your horse.

896
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,852
He broke my collarbone.

897
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,563
For God's sake,
somebody please help Hoot here...

898
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,440
...back up on his goddamn horse.

899
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:49,568
-Yes, sir, boss.
-Oh, now, you are one lucky nigger.

900
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,405
Better listen to your boss, white boy.

901
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,032
I'm gonna go walking
in the moonlight with you.

902
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,993
You wanna hold my hand?

903
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,377
Willie, take us home.

904
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,381
Here we go. Start moving.

905
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,431
Head them out.

906
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,811
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

907
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,230
-No, sir.
-You want a boot heel in it?

908
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,566
No, sir.

909
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,486
Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs
off me.

910
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:17,239
Flash that look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

911
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,949
Now move, nigger.

912
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,995
You niggers are gonna
understand something.

913
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,372
I'm worse than any
of these white men here.

914
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:29,168
You get the molasses out your ass,
keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

915
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,046
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?

916
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,422
Indeed.

917
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:39,428
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

918
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,307
I'm expecting to fall in love once I see
the specimens at Candyland...

919
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,934
...so before that moment...

920
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,813
...it would be good if I could have
a confidential strategy meeting...

921
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,107
...with my confidant.

922
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,903
What the hell you doing?

923
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,656
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

924
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,745
-You're sure it's her?
-He didn't call her by name...

925
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:08,457
...but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

926
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,334
While it's not wise to assume...

927
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,962
...in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

928
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,588
Point being...

929
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,758
...don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

930
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,677
You lose sight of why we're here.

931
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:24,306
-You think I lost sight of that?
-Yes, I do. Stop antagonizing Candie.

932
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:29,603
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

933
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:34,483
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

934
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,028
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

935
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,990
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

936
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,409
I recall the man...

937
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,704
...who had me kill another man
in front of his son...

938
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,956
...and he didn't bat a eye.

939
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,208
You remember that?

940
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

941
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:58,507
What you said was that
this is my world...

942
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,677
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

943
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,639
So that's what I'm doing,
I'm getting dirty.

944
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,563
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad...

945
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,774
...but that was the general gist.

946
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,488
See you at Candyland.

947
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,665
All right, niggers, back at it.

948
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,793
That means you too, Moonlight.

949
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,800
I'll be.

950
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,802
D'Artagnan!

951
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:28,180
Now, boy, why do a fool thing
like run off?

952
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,724
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

953
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,017
Yes, you can.

954
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:35,437
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

955
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:39,775
Mr. Stonesipher, would you shut these
dogs up? I cannot hear myself think.

956
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,528
Quieten down, Marsha!
Marsha, hush up!

957
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,154
Marsha! Hush up!

958
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:48,242
Hey! Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

959
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,714
-Well, now, boy, get on out that tree.
-Yes, sir.

960
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:27,072
How long was he loose?

961
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,534
A night. Day.

962
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,703
Half the other night.

963
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,247
How far he get off the property?

964
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:40,294
About 20 miles off prop.
Pretty far considering that limp he got.

965
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,382
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

966
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,509
One of this new lot.

967
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,388
Way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

968
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,391
Please, Monsieur Candie,
I ain't got it in me no more.

969
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:57,936
Now, now, now. Now, no begging.

970
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,939
No playing on my soft heart.

971
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:07,237
-You in trouble now, son.
-Yes, sir.

972
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,285
You know, I done paid $500 for you.

973
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,662
When I pay $500...

974
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:20,084
...I expect to get five fights out of a nigger
before he roll over and play dead.

975
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,293
Sir.

976
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,505
Gotta understand
I'm running a business here.

977
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,674
-You fought three fights.
-But I won every one.

978
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

979
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:33,180
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winning and losing.

980
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,394
Still, the fact remains:

981
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:42,272
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights.

982
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,858
So, what about my $500, huh?

983
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,154
What about my $500?

984
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,740
You gonna reimburse me?

985
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,249
You even know
what "reimburse" means?

986
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,384
I'll reimburse you.

987
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,305
You will?

988
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,058
Yep.

989
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,105
You'll pay $500...

990
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:27,276
...for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

991
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,485
No, he won't.

992
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,031
He just tired of you
toying with him is all.

993
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,742
Matter of fact, so am I.

994
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,328
We ain't paying a penny
for that pickaninny.

995
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,248
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

996
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,459
You heard him.

997
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:57,139
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

998
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:00,601
He ain't never seen a nigger like you
ever in his life.

999
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,769
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1000
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,690
That's right.

1001
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:08,942
For that matter...

1002
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:11,820
...nor have I.

1003
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,328
Now...

1004
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:23,874
...seeing as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1005
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:29,046
...you won't mind me handling this nigger
any way I see fit?

1006
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,090
He's your nigger.

1007
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,553
Mr. Stonesipher?

1008
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:42,184
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1009
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,269
Marsha!

1010
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,396
Marsha, hey, get him!

1011
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,859
Get him, get him!

1012
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,147
Your boss looks a little green around the
gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1013
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:33,694
No. He just ain't used to seeing
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1014
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,073
You are used to it?

1015
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,743
I'm just a little more used to Americans
than he is.

1016
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,747
Now, Monsieur Candie...

1017
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,624
...whenever you're ready.

1018
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:52,170
We rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's get to it.

1019
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:58,927
Because as of now, if he's an example,
I ain't impressed.

1020
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,514
Follow me.

1021
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:02,384
Line them up to the left here now, boy.

1022
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,345
Stand up straight, now!

1023
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,723
Get up there.

1024
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,308
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1025
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:14,563
I said give me a line! Give me a line!
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1026
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,791
Hello! Stephen, my boy.

1027
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,794
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass.

1028
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,630
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1029
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:25,801
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's the matter? Why you so ornery?

1030
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,011
-You miss me, huh?
-Oh, yes, sir.

1031
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:31,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop.

1032
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:35,602
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1033
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:40,690
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1034
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:46,571
Now, I asked you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1035
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,365
Hey, Snowball?

1036
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:53,203
Wanna know my name
or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1037
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:56,289
Just who the hell you calling
"Snowball," horse boy?

1038
01:28:56,456 --> 01:29:00,085
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag
so fast, make your head spin.

1039
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,962
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1040
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:06,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a Freeman.

1041
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,760
-This nigger here?
-That nigger there.

1042
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,221
Let me at least introduce
the two of you.

1043
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:15,308
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1044
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,728
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two ought to hate each other.

1045
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,732
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1046
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:26,987
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1047
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,655
They are our guests, Stephen.

1048
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:32,284
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
ought to show them hospitality.

1049
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,494
-You understand that?
-Him I understand.

1050
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:37,205
Don't know why I got to take lip
off this nigger.

1051
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,083
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1052
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:43,377
-Yes, sir. I understand.
-Well, good.

1053
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:47,424
They're spending the night. Go up in
the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1054
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,426
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1055
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,928
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

1056
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,598
-In the Big House?
-You got a problem with that?

1057
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,975
No, I ain't got no problem with it...

1058
01:29:57,142 --> 01:30:00,145
...if you ain't got no problem
burning the bed, sheets...

1059
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,063
...when this motherfucker's gone.

1060
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,398
That is my problem.
They are mine to burn.

1061
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:06,776
Your problem
is making a good impression.

1062
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:11,448
I want you to start solving that problem
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1063
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,035
Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.

1064
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,245
Go on, now.

1065
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:20,749
Can't believe you brought a nigger
to stay in the Big House.

1066
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:24,044
-Your daddy rolling over in his grave.
-Man, the lip on him.

1067
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,963
He's getting worse and worse. Now....

1068
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:31,968
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1069
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,137
There she is!

1070
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:40,518
Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle
is my widowed sister.

1071
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:45,023
Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1072
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:49,152
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly?

1073
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,948
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1074
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,408
-Come on, Charly. Go on.
-Let's go. Come on.

1075
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,078
You know where it is.
Like you on a rope.

1076
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:02,374
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run.

1077
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,917
Monsieur Candie?

1078
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:09,839
Yeah. About that matter about
the nigger girl you were talking about?

1079
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:11,049
Nigger gal?

1080
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,761
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1081
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,013
Yes, Hildi, what about them?

1082
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:21,685
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1083
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,355
You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1084
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:29,359
Stephen, when you get through showing
them their rooms, go fetch Hildi...

1085
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:33,071
...get her cleaned up real nice
and sent to Dr. Schultz's room here.

1086
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:37,409
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there's
something I ain't told you about yet.

1087
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:41,413
-What?
-Hildi in the hot box.

1088
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:43,999
What's she doing there?

1089
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:48,294
What you think she doing there
in the hot box? She being punished.

1090
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,006
-What she do?
-She run off again.

1091
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,092
Jesus Christ, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1092
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,302
-Two.
-When did she go?

1093
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,180
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1094
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,726
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1095
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:06,438
Lucky for her, they was out
chasing D'Artagnan's ass.

1096
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,358
Bill and Cody went looking for her,
found her, brung her back.

1097
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:11,901
Now, she a little beat up.

1098
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,363
She done that to her own damn self
running through them bushes.

1099
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,032
How long she been in the box?

1100
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,118
How long do you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1101
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,996
And the little bitch got 10 more days
be in there.

1102
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,207
-Still, take her out.
-Take her out? Why?

1103
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,251
Because I said so, that's why.

1104
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,212
Dr. Schultz is my guest.
Hildi is my nigger.

1105
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,548
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1106
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,802
-But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
-Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1107
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:40,972
What is the point of having
a nigger that speaks German...

1108
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,767
...if you can't wheel them out
when you have a German guest?

1109
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:47,520
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1110
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,189
Yes, sir.

1111
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,901
Lara Lee.
Will you and Cora be responsible...

1112
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,696
...for getting Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1113
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:59,783
-Of course, darling.
-Now, gentlemen, I do apologize...

1114
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,994
...but I am weary from our travels
beyond words.

1115
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:06,247
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1116
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,838
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up out of there!

1117
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:17,675
Cora, come here.
Get over there and get her cleaned up...

1118
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,761
...bring her back over here to Dr.--

1119
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,263
-What he say your name is? Shoots?
-Schultz.

1120
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,473
Schultz.

1121
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,434
-Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl.
-Yes, sir.

1122
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,482
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1123
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,152
No!

1124
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:48,975
Is you coming with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1125
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,821
Hello, ladies.

1126
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:28,616
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1127
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:34,831
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1128
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,459
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1129
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:41,963
I've heard a lot of good things
about you.

1130
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,925
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't you know.

1131
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,179
As I look at you now, Broomhilda...

1132
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:55,560
...I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1133
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,190
The doctor here speaks German.

1134
01:37:02,816 --> 01:37:04,818
And I've been informed you do as well?

1135
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,822
Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.

1136
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,958
Astonishing.

1137
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:28,134
-And I shall bring y--
-Much obliged.

1138
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,920
Don't be afraid.

1139
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,460
Pardon.

1140
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:40,033
Hey, Little Troublemaker.

1141
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:52,088
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1142
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:55,216
-Hurry up.
-These ready, Miss Cora.

1143
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:56,759
No, they drinking tonight.

1144
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:59,762
Go get the jug with the red stuff
Monsieur Candie like.

1145
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:03,224
-Get your big pretty ass out the way.
-You know you like it.

1146
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:05,601
That's because you knows what I like.

1147
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:07,728
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1148
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:13,150
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1149
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:18,364
But the best three by far
were Samson....

1150
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:20,992
-What's that other one's name?
-Goldie.

1151
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,201
Goldie.

1152
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,412
And Eskimo Joe.

1153
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:27,164
By the way,
why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1154
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:30,459
You never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.

1155
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:34,505
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1156
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:40,553
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.

1157
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,263
We all know that.

1158
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:47,184
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1159
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,479
All three are champions.

1160
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:52,648
Samson's the champion.

1161
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,692
Them other two pretty good.

1162
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:58,821
-Calvin, what's this nigger you let--?
-It's all right.

1163
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:01,157
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie...

1164
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:04,702
...while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game...

1165
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:09,122
...I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1166
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,458
Is that right?

1167
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:15,171
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1168
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:18,299
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1169
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:22,386
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1170
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,264
-Need to have what? What?
-Panache.

1171
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,476
-A sense of showmanship.
-Showmanship, yes.

1172
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:31,937
I want to be able to bill him
as the Black Hercules.

1173
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:37,360
-The Black Hercules. Isn't that clever?
-More like Nigger-les.

1174
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,988
I said, and I quote:

1175
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:44,617
"I would pay top dollar for...

1176
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,370
...the right nigger."

1177
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:51,749
Now, I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1178
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,168
But is he right as rain?

1179
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:01,050
Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know
there is no one in the nigger fight game...

1180
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:03,678
...that appreciates
the value of showmanship...

1181
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:06,389
-...more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.
-Nobody.

1182
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:10,434
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.

1183
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,728
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1184
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:18,025
Now, that should be your first, second,
third, fourth and fifth concern.

1185
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:20,778
After you have that,
and you know you have that...

1186
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:24,073
...then you can start to implement
a grand design.

1187
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:27,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1188
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,744
First things first.

1189
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:39,922
I see you two getting on.

1190
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,091
Famously.

1191
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,968
Oh, Monsieur Candie...

1192
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:48,597
...you cannot imagine what it's like not to
hear your native tongue in four years.

1193
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:51,726
Well, hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1194
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:57,565
Two weeks in Boston.
Monsieur Candie, you a mess.

1195
01:43:58,274 --> 01:44:00,192
Two weeks in Boston.

1196
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:05,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1197
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:09,869
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1198
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,871
Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.

1199
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:14,790
You might have caught
a little dose of nigger love.

1200
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:17,250
Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1201
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:21,130
It's like a pool of black tar.
Once it catches your ass, you caught.

1202
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,299
Yes, sir, you stuck.

1203
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,843
I don't know, doctor.

1204
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,971
You can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want...

1205
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:33,184
...but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1206
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:37,855
Well, naturally.

1207
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:41,442
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention...

1208
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:43,778
...not the plucked chicken.

1209
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:46,864
Dr. Schultz,
don't be so down on yourself.

1210
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,325
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1211
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:52,870
To clean these dishes, put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear?

1212
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:55,498
You know that nigger, don't you?

1213
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,290
-Who?
-"Who?"

1214
01:44:57,458 --> 01:45:00,753
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talking about.

1215
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:04,048
At the table?

1216
01:45:04,297 --> 01:45:05,883
I don't know him.

1217
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,468
You don't know him.

1218
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:10,346
-No.
-"No," what?

1219
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,264
No, sir.

1220
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:19,063
You wouldn't lie to me, now,
would you?

1221
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,735
Okay.

1222
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:29,365
Yeah. If you say so.

1223
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:38,958
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1224
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,002
But if it was my money...

1225
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:45,297
...I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1226
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:47,633
What would your price be?

1227
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,927
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1228
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:53,806
...and I don't know why I would be
inclined to be generous...

1229
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:56,183
...9000.

1230
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,643
Maybe.

1231
01:45:58,769 --> 01:45:59,812
Dr. Schultz...

1232
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:04,775
...let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about.

1233
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,319
It wasn't me who came to you
to sell a nigger.

1234
01:46:07,486 --> 01:46:08,529
Sure wasn't.

1235
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,990
-You approached me to buy one.
-Sure was.

1236
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:13,576
That $9000 Bright Boy's
been bandying about...

1237
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:17,079
...ain't too far off. If I wanted
to sell Eskimo Joe for that...

1238
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:19,957
-...I could do so any day of the week.
-Any day.

1239
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:24,461
But like you said in Greenville, doctor,
I don't wanna sell him.

1240
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:28,966
It was only your ridiculous offer
of $12,000...

1241
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,802
...that made me even consider it.

1242
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:44,273
You know, Monsieur Candie, you do
possess the power of persuasion.

1243
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:50,738
Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1244
01:46:50,905 --> 01:46:53,032
Eskimo Joe, $12,000.

1245
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,285
Hooray, doctor. Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1246
01:46:56,452 --> 01:47:00,122
However, that is a tremendous
amount of money.

1247
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:03,334
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,
I have a lawyer.

1248
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,294
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1249
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:08,631
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract...

1250
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,676
...before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1251
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:16,639
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe
examined by a physician of my choosing.

1252
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:22,435
-Naturally.
-So, say I return in about...

1253
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:25,731
...five days' time.

1254
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:27,024
Five days?

1255
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:28,441
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1256
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,903
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy...

1257
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,822
...can hash out the finer details
between themselves.

1258
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:37,493
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1259
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:39,495
Gentlemen...

1260
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:42,915
...may I propose a toast?

1261
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,418
To Eskimo Joe.

1262
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,589
Or shall we call him
the Black Hercules?

1263
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:52,675
To the Black Hercules.

1264
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,426
The Black Hercules.

1265
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:55,803
To the Black Hercules.

1266
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:59,472
You was right, doctor.
That name do have "pan-ass."

1267
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:04,979
Hildi, top my drink off.

1268
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:12,444
So, Hildi, how you like serving
at the big table in the Big House, huh?

1269
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:16,115
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1270
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,450
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1271
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:22,371
Better than sizzling in that hot box
or dragging your ass...

1272
01:48:22,538 --> 01:48:23,664
...through a bramble bush.

1273
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:27,626
Maybe not as much fun as getting to
pleasure all them Mandingos, huh?

1274
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:30,170
-She like them niggers. Sure do.
-Like Samson?

1275
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:31,380
No, sir.

1276
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,090
You know, Monsieur Candie...

1277
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:36,969
...the doctor here might be interested
in seeing Hildi's peeled back...

1278
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,513
...seeing as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1279
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:43,017
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi...

1280
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:46,395
...did you just speak German
or did you take her clothes off?

1281
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:50,107
-No, we just talked and--
-Oh, so you haven't seen her back?

1282
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:51,316
I haven't--

1283
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:54,653
No, no, no. Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1284
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,238
Hildi, take off your dress.

1285
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:58,407
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
Go on.

1286
01:48:58,574 --> 01:49:02,244
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

1287
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:05,372
But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Düsseldorf.

1288
01:49:05,538 --> 01:49:08,375
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1289
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:11,462
It would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1290
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:14,965
These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz,
no doubt about it.

1291
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:17,176
Hildi's got something like four lashes.

1292
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:20,012
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1293
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:23,474
-Look at that, doctor. It's like a painting.
-Calvin!

1294
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:27,560
We are eating. Ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped-up back.

1295
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:31,273
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

1296
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:34,567
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1297
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:37,237
During the brandies, gentlemen.

1298
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:45,412
Cora, come get this girl.

1299
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:51,293
-She a mess.
-Yes, ma'am?

1300
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,839
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up. Come on in here.

1301
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:05,974
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1302
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,644
You say you ain't know him.

1303
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:16,276
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1304
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,821
I don't.

1305
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:20,948
Yes, you do.

1306
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:24,118
Mr. Stephen...

1307
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:26,578
...I don't.

1308
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,540
Why is you lying to me?

1309
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,918
I ain't.

1310
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:35,504
Then why is you crying?

1311
01:50:36,088 --> 01:50:37,923
You scaring me.

1312
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,341
Why is I'm scaring you?

1313
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:42,010
Because you scary.

1314
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:46,223
To speak German this afternoon
with Hildi...

1315
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:50,060
...was positively soul-enriching.

1316
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:52,938
Doctor, that warms my heart
to hear that.

1317
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:56,358
You stay right here.

1318
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:06,034
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1319
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:09,288
Why, yes. Yes, sirree, Bob, I did.

1320
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:12,791
In that case...

1321
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:16,962
...allow me to propose
another proposition.

1322
01:51:17,129 --> 01:51:18,255
I'm all ears.

1323
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:20,507
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1324
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,426
-Monsieur Candie--
-Stephen.

1325
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,388
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1326
01:51:27,222 --> 01:51:32,060
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1327
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:33,353
Excuse him.

1328
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,024
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1329
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:39,484
You mean get up out of my chair?

1330
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,653
If'n you could manage it.

1331
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,823
-Why?
-It's about dessert.

1332
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,783
What about dessert?

1333
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,536
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1334
01:51:49,702 --> 01:51:51,872
We're having white cake.

1335
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,374
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing?

1336
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:58,879
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1337
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:00,380
Meet me in the library.

1338
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,926
I just can't understand
why you won't come talk to these niggers.

1339
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:06,428
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1340
01:52:06,595 --> 01:52:11,225
Fine, fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1341
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,893
Yes, sir.

1342
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:16,855
Well, gentlemen, as you can see...

1343
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:19,191
...talented as they are in the kitchen...

1344
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:22,945
...from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1345
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:28,075
If you'll excuse me a moment....

1346
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,707
You may clear the dinner service.

1347
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:38,919
You heard him. Go on, get.

1348
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:40,837
Hurry up, girl.

1349
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:46,093
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus?

1350
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,929
-The circus?
-Yes.

1351
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,312
What is the matter?

1352
01:53:02,401 --> 01:53:07,489
Them motherfuckers ain't here
to buy no Mandingos.

1353
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:09,199
They wants that girl.

1354
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,996
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about?

1355
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:17,499
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1356
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:21,336
They ain't here
for no muscle-bound Jimmie.

1357
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,006
They here for that girl.

1358
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:26,466
What girl? What, Hildi?

1359
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:30,262
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1360
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:33,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1361
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:36,143
-Did he give you any money?
-No, not yet, but--

1362
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, no how.

1363
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:41,148
But he's just about to buy...

1364
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:44,443
...who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1365
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:48,238
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1366
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,495
Where you getting all this?

1367
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:59,958
Why would they go through all that
for a nigger with a chewed-up back...

1368
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:01,251
...ain't worth $300?

1369
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:05,047
They doing it because that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1370
01:54:05,213 --> 01:54:06,381
She probably his wife.

1371
01:54:07,215 --> 01:54:11,303
Why that German gives a fuck who
that uppity son of a bitch is in love with...

1372
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,638
...I'm sure I don't know.

1373
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:18,060
If she's who they want...

1374
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:22,689
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos then?

1375
01:54:22,855 --> 01:54:26,401
You wouldn't pay no never mind
to no $300.

1376
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,904
But that 12,000?

1377
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:32,407
That made you real friendly,
now, didn't it?

1378
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:36,870
Yes, it did.

1379
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,708
His wife, huh?

1380
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:49,549
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1381
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:54,888
Those lying...

1382
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,517
...goddamn time-wasting...

1383
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:01,561
...sons of bitches.

1384
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:04,564
Sons of bitches!

1385
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:10,570
--out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1386
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,572
Oh, there you are.

1387
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:16,410
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1388
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:19,663
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1389
01:55:20,122 --> 01:55:22,749
Lara Lee, I was just looking
out the big window.

1390
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:25,919
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver...

1391
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:31,133
...trying to sell a passel of ponies.
Be a dear, go give them gals an eyeball.

1392
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,219
-Of course, brother.
-Thank you, darling.

1393
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,485
Yeah. Business never sleeps.

1394
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:55,449
Apropos, before your exit...

1395
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:59,911
...we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1396
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:02,914
Yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1397
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:05,250
And we will again, in a moment.

1398
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:23,935
Who's your little friend?

1399
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:30,525
This is Ben.

1400
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:36,490
He's a old Joe that lived around here
for a long time.

1401
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:39,201
And I do mean a long damn time.

1402
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:44,456
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1403
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,917
...and my daddy's daddy.

1404
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,920
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1405
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:54,716
...Old Ben took care of me.

1406
01:56:56,593 --> 01:57:00,680
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi...

1407
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,682
...puts a white man in contact...

1408
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:06,520
...with a whole lot of black faces.

1409
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:13,693
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1410
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:18,615
...surrounded by black faces.

1411
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:24,079
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out...

1412
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:26,706
...I only had one question:

1413
01:57:29,918 --> 01:57:31,294
Why don't they kill us?

1414
01:57:35,507 --> 01:57:40,595
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years...

1415
01:57:40,762 --> 01:57:45,767
...Old Ben here would shave my daddy
with a straight razor.

1416
01:57:46,142 --> 01:57:51,064
Now, if I was Old Ben, I would have
cut my daddy's goddamn throat...

1417
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:55,110
...and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1418
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,114
But he never did.

1419
01:58:00,615 --> 01:58:01,741
Why not?

1420
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:07,664
You see, the science of phrenology...

1421
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:10,375
...is crucial to understanding...

1422
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:13,795
...the separation of our two species.

1423
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:18,091
In the skull of the African here...

1424
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:21,428
...the area associated
with submissiveness...

1425
01:58:21,595 --> 01:58:27,392
...is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1426
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,534
If you examine...

1427
01:58:45,577 --> 01:58:48,330
...this piece of skull here...

1428
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:57,631
...you will notice three distinct dimples.

1429
01:59:01,176 --> 01:59:05,055
Here, here and here.

1430
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:06,431
Now...

1431
01:59:06,598 --> 01:59:11,478
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo...

1432
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:16,066
...these three dimples would be found
in the area most associated with...

1433
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:18,026
...creativity.

1434
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:20,695
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1435
01:59:20,945 --> 01:59:22,822
And in the skull of Old Ben...

1436
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:25,283
...unburdened by genius...

1437
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:30,288
...these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1438
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,457
...servility.

1439
01:59:33,291 --> 01:59:35,293
Now, Bright Boy...

1440
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,129
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1441
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:43,176
But if I took this hammer here...

1442
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:47,639
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1443
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:53,895
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1444
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:56,189
...as Old Ben.

1445
01:59:57,315 --> 02:00:00,777
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1446
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:03,947
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop...

1447
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:07,701
...Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1448
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:11,913
There have been a lot of lies
around this dinner table tonight...

1449
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,207
...but that you can believe!

1450
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:19,838
Mr. Moguy, would you collect the pistol
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1451
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:27,470
-Thank you ever so much.
-Doctor.

1452
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:33,184
Where were we?

1453
02:00:37,147 --> 02:00:39,107
Jackass.

1454
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:44,070
Yes.

1455
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:47,782
I do believe you were just getting ready
to make me a proposition...

1456
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,617
...to buy Broomhilda.

1457
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:51,411
Am I right?

1458
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:56,791
Right.

1459
02:00:58,626 --> 02:00:59,669
Bring out Hildi!

1460
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:05,216
Get over there yonder.

1461
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:08,470
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1462
02:01:08,636 --> 02:01:12,140
-Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
-Now shut your mouth.

1463
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:17,145
Dr. Schultz...

1464
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:21,191
...in Greenville, you yourself said
that for the right nigger...

1465
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:25,862
...you'd be willing to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1466
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:29,407
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1467
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:33,745
To which you said, "$12,000."

1468
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:37,707
Now, considering y'all have ridden
a whole lot of miles...

1469
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:40,043
...went through a whole lot of trouble...

1470
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:44,506
...and done spread a whole lot of bull
to purchase this lovely lady right here...

1471
02:01:44,672 --> 02:01:50,678
...it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact, the right nigger.

1472
02:01:50,929 --> 02:01:54,641
And if y'all want to leave Candyland
with Broomhilda...

1473
02:01:54,849 --> 02:02:00,355
...the price is $12,000.

1474
02:02:00,522 --> 02:02:04,317
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1475
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:08,780
Yes, I do, doctor.

1476
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:11,866
You see, under the laws
of Chickasaw County...

1477
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:15,537
...Broomhilda here is my property.

1478
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:20,959
And I can choose to do with my property
whatever I so desire.

1479
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:24,921
And if y'all think my price...

1480
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:28,675
...for this nigger here is too steep...

1481
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:31,719
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1482
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:38,560
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1483
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:40,228
Right in front of both y'all!

1484
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:41,521
Easy, big fella.

1485
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:45,483
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1486
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:49,153
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?

1487
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,489
What's it gonna be?

1488
02:02:51,656 --> 02:02:55,618
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1489
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:58,329
Yes, you may.

1490
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:12,802
That 12.

1491
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:18,766
Sold!

1492
02:03:18,975 --> 02:03:25,440
To the man with the exceptional beard
and his unexceptional nigger.

1493
02:03:30,695 --> 02:03:33,197
-Mr. Moguy.
-Yes, Calvin?

1494
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,993
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1495
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,579
Twelve thousand dollars.

1496
02:03:41,998 --> 02:03:44,834
It was a pleasure doing business
with y'all.

1497
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:46,711
Now, gentlemen...

1498
02:03:47,837 --> 02:03:50,340
...if you care to join me in the parlor...

1499
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:53,801
...we will be serving white cake.

1500
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:23,433
Well done, Calvin.

1501
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:26,728
Excuse me.

1502
02:05:26,894 --> 02:05:28,396
Excuse me, ma'am.

1503
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,816
Could you please
stop playing Beethoven?

1504
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:34,360
Take your hands off the harp.

1505
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:38,865
Doctor.

1506
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:41,909
-Doctor, you can't go in there.
-Stephen, Stephen.

1507
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:44,829
-He ain't got no business going in there.
-Let it be.

1508
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:48,499
He's just a little upset, that's all.
I'll handle this.

1509
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:15,234
White cake?

1510
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:18,821
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1511
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:31,626
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1512
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:36,756
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1513
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:39,008
D'Artagnan.

1514
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:43,054
And I was wondering what Dumas
would make of all this.

1515
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:44,806
Come again?

1516
02:06:48,059 --> 02:06:52,105
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

1517
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:53,815
Yes, of course, doctor.

1518
02:06:53,981 --> 02:06:55,733
I figured you must be an admirer.

1519
02:06:55,900 --> 02:07:00,196
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1520
02:07:00,404 --> 02:07:03,783
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today...

1521
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:06,119
...I wonder what he would have
made of it.

1522
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:09,997
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1523
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:17,380
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1524
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:21,884
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1525
02:07:23,386 --> 02:07:25,763
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1526
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:32,270
-Are these Broomhilda's papers?
-Yes, they are.

1527
02:07:32,436 --> 02:07:34,105
-May I?
-Of course.

1528
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:35,731
Thank you.

1529
02:07:37,817 --> 02:07:40,528
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history...

1530
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,072
...and of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1531
02:07:43,239 --> 02:07:45,366
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1532
02:07:46,617 --> 02:07:49,954
-Right over there on that little table.
-Thank you.

1533
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:12,101
Thank you.

1534
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,399
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1535
02:08:20,109 --> 02:08:22,820
...consider yourself a free woman.

1536
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:36,751
Mr. Candie...

1537
02:08:38,294 --> 02:08:42,173
...normally, I would say
auf Wiedersehen.

1538
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:46,969
But since what auf Wiedersehen
actually means is "till I see you again"...

1539
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:51,015
...and since I never wish
to see you again, to you, sir...

1540
02:08:51,182 --> 02:08:54,518
...I say, "goodbye."

1541
02:08:58,022 --> 02:08:59,482
Let's go.

1542
02:09:00,608 --> 02:09:02,026
Come on.

1543
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:05,696
One more moment, doctor.

1544
02:09:07,573 --> 02:09:08,616
What?

1545
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:15,873
It's a custom here in the South...

1546
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:21,837
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1547
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:25,424
-It implies good faith.
-I'm not from the South.

1548
02:09:25,591 --> 02:09:27,301
But you are...

1549
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:30,012
...in my house, doctor.

1550
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,473
So I'm afraid I must insist.

1551
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,683
Insist?

1552
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:35,977
On what? That I shake your hand?

1553
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:39,313
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist
in the opposite direction.

1554
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:44,902
-You know what I think you are?
-What you think I am? No, I don't.

1555
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:48,364
I think you are a bad loser.

1556
02:09:48,864 --> 02:09:51,951
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1557
02:09:52,118 --> 02:09:53,327
Nevertheless...

1558
02:09:53,953 --> 02:09:57,123
...here in Chickasaw County,
a deal ain't done...

1559
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:59,667
...until the two parties
have shook hands.

1560
02:10:00,376 --> 02:10:04,046
Even after all that paper signing,
don't mean shit...

1561
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:07,967
...you don't shake my hand.

1562
02:10:08,718 --> 02:10:14,598
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1563
02:10:14,765 --> 02:10:16,434
I don't think so.

1564
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,602
Mr. Pooch?

1565
02:10:20,604 --> 02:10:25,234
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand...

1566
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:27,069
...you cut her ass down.

1567
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:52,386
You really want me
to shake your hand?

1568
02:10:54,013 --> 02:10:55,681
I insist.

1569
02:10:56,891 --> 02:10:59,268
If you insist.

1570
02:11:16,077 --> 02:11:18,996
No! Calvin!

1571
02:11:20,206 --> 02:11:21,791
Calvin!

1572
02:11:28,005 --> 02:11:30,549
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1573
02:11:42,937 --> 02:11:45,064
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1574
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,775
Help, he's killing everyone!

1575
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:05,793
-Holy--!
-Shit!

1576
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,002
-Son of a--!
-Bitch!

1577
02:12:11,632 --> 02:12:12,967
-Damn it!
-Fucking--!

1578
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:14,427
Get the fuck--!

1579
02:12:17,471 --> 02:12:19,473
Damn it, son of a bitch! What--?

1580
02:12:20,266 --> 02:12:21,559
Fucking nigger!

1581
02:12:21,725 --> 02:12:22,893
Damn it!

1582
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:26,063
What the fuck is going on?

1583
02:12:26,689 --> 02:12:28,190
You shot me!

1584
02:12:28,357 --> 02:12:29,859
You stupid son of a--!

1585
02:12:30,025 --> 02:12:31,444
Sorry, Jessie!

1586
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:35,698
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1587
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:06,812
Aim low!

1588
02:13:09,773 --> 02:13:11,233
Nigger! Gonna kill!

1589
02:13:12,526 --> 02:13:14,195
God! Oh, my God!

1590
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:17,031
Motherfucker!

1591
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:26,540
Shit!

1592
02:14:23,264 --> 02:14:24,390
Shit.

1593
02:14:36,569 --> 02:14:38,028
Hold your fire!

1594
02:14:41,407 --> 02:14:43,242
Hold your fire!

1595
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:46,579
Stop shooting, goddamn it!

1596
02:14:55,296 --> 02:14:56,839
Django!

1597
02:14:57,172 --> 02:14:58,215
What?

1598
02:15:01,302 --> 02:15:03,137
We got your woman.

1599
02:15:04,388 --> 02:15:07,725
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1600
02:15:07,891 --> 02:15:12,980
You don't stop all that carrying on,
he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

1601
02:15:13,147 --> 02:15:15,190
Now, that ain't no threat, horse boy.

1602
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:17,026
That there is a promise.

1603
02:15:18,485 --> 02:15:19,903
Or...

1604
02:15:20,070 --> 02:15:22,990
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1605
02:15:23,991 --> 02:15:25,326
...we won't kill Hildi.

1606
02:15:25,492 --> 02:15:26,869
Horseshit!

1607
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:30,456
Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1608
02:15:31,206 --> 02:15:32,875
You give up...

1609
02:15:33,167 --> 02:15:36,295
...ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1610
02:15:37,338 --> 02:15:39,590
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1611
02:15:39,757 --> 02:15:42,760
I don't give a goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1612
02:15:42,926 --> 02:15:45,888
I believe if you don't give up
in the next 10 seconds...

1613
02:15:46,055 --> 02:15:49,892
...we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1614
02:15:52,269 --> 02:15:53,687
Don't do it.

1615
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:55,773
You give me up.

1616
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:58,025
-Six!
-Just let me go.

1617
02:15:58,192 --> 02:15:59,610
-Seven!
-They got too much.

1618
02:15:59,777 --> 02:16:01,320
-Django.
-Eight!

1619
02:16:01,487 --> 02:16:02,529
I love you.

1620
02:16:02,905 --> 02:16:03,947
Nine!

1621
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:05,157
Hold it!

1622
02:16:05,324 --> 02:16:06,367
No.

1623
02:16:08,243 --> 02:16:09,370
I give up.

1624
02:16:10,537 --> 02:16:13,290
I can't hear you, nigger.

1625
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:16,001
I said I give up.

1626
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:42,903
No.

1627
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:44,571
No.

1628
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:18,332
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1629
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:25,881
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1630
02:18:26,465 --> 02:18:29,593
I knew there was something fishy
about y'all.

1631
02:18:30,177 --> 02:18:32,721
We found your wanted posters...

1632
02:18:32,888 --> 02:18:35,724
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1633
02:18:36,683 --> 02:18:38,685
I got to say...

1634
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:42,439
...I ain't never heard of no
black bounty hunter before.

1635
02:18:42,606 --> 02:18:46,443
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1636
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:49,404
Probably pretty good
while it lasted, huh?

1637
02:18:58,789 --> 02:19:02,209
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie. On three.

1638
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,044
One.

1639
02:19:04,878 --> 02:19:06,505
I got you. Two.

1640
02:19:07,965 --> 02:19:09,883
Calm down. Now here it comes.

1641
02:19:10,968 --> 02:19:12,386
Captain?

1642
02:19:12,636 --> 02:19:14,429
Miss Lara want to see you.

1643
02:19:15,138 --> 02:19:19,101
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1644
02:19:19,476 --> 02:19:23,230
Oh, and she changed her mind
about snipping Django.

1645
02:19:24,064 --> 02:19:26,900
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1646
02:19:28,652 --> 02:19:30,863
Well, she didn't waste a minute
telling me.

1647
02:19:37,953 --> 02:19:40,289
How disappointing.

1648
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:04,563
You leaving.

1649
02:20:05,898 --> 02:20:09,484
This here what you take with you.

1650
02:20:12,279 --> 02:20:15,824
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at the Big House...

1651
02:20:15,991 --> 02:20:19,286
...could talk about
for the last few hours.

1652
02:20:19,453 --> 02:20:22,956
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life...

1653
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:26,126
...was coming up with all kinds
of ways to kill your ass.

1654
02:20:26,293 --> 02:20:31,506
Now, mind you, most of them ideas
had to do with fucking with your fun parts.

1655
02:20:31,673 --> 02:20:35,385
Now, that may seem like a good idea...

1656
02:20:35,552 --> 02:20:37,638
...but truth is...

1657
02:20:38,722 --> 02:20:41,224
...when you snip a nigger's nuts...

1658
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:45,520
...most of them bleed out in,
oh, about seven minutes.

1659
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:47,356
Most of them.

1660
02:20:49,066 --> 02:20:51,026
More than most.

1661
02:20:51,193 --> 02:20:52,945
Then I says:

1662
02:20:54,446 --> 02:20:56,657
"Shitfire.

1663
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:01,787
The niggers we sells to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1664
02:21:02,245 --> 02:21:04,957
And they still saying,
"Let's whip him to death."

1665
02:21:05,123 --> 02:21:08,585
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1666
02:21:08,752 --> 02:21:12,047
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1667
02:21:12,214 --> 02:21:14,132
We do that shit all the time.

1668
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:15,342
Hell's bells...

1669
02:21:15,509 --> 02:21:20,430
...the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1670
02:21:21,348 --> 02:21:24,184
Lo and behold...

1671
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:28,939
...out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea...

1672
02:21:29,147 --> 02:21:32,859
...of giving your ass to
the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1673
02:21:35,237 --> 02:21:39,866
And as a slave of
the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company...

1674
02:21:40,325 --> 02:21:43,870
...henceforth, till the day you die...

1675
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:47,124
...all day, every day...

1676
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:50,168
...you will be swinging
a sledgehammer...

1677
02:21:50,335 --> 02:21:54,840
...turning big rocks into little rocks.

1678
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:56,925
Now, when you get there...

1679
02:21:57,092 --> 02:21:59,678
...they gonna take away your name...

1680
02:21:59,845 --> 02:22:02,973
...give you a number
and a sledgehammer...

1681
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:05,350
...and say, "Get to work."

1682
02:22:05,517 --> 02:22:08,061
And one word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1683
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,689
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1684
02:22:10,856 --> 02:22:14,276
Oh, they does that real good.

1685
02:22:14,443 --> 02:22:16,028
They gonna work you...

1686
02:22:16,194 --> 02:22:21,199
...all day, every day,
till your back give out.

1687
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:24,244
Then they're gonna hit you in the head
with a hammer...

1688
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:26,496
...throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1689
02:22:26,663 --> 02:22:32,544
And that will be the story
of you, Django.

1690
02:23:10,749 --> 02:23:12,834
And what's the golden rule,
Frankie, eh?

1691
02:23:13,627 --> 02:23:16,129
You don't root abos.

1692
02:23:20,801 --> 02:23:22,302
Hey, white boy.

1693
02:23:23,762 --> 02:23:25,722
I said, hey, white boy.

1694
02:23:26,139 --> 02:23:29,226
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

1695
02:23:29,392 --> 02:23:31,645
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1696
02:23:31,812 --> 02:23:32,896
Do what, now?

1697
02:23:33,063 --> 02:23:36,608
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?

1698
02:23:36,942 --> 02:23:41,113
-Eleven thousand, 500, actually.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

1699
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:45,992
Back there at that plantation, Candyland,
there was an $11,500 fortune.

1700
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:48,829
Just sitting there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1701
02:23:49,412 --> 02:23:51,581
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1702
02:23:51,748 --> 02:23:56,002
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1703
02:23:56,169 --> 02:23:59,297
You can't steal it.
You got to earn it, white boy.

1704
02:24:00,298 --> 02:24:02,509
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1705
02:24:02,676 --> 02:24:05,595
The $11,500 fortune waiting for you
back at Candyland...

1706
02:24:05,762 --> 02:24:08,598
...is in the form of
a "wanted dead or alive" bounty...

1707
02:24:08,765 --> 02:24:12,602
-...on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
-Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1708
02:24:12,769 --> 02:24:17,399
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this gang
of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang.

1709
02:24:17,566 --> 02:24:20,777
There's a $7000 "wanted dead or alive"
bounty on him...

1710
02:24:20,944 --> 02:24:23,530
...$1500 for each of his three
accomplices:

1711
02:24:24,406 --> 02:24:25,907
Dandy Michaels...

1712
02:24:26,283 --> 02:24:30,370
...Gerald Nash and Crazy Craig Koons.

1713
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:32,080
All four of them gentlemen...

1714
02:24:32,247 --> 02:24:35,876
...they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off. You know why?

1715
02:24:36,042 --> 02:24:39,880
Because they just got away with murder.
But it ain't got to be that way.

1716
02:24:40,046 --> 02:24:43,508
You and your mates, y'all can
ride back there and get that money.

1717
02:24:43,675 --> 02:24:48,221
-What'd these jokers do again?
-Sons of bitches killed innocent people.

1718
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:51,600
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1719
02:24:52,726 --> 02:24:56,104
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1720
02:24:56,271 --> 02:24:57,606
Get it out.

1721
02:24:59,065 --> 02:25:01,985
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall...

1722
02:25:02,152 --> 02:25:04,905
-...and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
-But you're a slave.

1723
02:25:05,071 --> 02:25:08,283
-Murder and stagecoach robbery."
-I ain't no goddamn slave.

1724
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:10,118
Do I sound like a fucking slave?

1725
02:25:10,285 --> 02:25:12,746
-"$7000 for Smitty Bacall."
-That's a shitload.

1726
02:25:12,913 --> 02:25:14,581
I'm a bounty hunter.

1727
02:25:15,749 --> 02:25:18,460
Yesterday, as a free man...

1728
02:25:18,627 --> 02:25:23,256
...I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner...

1729
02:25:23,423 --> 02:25:24,966
...Dr. King Schultz.

1730
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:29,930
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1731
02:25:30,096 --> 02:25:32,891
We finally found their ass
laying low in Candyland.

1732
02:25:33,058 --> 02:25:36,478
We went in there to get them,
things went sour...

1733
02:25:36,645 --> 02:25:40,023
...my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot...

1734
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:42,817
...then everybody there
decided to blame me...

1735
02:25:42,984 --> 02:25:44,611
...so here I am.

1736
02:25:46,279 --> 02:25:48,406
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1737
02:25:48,573 --> 02:25:51,409
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1738
02:25:51,576 --> 02:25:54,829
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted...

1739
02:25:54,996 --> 02:25:56,831
...and that 11,500 is up for grabs.

1740
02:25:56,998 --> 02:26:00,877
The last thing they'd expect
is y'all riding back in there and getting it.

1741
02:26:01,044 --> 02:26:02,671
Well, what's the deal?

1742
02:26:02,837 --> 02:26:06,341
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1743
02:26:06,508 --> 02:26:09,219
No, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1744
02:26:09,427 --> 02:26:12,806
But you give me a pistol,
one of them horses...

1745
02:26:12,973 --> 02:26:17,644
...and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point them out to you.

1746
02:26:17,811 --> 02:26:19,145
<i>This is a real handbill.</i>

1747
02:26:19,312 --> 02:26:23,483
Just because it's a real handbill doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarkey is.

1748
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:25,443
Now, why would a slave...

1749
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:29,322
...have a "wanted dead or alive"
handbill in his pocket?

1750
02:26:33,827 --> 02:26:36,705
Did that black ride into Candyland
yesterday?

1751
02:26:43,044 --> 02:26:47,340
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1752
02:26:48,216 --> 02:26:51,344
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1753
02:26:51,553 --> 02:26:53,263
Is he a Candyland slave...

1754
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:57,267
...or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1755
02:26:57,434 --> 02:26:59,102
Yeah.

1756
02:26:59,436 --> 02:27:01,771
They walked us
from the Greenville auction...

1757
02:27:01,938 --> 02:27:04,524
...and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1758
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:08,820
Now, this white man,
was the black his slave?

1759
02:27:08,987 --> 02:27:10,530
He weren't no slave.

1760
02:27:10,697 --> 02:27:12,741
You fucking sure about that?

1761
02:27:12,907 --> 02:27:14,409
Damn sure.

1762
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:20,290
What happened over in Candyland?

1763
02:27:20,457 --> 02:27:23,835
Bunch of shooting. Master got shot.

1764
02:27:24,002 --> 02:27:26,046
-Who shot him?
-The German.

1765
02:27:26,212 --> 02:27:27,464
Why'd he do that?

1766
02:27:27,922 --> 02:27:31,718
Nigger and the German was acting
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1767
02:27:31,885 --> 02:27:34,721
-Well, what were they?
-Bounty hunters.

1768
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,184
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1769
02:27:40,143 --> 02:27:43,396
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1770
02:27:44,981 --> 02:27:46,775
I got one more condition.

1771
02:27:46,941 --> 02:27:47,984
What's that?

1772
02:27:48,151 --> 02:27:51,196
When we get there, when time come...

1773
02:27:53,156 --> 02:27:55,867
-...you let me help you kill them.
-Hey.

1774
02:27:56,242 --> 02:27:57,827
You're a funny bugger.

1775
02:27:57,994 --> 02:28:00,580
-Cut him loose.
-Yeah, yeah.

1776
02:28:00,789 --> 02:28:02,707
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1777
02:28:02,874 --> 02:28:04,626
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1778
02:28:04,793 --> 02:28:06,044
Hey.

1779
02:28:06,586 --> 02:28:09,672
You're all right for a black fella.
Oh, yeah.

1780
02:28:14,761 --> 02:28:16,513
There we go. There you go, mate.

1781
02:28:16,679 --> 02:28:18,014
Yeah.

1782
02:28:18,181 --> 02:28:20,809
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1783
02:28:20,975 --> 02:28:23,853
-What them saddlebags got in them?
-Dynamite.

1784
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:27,190
I ain't riding no horse
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1785
02:28:27,357 --> 02:28:29,067
I can understand that.

1786
02:28:29,234 --> 02:28:32,237
Frankie, why don't you take
them sticks off that horse...

1787
02:28:32,404 --> 02:28:35,073
...and stick them in the nigger cage?

1788
02:28:35,698 --> 02:28:38,868
A little dynamite for you black fellas
to play with.

1789
02:28:49,462 --> 02:28:52,215
Floyd, you got that rifle
up on the wagon, don't you?

1790
02:28:52,382 --> 02:28:53,425
Yeah, right.

1791
02:28:53,591 --> 02:28:56,052
Why don't you give him your gun
and gun belt?

1792
02:28:56,219 --> 02:28:57,554
Righto.

1793
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,723
Now, don't drop the fucking thing,
all right?

1794
02:29:00,890 --> 02:29:03,601
I just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1795
02:29:03,768 --> 02:29:05,728
Oh, that's good to know.

1796
02:30:37,654 --> 02:30:39,239
Throw me up that dynamite.

1797
02:32:09,787 --> 02:32:11,372
-Jake.
-Yeah?

1798
02:32:11,539 --> 02:32:14,834
Get out there and see what's wrong
with them goddamn dogs.

1799
02:32:16,878 --> 02:32:18,004
Get them.

1800
02:32:19,547 --> 02:32:21,549
D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

1801
02:34:53,075 --> 02:34:54,702
It's me, baby.

1802
02:35:42,750 --> 02:35:49,173
<i>In the sweet by-and-by</i>

1803
02:35:51,467 --> 02:35:54,095
<i>We will meet</i>

1804
02:35:54,262 --> 02:35:58,599
<i>On that beautiful shore</i>

1805
02:36:02,603 --> 02:36:06,983
<i>By-and-by</i>
<i>By-and-by</i>

1806
02:36:07,149 --> 02:36:11,320
<i>By-and-by we will meet</i>

1807
02:36:11,487 --> 02:36:13,447
<i>We will meet by-and-by</i>

1808
02:36:13,614 --> 02:36:16,534
Cora, would you prepare us
some coffee?

1809
02:36:16,909 --> 02:36:18,870
Sheba, you help her.

1810
02:36:19,036 --> 02:36:20,288
Come on.

1811
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:25,668
<i>In the sweet--</i>

1812
02:36:25,877 --> 02:36:28,045
<i>By-and-by</i>

1813
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:34,218
Y'all gonna be together with Calvin
in the by-and-by.

1814
02:36:40,558 --> 02:36:43,436
Just a bit sooner
than y'all was expecting.

1815
02:36:51,402 --> 02:36:54,447
Billy Crash. Now, where were we?

1816
02:36:54,989 --> 02:36:57,158
Oh, that's right.

1817
02:36:57,491 --> 02:37:01,954
Last time I seen you,
you had your hands on my--

1818
02:37:11,881 --> 02:37:13,507
Sweet Jesus.

1819
02:37:14,467 --> 02:37:18,012
Django! You black son of a bitch!

1820
02:37:18,179 --> 02:37:19,597
The D is silent, hillbilly.

1821
02:37:20,765 --> 02:37:21,974
Oh, no!

1822
02:37:24,018 --> 02:37:26,646
Now, all you black folks...

1823
02:37:26,812 --> 02:37:30,274
...I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

1824
02:37:31,233 --> 02:37:32,944
Not you, Stephen.

1825
02:37:33,736 --> 02:37:35,863
You right where you belong.

1826
02:37:38,032 --> 02:37:42,203
Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

1827
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:43,412
Do what now?

1828
02:37:44,038 --> 02:37:47,708
I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."

1829
02:37:49,001 --> 02:37:50,711
Bye, Miss Lara.

1830
02:37:54,966 --> 02:37:56,217
Y'all two run along now.

1831
02:38:14,986 --> 02:38:19,323
Stephen, how you like my new duds?

1832
02:38:20,032 --> 02:38:23,494
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

1833
02:38:34,296 --> 02:38:36,549
I count six shots, nigger.

1834
02:38:37,758 --> 02:38:39,593
I count two guns, nigger.

1835
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:45,349
You said in 76 years
on this plantation...

1836
02:38:45,516 --> 02:38:48,185
...you seen all manner of shit
done to niggers.

1837
02:38:48,394 --> 02:38:51,355
But I notice, you didn't mention
kneecapping.

1838
02:38:51,856 --> 02:38:55,151
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

1839
02:38:55,317 --> 02:38:56,986
Seventy-six years, Stephen.

1840
02:38:57,153 --> 02:39:00,781
How many niggers you think you see
come and go? Seven thousand?

1841
02:39:00,990 --> 02:39:02,491
Eight thousand?

1842
02:39:02,908 --> 02:39:04,410
Nine thousand?

1843
02:39:04,577 --> 02:39:07,288
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

1844
02:39:07,455 --> 02:39:11,417
Every single word that came out of
Calvin Candie's mouth was horseshit.

1845
02:39:11,584 --> 02:39:15,504
But he was right about one thing:
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

1846
02:39:18,132 --> 02:39:20,092
You son of a bitch!

1847
02:39:21,177 --> 02:39:22,970
You motherfucker!

1848
02:39:23,137 --> 02:39:25,389
Oh, sweet Jesus, let me kill this nigger.

1849
02:39:26,974 --> 02:39:29,810
You ain't gonna get away
with this, Django.

1850
02:39:29,977 --> 02:39:32,021
They gonna catch your black ass.

1851
02:39:32,188 --> 02:39:34,690
You gonna be on the wanted posters
now, nigger.

1852
02:39:34,857 --> 02:39:37,651
The bounty hunters
gonna be looking for you.

1853
02:39:38,069 --> 02:39:41,864
You can run, nigger,
but they gonna find your ass!

1854
02:39:42,031 --> 02:39:46,035
And when they do, oh, Lord,
what they gonna do to your ass.

1855
02:39:46,368 --> 02:39:50,915
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger.
You done fucked up!

1856
02:39:51,082 --> 02:39:55,920
This Candyland, nigger.
You can't destroy Candyland!

1857
02:39:56,087 --> 02:39:59,799
We been here!
There's always gonna be a Candyland.

1858
02:40:10,893 --> 02:40:14,438
Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!

1859
02:40:14,605 --> 02:40:17,358
They gonna find your black ass!

1860
02:40:21,862 --> 02:40:24,281
Django!
