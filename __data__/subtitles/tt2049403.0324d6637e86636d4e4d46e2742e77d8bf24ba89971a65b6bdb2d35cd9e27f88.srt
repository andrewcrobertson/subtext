The living.

7
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,053
The dead.

8
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,155
Can they coexist?

9
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,291
That's what
we're here to find out.

10
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:31,028
My name is Lydia Deetz,
and welcome to <i>Ghost House.</i>

11
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,631
Joining us in the attic tonight

12
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:40,303
are Emmet and Jody Welch,
from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.

13
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,705
Along with their dog, Taco.

14
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:44,974
And we're gonna hear about how

15
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:49,078
their dream home
became a ghost house.

16
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:54,117
I've been a psychic mediator
for over 15 years.

17
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,885
But nothing
could have prepared me

18
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,786
for what I encountered
when I visited

19
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,921
the Welch farm.

20
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,324
Here's a preview.

21
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,725
Be warned,

22
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:04,793
it's intense.

23
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:10,232
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna</i>
<i>find behind this door,</i>

24
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:13,701
<i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>

25
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,388
I feel a dark presence.

26
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,357
We need to leave! Now!

27
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,695
Emmet, are you ready to hear
about your paranormal visitors?

28
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:43,763
Bring it on.

29
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,266
How about you, Jody?

30
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,967
Haven't slept a wink

31
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,403
since we moved
into that darned house.

32
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:52,872
Taco was so freaked out,
he goes to the bathroom

33
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,276
in his doggy bed every night.

34
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:57,378
It's been a living nightmare.

35
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:01,882
Confronting the unknown.
Conquering your fears.

36
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,850
There's nothing harder.

37
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:05,152
But don't worry.

38
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,753
I'll be right by your...

39
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,057
What the...

40
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,125
No.

41
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,261
No, no.

42
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,296
What's going on?

43
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,965
-I don't know.
-Go!

44
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:20,934
No. No.

45
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,902
-Uh...
-You're doing great.

46
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,038
I'm...

47
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,473
Need a break?

48
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,442
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's take a break.

49
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,445
Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!

50
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,047
Bravo.

51
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:37,083
I need five. Make it happen.

52
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,018
Okay, everybody, that's lunch!

53
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:52,965
I told him
he needed to wear contacts.

54
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:56,034
But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician
wouldn't listen.

55
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,835
Oh, can you
give it a rest, Nadia?

56
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,471
I'm having a really shitty day.

57
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,074
Hmm?

58
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,843
What happened out there?

59
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,846
You okay?

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,414
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,483
It's these double taping days,

62
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:14,919
-it can get to me.
-Oh, God.

63
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:17,255
Kills me to see you
feeling like this.

64
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,522
Because when
you're feeling like this,

65
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:19,957
it just makes me
feel what you're feeling.

66
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:21,292
So in a weird way it's like,

67
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,127
when you're hurting,
it's hurting me.

68
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,396
-I don't know.
-God, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:27,298
I... I don't mean to make you
feel like that.

70
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:29,533
Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.

71
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,402
If anything, it just shows
how connected we are.

72
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:36,007
It's like we got the same
stupid little heart.

73
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,850
No. You don't need these.

74
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:48,885
Oh.

75
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,854
I have one job, and that is

76
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,890
to make sure that you do not
drown your talents

77
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,392
at the bottom
of a bottle of pills, Lydia.

78
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,094
Please...

79
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,828
just to get through today.

80
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,535
Okay. But...

81
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,270
this is the last time

82
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,039
that I ever dig pills
out of a trash can for you.

83
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,274
Do you understand?
Or a toilet or sink.

84
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:13,909
Here.

85
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,514
Okay? You got this.

86
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:19,548
-All right?
-Yeah.

87
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,455
-Is that mine?
-Don't move.

88
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,424
Who's texting me?

89
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,092
Your stupid stepmother.

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,494
She's got texting diarrhea.

91
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,863
I have to go.

92
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,433
Lydia...

93
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,234
we still have
a segment to finish.

94
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,946
<i>Tell us about</i>

95
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,915
<i>the inspiration</i>
<i>for The Human Canvas.</i>

96
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:55,116
<i>I am my own canvas.</i>

97
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,552
<i>I am my art.</i>

98
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,922
<i>As we know,</i>
<i>art imitates the living.</i>

99
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,423
<i>It feeds me.</i>

100
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:05,026
<i>And I was not getting</i>
<i>enough nourishment</i>

101
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,994
<i>from the sculpture alone.</i>

102
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,664
<i>So, I decided</i>
<i>to broaden my tastes</i>

103
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,999
<i>and it turns out</i>
<i>I am insatiably...</i>

104
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,134
Delia!

105
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,569
Where have you been?

106
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,403
I think I've cried all
the water out of my body.

107
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,105
What happened to Dad?

108
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:20,474
I'm <i>desolee,</i> Le Tigre!

109
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:22,976
He is the Picasso
of graffiti artists.

110
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,278
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Métro.

111
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:27,247
But now he's having
a <i>petite</i> tantrum

112
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,982
because I had to cancel
the performance.

113
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,283
What happened?

114
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,419
What? Oh.

115
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,256
Your father's left me.

116
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,624
He's divorcing you?

117
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:40,127
What a horrible thought.

118
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,261
No! He's dead!

119
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:43,997
What?

120
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,399
Daddy's passed away.

121
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,201
How?

122
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,071
He was returning

123
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:53,539
from his bird-watching
expedition

124
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:55,074
to the Funafuti Atoll...

125
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:58,511
<i>...when his plane</i>
<i>went down</i>

126
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,079
<i>in the South Pacific.</i>

127
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:06,218
A plane crash?

128
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,690
<i>That was</i>
<i>his worst nightmare.</i>

129
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,261
Actually,
he survived the crash.

130
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,395
-He drowned?
-Almost.

131
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,998
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

132
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,166
Daddy clung onto a wing.

133
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,235
- Over here!
- Come on!

134
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,504
Hey, swim over!
Swim over!

135
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:27,539
Hey!

136
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,341
So, how did he die?

137
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,043
A shark jumped out of the water

138
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,044
<i>and got him!</i>

139
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:35,380
Just like that.

140
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,050
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

141
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,318
He was so excited,

142
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,454
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

143
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,722
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

144
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,491
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

145
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:48,492
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

146
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,160
to watch birds
do it on a beach.

147
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,195
And it killed him!

148
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:54,665
We need to tell Astrid.

149
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,534
Oh. Must we?

150
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,336
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

151
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,671
That's if I can even reach her.

152
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,040
We're barely on speaking terms.

153
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,341
Oh, it would kill Charles
to know

154
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,677
I had to cancel my show.

155
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,978
<i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>

156
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,380
What'd he say?

157
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:19,689
Did you see that?

158
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,415
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>

159
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,619
Where am I?

160
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:53,288
Down the hall,
second door on the right.

161
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,090
Take a number.

162
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:56,424
Someone will help you.

163
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,094
Eventually.

164
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,732

♪ <i>With no-one to love you</i>
<i>you're goin' nowhere♪</i>

180
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,553
Hey, toots!

181
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,755
You're not supposed
to be back here.

182
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,926
Don't make me tell you twice.

183
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,231
Where is Beetlejuice?

184
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:20,389
Ugh.

185
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,973
Ghost House!

186
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,307
When you're all
on your third kid

187
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,275
and second divorce,

188
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,543
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

189
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,419
Perfect.

190
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,592
Leave me alone.

191
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:13,007
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

192
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,641
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

193
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,742
I've never hosted anything

194
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,544
without Charles standing there.

195
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,479
Watching me. In awe.

196
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,082
<i>It's Astrid.</i>

197
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,716
<i>- Please don't leave a message.</i>
- She won't pick up.

198
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,785
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

199
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:27,021
Might be easier coming from

200
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,755
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

201
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:31,525
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

202
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,859
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

203
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,661
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

204
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:38,531
In fact,

205
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,000
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

206
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,468
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

207
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,436
You did? When?

208
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,106
Forty years ago.

209
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,642
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

210
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,111
I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

211
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:52,678
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

212
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,380
Enough!
I'll handle this.

213
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:57,817
Astrid!

214
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:00,954
Astrid!

215
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:02,989
Astrid!

216
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,392
Stop torturing your mother.

217
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,360
I know I usually find it funny,

218
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:10,829
and only fair
after the way she treated me

219
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,363
when she was your age.

220
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,765
But not today!

221
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,669
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

222
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:18,904
You've lost your grandpa.

223
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,840
And I've lost my...

224
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,374
horny handyman.

225
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,543
Charles.

226
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,846
Charles!

227
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh, Charles!

228
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,955
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

229
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,090
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

230
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,458
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

231
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:42,894
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

232
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,394
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

233
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:45,796
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

234
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,397
Grandpa loved that place.

235
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:48,933
Yes, and we are going
to honor him

236
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,969
with a Grief Collective.

237
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,871
A "Grief Collective"?

238
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:58,408
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

239
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,776
What does loss look like?

240
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,679
Is it just tears? A headstone?

241
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,048
Wilting gladioli?

242
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,550
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

243
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,420
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

244
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,521
I can't go.

245
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,091
I'm our school rep

246
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:15,825
for our Student Environmental
Conference next week.

247
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,526
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

248
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,897
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

249
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,199
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

250
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,134
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

251
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,969
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

252
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,472
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

253
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,607
when you're living high
off a tree hugger's salary.

254
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:37,545
What? No! No!

255
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:41,750
Jesus! Okay,
people already know

256
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,551
that Lydia Deetz is my mom.

257
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:46,588
Okay, can you stop being
a freak for, like, one second?

258
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,991
-Go back.
-Why?

259
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,659
All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

260
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,427
more time with ghosts
than your own daughter.

261
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,028
Jesus, Bob.

262
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,829
Can't you see
I'm concentrating here?

263
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:30,966
You know, Bob,

264
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,567
long distance relationships
can be difficult.

265
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,170
Especially when
one of you is dead

266
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:36,837
and the other's ignoring you
for 30 years.

267
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,173
But Lydia and I,

268
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,074
we have a definite
psychic connection.

269
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,708
<i>I just need</i>
<i>these people out of my house.</i>

270
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:44,610
Please hold! Afterlife
Call Center, please hold.

271
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,846
<i>How much</i>
<i>for a premium bio exorcism?</i>

272
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,182
And I'll tell ya something,

273
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,883
she definitely saw me
that last time.

274
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:52,752
I felt a little tingle.

275
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,021
<i>The money back</i>
<i>guarantee one.</i>

276
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:55,956
I'm putting your call
through now.

277
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,557
<i>I've just died,</i>
<i>and she's already remarried.</i>

278
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,193
Sell him the honeymoon package.

279
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:00,827
I'll kill the new husband,
and I'll possess the ex-wife.

280
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,296
I'll make her
do some unseemly things,

281
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,931
and then I'll post the pics.

282
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,232
<i>Can I pay</i>
<i>in installments?</i>

283
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:12,238
I'm needed upstairs.

284
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,673
Bob, hold down the fort.

285
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,018
<i>Ou je suis?</i>

286
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:26,252
- Where am I?
- Take a number,

287
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:27,519
take a seat.

288
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,932
I'm more of a dog person.

289
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:42,267
You! Room 515. Now.

290
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,341
-Come on.
-Come on.

291
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:50,808
Hey,
easy with the suit.

292
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:51,842
Don't "Detective" me,

293
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,078
you walking disaster.

294
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,678
-We got reports.
-Another protestor.

295
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:55,981
<i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>

296
00:19:56,014 --> 00:20:00,185
Wolf Jackson,
Afterlife Crime Unit.

297
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,553
Let me take a wild stab.

298
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:04,022
Actor.

299
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:06,324
Not just any actor.

300
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,794
I've done it all.
For six movies and a reboot,

301
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,030
I became Frank Hardballer.

302
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:14,331
Doing my own stunts
was non-negotiable.

303
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,233
-You know why?
-Authenticity.

304
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:17,868
Correct.

305
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:20,204
A vice cop doesn't
get to a perp's door

306
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:23,773
and then call for some hambone
stunt man to break it down.

307
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,376
Neither did I.

308
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,078
You gotta keep it real.

309
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,778
Looks like you got a little
too real there, bud.

310
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,349
Who knew it was a live grenade?

311
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,385
Your name came up

312
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,987
on this case I'm investigating.

313
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,094
Recognize this puss?

314
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:47,030
Never seen that chick
before in my life.

315
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,131
Or afterlife.

316
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,004
Any idea

317
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,873
why my suspect wrote your name

318
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,774
in this schmo's goo?

319
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:02,644
Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,
but could be a super-fan.

320
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,247
You know,
guys like you and me...

321
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,349
...we drive the gals crazy.

322
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,318
She collected
all her body parts.

323
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,787
My hunch
is she's out for revenge.

324
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,125
And you seem to be <i>numero uno</i>
on her hit list.

325
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,358
Well, wouldn't be
the first woman

326
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,825
who wanted to kill me.

327
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,862
And kinda hard
to kill a dead guy.

328
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,096
This gal can.

329
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,931
She's a soul sucker.

330
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,665
Oh, yeah,
you could say that again.

331
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,803
My advice, lay low.

332
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:31,739
She gets her hands on you
and you're dead-dead.

333
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,675
And there's no coming back
from that, Mr. Juice.

334
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,810
Roger that.

Be comforted in the knowledge

347
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:35,001
that he's in
a far better place.

348
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,370
Angels are guiding him
towards everlasting light

349
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:40,073
and may his soul fly through
the heavenly gates,

350
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:42,008
like the birds
that he so adored

351
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,842
and soar over
the Fields of Elysium

352
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:45,345
to the glory that is thine.

353
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:47,347
What?

354
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,323
I haven't been to a funeral
since Dad's.

355
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,491
Death is hard.

356
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,195
Yeah, sometimes
I think life is harder.

357
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,397
I know.

358
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,436
Listen, if you wanna talk
to that therapist again...

359
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,470
There you go again.

360
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,039
You just sidestep

361
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,207
every possible
conversation about him.

362
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,176
Astrid...

363
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,811
I loved your father,

364
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,046
but our relationship was over

365
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,915
a long time
before the accident.

366
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:27,218
I still don't understand
why you can't see him.

367
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:33,057
-Why not?
-I wish I knew.

368
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,426
But this ability

369
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,295
didn't exactly
come with instructions.

370
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,865
It all started
when I was your age.

371
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:42,533
It's ironic, isn't it?

372
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,135
You can apparently
see any random ghost

373
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:45,536
for your shitty TV show,

374
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,871
but the one ghost
that actually matters to me

375
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:48,273
you can't see at all.

376
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,093
We are closed!

377
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,996
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Charles Deetz.

378
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,098
I'm feeling
a little lightheaded.

379
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:16,333
Where am I?

380
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,068
Damn newbies.

381
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:20,237
You wait! In waiting room!

382
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:23,239
All right.

383
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:25,341
Unbelievable.

384
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,885
Hey...

385
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:37,219
who's there?

386
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,342
-My ex-wife is back.
-Hmm?

387
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:37,478
Well, I know
what you're thinking...

388
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:41,048
"When was the Juice
ever tied down?

389
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,418
What kind of woman could ever
keep him satisfied?" Well...

390
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:32,422
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

391
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:01,417
Now she's back,

392
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:02,584
and she's pissed.

393
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:33,781
Hey.

394
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,052
Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

395
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:40,354
In here, too.

396
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:44,759
Listen, if you ever
need to process

397
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,694
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

398
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:53,167
Emotions processed. Thanks.

399
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,670
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

400
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:58,506
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

401
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,777
Death is so, like...

402
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:08,114
It's, like, tragic,
you know?

403
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:11,284
I mean, if you ever wanna,
you know, cry or just,

404
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,752
kind of rage against
some of these feelings

405
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:14,654
that you have going on
in there,

406
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,122
I want you to know

407
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,358
that I could be that...

408
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:21,394
kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

409
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:24,899
-I'm good.
-You know,

410
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,132
times like this
can bring a family

411
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,268
weirdly closer together.

412
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:29,703
On the way over here,

413
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,438
I wrote a poem
for your grandpa.

414
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,673
Oh, did you? How does it go?

415
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,543
It's, it's, it's...

416
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,278
it starts...

417
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,915
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

418
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,717
And then acceptance.

419
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,886
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

420
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,621
but it's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,489
Cut the crap, Rory.

422
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,524
All right? I'm not falling
for your New Age,

423
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,426
overly emotional,
trauma bonding,

424
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,761
yoga retreat bullshit.

425
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,529
I see you.

426
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,732
Because, like you,

427
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,735
my mom is a very broken person.

428
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,536
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

429
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,872
You just exploit her.

430
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,239
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

431
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,273
that's on her.

432
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,853
I'm so sorry
for your loss. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,454
I know, I know. Thank you.

434
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,591
Oh, if it isn't
little Jane Butterfield.

435
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,226
Littler Jane?

436
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,560
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

437
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,828
We hyphenated.

438
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:31,864
Is that Maxie Dean?

439
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:34,465
No.

440
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,733
No one's here yet.

441
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,837
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

442
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,440
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

443
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:46,710
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

444
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,779
It's a mourning shroud.

445
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:51,748
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

446
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:54,584
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

447
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,487
To a new life
with a new family.

448
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,890
I can't wait to show it.

449
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,590
Buyers are already lining up.

450
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:02,325
Thanks to you, Lydia,

451
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,528
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

452
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,997
Ghosts aren't real.

453
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,498
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

454
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,966
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

455
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,835
Okay, honey, in we go.

456
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,271
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

457
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:16,305
What?

458
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:17,707
We're gathered here today

459
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,377
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

460
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,545
Now, I only had the pleasure

461
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:24,246
of meeting Charles a few times.

462
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,515
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

463
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:29,285
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

464
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:32,521
Yeah, but he also...

465
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,590
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

466
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:37,793
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

467
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,628
Lydia,

468
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:40,795
now, I know
we had always agreed

469
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:41,830
to take
our relationship slowly.

470
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,465
But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:46,468
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

472
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:48,470
Will you marry me on Halloween?

473
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:49,704
- Good Lord!
- Uh...

474
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:52,474
That's... That's in two days!

475
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:53,742
Yes, I know.

476
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:54,709
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

477
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,311
The church is available.

478
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:57,645
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

479
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,447
salvation
and everlasting glory.

480
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,484
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

481
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,819
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

482
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,723
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

483
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,026
because as we stand here,

484
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,028
surrounded by death...

485
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,630
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

486
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:17,866
Because I want to spend

487
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:18,967
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

488
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:21,836
And you, Delia.

489
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,372
And you too.

490
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:26,875
And you. Again.

491
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,709
What do you say?

492
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:31,645
Rory, I... Come on,

493
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:33,781
I can't commit to this
right now.

494
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,886
Oh.

495
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:39,888
All right.

496
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,657
This is too much loss.

497
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,926
What do you mean?

498
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,527
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

499
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,996
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

500
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,630
which you know about.
And now the death of...

501
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,767
-us.
-No! No, I...

502
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,569
Come on, I didn't mean that.

503
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,105
Thought you wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

504
00:32:58,138 --> 00:32:59,372
right beside me.

505
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,074
No safety nets, right?

506
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:02,708
But I guess,

507
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:04,677
the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

508
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,380
And that cord just snapped.

509
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,348
Come on. Rory...

510
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:11,450
-I love you.
-And I love you.

511
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh.

512
00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:16,755
What are we waiting for?

513
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:20,392
Okay, I guess.

514
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:24,763
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,036
She said "yes"!

516
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:33,105
She said "yes"!

517
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,042

- Sorry!

532
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:03,960
Whoa.

533
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:07,964
Are you okay?

534
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:17,173
Are you okay?
What happened?

535
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:20,108
Yeah. I'll live.

536
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:22,743
Uh, what are you reading?

537
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:25,713
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

538
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:27,515
-One of those.
-"One of those"?

539
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:28,984
What does that mean?

540
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:31,019
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

541
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,554
-Did you really?
-Yeah.

542
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:35,157
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

543
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,158
Yes.

544
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:38,060
Yeah, I...

545
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:41,529
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

546
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:42,931
Where have you been
all my life?

547
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:49,804
So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

548
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:51,072
My whole life.

549
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,772
I've never seen you
around before.

550
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:54,574
Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

551
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:55,876
for my grandpa's funeral.

552
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,778
Until my mom's janky fiance

553
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:01,182
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

554
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:02,649
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

555
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,653
Wow. That's different.

556
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,955
Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

557
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:09,256
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

558
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,492
Is your dad
in the picture or...

559
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,761
No.

560
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,564
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

561
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:20,234
Defender of hopeless causes.

562
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:22,668
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

563
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:24,037
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

564
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:26,973
But my mom grew up here.

565
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,640
That old house on the hill.

566
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:30,944
Wait. The Ghost House?

567
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:33,545
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

568
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:35,281
Unfortunately.

569
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:36,983
She's a legend.

570
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:39,019
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

571
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:40,954
You don't?

572
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:44,224
-No.
-Mmm-hmm.

573
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,959
I only believe in things
that I can see.

574
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:47,793
You know, science. Facts.

575
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:51,730
Oh.

576
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:53,798
Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

577
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:56,168
Back to the insanity.

578
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,569
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

579
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,072
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

580
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:02,274
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

581
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:08,013
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

582
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:11,716
if you want a break
from the insanity.

583
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,251
Witness confirmed our suspect

584
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:49,353
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

585
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:50,620
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

586
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:51,956
Hit me.

587
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,024
After she turned the owner

588
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:55,093
into a human pancake,

589
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:56,960
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

590
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:59,728
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

591
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,064
has her twisted heart set

592
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:04,800
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

593
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:06,269
She won't stop killing,

594
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:09,206
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

595
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,644
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

596
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:19,950
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

597
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:21,885
Thank you, Janet.

598
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:24,254
You keep me real.

599
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:25,754
Should we take
this Beetlejuice

600
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:27,022
into protective custody?

601
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,290
See if you can find him.

602
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:29,892
He's probably laying low.

603
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,994
Scared out of his mind.

604
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,969
A little higher, boys.

605
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:41,904
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

606
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:50,712
Bob.

607
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,779
Like lookin' in a mirror.

608
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:55,351
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

609
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:57,086
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

610
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,355
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

611
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:03,258
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

612
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,105
Now's my chance.

613
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,817
What?

614
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,352
Why?

615
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,955
No! No! No!

616
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:36,456
Delia, what's wrong?

617
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,091
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

618
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,893
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

619
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,129
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

620
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,997
-Why?
-For the Collective.

621
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:46,033
We cannot sincerely celebrate

622
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:48,734
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

623
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,736
Not until we release the horror

624
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,105
that they inflicted upon us.

625
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,740
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

626
00:39:54,774 --> 00:39:57,311
He bought this house
without telling me.

627
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,348
Oh, my God!

628
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,183
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

629
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,885
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

630
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:07,786
It was Delia.

631
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,188
Oh, Delia.

632
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:10,423
I'm good.

633
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,525
Ignore her.

634
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:14,293
That was very
thoughtful of you.

635
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:16,462
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

636
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:19,798
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

637
00:40:19,832 --> 00:40:21,100
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

638
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,902
our grief and our trauma.

639
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,136
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

640
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,871
and we gotta
finish those shows.

641
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,139
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

642
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:28,841
to give us a hand.

643
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:32,010
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

644
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,777
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

645
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,414
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

646
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,917
How convenient.

647
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:49,919
Ew.

648
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,333
Oh.

649
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,168
God, I thought I lost those.

650
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,208
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

651
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:49,910
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

652
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,279
My water broke during
<i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

653
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:55,216
Dad's favorite movie.

654
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,283
Yeah.

655
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:57,318
Can I keep this?

656
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:00,121
Yeah.

657
00:43:00,154 --> 00:43:02,022
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

658
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,392
Did Grandpa make that?

659
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:07,294
No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

660
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:09,929
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

661
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,373
Oh, I found that on the floor.

662
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:23,576
-Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
-Don't ever say that name!

663
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,278
Not ever!

664
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,514
-Beetlejuice.
-No! Astrid, I'm serious.

665
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:30,116
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

666
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,484
-is gonna happen.
-Like what?

667
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:33,486
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

668
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,155
Do you understand me?

669
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:36,423
Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

670
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:53,539
Oh, my God, it's you!

671
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:55,974
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

672
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,210
It's breathing exercises.

673
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,945
Try seeing ghosts every day.

674
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,314
Astrid!

675
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:04,450
Let her be.

676
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:06,185
God, she hates me.

677
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,721
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

678
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:12,657
You blamed me
for your mother's.

679
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,392
She's not dead.

680
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,428
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

681
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:18,563
There's a difference.

682
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:20,164
You weren't very nice.

683
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:22,667
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

684
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,535
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

685
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:27,605
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

686
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:29,040
we have gotten closer.

687
00:44:29,073 --> 00:44:30,641
No, I started liking you
before that.

688
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,181
Again with
the creepy breathing!

689
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:39,016
It works!

690
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,118
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

691
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,486
Of course you did.

692
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,454
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

693
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:46,523
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

694
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:48,425
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

695
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,693
in a skiing accident,

696
00:44:49,726 --> 00:44:52,095
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

697
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:53,663
and we connected.

698
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,499
Yeah.

699
00:44:55,532 --> 00:44:57,701
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

700
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,603
Okay, but this isn't about him.

701
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:01,538
Astrid found this in the attic.

702
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:03,340
Ew. So?

703
00:45:03,773 --> 00:45:05,509
So?

704
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,744
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

705
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:09,312
Like he's lurking somewhere,

706
00:45:09,346 --> 00:45:10,780
just out of reach.

707
00:45:10,815 --> 00:45:12,215
But lately,

708
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:13,749
I'm seeing him again.

709
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:16,252
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

710
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:17,620
But now this?

711
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:19,688
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

712
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:22,691
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

713
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:24,326
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

714
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,362
who tormented me
all those years ago?

715
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:28,797
It's time to find her.

716
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:44,546
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,587
- Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,756
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

719
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,157
Okay. Have fun.

720
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,330
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

721
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:04,465
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

722
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:17,778
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

723
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:18,880
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

724
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:21,849
No, I troll old record stores.

725
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,784
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

726
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:31,358
<i>Handbook for</i>
<i>the Recently Deceased.</i>

727
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:33,627
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

728
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,296
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly.

729
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,899
Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

730
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:39,132
my mom would write.

731
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,735
What's the deal
with your parents?

732
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:44,371
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

733
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,139
in the kitchen stress-baking.

734
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:49,475
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

735
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:51,177
but then he had an accident,

736
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,180
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

737
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:56,515
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

738
00:46:58,451 --> 00:47:01,153
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

739
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:03,422
traveling, with a famous mom.

740
00:47:03,456 --> 00:47:05,358
Not really.

741
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,226
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

742
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:08,294
We used to have this big plan

743
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,629
where we were gonna visit

744
00:47:09,662 --> 00:47:11,330
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

745
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:14,567
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

746
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,636
yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

747
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,537
What happened?

748
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,741
A boat accident.

749
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:24,509
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

750
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,777
and they never found his body.

751
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,582
You really miss him.

752
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:34,319
Yeah.

753
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,654
You know,
I at least would have liked

754
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,422
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

755
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:38,757
But can't your mom,

756
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,458
I don't know, like,

757
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:42,828
contact him or...

758
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,229
She claims
she can't even see him.

759
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,231
-Why not?
-Because she's a fraud.

760
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:48,900
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

761
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,837
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

762
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:56,206
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

763
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,308
Because my dad,
he would go all out

764
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,978
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

765
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,779
Yeah, I think I was

766
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,214
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

767
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,885
-Wow. Yeah.
-Yeah. It was a choice.

768
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,385
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

769
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,653
so I don't know,

770
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,455
probably be
my least favorite now.

771
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,623
Well, what time's the wedding?

772
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,859
Midnight. The witching hour.

773
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,727
Future stepdad's lame idea.

774
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,264
Well, why don't you
come over...

775
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,332
earlier?

776
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,302
Uh, we could,

777
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:30,306
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

778
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,211
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

779
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:37,246
no pressure.

780
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,887
What is up
with these creepy birds?

781
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,255
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

782
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:48,291
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

783
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,027
you love in SoHo.

784
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,527
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

785
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,296
Should be here later today.

786
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:55,630
Ooh, great. Thanks.

787
00:48:57,399 --> 00:48:58,801
And a, uh,

788
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,269
little bird may have
chirped our big news

789
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:03,371
to a few news outlets.

790
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,674
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

791
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:07,442
Could be great press
for the show.

792
00:49:07,476 --> 00:49:10,046
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

793
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,582
but can we just keep it
small and private?

794
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:15,918
Yeah. Well, sure.

795
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,953
It's your big day.

796
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:18,855
Night. Whatever.

797
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,723
<i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>

798
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:24,492
<i>all through me. All through me!</i>

799
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:31,298
Lydia?

800
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,970
I want you out of my life!

801
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:36,004
Do you hear me?

802
00:49:36,737 --> 00:49:37,738
Lydia?

803
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,043
Who are you yelling at?

804
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:44,512
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

805
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:45,881
-Dr. Glickman?
-Mmm.

806
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:47,681
He said that I was holding
something back

807
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:50,085
and until I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

808
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:52,720
-Mmm.
-Okay, well, he was right.

809
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:54,989
And I'm going to tell you now.

810
00:49:55,022 --> 00:49:56,090
And, fair warning,

811
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:58,859
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

812
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:01,394
Are you okay with that?

813
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:02,796
Of course. I'd love to.

814
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,597
Let's break through
this barrier together.

815
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,399
Okay, just give me a sec.

816
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:11,704
When I was a teenager,

817
00:50:11,738 --> 00:50:15,042
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

818
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:16,776
and tried to force me
to marry him,

819
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:19,980
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

820
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:22,582
I believed he was gone forever,

821
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:24,852
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

822
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:27,586
And now, he is actually back.

823
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,024
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

824
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:35,661
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

825
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:37,063
Don't say his name!

826
00:50:37,096 --> 00:50:38,998
If you say his name
three times,

827
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:40,532
he will appear.

828
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:45,805
Okay. So this...

829
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,808
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

830
00:50:48,842 --> 00:50:50,442
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

831
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:51,845
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

832
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:54,948
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

833
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:58,884
I know this
is a big step for you.

834
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,685
But in the words
of Dr. Glickman,

835
00:51:00,718 --> 00:51:02,687
I'm gonna give you
the push you need.

836
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:06,490
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

837
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:16,034
What just happened?

838
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:17,568
We're in the model.

839
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:19,838
That's not possible.

840
00:51:23,774 --> 00:51:24,977
What the hell?

841
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,611
I told you not to say his name!

842
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,984
<i>Lydia Deetz,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

843
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:34,784
<i>Don't ever</i>
<i>say that name.</i>

844
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:37,554
<i>Not ever!</i>
<i>We need to leave, now.</i>

845
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:39,456
<i>Beetlejuice,</i>
<i>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>

846
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:43,460
-Is that...
-Beetlejuice!

847
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,599
First of all,
I want you two kids to know,

848
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:51,501
this is a safe space. Okay?

849
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:52,904
Feel free
to express yourselves.

850
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:54,906
Don't be afraid. I sense
there's an enabler here,

851
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:55,973
but we'll get to that.

852
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:57,208
Look, dig deep

853
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,508
and spill your guts.

854
00:51:58,541 --> 00:51:59,809
Okay? Who wants to go first?

855
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:01,443
Huh?

856
00:52:01,477 --> 00:52:02,778
All right, I will.

857
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:08,717
There you go. See?
I'm willing to do the work.

858
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,220
You two kids
need to get in touch

859
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,888
with your inner child.

860
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:13,555
Mine'll be along
in just a jiffy.

861
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:31,240
Everybody says
he's got my eyes.

862
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,109
Personally, I don't see it.

863
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:35,811
Scram, kid.

864
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,015
You're just my unpacked trauma.

865
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,649
You're just my unpacked trauma.

866
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,618
You're a figment
of my imagination.

867
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,887
Really?

868
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,221
Is this a figment
of your imagination?

869
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,129
Leg man.

870
00:52:54,163 --> 00:52:55,864
Just like his old man.

871
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:05,907
That was you stalking me.

872
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,175
Hey, if stalking means

873
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,910
trying to remarry
the love of my life,

874
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:11,245
well, I'm guilty as charged.
Come here!

875
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:12,947
Home, home, home!

876
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:31,966
<i>♪ Wherever you go</i>
<i>Whatever you do ♪</i>

877
00:53:31,1000 --> 00:53:37,603
<i>♪ I will be right here</i>
<i>Waiting for you ♪</i>

878
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:40,974
What happened?

879
00:53:41,008 --> 00:53:42,909
I just had the wildest dream.

880
00:53:44,277 --> 00:53:46,779
Yeah, I think
we should lay off the pills.

881
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:56,789
Snakes?

882
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:58,859
Actually, asps.

883
00:53:58,892 --> 00:54:00,293
Aren't they beautiful?

884
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:01,895
Wedding gift for Rory?

885
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,864
Too late.
They've been defanged.

886
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:06,966
Guaranteed harmless,
and they're for me.

887
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,035
In Ancient Egypt,

888
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,602
a queen would perform
a ceremony

889
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:12,604
at the tomb of her pharaoh
using snakes,

890
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:14,706
the symbol of undying love.

891
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:16,075
-Are you sure about that?
-Mmm-hmm.

892
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:17,609
We read that
they were a constant threat

893
00:54:17,642 --> 00:54:18,676
to Ra in the underworld

894
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:19,945
and represented total chaos.

895
00:54:19,979 --> 00:54:21,147
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

896
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,915
more art and less reading.

897
00:54:22,948 --> 00:54:24,783
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

898
00:54:24,817 --> 00:54:25,885
So go pack up your things,

899
00:54:25,918 --> 00:54:27,053
I'm driving you back to school.

900
00:54:27,086 --> 00:54:28,586
Wait, what happened?

901
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,755
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

902
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,892
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

903
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:34,926
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

904
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:36,194
except that model.

905
00:54:36,227 --> 00:54:38,595
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

906
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:39,964
Oh.

907
00:54:39,998 --> 00:54:42,033
You're calling off the wedding?

908
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,172
What did that
cheese ball do now?

909
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:48,639
It's not Rory.

910
00:54:48,672 --> 00:54:49,706
It's Beetlejuice.

911
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,842
He's here.

912
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,310
In the model. I saw him.

913
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:54,678
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

914
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:55,947
Wait,
we can't leave yet.

915
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:00,717
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

916
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:04,923
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

917
00:55:04,956 --> 00:55:06,356
You had time to get married.

918
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,059
She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

919
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:10,327
Whatever. I was biking

920
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,162
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

921
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:13,997
and we started talking,

922
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:15,065
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

923
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:18,869
Can I go, Mom?

924
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,270
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,305
Please?

926
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:27,111
I will not allow
that menace to humanity

927
00:55:27,144 --> 00:55:29,146
to upheave our family again.

928
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:32,416
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

929
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:34,318
We're gonna be fine, right?

930
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:36,920
Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

931
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:51,400
Trick or treat!

932
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:57,240
Are you sure
this is the right address?

933
00:55:57,273 --> 00:55:58,975
Yeah.

934
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:00,843
125 Jefferson Lane.

935
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:02,711
Don't judge... all right?

936
00:56:02,744 --> 00:56:04,180
His dad just got
into an accident at work,

937
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:05,714
and they're going through
a rough patch.

938
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:06,983
Trick or treat!

939
00:56:07,016 --> 00:56:08,017
He's cute.

940
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:10,718
What are you doing?

941
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,053
I was gonna go
say "hey" to his parents.

942
00:56:12,087 --> 00:56:14,022
Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

943
00:56:14,055 --> 00:56:15,090
I mean,
we're not six years old.

944
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:16,158
Nothing's gonna happen.

945
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:18,326
All right, okay. You're right.

946
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,429
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

947
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,898
Not a second later.

948
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:27,936
Come on, quick!

949
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:31,640
Trick or treat!

950
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:52,359
I, uh,
raided the basement.

951
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:54,795
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

952
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,996
Yeah, you really went all out.

953
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,865
Yeah.

954
00:56:57,898 --> 00:56:59,867
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

955
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,968
Thank you. But yeah,

956
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,503
my parents think
I look more like

957
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:04,338
Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>

958
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:06,340
-Mmm?
-Your costume looks great.

959
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:09,176
Who are you supposed to be?

960
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,244
Marie Curie.

961
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,080
Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
French physicist

962
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,882
-and feminist icon.
-Oh, she was, uh,

963
00:57:15,915 --> 00:57:18,151
she discovered radiation.
Right?

964
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,385
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

965
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:20,453
Yeah, her work was killing her.

966
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:21,888
She didn't even realize it.

967
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,990
Yeah, well,
for someone who is dying

968
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,159
of radiation poisoning,

969
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,829
uh, you look beautiful.

970
00:57:29,862 --> 00:57:33,299
I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

971
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,867
It's probably
too much actually.

972
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:36,402
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

973
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:38,404
maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

974
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:40,473
Or we could start
handing it out now,

975
00:57:40,506 --> 00:57:42,108
if that's...

976
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,842
-what you wanna do.
-Yeah.

977
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,378
Uh, I have a confession,
actually.

978
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,983
I'd rather stay up here
with you.

979
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,388
Okay. Yeah.

980
00:57:57,322 --> 00:57:58,323
That works, too.

981
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,957
Please don't freak out.

982
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:33,991
What are you?

983
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:35,960
Don't you know?

984
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:40,064
Astrid, really,
you don't have to be scared.

985
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:43,234
You're a ghost.

986
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,039
My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

987
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:50,507
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

988
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,309
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

989
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:54,344
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

990
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:55,378
And one day,

991
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:58,048
I slipped

992
00:58:58,081 --> 00:58:59,082
and fell.

993
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,584
How long ago did that happen?

994
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:04,020
23 years, 5 months and 14 days.

995
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:05,455
But who's counting?

996
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:06,990
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

997
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:09,926
I can't go any further
than that tree.

998
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:13,096
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

999
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:14,597
But then you came along,

1000
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:15,998
and you could see me.

1001
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:19,535
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1002
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:21,904
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1003
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:23,005
It was amazing.

1004
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:24,940
You're amazing.

1005
00:59:24,973 --> 00:59:26,542
-I should go.
-Astrid, I know.

1006
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:28,043
I know it's insane.

1007
00:59:28,077 --> 00:59:31,246
But I really like you,

1008
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,015
and I want us to be together.

1009
00:59:34,316 --> 00:59:36,051
How?

1010
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:38,287
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
00:59:39,388 --> 00:59:40,956
Well, uh,

1012
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:42,624
what if I told you

1013
00:59:42,658 --> 00:59:44,393
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1014
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:47,462
To be human again.

1015
00:59:47,495 --> 00:59:49,564
Um, it's all in this book.

1016
00:59:49,597 --> 00:59:51,466
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1017
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:52,900
It's kind of complicated,

1018
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:55,136
but, uh, I can only do it

1019
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:58,973
with the help
of a living person.

1020
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:02,009
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1021
01:00:02,043 --> 01:00:04,545
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

1022
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:07,181
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

1023
01:00:07,215 --> 01:00:08,616
Yeah, well, I...

1024
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:11,252
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1025
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:12,620
to stay away.

1026
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:14,455
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1027
01:00:16,424 --> 01:00:18,625
You'd get to see your dad.

1028
01:00:19,493 --> 01:00:20,560
Again.

1029
01:00:35,108 --> 01:00:37,010
I have the first
official open house

1030
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:38,412
a week from Sunday,

1031
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:40,280
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

1032
01:00:40,313 --> 01:00:41,548
Where's Rory?

1033
01:00:41,581 --> 01:00:43,283
Supermarket.

1034
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:45,318
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

1035
01:00:45,352 --> 01:00:47,621
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

1036
01:00:47,654 --> 01:00:49,055
Even Halloween.

1037
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:51,590
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1038
01:00:51,624 --> 01:00:54,427
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1039
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,461
No, Delia.

1040
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,463
Where are you going?

1041
01:00:57,496 --> 01:00:59,064
Cemetery.

1042
01:00:59,098 --> 01:01:01,100
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1043
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:05,137
I need to skedaddle, too.

1044
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:06,705
I'm co-chaperoning

1045
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:09,408
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1046
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:11,677
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1047
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,713
We agreed nothing Disney.

1048
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:16,582
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1049
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:20,519
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1050
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,387
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

1051
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,756
- Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

1052
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,324
Isn't that genius?

1053
01:01:26,357 --> 01:01:28,259
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1054
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,161
I'm going as...

1055
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:34,666
"reverse mortgage."

1056
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,601
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1057
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:39,404
Where is Astrid?

1058
01:01:39,437 --> 01:01:41,773
On a date. Her first.

1059
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:44,342
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1060
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:46,077
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1061
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,213
Don't mention that street.

1062
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,280
I have a listing that's kept me

1063
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:51,416
from a perfect sales record.

1064
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:53,317
Oh, it's my own fault.

1065
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,686
The place had been
on the market for years...

1066
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:58,288
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1067
01:01:58,322 --> 01:01:59,690
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1068
01:01:59,723 --> 01:02:01,024
Murder House?

1069
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:02,559
Which house?

1070
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:05,496
125.

1071
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:07,297
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1072
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:09,066
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1073
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:12,135
Jeremy Frazier?

1074
01:02:12,169 --> 01:02:14,171
I didn't get his last name.

1075
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:17,040
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1076
01:02:17,074 --> 01:02:20,177
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1077
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,513
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1078
01:02:23,546 --> 01:02:25,515
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1079
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:26,582
When they tried to get him out,

1080
01:02:26,616 --> 01:02:28,584
he fell, broke his neck,

1081
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:30,353
died instantly.

1082
01:02:35,658 --> 01:02:38,294
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1083
01:02:38,327 --> 01:02:40,496
Draw a door with some chalk?

1084
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,798
Oh, and knock three times?

1085
01:02:41,832 --> 01:02:43,299
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1086
01:02:43,332 --> 01:02:44,333
So lame.

1087
01:02:54,877 --> 01:02:57,112
Or maybe it's not so lame.

1088
01:02:57,145 --> 01:02:58,848
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1089
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:00,783
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1090
01:03:00,816 --> 01:03:03,151
you have to read
that incantation first.

1091
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,157
<i>"De mundo</i>
<i>vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

1092
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:26,775
Astrid!

1093
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,481
Jeremy, is that you?

1094
01:03:40,454 --> 01:03:43,324
<i>"Ut liber iterum</i>
<i>ambulet alius."</i>

1095
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,226
Okay.

1096
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,695
I think that worked.

1097
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:49,530
Astrid!

1098
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:54,101
Let's go see your dad.

1099
01:03:57,437 --> 01:03:59,339
Astrid! No!

1100
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:06,679
Okay.

1101
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:19,793
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1102
01:04:19,827 --> 01:04:22,228
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1103
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:24,664
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1104
01:04:24,697 --> 01:04:26,733
Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1105
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:29,601
Merry Christmas.

1106
01:04:29,635 --> 01:04:30,837
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:33,739
Thanks.

1108
01:04:33,773 --> 01:04:35,407
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1109
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:45,484
Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1110
01:04:45,517 --> 01:04:48,553
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1111
01:04:48,587 --> 01:04:50,689
That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1112
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:58,463
Whoa, dude.

1113
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:05,436
Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1114
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:09,540
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1115
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,777
No, I haven't.

1116
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,812
And I won't ever.

1117
01:05:13,845 --> 01:05:15,847
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1118
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:19,517
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1119
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:23,320
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1120
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:24,890
Kings of Commerce,

1121
01:05:24,923 --> 01:05:26,457
Knights of Nasdaq,

1122
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,727
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1123
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,363
You are no more, my king.

1124
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,532
But with the blessing
of the angels

1125
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,267
of undying love...

1126
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:40,871
I, your surviving queen,

1127
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:43,273
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1128
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,613
Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1129
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,884
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1130
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:55,452
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1131
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,353
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1132
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:58,889
but don't come up

1133
01:05:58,923 --> 01:06:00,557
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1134
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,591
Sure.

1135
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,395
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1136
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:08,363
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

1137
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,698
Here we are.

1138
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,266
- Apples...
- Thank you!

1139
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,268
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1140
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,737
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1141
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,242
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1142
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,780
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1143
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:55,476
The Juice is loose.

1144
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,014
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1145
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:01,950
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1146
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,484
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1147
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,553
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1148
01:07:06,586 --> 01:07:07,989
He gets to come back,

1149
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,689
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1150
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:11,591
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1151
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:12,860
-Soul Train?
-That's right.

1152
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:15,462
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1153
01:07:15,495 --> 01:07:16,998
No, she can't
get on that train.

1154
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:18,800
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1155
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,400
Well, I can get you in,

1156
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:22,569
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1157
01:07:22,602 --> 01:07:24,738
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1158
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:26,606
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1159
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,843
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1160
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:30,577
She's kinda clingy.

1161
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,678
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1162
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,080
You want me to marry you!

1163
01:07:33,114 --> 01:07:34,748
I thought you'd never ask.

1164
01:07:34,782 --> 01:07:36,582
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1165
01:07:36,615 --> 01:07:38,450
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1166
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:39,718
Yikes!

1167
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,422
Okay, fine.

1168
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:45,457
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1169
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:46,692
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1170
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:48,394
-Give me that.
-Ow.

1171
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:49,428
And here we go.

1172
01:07:52,464 --> 01:07:53,834
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1173
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:56,569
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1174
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:03,977
Yeah.

1175
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,613
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

1176
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:23,394
<i>We need</i>
<i>a demon possession.</i>

1177
01:08:23,428 --> 01:08:24,662
<i>Our case worker's</i>

01:08:24,696 --> 01:08:25,764

01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,807
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1182
01:08:36,474 --> 01:08:37,475
You never saw us.

1183
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,110
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

1184
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:43,181
Bob, you and the boys
stand guard.

1185
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:44,983
Nobody gets through.

1186
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:47,986
Let's go, honey.

1187
01:09:08,206 --> 01:09:09,840
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

1188
01:09:09,873 --> 01:09:11,474
Whoa, whoa.

1189
01:09:11,507 --> 01:09:12,708
One each.

1190
01:09:12,742 --> 01:09:13,877
Honor system.

1191
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:15,645
Yeah, right. Asshole.

1192
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:18,714
Huh?

1193
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:23,787
Okay, everyone,

1194
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,955
strawberries get first pick
this time.

1195
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:26,957
No crowding.

1196
01:09:38,035 --> 01:09:40,137
Hands on your head, asswipe!

1197
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,838
Or I'll spray-paint the wall
with your brains!

1198
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:44,073
<i>10-31 reporting.</i>

1199
01:09:44,106 --> 01:09:45,607
Oh, no, dude.

1200
01:09:46,574 --> 01:09:47,944
That was way too forced.

1201
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,112
Remember, throw it away.

1202
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:52,014
Underplay it.

1203
01:09:52,048 --> 01:09:54,083
You gotta keep it real.

1204
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:55,151
- <i>Warning.</i>
- Olga,

1205
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:56,651
what the hell is going on?

1206
01:09:56,685 --> 01:09:59,188
We got a code 6-9-9 violation.

1207
01:09:59,221 --> 01:10:00,790
You mean to tell me

1208
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:03,125
a live one illegally
broke into the Afterlife?

1209
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:05,094
<i>...6-9-9 violation.</i>

1210
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:07,863
Time to call the Ghoul Squad.

1211
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:13,835
I need a hard target search
for two suspects.

1212
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:15,003
Scumbag...

1213
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,705
goes by the name
of Beetlejuice.

1214
01:10:17,738 --> 01:10:19,573
And a female Fleshbag.

1215
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:21,910
One Lydia Deetz.

1216
01:10:21,943 --> 01:10:25,947
Kick down every door.
Leave no gravestone unturned.

1217
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:30,285
Hell, sift through the sands
of Titan if you have to!

1218
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:32,586
Men...

1219
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:34,688
this is what
you've been training

1220
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:36,091
your entire deaths for.

1221
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:38,592
And remember...

1222
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,128
Gotta keep it real!

1223
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:41,896
Yes!

1224
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:53,007
What the hell?

1225
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,143
Where am... What?

1226
01:10:56,176 --> 01:10:59,146
No. No. No!

1227
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:02,615
No!

1228
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,684
No!

1229
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:06,320
Excuse me!

1230
01:11:06,353 --> 01:11:08,122
What if a mistake's been made?

1231
01:11:08,155 --> 01:11:10,190
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

1232
01:11:16,796 --> 01:11:17,964
Seriously?

1233
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:20,732
No. I have global entry.

1234
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:22,835
Is there a line for that?

1235
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:28,307
<i>The 8:35 to the Great Beyond</i>

1236
01:11:28,341 --> 01:11:29,776
<i>is on time.</i>

1237
01:11:29,809 --> 01:11:31,310
Next.

1238
01:11:31,344 --> 01:11:34,080
Stand on the marks and look
directly into the camera.

1239
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:37,083
Say "cheese."

1240
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:40,887
Whoa!

1241
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,921
Are you okay?

1242
01:11:43,856 --> 01:11:46,291
No. I feel strange.

1243
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:49,027
I feel amazing. Go figure.

1244
01:11:49,061 --> 01:11:50,661
-What just happened?
-Well, it's real simple.

1245
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:54,132
You remember the chant
that I got you to recite?

1246
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:58,837
Uh, you agreed
to swap your life for mine.

1247
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:01,173
What?

1248
01:12:01,206 --> 01:12:03,308
I needed your life so that
I could walk free again.

1249
01:12:04,742 --> 01:12:06,878
She's got a seat
on the Soul Train.

1250
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:08,880
One-way to the Great Beyond.

1251
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:11,149
If you hustle,
you can make the 8:35.

1252
01:12:11,183 --> 01:12:12,750
- Wait, no! Wait!
- Thank you very much.

1253
01:12:13,952 --> 01:12:14,953
I never agreed to this!

1254
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,687
Uh, how do I cross back over?

1255
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,157
Get this stamped first.
Window 11.

1256
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:23,127
The transfer
isn't permanent till then.

1257
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:29,699
Dad?

1258
01:12:29,732 --> 01:12:30,968
-Astrid?
-Dad?

1259
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:33,003
Dad! Help me!

1260
01:12:33,404 --> 01:12:34,637
Dad!

1261
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:36,639
Astrid!

1262
01:12:54,023 --> 01:12:56,359
Soon, my beloved.

1263
01:12:56,392 --> 01:12:57,726
Soon.

1264
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:17,947
<i>Warning, violation code 6-9-9.</i>

1265
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:19,314
All clear. Let's go.

1266
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:20,249
We're like Bonnie and Clyde,
you and me.

1267
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:21,450
Without the bullet holes.

1268
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:22,750
Do you even know
where we're going?

1269
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:24,019
You go right down the hallway,

1270
01:13:24,052 --> 01:13:25,387
three rights through
the ninth door...

1271
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,687
<i>Violation code 6-9-9.</i>

1272
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:28,190
...and right to the Soul Train.

1273
01:13:28,223 --> 01:13:29,825
Where are you going?

1274
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:31,059
I'm gonna go to
the little boy's room first.

1275
01:13:59,153 --> 01:14:02,123
This is the 8:35...

1276
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:03,858
to the Great Beyond!

1277
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,861
All aboard

1278
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:08,963
the Soul Train!

1279
01:14:17,505 --> 01:14:18,806
No. No!

1280
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:20,975
No!

1281
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:23,476
Yeah! Whoo!

1282
01:14:26,513 --> 01:14:27,881
Astrid!

1283
01:14:27,914 --> 01:14:29,049
Astrid!

1284
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,519
No! No, no!

1285
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:33,787
No, no!

1286
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,854
Please, no!

1287
01:14:43,496 --> 01:14:46,266
Hey,
shake your thing, mama.

1288
01:14:46,299 --> 01:14:47,467
Hey!

1289
01:14:56,308 --> 01:14:57,776
Astrid!

1290
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,121
Shoot!

1291
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,457
Freeze!

1292
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,425
There.

1293
01:15:17,129 --> 01:15:18,864
By the way, I saw Dad.

1294
01:15:29,941 --> 01:15:31,309
Hey, where are we?

1295
01:15:31,342 --> 01:15:32,410
I don't know.

1296
01:15:35,246 --> 01:15:37,181
Hey, that's Saturn.

1297
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:40,218
Right? So we must be
on one of its moons.

1298
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:41,986
I swear,
the Afterlife is so random!

1299
01:16:03,874 --> 01:16:06,076
Sandworm! Run!

1300
01:16:14,151 --> 01:16:15,852
Take my hand!

1301
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:23,427
Here! Come on!

1302
01:16:53,122 --> 01:16:54,557
Marie Curie.

1303
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,659
After the radiation poisoning.

1304
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:58,293
Right?

1305
01:16:58,326 --> 01:16:59,494
Learned from the best.

1306
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:02,263
We made a great kid.

1307
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:05,166
Yeah, we did.

1308
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:07,902
Come here!

1309
01:17:11,172 --> 01:17:12,507
I know you can't see me,

1310
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,443
but I check in on you both
all the time.

1311
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:16,611
And I don't want
to be the reason

1312
01:17:16,644 --> 01:17:18,480
that drove you two apart.

1313
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:19,514
You need each other.

1314
01:17:20,615 --> 01:17:22,250
You make each other better.

1315
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:24,285
Always have.

1316
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:27,122
<i>Alert!</i>

1317
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:28,356
<i>We have a 6-9-9 violation.</i>

1318
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,290
We gotta get back
to Winter River.

1319
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:32,192
You can't leave until
Astrid gets her life back.

1320
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:34,661
<i>-Warning! Intruder detected!</i>
-Let's go.

1321
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:39,566
The Ghoul patrol found
the breach and sealed it.

1322
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,703
Any sign of Mr. Beetlejuice?
Or the Fleshbag?

1323
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:44,171
Still looking.

1324
01:17:44,204 --> 01:17:46,073
But we did find something
that might help.

1325
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:00,187
Hmm.

1326
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:10,229
-"Bob"?
-Mmm?

1327
01:18:12,766 --> 01:18:15,001
Let me tell ya
how this is gonna go.

1328
01:18:15,034 --> 01:18:18,037
Your shriveled lips
will start flappin',

1329
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,206
or I'll crack
your itty-bitty skull

1330
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,208
like a goddamn walnut.

1331
01:18:22,241 --> 01:18:23,476
Where's Beetlejuice?

1332
01:18:38,523 --> 01:18:40,192
- Rory?
- Father...

1333
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:42,294
I'm seeing these shrunken
head people everywhere.

1334
01:18:42,327 --> 01:18:43,995
Well, be not afraid,

1335
01:18:44,029 --> 01:18:46,097
for thine eyes
will see strange things.

1336
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:47,999
Are you filled
with fear and trembling?

1337
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:50,469
Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

1338
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:52,537
-Ah.
-What are you doing here?

1339
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:53,705
I'm searching
for the lost lambs

1340
01:18:53,738 --> 01:18:55,307
to bring back into the light.

1341
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,609
Why don't I give you a ride
to the church?

1342
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:06,116
Trick or treat!

1343
01:19:07,518 --> 01:19:09,253
Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

1344
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,621
I... Come right back, I just...

1345
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,423
Excuse me. Just...

1346
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,593
Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,
late for a wedding.

1347
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:18,229
Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1348
01:19:18,262 --> 01:19:19,663
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1349
01:19:19,697 --> 01:19:22,199
I'm on a break.
Take a number. Take a seat.

1350
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,601
No, you see, those asps,

1351
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,102
they were defanged.
I paid extra for that.

1352
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,204
Honey, you're dead, okay?

1353
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:29,173
Now take a number and sit down.

1354
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:37,113
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

1355
01:19:37,146 --> 01:19:38,548
Did that line
used to work for you?

1356
01:19:38,581 --> 01:19:40,517
I'm not dead!

1357
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:43,486
You know what?

1358
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,255
My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1359
01:19:45,288 --> 01:19:46,790
Yes, he can fix this.

1360
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,191
You call him, he can fix this,
he can fix anything.

1361
01:19:48,224 --> 01:19:49,692
Not anymore he can't.

1362
01:19:49,726 --> 01:19:52,328
No, wait! Wait, I know people!

1363
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:55,698
Oh! I know people!
I am people! Why's...

1364
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,135
No.

1365
01:19:59,168 --> 01:20:01,070
Beetlejuice. Oh, no.

1366
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,641
Beetlejuice.

1367
01:20:07,543 --> 01:20:09,211
Right here.

1368
01:20:09,244 --> 01:20:11,113
I get it. Now that you're dead,

1369
01:20:11,146 --> 01:20:12,681
you wanna hang out with me.

1370
01:20:12,714 --> 01:20:14,449
Would you help me
find Charles, please?

1371
01:20:14,483 --> 01:20:16,418
And then the VIP lounge.

1372
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:17,854
-Sure.
-Okay.

1373
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:20,556
Just after you help me
find my runaway bride.

1374
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:23,725
Ugh.

1375
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:35,404
Hmm?

1376
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:39,140
Where is he?

1377
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:43,611
Tell me.

1378
01:21:14,674 --> 01:21:17,544
<i>Stay behind</i>
<i>the line until called.</i>

1379
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:25,452
Don't stamp that passport!

1380
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:32,325
You're too late, man.

1381
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:33,861
I think it was Dostoevsky
who said...

1382
01:21:35,695 --> 01:21:36,696
"Later, fucker!"

1383
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:41,600
This way. Follow me.

1384
01:21:46,372 --> 01:21:48,540
Next!

1385
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:51,410
<i>Warning! Intruder detected.</i>

1386
01:21:52,444 --> 01:21:54,213
This way.

1387
01:21:54,246 --> 01:21:56,548
<i>This is</i>
<i>a code 6-9-9. We have...</i>

1388
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:58,217
Okay, this is as far as I go.

1389
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:00,754
-Okay.
-I love you.

1390
01:22:00,787 --> 01:22:02,254
I love you too, sweetheart.

1391
01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:05,524
Have an amazing life.

1392
01:22:05,557 --> 01:22:06,725
You take care of each other.

1393
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,193
Yeah.

1394
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:09,528
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

1395
01:22:31,616 --> 01:22:33,184
Thank you for saving my life.

1396
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,424
I'm so sorry I never believed
that you saw ghosts and...

1397
01:22:39,457 --> 01:22:41,160
I don't know,
I'm just sorry for all of it.

1398
01:22:43,727 --> 01:22:45,228
Astrid, I...

1399
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:46,998
Lydia!
Come on, you're late!

1400
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:48,732
Oh, my God! My wedding!

1401
01:22:48,766 --> 01:22:50,400
We're about to start.

1402
01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:51,969
Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1403
01:22:52,003 --> 01:22:53,470
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

1404
01:22:53,503 --> 01:22:55,272
I know,
but if I don't do it now,

1405
01:22:55,305 --> 01:22:57,374
I'm never gonna do it.

1406
01:22:57,407 --> 01:22:59,376
But are you sure about this?

1407
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:02,847
Rory loves me,
and that's gotta be enough.

1408
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,749
Quickly, my dear!
Come! Come!

1409
01:23:04,782 --> 01:23:05,883
Oh.

1410
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:09,987
And the lost lamb
is welcome into thy house

1411
01:23:10,021 --> 01:23:11,856
-with open arms.
-Oh, my God!

1412
01:23:13,824 --> 01:23:15,257
I thought you got cold feet.

1413
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:16,592
Oh, no, blame me.

1414
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,360
She just saved me
from my date from hell.

1415
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:19,628
Who are all these people?

1416
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,664
This is just
a couple influencers.

1417
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,399
Nobody under
five million followers,

1418
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:25,736
and I think we have
a Netflix executive in there.

1419
01:23:25,769 --> 01:23:26,903
We doing this?

1420
01:23:26,937 --> 01:23:28,805
Yeah. Where's your dress?

1421
01:23:28,839 --> 01:23:30,406
All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

1422
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:31,942
So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

1423
01:23:31,975 --> 01:23:33,375
Wait, where's Delia?

1424
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:34,510
Yo!

1425
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:36,947
Right here.

1426
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,581
She was helpin' me calm down
before the wedding.

1427
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,016
I was feeling a little jittery.

1428
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,318
-All, right, beat it.
-You.

1429
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:44,787
You're that thing...

1430
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,454
from my dream.

1431
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,389
Well, I'm really
more nightmare material,

1432
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,825
but, thanks.

1433
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:51,593
- You're...
- Uh-uh.

1434
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:53,728
Part of the deal

1435
01:23:53,763 --> 01:23:55,363
is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!

1436
01:23:55,396 --> 01:23:56,731
What deal?

1437
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,000
The deal she made to save you.

1438
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,467
By the way,
you can call me "Dad."

1439
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,836
Lydia.

1440
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,905
You agreed to marry him?

1441
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:06,341
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

1442
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,675
Lydia. What's going on here?

1443
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,913
Wow.

1444
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:12,848
Awkward.

1445
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:14,884
You haven't made much progress
since our last session,

1446
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,618
so I'm gonna suggest
some drug therapy.

1447
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:19,988
Don't be afraid to share.
When you're ready.

1448
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:28,562
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

1449
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:30,932
I never believed in ghosts,
spirits, or any of it.

1450
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,101
What? All this time?

1451
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,435
Why the hell
did you wanna get married?

1452
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:36,738
Money!

1453
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,972
I knew I could make more
as your husband

1454
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:39,573
than I could as your manager.

1455
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:42,709
And I never
had a dead fiancee.

1456
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,478
I just went
to that survivor's retreat,

1457
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:47,346
so that I could meet
weak women and exploit them!

1458
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,516
And I hit the codependent
lottery when I met you.

1459
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,318
How 'bout a little
physical therapy?

1460
01:25:00,526 --> 01:25:01,862
We'd like to thank you all

1461
01:25:01,895 --> 01:25:03,797
for coming to this
very special occasion,

1462
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:06,432
but right now
we'd like a little privacy.

1463
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:34,459

Mr. Juice,

01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:10,961
you've violated code 6-9-9!

1507
01:30:10,994 --> 01:30:12,295
Freeze!

1508
01:30:13,964 --> 01:30:15,065
Book 'em, Danno!

1509
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:18,768
Beetlejuice!

1510
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:24,274
What the...

1511
01:30:24,307 --> 01:30:25,742
I'm back.

1512
01:30:30,712 --> 01:30:32,114
Sweetheart!

1513
01:30:32,148 --> 01:30:33,415
You look fantastic!

1514
01:30:33,449 --> 01:30:35,284
You look so...

1515
01:30:35,317 --> 01:30:37,853
- put together.
- He's mine.

1516
01:30:37,887 --> 01:30:40,089
It's me, not you.
You know, honey,

1517
01:30:40,122 --> 01:30:42,791
I've been goin' through
a lotta changes lately.

1518
01:30:42,825 --> 01:30:44,692
Kind of a mid-afterlife
crisis, I guess.

1519
01:30:44,727 --> 01:30:47,897
Your soul belongs to me,
my love.

1520
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:49,765
For eternity.

1521
01:30:49,798 --> 01:30:51,066
You don't wanna
spend your eternity with me.

1522
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,234
I'm a lone wolf.

1523
01:30:52,268 --> 01:30:53,869
You need a soulmate.

1524
01:30:53,903 --> 01:30:56,704
Somebody who really sees you.
For instance.

1525
01:31:02,877 --> 01:31:05,146
I need something
to draw with. Quick!

1526
01:31:39,146 --> 01:31:40,280
<i>Olé.</i>

1527
01:31:52,326 --> 01:31:53,860
- Let's go!
- Hey!

1528
01:31:54,795 --> 01:31:56,430
We had a deal.

1529
01:31:56,463 --> 01:31:58,131
She doesn't have to marry you.

1530
01:31:58,165 --> 01:32:00,133
- What?
-  -You violated code 6-9-9.

1531
01:32:00,167 --> 01:32:02,836
Yeah, you illegally brought
my mom into the Afterlife.

1532
01:32:02,869 --> 01:32:05,137
According to that book,
that contract is null and void.

1533
01:32:08,874 --> 01:32:11,310
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us,

1534
01:32:11,344 --> 01:32:13,546
but the 600-year age gap

1535
01:32:13,579 --> 01:32:15,348
was a little bit much for me.

1536
01:32:15,381 --> 01:32:16,882
-Beetle...
-Ah!

1537
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:18,284
Beetlejuice.

1538
01:32:22,989 --> 01:32:24,056
Beetlejuice.

1539
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:33,165
- Hey!
- Beetlejuice.

1540
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,176
Shoulda got married in Vegas.

1541
01:32:53,518 --> 01:32:55,120
Looks like
we're a little late, boys.

1542
01:32:57,188 --> 01:32:59,324
Tape off the crime scene,
call in forensics,

1543
01:32:59,357 --> 01:33:02,160
and keep
the goddamn media away.

1544
01:33:02,193 --> 01:33:05,363
Little lady, you just
popped his Beetlejuice.

1545
01:33:05,397 --> 01:33:06,897
Say your goodbyes,

1546
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:08,866
you can take a selfie now,
if you like,

1547
01:33:08,899 --> 01:33:10,100
but make it quick.

1548
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:13,570
Sister, you're comin' with me.

1549
01:33:13,604 --> 01:33:15,506
What? Delia, what did you do?

1550
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:17,107
I fell for a scam,

1551
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:20,010
and I'm counting on you
to claim a refund.

1552
01:33:20,044 --> 01:33:21,578
Those snakes were actually
poisonous, weren't they?

1553
01:33:21,612 --> 01:33:25,049
Yeah. So, I died
of embarrassment.

1554
01:33:25,082 --> 01:33:27,217
Your work's gonna
go up in value.

1555
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:28,919
- Oh! Oh, well, then.
- Mmm-hmm.

1556
01:33:29,486 --> 01:33:31,121
Delia...

1557
01:33:31,155 --> 01:33:32,856
-I'll miss you.
-No, you won't.

1558
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,892
I'll find Charles
and we'll haunt you both,

1559
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:36,927
until you beg us to move on!

1560
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,995
Nice work
for a couple of Fleshbags.

1561
01:33:39,028 --> 01:33:40,930
Don't come knockin'
until it's your time,

1562
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:42,632
and in the meantime, remember,

1563
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:44,500
you gotta keep it real.

1564
01:33:44,534 --> 01:33:46,002
Come on, beautiful,

1565
01:33:46,035 --> 01:33:48,004
we got a date
with the commissioner.

1566
01:34:33,682 --> 01:34:34,950
Charles!

I can't believe you're here!

1569
01:34:44,425 --> 01:34:45,693
Oh, Charles.

1570
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:47,495
I'm so happy
to see you!

1571
01:34:48,396 --> 01:34:49,697
Oh, Charles,

1572
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:51,132
look what happened to me!

1573
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:56,003

01:35:24,264 --> 01:35:26,332
