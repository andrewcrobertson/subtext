It's that defective

Orion Pax. Who cares?

48
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,912
We told you to never
come back here!

Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

Hold on. Whoa, whoa, hold
on. No need for violence.

51
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,185
How about this: I run away, you
chase me. We play that game. Huh?

Come on. You're bigger,
faster. It'll be fun.

He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

54

Why not? It's not
like he can transform.

00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:31,897
Oh, yeah?

Ooh, Energon.

Evening, everyone. Pardon me.

00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,931

Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?

82
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:03,021
[chuckling] Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

83
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,462
You want to give me another one?

84
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,860
You're dead! I'll
take that as a no.

85
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,697
[grunts] Hey! Watch
where you're going!

86
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:10,534
Oh... What did
you say, no-cog?

87
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,096
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean you.

88
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:13,966
I was referring to the
bot who was behind you.

89
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,473
What? Where'd he go?

90
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,936
The filthy red and blue bot?

91
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,905
Has a big mouth, squeaky joints,

92
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,610
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

93
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:22,304
Where is he? He went that way.

94
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,482
When I get my hands
on that bot...

95
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,218
All right, all clear.

96
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:37,858
Okay, D-16, I may
be a little rusty,

97
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,530
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

98
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,664
Let me guess. Chased
out of the archives?

99
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,743
[laughs] Yeah. I had to jump
out of a window this time.

100
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,536
Almost died.
[laughs] It was wild.

101
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,769
And digging through ancient
data is worth dying for?

102
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,133
Yes, it is.

103
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:50,607
I need a new best friend.

104
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,510
If there are clues in
our recorded history

105
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,611
that can help locate the
Matrix of Leadership,

106
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,008
they're in the archives.

107
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:59,374
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

108
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,486
is up on the surface right now,

109
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,720
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

110
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,822
That's exactly what I'm
doing. I'm trying to help him.

111
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,384
Yeah, okay. [laughs]

112
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,155
The sooner Energon flows again,

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,322
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

114
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,676
Don't you want to choose your
own path, do whatever you want?

115
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,327
We're miners. We
mine, that's all.

116
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:22,837
No, there has got to be something
more I can do. I can feel it.

117
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:24,872
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

118
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,643
you could transform
without a cog?

119
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,447
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

120
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,878
Took me three days
to pry you open.

121
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,022
Your feelings get
you in trouble.

122
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,551
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,784
Just trust in Sentinel
Prime. I do trust in him.

124
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,447
Hey, if we did have cogs...

125
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,724
I'd transform into a
shovel and beat you.

126
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,660
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

127
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:46,564
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

128
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,830
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

129
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,800
I'll give it to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

130
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:53,670
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

Prime decal, first edition.

132
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,576
[gasps] What?

133
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,446
If you don't want it, I
can just throw it away.

134
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,052
Throw it away? Don't...
That's not funny. Let me see.

135
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:04,439
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

136
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,081
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the...

137
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,984
The strongest
Prime to ever live.

138
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,480
I know, buddy.

139
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:16,660
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

140
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,532
Thanks. Always got your back.

141
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,930

[all] So much, Elita-1!

148

00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:13,684
you are looking especially
shiny this morning. New polish?

156
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,686
Orion Pax, I'm
sorry that I somehow

157
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,479
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

158

Apology accepted.

enough power in me

touch Primus myself.

163

touch or the power.

Drill it out!

177
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:03,591

Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

187

The tunnel is closing.

188

I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

195
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,299
I'm falling back to assist.

[Elita]<i> Negative. Do not

We're gonna need more lift.

198
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,569
It's closing! Just
grab your pack and go.

199
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,812
Yeah. Good idea.

200
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,144
What? No, I didn't mean it!

[Elita]<i> Pax, what's happening?</i>

00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,289
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:05,895
It's all good. [deep rumbling]

207

Oh, that's not good.
[rumbling swells]

208

exit the tunnel of death?

What the hell, Pax? I
told you to evacuate.

219
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,227
I did, eventually. If I
get fired because of you...

220
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:43,196
Oh, please. They're
not gonna fire you.

221
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,627
Elita-1, you're fired.

222
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:48,696
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

223
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:50,632
That is true. I was the
one who broke the rules.

224
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,304
No one asked you!

225
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,603
Darkwing, please, I've
worked too hard for this.

226
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:57,672
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

227
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:00,345
Report to waste
management immediately.

228
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,017
Waste management?

229
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,019
Elita... Next time, why
don't you stop and think

230
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:05,548
before you ruin someone's life?

231
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,714
I'm sorry!

232
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,386
[indistinct chatter]

233
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,091
Hey, Darkwing! Don't do it.

234
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:13,325
I may not have a cog, but
my finger can transform.

235
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,262
Guess which one? I'll give
you a "limited option."

[imitates mechanical

237
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,903
Excuse me, sir.

238
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,806
Allow me. [grunts]

239
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,237
I apologize on his
behalf for the...

240
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:26,778
[slow groan] Why?

241
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,651
[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]

242
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,191
What'd you expect? He's metal.

243
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,863
You know you were out of line,

244
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,096
talking back to a
superior like that.

245
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:50,263
Darkwing was out of
line. He deserves it.

246
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:52,067
[sighs]

247
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:54,564
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

248
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:59,008
He had every right to
hit me. I interfered.

249
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,738
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

250
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,851
I'm glad you were there with me

251
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,457
to get punched in the
face. That was fun.

252
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,679

Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

289
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:58,358
[D-16] Whatever this
is, it better be good.

290
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,063
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay. Listen.

291
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,164
All right, what
if... what if...

292
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,661
what if tomorrow

293
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:08,500
we ran in the Iacon 5000, huh?

294
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:11,470
What if kill you
for waking me up?

295
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:13,208
No, no, no, hear me out.

00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,671
We don't even have to win!

297

Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

298
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,247
But... But if we beat
just one Transformer,

299
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:21,249
it proves we're just
as good as they are.

300
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,383
Not only would we
go down in history,

301
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:26,716
the mining bots that
did the impossible,

302
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,586
but we would show
everyone that we're...

303
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,654
we're capable of so much more!

304
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:31,996
Or we get publicly humiliated

305
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,723
and then busted
back to tier one.

306
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,660
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

307
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,299
Pax... Come on, D.

308
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,762
Pax.

309
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,633
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

310
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,867
We can't fly, we can't roll,

311
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,209
we can't race.

312
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,276
Come on, let's go.

313

314
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,279
All right, fine.

315
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:53,017
Yeah, maybe you're right.

316
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,089
Maybe.

00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,654
[D-16] The Iacon
5000 is finally here!

[Orion] I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

319
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,427
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

320
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,099
Yeah, yeah, I know. Follow me.

321
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,200
Great. We're
gonna be late now.

322
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,334
I wanted good seats.

323
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,205
We came all this way to miss the
opening ceremony. This is wonderful!

324

Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

325
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,044

00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,349
Okay, where are you taking me?

00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,749
Don't be a glitch, this will
be totally worth it. Trust me.

Hey, you don't be a glitch.

332
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,785
Look, I know this is,

like, we're joking around,

334
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:39,954

any part of the Iacon 5000,

335
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:43,529

No.

342
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,127

[cheers, applause] I
love you, Sentinel!

350
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:39,123
Yes! It feels so good to
be here with you all today.

[crowd quiets]

354
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,023
It has been precisely 50 cycles

355
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,564
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

356
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,106
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

357
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,735
and our Energon supply dried up.

358
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,805
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

359
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,774
my brothers and sisters in arms.

360
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,009
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

361
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:11,716
and we show them that the strength of
Cybertron will never be diminished.

362
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:18,558
Racers, on your marks!

363

00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,203
I can't believe we get to
watch from the starting line.

The best seats in the
house! [beeps, whirs]

366
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:29,833

[announcer]<i> Get set!</i>

368
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:34,376
It's time to show them we
are more than meets the eye.

00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,773

377
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:00,204

There are miners in
the race! Miners?

382

No way! They can't
even transform!

383
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,612

I'm gonna kill you!

00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:27,462

I owe you one. More

Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

you were something else?

things I've ever seen.

real run for their money.

halfway into the first shift

crew has already reached 150% quota.

everyone our potential.

That we bots can do
more than just mine...

493
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:38,399
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

494
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,137
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

495
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,447
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

496
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:44,581

travel to the surface.

But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

503
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:59,596
Hang tight. Airachnid, have
someone escort these heroes

504

service facilities.

505

The Sentinel Prime!

508
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:16,173
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

509
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,824
I'm telling you, D... I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

510
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,990
and we're gonna go...
[heavy footsteps]

511

[Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
[D-16] No! [yells]

514

Wait, wait! You
don't understand!

515
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,522
We were supposed to go to
Sentinel Prime's service pod!

516
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:38,833
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

517
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:40,329
I'll make sure of that.

518
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,639
You're making a
mistake! Ask Sentinel!

519
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,773
[groans] I hate that guy!

520
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:46,841
[clattering]

521
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,847
[clattering continues]

522
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,316
You! How did you get down here?

523
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,054
There's no access to this level.

524
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:04,089
There is nobody
down here but me.

525
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,630
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

526
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,864
You're others!
You're not... me!

527
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,603
You're here, and you're not me!

528
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,836
[laughs]

529
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:16,838
Uh, yeah. Awesome!

530
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:19,335
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

531
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,535
I just haven't had
a lot of company

532
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,647
since they put me down
here in sublevel 50.

533
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,914
Fifty? But there are
only 40 sublevels.

534
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,575
That's what I thought!

535
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,545
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

536
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,327
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

537
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,724
How long have you
been down here?

538
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,385
How long have I
been here? [laughs]

539
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,586
Let's see, somewhere between
a long time and forever?

540
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:43,326
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

541
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,196
'cause I'm so good at what I do.

542
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:48,232
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

543
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:49,706
But you can call me B.

544
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,378
And I'm actually working
on some nicknames.

545
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,073
The one I'm floating
right now is Badassatron.

546
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:57,846
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

547
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,210
But if you have any critiques...

548
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,213
Yeah, great. How do
we get out of here?

549
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:04,149
Great question. You don't.

550
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,755
We don't? Nope.

551
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,054
We have limited access to
the waste management area,

552
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:12,124
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

553
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,160
No, they prefer we stay
here on the task at hand.

554
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:16,733
Which is? Oh!

555
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,670
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

556
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,463
onto the conveyor belt.

557
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,400
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

558
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,106
before it hits the
furnace and gets smelted.

559
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,141
So you watch garbage burn.

560
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:30,637
Yes!

561
00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:32,276
It is so great that
you're here now.

562
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,179
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

563
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:36,016
And then tell you
everything about me!

564
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,920
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

565
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,251
with one or two
new best friends.

566
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,451
Uh, yeah, I would love to...

567
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,123
[splutters] Where
are my manners?

568
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:45,938
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

569
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:47,929
Hey, guys, we've got company!

570
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:51,735
This is EP-508,

571
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,497
this is A-A-Tron, and
this fella here is Steve.

572
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,906
"Steve"? Yeah, he's foreign.

573
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,875
Question: Do they
talk back to you?

574
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,174
Um, they're not real.

575
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,814
[laughing] Jeez, you
think I'm that crazy?

576
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,277
It's just you've
been down here a...

577
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:07,861
No, I was talking to
Steve. [beeps and whirs]

578
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,313
[indistinct robotic
speech] [laughs]

579
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,479
Classic Steve.

580
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,283
What is that?
Look at this guy.

581
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:15,319
[mocks electronic speech]
It's coming from inside.

582
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,827
Oh! Steve! No!

583
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,028
I am so sorry.
[dramatically] Steve, no!

584
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,129
We can fix it, don't
worry. My Steve!

585
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:28,035
[voice over transmission]
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

586
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,170
<i>Calling the High Guard for immediate
support. Immediate support!</i>

587
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,436
That's Alpha Trion.

588
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:34,976
One of the Primes?

589
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,308
<i>Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

590
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:40,146
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

591
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:43,413
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

592
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,320
Holy Primus!

593
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:52,620
Those are coordinates to
a location on the surface.

594
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:57,229
This could be where the Primes
died in the Quintesson war.

595
00:28:57,264 --> 00:29:00,661
Which means this is
where we could find

596
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,004
the Matrix of Leadership.

597
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,535
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

598
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,174
Or it's a clue of
how we could find

599
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:10,946
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

600
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:13,742
Hey, D, come on, this could be our
chance to show everyone we're not...

601
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,181
You already tried
to "show everyone"

602
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:16,721
in the race you tricked
me into running,

603
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,085
which got us stuck down here

604
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,516
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

605
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,453
really cool guy.

606
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:25,686
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying...

607
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,490
There's a reason no one
goes to the surface.

608
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:29,228
It's dangerous!

609
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,593
I'm waiting right here until
Sentinel Prime finds us.

610
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,463
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

611
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:36,532
Well, we'll just stay here
forever. That cool with you, B?

612
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,940
Forever? This is great!

613
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:40,173
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

614
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,109
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

615
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:44,254
I usually sleep on the conveyor
belt, but you can totally have it.

616
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:45,783
I'll sleep in the
corner next to A-A-Tron.

617
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,510
Plenty of room for you
to stretch out, too,

618
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:49,919
'cause you're taller than
I am. Know what I mean?

619
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:54,022
Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel's reaction
would be if you personally handed him

620
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:56,992
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

621
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:59,896
Okay, stop. I know what
you're trying to do.

622
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,162
And it's definitely
working. I'm in.

623
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:04,692
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy. How
do we get to the surface?

624
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,870
Pfft! You kidding
me? The surface?

625
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,004
Easy. I know a way.

626
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,765
But it won't be easy.

627
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:14,735
[D-16] Why is there
so much trash? Ah!

628
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,111
[Orion] Warn me next time,
please. My mouth was open.

629
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,608
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!

630
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,776
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

631
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,954
that go all the
way to the surface.

632
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,429
[D-16] Yeah, but they don't allow
passengers. The trains are autonomous.

633
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:29,816
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

634
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:32,291
It's perfect. We'll be
safe inside the train.

635
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,402
[worker] That's the
last one. Send 'er up!

636
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,972
[door whirs, thuds]

637
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,143
[Elita] Hold up! One more.

638
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:54,511
I'll lock it down.

639
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,712
[electronic beeps, clicks]

640
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:05,819
[laughs] Thanks for being
an idiot, whoever you are.

641
00:31:05,854 --> 00:31:08,965
Turning you in will definitely get
me promoted back up a rank or two.

642
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Got her! [grunting]

643
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,199
No, wait, I...

644
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,530
Elita! Stop!

645
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,334
Orion? Hold on, let me...

646
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:16,566
Security! Sound the ala...

647
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:22,869
[grunts angrily]

648
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,944
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

649
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,216
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

650
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:31,383
So am I. To ruin your life.

651
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,930
[yells] [all grunt]

652
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:45,001
Elita, wait. We found a
message. We know where...

653
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,861
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

654
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,402
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

655
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,601
Well, she's gone.

656
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:54,439
[all grunting]

657
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:03,052
[groans]

658
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:07,881
Whoa!

659
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,818
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

660
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:11,962
Climb faster!

661
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,972
[all groaning]

662
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:28,275
Gotcha! [grunts]

663
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,640
Ah, the surface.

664
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:06,181
It's beautiful.

665
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:12,121
[B-127] I am speechless.

666
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,619
Elita, listen to me.

667
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:17,885
We know where the
Matrix of Leadership is.

668
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Oh, sure. And I'm
really a Prime.

669
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:23,330
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

670
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:25,827
Whoa. Where did you get this?

671
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,598
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

672
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,073
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

673
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,470
What? Look.

674
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,670
Sentinel told us he was
going to the surface,

675
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:35,573
and then we found this message.

676
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:37,806
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

677
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,809
or scout the
locations ourselves.

678
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:42,118
Whichever comes first.

679
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:45,682
This was too important to wait.

680
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:48,388
It will change all of our lives.

681
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,193
[inhales sharply]
No, no, no, no.

682
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:54,493
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

683
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:56,374
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the...

684
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,299
[rumbling] Hey, guys? Guys?

685
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,366
What is that?

686

It was going the other way.

00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:31,227

I think this is us,

00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:39,433
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

720

then I'm dragging you and
those two idiot go-bots

722
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:49,971

723
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:52,941

everything that's happened,

Am I saying that right?

Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

731
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,598
I'm B-127. You kneed me in
the face earlier, back there.

732
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,271
You can call me
B, or Badassatron.

733
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,031
It's a nickname some
of the guys gave me.

734
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,440
I don't know. I didn't give
it to myself or anything.

You like that, right?

739

[deep voice] Badass... I'm
gonna need you to talk less.

740

Sure! No... Yeah, no problem.

What am I talking less
about, my nickname?

742
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:38,921
That's fine with me. Got
some mountains over here...

743
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:40,824
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

744
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,793
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

745
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,091
I can't help it.

D, we're really doing this.

you. This was a great idea.

having a good time.

00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:27,064
[Prime 3] It's a trap!
Battle positions!

862
00:45:27,088 --> 00:45:29,517
Hold the line! [Prime]
Primus be with us!

863
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:31,156
[laserfire pulsing]

864
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,621
For Cybertron!

865
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,333
[Alpha Trion] <i>We were
outnumbered, but stood as one.</i>

866
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,568
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

867
00:45:51,178 --> 00:45:53,046
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

868
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,955
[metallic slice]

869
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:03,123
[grunts]

870
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:05,190
[pained yell]

871
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:07,588
[audio slows]

872
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:17,873
[grunting]

873
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,535
Sentinel, why?

874
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,076
For all the power of Cybertron.

875
00:46:26,312 --> 00:46:32,646
[Alpha Trion]<i> But Sentinel never understood
the true power of what he desired.</i>

876
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:36,716
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

877
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:41,688
<i>by one that Primus
himself deems worthy.</i>

878
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,397
<i>And Sentinel most
certainly was not.</i>

879
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,465
No!

880
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:58,771
Wait. Hold on. You're saying that the
Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

881
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,443
No.

882
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:02,852
No, no, no. That is
impossible. I don't believe it.

883
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,711
Why would Sentinel do that?

884
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:06,317
To make a bargain.

885
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:08,253
A bargain? With who?

886
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:10,992
[deep rumbling]

887
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:14,490
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

888
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,464
[Orion] The Quintessons.

889
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:22,696
[Elita] There are so many.

890
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:25,534
[electronic whirring]

891
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,027
He's here.

892
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,261
Sentinel Prime is here.

893
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,346
[warbling]

894
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,712
[chittering]

895
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:25,396
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

896
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,316
[gasping]

897
00:48:45,946 --> 00:48:47,385
[guttural chittering]

898
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:07,977
[Elita] I load those crates.

899
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,408
Those are filled with
contaminated metal.

900
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:12,113
I don't understand.

901
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,742
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

902
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:21,089
Our Energon.

903
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:29,295
Traitor! D, no.

904
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:39,976
[grunts, groans]

905
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:44,475
[straining] I know
what I promised you

906
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,610
but our mines,
they're running out!

907
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:49,810
There's barely enough
Energon for us.

908
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:52,384
[roars]

909
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:54,617
I swear I will get you the rest.

910
00:50:00,328 --> 00:50:02,163
Triple-time every mining shift.

911
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:04,858
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

912
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:06,530
All of it! Let's go.

913
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:17,970
[ship rumbling]

914
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:26,385
Now you have seen the truth.

915
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:31,324
Every day...

916
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,924
Every single day of my life

917
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,498
has been a lie.

918
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:42,995
My God, I knew it!

919
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,866
Deep down, I always
felt something was off.

920
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:48,374
He deceived everyone.

921
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:53,544
Sentinel bought himself power and then
put us to work paying off his debt.

922
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:55,315
I can't believe it.

923
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,844
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

924
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,681
I just saw it, but I still...

925
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:00,716
I can't believe it.

926
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:03,719
Sentinel lied

927
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,853
to my face. [Orion]
It was all a sham.

928
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:08,691
How could we have
been so gullible?

929
00:51:08,726 --> 00:51:12,332
Oh, this... this is going
to change everything.

930
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:13,729
[thudding]

931
00:51:13,764 --> 00:51:15,236
[grunting]

932
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:19,339
You just had to
do it, didn't you?

933
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,671
Me? What did I do?

934
00:51:21,706 --> 00:51:23,508
You just had to
go to the surface,

935
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:25,543
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

936
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:28,117
You just had to break protocol!

937
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:30,383
Who cares about
protocol? I do!

938
00:51:30,946 --> 00:51:32,550
I care!

939
00:51:32,585 --> 00:51:35,190
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

940
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,686
Sentinel Prime has
been forcing us

941
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,051
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

942
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:42,758
and all the while he's been giving the
Energon away to our greatest enemies!

943
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:45,761
And what do you think he's going to do
to us when he finds out that we know?

944
00:51:45,796 --> 00:51:47,862
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

945
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,537
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

946
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:51,305
That's the whole thing!

947
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,703
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

948
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:58,037
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master
plan. I can't wait to hear this.

949
00:51:58,072 --> 00:51:59,412
Don't you want to stop him?

950
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:01,315
No, I want to kill him!

951
00:52:02,582 --> 00:52:04,252
I want to put Sentinel in chains

952
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,913
and march him through the mines

953
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:09,455
so everyone can see him for
the false Prime that he is!

954
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:13,393
I want him to suffer and
then to die in darkness.

955
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,099
But we all know that
it doesn't matter

956
00:52:16,123 --> 00:52:17,727
what I want, right, Pax?

957
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:21,335
The fact is, we're just
cogless bots. Right?

958
00:52:22,998 --> 00:52:28,177
[D-16 chuckles bitterly] We had limited
options, and now... now we have none.

959
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:34,447
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

960
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:37,384
Oh, yeah. I've been with
myself since I came online,

961
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:40,354
and this slot's
always been empty.

962
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:42,389
What are you saying?
Are you saying...

963
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:45,986
No. No way. Nobody could be
that evil, not even Sentinel.

964
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:50,430
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

965
00:52:50,465 --> 00:52:55,633
We were born with
transformation cogs, but he...

966
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:57,602
He took them from us.

967
00:52:57,637 --> 00:53:00,836
What defines a
Transformer... [grunts]

968
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:03,311
is not the cog in his chest

969
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:08,349
but the spark that
resides in their core.

970
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:13,684
A spark that gives you the
will to make your world better.

971
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:18,183
My fellow Primes had that spark.

972
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:22,231
And I see their strength in you.

973
00:53:23,795 --> 00:53:30,305
Take their cogs and access
your full potential.

974
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,439
Prima.

975
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:34,969
Onyx.

976
00:53:35,576 --> 00:53:37,103
Alchemist.

977
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,314
Micronus.

978
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:45,144
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

979
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,148
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

980
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:54,725
[electronic whirring]

981
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,274
[electronic whirring continues]

982
00:54:16,012 --> 00:54:20,421
They were one. You are one.

983
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:23,292
All are one!

984
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:39,935
Wait. We have...
You... You gave us...

985
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,444
The ability to
change your world.

986
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:48,614
How you choose to use
that power is up to you.

987
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,716
[laughs]

988
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:53,553
[heavy thud]

989
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:54,884
They've found us.

990
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:57,590
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!

991
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:01,462
No. You must return to Iacon
City and alert everyone.

992
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:07,963
Embedded in this are the
records I have shown you.

993
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:10,438
Use it to reveal the truth.

994
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:12,803
We will.

995
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:14,937
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

996
00:55:14,972 --> 00:55:17,808
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

997
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:19,304
[thudding boom]
We're out of time.

998
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:20,943
We got to move!

999
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:23,715
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

1000
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,278
Your fight will come, my friend.

1001
00:55:26,313 --> 00:55:29,655
Primus has a purpose for us all.

1002
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,591
But this fight...
[heavy booming thud]

1003
00:55:31,626 --> 00:55:33,494
This fight is mine.

1004
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,991
Now go! [thudding continues]

1005
00:55:47,004 --> 00:55:48,410
Stand down, old timer.

1006
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,413
Ah. Old, you say?

1007
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,349
[rumbling]

1008
00:55:58,114 --> 00:55:59,388
[laserfire pulsing]

1009
00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:06,186
[roars]

1010
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,390
[electrical crackling]

1011
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:15,932
[laserfire pulsing]

1012
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,230
[roars]

1013
00:56:21,236 --> 00:56:23,203
Not too old for you.

1014
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:27,240
[roaring]

1015
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:30,210
We need to hurry!

1016
00:56:30,245 --> 00:56:31,915
I still think we
have better odds

1017
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,686
fighting than outrunning them.

1018
00:56:33,721 --> 00:56:36,722
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

1019
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:39,692
That's right. Everyone
ready? I was born ready.

1020
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:41,353
On three. One...

1021
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:43,025
[all yelling]

1022
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:47,227
[faint yelling, grunting]

1023
00:56:49,935 --> 00:56:50,935
Ah!

1024
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,443
[laserfire pulsing]

1025
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:56,643
[grunting]

1026
00:56:56,678 --> 00:56:58,172
How do we use these things?

1027
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,108
I don't know. Just try.

1028
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:02,011
[straining]

1029
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:04,684
It's working. Ha! It's working!

1030
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:06,521
My head! My head!

1031
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,588
Whoa!

1032
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,425
Help! Help!

1033
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:16,630
This is not faster!

1034
00:57:18,029 --> 00:57:19,765
[yells, grunts]

1035
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,536
Oh, come on!

1036
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:24,638
And transform!

1037
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,937
[yelling]

1038
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,675
Wheels! I need wheels!

1039
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,140
[laserfire pulsing]

1040
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:35,682
[Elita yelling]

1041
00:57:38,478 --> 00:57:39,478
Whoa.

1042
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,089
[audio slows]

1043
00:57:47,124 --> 00:57:49,663
[mechanical whirring]

1044
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:54,294
[B-127 yelling]

1045
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:02,643
[mechanical whirring]
Ha! [grunts]

1046
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:05,580
[grunts, laughs]

1047
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,109
Oh, wow.

1048
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,660
We're alive! I've
never moved that fast.

1049
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:11,443
That was incredible! Did
you see me slide all over?

1050
00:58:11,478 --> 00:58:13,247
[overlapping chatter]

1051
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,556
[laser blast]

1052
00:58:15,218 --> 00:58:17,482
[engine humming]

1053
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:18,659
[mechanical whirring]

1054
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:19,891
Yes!

1055
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:22,927
[laughing deliriously]

1056
00:58:22,962 --> 00:58:24,489
Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?

1057
00:58:24,524 --> 00:58:28,163
I'm great. Are you kidding
me? We can transform!

1058
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:30,330
We transform!

1059
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:31,969
Oh, hey! I know.

1060
00:58:32,004 --> 00:58:34,070
We're wasting time. We
have to get back to Iacon.

1061
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:35,269
Looks like the fastest way

1062
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,007
back to Iacon is...
Here, I got it.

1063
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,503
Hey, what are you doing?

1064
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:40,219
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

1065
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:43,046
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

1066
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:49,723
I... got... it.

1067
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:52,990
Okay.

1068
00:58:56,897 --> 00:58:58,259
Follow me.

1069
00:59:04,003 --> 00:59:05,200
[wheezes]

1070
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:07,367
Alpha Trion!

1071
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:10,205
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

1072
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:13,010
You look horrible.

1073
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:18,147
Traitor. You are a disgrace.

1074
00:59:18,182 --> 00:59:21,414
Primus will surely...
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1075
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:25,220
I seized an opportunity to
take control of my future.

1076
00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:26,705
Anything to get out
of working for you

1077
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,059
and that boring
council of elders.

1078
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:31,259
Seriously, I would
watch you Primes

1079
00:59:31,294 --> 00:59:33,393
spend half the day losing a war

1080
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:38,233
and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

1081
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:39,531
And now look at you.

1082
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:43,370
Hear my words: You will fall.

1083
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,438
And a new Prime will rise...

1084
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:46,978
There you go again.

1085
00:59:47,013 --> 00:59:49,915
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

1086
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,246
[groans]

1087
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:52,731
There were others in
the cave with you.

1088
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,787
Who are they?

1089
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:56,922
They are to be your undoing.

1090
00:59:56,957 --> 01:00:01,355
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do...

1091
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,929
[pained grunt]
[electrical crackling]

1092
01:00:05,064 --> 01:00:06,228
[body thuds]

1093
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:10,463
Oh, didn't I just
say no speeches?

1094
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:12,102
You heard me, right?

1095
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:14,533
This is what I'm talking
about. Unbelievable.

1096
01:00:14,568 --> 01:00:17,437
All of them are like
that. So disrespectful.

1097
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:19,043
[sighs]

1098
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:21,276
Okay. Hunt down the others.

1099
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:22,618
With pleasure.

1100
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:34,454
[engines humming]

1101
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:40,460
Hey, buddy.

1102
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:42,495
Oh. Hey.

1103
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:47,302
You've been a little
quiet. Are you all right?

1104
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:51,636
All I can think about is
Sentinel's smirking face.

1105
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:55,475
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1106
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:59,688
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth.

1107
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:02,790
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

1108
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,792
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

1109
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,058
They worship Sentinel.

1110
01:01:07,093 --> 01:01:09,093
There's got to be a better
way to bring him down.

1111
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:11,799
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

1112
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,900
I trusted Sentinel!

1113
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:15,594
With everything.

1114
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:22,073
I will never trust a
so-called leader ever again.

1115
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:26,407
There's only one bot
I know I can trust...

1116
01:01:26,442 --> 01:01:27,606
[electrical crackling]

1117
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:28,915
[grunting]

1118
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,279
[electronic sputtering]

1119
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:39,255
[voice] All right, wake them up.

1120
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,685
[gasps]

1121
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,258
[breathes heavily]

1122
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:48,462
[grunts]

1123
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:05,446
Now, are you spies

1124
01:02:06,581 --> 01:02:09,758
or just incompetent lackeys?

1125
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,585
We're not spies. But
he is incompetent.

1126
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,930
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1127
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:21,495
That just means he believes
himself, like any spy would.

1128
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,497
[muffled indistinct speech]

1129
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:26,038
Uh, why is he gagged?

1130
01:02:26,073 --> 01:02:27,732
He wouldn't stop talking.

1131
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:29,283
[muffled speech continues]
Even when he was unconscious?

1132
01:02:29,307 --> 01:02:31,505
Especially when he
was unconscious!

1133
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,748
Enough!

1134
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:35,344
Two options for you!

1135
01:02:35,379 --> 01:02:40,052
One, we slowly dismantle each of
you one bolt and screw at a time,

1136
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:42,714
and really make
sure you feel it.

1137
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:43,858
Or two:

1138
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,651
In exchange for a quick death,

1139
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:48,093
you give us intel on
the Energon trains,

1140
01:02:48,128 --> 01:02:50,095
access to the mines

1141
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,802
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1142
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:55,331
Who exactly are you guys?

1143
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:57,036
[muffled grunting, straining]

1144
01:02:57,071 --> 01:02:58,103
Ah!

1145
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:01,172
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1146
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:03,075
[growls] I told you it
wasn't tight enough!

1147
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,210
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon. Prestigious?

1148
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:08,949
He's right. I read all
about you in the archives.

1149
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:12,381
You were the most legendary
warriors in all of Cybertron.

1150
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,185
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

1151
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,089
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

1152
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:19,729
Raise your hand if "wave" is in
your name. There's a lot of "waves."

1153
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:21,291
Silence!

1154
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:23,425
The yellow annoying
one is correct.

1155
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,426
Whoo!

1156
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:26,263
We were once the High Guard.

1157
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:30,003
We witnessed Sentinel's
betrayal, saw the Primes fall.

1158
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:32,907
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1159
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,635
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1160
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,373
That's great! We're...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1161
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:41,080
Okay, okay. We're
good. Everyone relax.

1162
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:43,577
I'm just saying we're allies.

1163
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,645
We were on our
way back to Iacon,

1164
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,715
and now with your help, we can unify
Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

1165
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,862
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

1166
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:58,724
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1167
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:00,693
[all cheering]

1168
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:03,597
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

1169
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,533
Yeah. Just a little.

1170
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:06,908
Hey!

1171
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,470
What are you doing?

1172
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,706
I tell you what I'm not doing.

1173
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:17,644
I'm not cowering in some busted
ship, playing king of the throne.

1174
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,844
I'm not pretending like
I'm making a difference

1175
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:22,583
by throwing one punch and
then running away to hide!

1176
01:04:22,618 --> 01:04:24,849
I found out that
Sentinel is rotten today,

1177
01:04:24,884 --> 01:04:26,851
and I'm gonna make
him pay for it.

1178
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:28,358
Today!

1179
01:04:28,393 --> 01:04:31,966
You think you can insult
me and just walk away?

1180
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:36,003
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1181
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,664
[chuckles] Is that right?

1182
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,832
Well, how can you say so

1183
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:42,801
with my head in your teeth?

1184
01:04:42,836 --> 01:04:44,473
[grunts] D!

1185
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:46,871
[grunts] [excited chatter]

1186
01:04:46,906 --> 01:04:48,081
[both grunting]

1187
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:52,415
Whoa!

1188
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:54,054
[grunting] [mechanical whir]

1189
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:55,682
[growls] [grunts]

1190
01:04:57,554 --> 01:04:58,883
Hit me!

1191
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:02,161
Do it! Come on! Yeah,
more! [crowd cheers]

1192
01:05:02,196 --> 01:05:05,692
[laughs]
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1193
01:05:07,894 --> 01:05:12,864
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1194
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:14,943
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1195
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,737
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1196
01:05:17,772 --> 01:05:20,773
[yells angrily]

1197
01:05:20,808 --> 01:05:22,544
[mechanical whirring]

1198
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:31,454
[panting]

1199
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,460
Please! I beg you!

1200
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:40,298
Stop! D, he's not the enemy!

1201
01:05:42,632 --> 01:05:44,764
Bear witness!

1202
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,569
This is the last
time I show mercy!

1203
01:05:47,604 --> 01:05:50,242
Decide right now:

1204
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:54,873
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

1205
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:58,217
or follow me as
we march on Iacon

1206
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:01,781
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1207
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:04,256
[cheers, chanting]

1208
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:08,854
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1209
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,889
[chanting fades]

1210
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:20,008
[distant rumbling]

1211
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,639
[all screaming]

1212
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:30,348
[laserfire pulsing]

1213
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:36,948
B, come on!

1214
01:06:37,522 --> 01:06:39,126
[B-127 yelling]

1215
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,464
[mechanical whirring]

1216
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,836
[grunts]

1217
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:04,745
[Airachnid] Engage all
hostiles! I've got the bridge!

1218
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:23,038
[grunts angrily]

1219
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:25,403
[D-16 yelling]

1220
01:07:29,343 --> 01:07:30,870
[mechanical whirring]

1221
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:34,512
[grunts]

1222
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:37,515
Elita, get down!

1223
01:07:41,454 --> 01:07:42,519
[grunts]

1224
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:58,964
[Orion coughs, clears throat]

1225
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:02,671
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1226
01:08:02,706 --> 01:08:05,212
[groans] Where are the others?

1227
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,007
Sentinel's troops took as many
prisoners as they could carry.

1228
01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:10,811
They got D-16 and B.

1229
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:12,681
Oh, no.

1230
01:08:12,716 --> 01:08:15,255
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1231
01:08:16,115 --> 01:08:17,257
[sighs]

1232
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:18,984
Our proof.

1233
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:20,425
It's gone.

1234
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:23,560
So, what do we do now?

1235
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:25,166
D was right.

1236
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,762
About what? Everything.

1237
01:08:27,797 --> 01:08:31,403
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1238
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:33,141
It's all my fault.

1239
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,066
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1240
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:37,574
[sighs]

1241
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:44,746
Listen to me. I really
want you to hear this.

1242
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:45,813
Are you listening?

1243
01:08:48,422 --> 01:08:49,817
I'm better than you.

1244
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:52,457
Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you.

1245
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,086
I'm better than
you in every way,

1246
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:57,594
except you have hope.

1247
01:08:57,629 --> 01:09:01,301
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1248
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:05,272
You snuck up to the surface to
find the Matrix of Leadership.

1249
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,098
[chuckles] Yeah, and
how'd that work out?

1250
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:08,869
My point is,

1251
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:13,137
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1252
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:16,250
This blind optimism
that you have

1253
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:20,617
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1254
01:09:21,686 --> 01:09:23,488
that are also extremely stupid.

1255
01:09:23,523 --> 01:09:26,051
First time giving a pep talk?

1256
01:09:26,086 --> 01:09:27,822
You're inspiring.

1257
01:09:27,857 --> 01:09:31,199
You can envision a better
future that no one else can see.

1258
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,302
And if we ever want to
see B and D-16 again,

1259
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:39,339
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1260
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:41,572
Listen to me.

1261
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:43,673
We can do this.

1262
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,349
Those Energon trains will
be heading back to Iacon.

1263
01:09:49,384 --> 01:09:52,077
If we intercepted one...

1264
01:09:52,112 --> 01:09:55,289
Hell yes, I can reroute
it. What else do we need?

1265
01:09:55,324 --> 01:10:00,019
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1266
01:10:02,056 --> 01:10:04,364
I was afraid you'd say that.

1267
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:07,961
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1268
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:11,239
In order to save our captured
friends, we have to act now.

1269
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,538
How about I blast
you back to Iacon?

1270
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:16,970
[pained grunt] Oh! She
punched me in my eye!

1271
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:20,215
Everyone, shut up! All
of you. Listen to him.

1272
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,043
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1273
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:25,715
at the top of Sentinel's tower.

1274
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,751
A surprise attack would give
us a chance to rescue them.

1275
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:33,723
Impossible. We do not have
enough soldiers or a way inside.

1276
01:10:33,758 --> 01:10:36,891
Elita will get us in. And
I will get more troops.

1277
01:10:36,926 --> 01:10:38,530
Why should we follow you?

1278
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:41,368
We will follow you.

1279
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,602
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1280
01:10:44,637 --> 01:10:46,637
What is our first move?

1281
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:47,803
[quietly] We roll out.

1282
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,410
What?

1283
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:51,840
Louder.

1284
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:54,282
[boldly] Transform
and roll out!

1285
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:07,823
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1286
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:11,431
Look at this rowdy
bunch! The High Guard!

1287
01:11:11,466 --> 01:11:13,301
You know, you guys have
been tough to find.

1288
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:16,898
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1289
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:19,439
Tracking the bots in the
cave led me right to them.

1290
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:20,770
Oh-ho-ho!

1291
01:11:20,805 --> 01:11:23,707
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

1292
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,907
[high-pitch] I'm going to
rip you apart piece by piece

1293
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:27,422
so that your death
is painful! [laughs]

1294
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,723
You'll regret the
day you were...

1295
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,681
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1296
01:11:30,716 --> 01:11:33,717
Oh, D-16, what a
tragic story you'll be.

1297
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:37,622
Atop the leaderboard in your
sector and secretly a traitor.

1298
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:39,723
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1299
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,462
Nuh-uh. You, all of
you, are traitors.

1300
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:46,158
You've been working with the
Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions.

1301
01:11:46,193 --> 01:11:48,611
You're the reason why I haven't
found the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1302
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:49,898
None of that is true!

1303
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,504
Oh, trust me, it'll be very true

1304
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:54,441
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1305
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:58,269
Because down here, the
truth is what I make it.

1306
01:11:58,304 --> 01:11:59,314
[thud reverberates]

1307
01:12:07,016 --> 01:12:09,423
Well, well. What's this about?

1308
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:12,987
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1309
01:12:13,022 --> 01:12:14,956
Feeling confident, are we?

1310
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:18,190
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1311
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:19,290
Please.

1312
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,536
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1313
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,703
You took it all.

1314
01:12:27,069 --> 01:12:28,442
I sure did.

1315
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:29,839
[grunts]

1316
01:12:29,874 --> 01:12:31,511
[gasps] [groans]

1317
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:33,909
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1318
01:12:35,308 --> 01:12:38,386
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1319
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,279
The biggest! The
baddest! The toughest!

1320
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,755
That's why, after I killed him,

1321
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:48,022
I took his cog for myself.

1322
01:12:48,057 --> 01:12:50,530
He was greater than
you'll ever be!

1323
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:52,829
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1324
01:12:52,864 --> 01:12:55,700
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1325
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:56,767
Here.

1326
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:01,233
Let's make sure it
doesn't come off.

1327
01:13:01,268 --> 01:13:02,773
[electrical crackling]

1328
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:06,007
[pained shouts, groans]

1329
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,529
Okay. [sighs]

1330
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,092
[stammers] I can do this.

1331
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:42,241
[miner] You can't be serious. We just
worked 22 shifts without a break!

1332
01:13:42,276 --> 01:13:43,990
These miners need rest
and time to repair and...

1333
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:46,278
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1334
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:49,721
So get back in the mines before
I make you get back in the...

1335
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:50,887
[aggressive thud]

1336
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:55,386
[triumphant electronic jingle]

1337
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:57,388
Who was that? Did
you see who that was?

1338
01:13:57,423 --> 01:13:58,598
[miner] That can't be him.

1339
01:13:58,633 --> 01:13:59,698
[Jazz] Is that...

1340
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,393
It can't be.

1341
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:04,934
Orion? Jazz.

1342
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:06,364
Is it really you?

1343
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:08,773
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1344
01:14:08,808 --> 01:14:10,368
"Little"?

1345
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:12,205
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1346
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,075
Uh, how is this possible?

1347
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,913
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1348
01:14:17,751 --> 01:14:19,883
Sentinel is a liar.

1349
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:21,918
What? Huh?

1350
01:14:21,953 --> 01:14:24,085
Look, I know how this
will sound coming from me.

1351
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,594
I was never the
most focused miner.

1352
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,058
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1353
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:31,961
[mechanical whirring]

1354
01:14:37,903 --> 01:14:42,136
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1355
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,271
My friends,

1356
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:49,374
we were all born with
transformation cogs.

1357
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,587
And then Sentinel, he
stole them from us.

1358
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,986
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1359
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:59,153
He stole our freedom.

1360
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:08,800
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1361
01:15:08,835 --> 01:15:12,936
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1362
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:17,468
or fight back against
Sentinel with me.

1363
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,141
Right now.

1364
01:15:20,176 --> 01:15:23,518
How are we supposed to do that? We
can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1365
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:29,788
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1366
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:32,758
but the spark that
resides in their core.

1367
01:15:32,793 --> 01:15:36,927
A spark that gives you the
will to make your world better.

1368
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:40,799
And that spark, Sentinel
can never take from us.

1369
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:43,197
There's not enough of
us. We'd need an army.

1370
01:15:43,232 --> 01:15:46,970
And we have one. Elita
is bringing troops.

1371
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:49,038
We are not alone in this.

1372
01:15:49,073 --> 01:15:51,843
If we want to be in
control of our own destiny,

1373
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:53,504
we will have to fight for it.

1374
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:56,881
Now is the time for
us to stand up...

1375
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,883
[supportive chatter]
for ourselves.

1376
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:00,313
[scattered cheers]

1377
01:16:01,217 --> 01:16:03,151
Stand up for this injustice.

1378
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:05,351
[cheers growing]

1379
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:09,058
I promise you this
fight will be worth it.

1380
01:16:09,995 --> 01:16:11,731
Follow me.

1381
01:16:11,766 --> 01:16:14,635
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1385
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,504
You got it.

1386
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:28,781
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1389
01:16:42,192 --> 01:16:43,422
Not a good idea.

1390
01:16:45,591 --> 01:16:47,767
[whispering] D,
stay down. [groans]

1391
01:16:59,572 --> 01:17:01,407
Well, that's a shame.
[mechanical whirs]

1392
01:17:01,442 --> 01:17:03,376
You really were a great miner.

1393
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:10,317
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

[grunts]

1395
01:17:19,559 --> 01:17:22,131
They spotted us. It's
about to get bumpy.

1396
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:24,771
High Guard, eject.

1397
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,740
Come on! Move out!

1399
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:43,757

too many. We have to abort!

1401

01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:54,295
Whoo-hoo!

1404
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,901
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1405
01:17:55,936 --> 01:17:57,661
Let's break some protocol!

1406
01:17:57,696 --> 01:17:59,432
[Elita] That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1411
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,957
That's right, you do.

1412
01:18:18,992 --> 01:18:21,696
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1413

[Orion] Hey!

1416
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:48,987
What has he done to you?

1417
01:18:49,022 --> 01:18:51,858
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1418
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,059
[Orion] Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1419

[electronic throbbing]

1420
01:18:59,725 --> 01:19:02,066
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1421
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:03,837
I'm doing this my way. D!

1422
01:19:09,372 --> 01:19:10,404
Yes!

1423
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:11,471
Whoa! [metal clangs]

1424
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:13,011
Whoa-ho-ho!

1425
01:19:13,046 --> 01:19:14,375

Elita! Battle mask!

01:19:18,084 --> 01:19:21,019
It appeared when
this guy tried to...

1429
01:19:21,054 --> 01:19:23,054
Knife hands? I
have knife hands!

1430
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:27,124
What the...?

1431
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:30,127

1432

[deep voice] Badassatron.

1433
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:39,136
Where's Sentinel? [both grunt]

1434
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:43,943
[Sentinel] You
pathetic little twits.

1435
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:48,277
Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?

1436
01:19:48,312 --> 01:19:52,116
It's over, Sentinel. You can't escape
the truth. [Sentinel] What truth?

1437
01:19:52,151 --> 01:19:54,822
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1438
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:57,033
Forced you to mine so that I
could pay off the Quintessons

1439
01:19:57,057 --> 01:19:58,386
and live like a king?

1440
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:01,389
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1441
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:05,393
[mechanical whirring]
is what I make it.

1442
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:08,595

1445

He's too strong.
I have a plan.

1446
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,275
We need Airachnid. Airachnid?

1447
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,541
We need her memory.
Where is she?

1448
01:20:21,576 --> 01:20:23,147
Found her! [yells]

1449
01:20:24,678 --> 01:20:25,678
Elita!

1450
01:20:26,515 --> 01:20:27,921
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1451
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,263
<i>Bring her to the
broadcast station.</i>

1452

<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1458
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,989
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1459
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,584
I can see that.

1460
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:06,784
I'm gonna cut these
guys. Watch. Come here!

1461
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:08,654
You can jab them
later. We got to go.

1462
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,032

B!

1469
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:46,329
These are not the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

1470
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:48,969
What? No, I didn't...
That was an... I...

1471
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:50,597
It was already
like that. Right?

1472
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:51,950
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:12,913
All of it!

1558
01:28:18,316 --> 01:28:21,493
All hail Megatron!

1559
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,893
He's gonna kill everyone. We
have to stop him. Come on.

1560
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,094
Stop! It's over.

1561
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:32,867
It's over when every last
one of his followers is dead!

1562
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,506
[grunts]

1563
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:07,803
Impossible.

1564
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:14,337
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1565
01:29:14,372 --> 01:29:16,548
We could've built
the future together.

1566
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:18,583
I'll build it myself.

1567
01:29:18,618 --> 01:29:22,180
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1568
01:29:23,557 --> 01:29:25,018
[roars]

1569
01:29:40,068 --> 01:29:41,068
[pained grunt]

1570
01:29:42,367 --> 01:29:43,542
[roars]

1571
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:01,923
[electronic charging]

1572
01:30:03,762 --> 01:30:04,794
Ah!

1573
01:30:06,864 --> 01:30:08,061
[growling]

1574
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:11,768
[both grunting]

1575
01:30:13,035 --> 01:30:14,936
[powering up]

1576
01:30:19,778 --> 01:30:21,107
[yells]

1577
01:30:48,433 --> 01:30:49,905
[roars]

1578
01:31:00,984 --> 01:31:03,754
[panting heavily]

1579
01:31:06,924 --> 01:31:10,123
We were given the power
to change our world

1580
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:12,631
and you chose to destroy it.

1581
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,094
Just like Sentinel.

1582
01:31:14,129 --> 01:31:17,966
You have betrayed
Cybertron and its citizens.

1583
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,432
And you betrayed me.

1584
01:31:33,511 --> 01:31:34,587
Go.

1585
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:38,118
Take the High Guard and leave.

1586
01:31:39,352 --> 01:31:42,958
You are banished from Iacon.

1587
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,163
It didn't have to end this way.

1588
01:31:52,497 --> 01:31:55,971
This isn't over, Prime.

1589
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,882
High Guard, follow me!

1590
01:32:19,491 --> 01:32:22,030
[Optimus Prime]<i> The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1591
01:32:22,065 --> 01:32:25,198
<i>is not as clear as
I once believed.</i>

1592
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:29,136
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

1593
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:33,173
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1594
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:35,043
[Orion] Hey,
Megatronus Prime. Nice.

1595
01:32:35,078 --> 01:32:37,210
Oh, yeah. Well, he's my hero.

1596
01:32:37,245 --> 01:32:39,047
[both] The greatest
Prime to ever live.

1597
01:32:39,082 --> 01:32:40,785
[both laugh]

1598
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,546
I'm D-16. Orion Pax.

1599
01:32:43,581 --> 01:32:45,955
You ever mine Energon before?

1600
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:47,352
No. You?

1601
01:32:47,387 --> 01:32:49,563
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1602
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:51,664
Well, I'll tell you what.

1603
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:54,194
You watch my back, I
promise to watch yours.

1604
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:55,393
All right.

1605
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,231
Thanks, Pax.

1606
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:13,576
A new beginning for Cybertron.

1607
01:33:13,611 --> 01:33:15,688
And a new leader.

1608
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:17,690
Yes, about that.

1609
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:22,695
I could use some help from a bot
who is better than me in every way.

1610
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,664
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1611
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,062
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1612
01:33:27,097 --> 01:33:30,065
Well, Captain, I do
owe you a promotion.

1613
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,837
How's Major Elita sound?

1614
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:35,400
How about Commander?

1615
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:37,369
[chuckles] Even better.

1616
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:41,340
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot
let you go back to sublevel 50.

1617
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,177
I may be a Prime now,

1618
01:33:43,212 --> 01:33:44,915
but I'm gonna need
you by my side.

1619
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:48,413
Are you serious? This is
the greatest day of my life.

1620
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:50,613
I get to work for
the government.

1621
01:33:50,648 --> 01:33:54,254
[shimmering tone]
Okay. So that's new.

1622
01:33:54,289 --> 01:33:55,926
I'm sorry, what is happening?

1623
01:34:07,368 --> 01:34:09,401
[all cheering]

1624
01:34:26,354 --> 01:34:30,092
[Optimus Prime] <i>And now we
stand here together as one...</i>

1625
01:34:32,492 --> 01:34:35,625
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1626
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,870
<i>to become who we
were destined to be,</i>

1627
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:43,567
<i>to right wrongs, to
make our world better.</i>

1628
01:34:43,602 --> 01:34:46,746
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i>

1629
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:49,474
<i>are the rights of
all sentient beings.</i>

1630
01:34:50,576 --> 01:34:55,051
<i>Here, all are truly Autobots.</i>

1631
01:34:56,516 --> 01:35:00,122
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1632
01:35:00,157 --> 01:35:05,523
<i>If you dare return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1633
01:35:05,558 --> 01:35:08,460
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1634
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:12,299
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1635
01:35:38,723 --> 01:35:40,162
[door opens] [rapid footsteps]

1636
01:35:40,197 --> 01:35:42,659
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1637
01:35:42,694 --> 01:35:44,936
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1638
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:46,872
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1639
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:50,436
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1640
01:35:50,471 --> 01:35:52,273
Watch this. Knife hands!

1641
01:35:54,178 --> 01:35:55,210
No!

1642
01:43:20,052 --> 01:43:23,955
[Megatron] <i>Sentinel
the betrayer is dead.</i>

1643
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:27,695
<i>But his death has given
life to a new enemy.</i>

1644
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,895
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1645
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:32,029
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1646
01:43:33,164 --> 01:43:37,342
<i>We will not be blinded
by his deception.</i>

1647
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:40,004
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1648
01:43:40,842 --> 01:43:42,842
Decepticons!

1649
01:43:42,877 --> 01:43:44,679
Rise up!

1650
01:43:44,714 --> 01:43:48,177
[all] Rise up! Rise up!

1651
01:43:48,212 --> 01:43:49,651
