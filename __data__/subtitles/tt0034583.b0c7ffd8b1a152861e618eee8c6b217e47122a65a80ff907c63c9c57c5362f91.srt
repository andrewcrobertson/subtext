We also know what you did in Paris.

And also we know why you left Paris.

stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

for the fox?

Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,373
until the day we marched in.

413
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:57,919
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal Sheets in his cellar.

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,006
Of course, one must admit
he has great Courage.

I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

834
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:05,578
Signor Ugarte is dead.

835
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,712
I'm making out the report now.

836
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:13,965
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

837
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:17,469
or died trying to escape.

838
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,388
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

839
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,001
Good day.

840
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:29,064
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

841
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,315
Excuse me, Captain.

842
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:33,777
Another visa problem has come up.

843
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:38,778
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

844
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:48,583
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

845
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:51,503
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

846
00:54:51,504 --> 00:54:53,880
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

847
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,716
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

848
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:59,469
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

849
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:04,470
MAN: Thanks.

850
00:55:12,984 --> 00:55:14,568
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

851
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:16,820
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

852
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:18,321
Thank you very much, signor.

853
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:20,907
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

854
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:23,285
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

855
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,495
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

856
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:26,955
I never drink in the morning.

857
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,874
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

858
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,002
Carrying Charges, my boy.
Carrying Charges.

859
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:33,503
Here, sit down.

860
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:36,339
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

861
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,216
Bourbon.

862
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:40,343
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

863
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:43,930
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

864
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,891
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

865
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:49,102
and no one knows where
those letters are.

866
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:50,604
Practically no one.

867
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:53,148
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

868
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,400
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

869
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:57,861
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

870
00:55:57,862 --> 00:55:59,571
I'll handle the entire transaction.

871
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:02,490
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

872
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,159
And the carrying Charges?

873
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,621
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

874
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:10,206
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

875
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:11,916
I'll tell him when he comes in.

876
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,836
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

877
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:19,837
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

878
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:26,931
That's why I came here. To give
them a Chance to ransack my place.

879
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:30,435
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

880
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:35,436
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

881
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:37,150
LASZLO: Morning.

882
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:42,151
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

883
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:47,243
MAN: You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

884
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:48,745
Only 700 francs.

885
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:52,082
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

886
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,418
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

887
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:58,088
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

888
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:01,883
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

889
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,093
Doesn't matter.

890
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:07,222
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

891
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,433
Your story had me a little Confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

892
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:12,227
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

893
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,105
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

894
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:18,900
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

895
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:20,110
Yes.

896
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,696
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

897
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:24,406
I don't think I Will, Rick.

898
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,117
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

899
00:57:27,118 --> 00:57:28,868
I think I'm entitled to know.

900
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:31,746
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

901
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:35,125
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

902
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:39,254
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

903
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:43,425
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

904
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:47,637
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

905
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,097
If we leave it that way...

906
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,934
maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

907
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:54,728
Not last night.

908
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:58,148
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

909
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:01,192
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

910
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:03,111
You can believe that if you want to.

911
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,989
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

912
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,991
Above a saloon, it's true...

914
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:13,413
I'll be expecting you.

915
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:16,374
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

916
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:19,627
You'll be there.

917
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:22,088
No, Rick.

918
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:25,383
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

919
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:30,384
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

920
00:58:33,517 --> 00:58:38,271
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
Unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

921
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:40,356
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

922
00:58:40,357 --> 00:58:43,276
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

923
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:45,111
I am influential and respected.

924
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:48,698
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

925
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:50,992
You, however, are a different matter.

926
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:55,789
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

927
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:59,125
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

928
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:02,545
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

929
00:59:02,546 --> 00:59:04,547
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

930
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:08,468
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

931
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:10,762
We are only interested in two visas.

932
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:13,389
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

933
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,642
You two will want to discuss this.

934
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:20,643
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

935
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:23,441
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

936
00:59:23,442 --> 00:59:27,070
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

937
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:29,030
But if the situation were different...

938
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:31,741
if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

939
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:34,244
would you take it?

940
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:36,579
Yes, I would.

941
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,915
Yes, I see.

942
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:43,002
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

943
00:59:43,003 --> 00:59:45,338
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

944
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:50,339
and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

945
00:59:50,344 --> 00:59:55,306
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

946
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:57,976
I love you very much, Ilsa.

947
00:59:57,977 --> 01:00:01,145
Your secret will be safe with me.

948
01:00:01,146 --> 01:00:03,439
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

949
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,440
Not more than 50 francs.

950
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:12,448
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

951
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:15,994
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

952
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:18,121
Well, good luck, but be careful.

953
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:21,291
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

954
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,544
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

955
01:00:24,545 --> 01:00:27,422
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

956
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,507
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

957
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:32,802
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

958
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,012
Yes, something.

959
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:37,390
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

960
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:39,601
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

961
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:43,313
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

962
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:44,522
Rick?

963
01:00:44,523 --> 01:00:47,942
A difficult Customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,153
But it is worth a Chance.

That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

982
01:01:57,388 --> 01:01:59,847
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

to be especially destructive.

Rick, have you got

Louis, are you Pro-Vichy

1171
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:08,325
what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1172
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:10,619
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

- Yes, much too good a time.

This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

- Under safe conduct from me.

in the concentration camp here.

Please don't go
to the Underground meeting tonight.

1200
01:16:01,064 --> 01:16:02,314
I must.

1201
01:16:02,315 --> 01:16:05,943
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

you would carry on.

about Rick? What did you find out?

- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

But no intention of selling them.

You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1211

Did he give any reason?

- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1214

01:19:03,204 --> 01:19:05,622
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

- I will.

- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1244
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:22,180
I won't.

1246
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:29,392
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1247
01:19:42,618 --> 01:19:46,204
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1248
01:19:46,205 --> 01:19:49,708
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1249
01:19:49,709 --> 01:19:51,126
Well, won't you sit down?

1250
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:55,213
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1251
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:58,717
Your visit isn't connected
by any Chance with the letters of transit?

1252
01:19:58,718 --> 01:20:01,595
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1253
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,389
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1254
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:07,517
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1255
01:20:07,518 --> 01:20:09,436
I know how you feel about me...

1256
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:12,355
but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1257
01:20:12,356 --> 01:20:14,983
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1258
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:17,152
what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1259
01:20:17,153 --> 01:20:18,695
It was your cause too.

1260
01:20:18,696 --> 01:20:21,615
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1261
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,534
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1262
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:29,535
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1263
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,126
Richard.

1264
01:20:33,127 --> 01:20:36,838
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1265
01:20:36,839 --> 01:20:39,925
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1266
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:43,553
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1267
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:45,806
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1268
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:50,807
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1269
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:55,982
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1270
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:59,361
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1271
01:20:59,362 --> 01:21:00,737
One woman has hurt you...

1272
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:03,657
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1273
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:08,658
You're a coward and a weakling.

1274
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:13,542
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1275
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:16,670
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1276
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,548
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1277
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:20,757
What of it?

1278
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:25,758
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1279
01:21:30,268 --> 01:21:34,479
Now, if you'll...

1280
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,939
All right.

1281
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,150
I tried to reason with you.

1282
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:40,777
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1283
01:21:40,778 --> 01:21:45,490
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1284
01:21:45,491 --> 01:21:49,202
Put them on the table.

1285
01:21:49,203 --> 01:21:51,371
No.

1286
01:21:51,372 --> 01:21:54,749
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1287
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:59,750
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1288
01:22:00,173 --> 01:22:04,593
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1289
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:09,594
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1290
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,270
Richard...

1291
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:18,023
I tried to stay away.

1292
01:22:18,024 --> 01:22:21,818
I thought I would never see you again.

1293
01:22:21,819 --> 01:22:26,819
That you were out of my life.

1294
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:48,136
The day you left Paris...

1295
01:22:48,137 --> 01:22:51,806
if you knew what I went through.

1296
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:55,477
If you knew how much I loved you.

1297
01:22:55,478 --> 01:23:00,478
How much I still love you.

1298
01:23:12,203 --> 01:23:15,288
And then?

1299
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:19,793
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1300
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,505
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1301
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:25,382
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1302
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:29,177
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1303
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,805
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1304
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,223
Then it came.

1305
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:36,685
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1306
01:23:36,686 --> 01:23:40,605
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1307
01:23:40,606 --> 01:23:42,357
Then I met you.

1308
01:23:42,358 --> 01:23:45,902
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1309
01:23:45,903 --> 01:23:49,197
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1310
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:52,158
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1311
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,328
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1312
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:58,790
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1313
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:00,959
and for those working with us.

1314
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,337
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1315
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:07,048
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1316
01:24:07,049 --> 01:24:09,634
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1317
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:13,096
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1318
01:24:13,097 --> 01:24:16,683
He was sick. He needed me.

1319
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,477
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1320
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:24,478
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1321
01:24:24,483 --> 01:24:26,568
Well...

1322
01:24:26,569 --> 01:24:31,197
well, you know the rest.

1323
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,409
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1324
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,745
What about now?

1325
01:24:36,746 --> 01:24:38,580
N OW?

1326
01:24:38,581 --> 01:24:40,790
I don't know.

1327
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:45,045
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1328
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:46,463
And Laszlo?

1329
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,883
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1330
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:53,386
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1331
01:24:53,387 --> 01:24:56,348
All except one.

1332
01:24:56,349 --> 01:24:59,934
He won't have you.

1333
01:24:59,935 --> 01:25:03,438
I can't fight it anymore.

1334
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,439
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1335
01:25:08,778 --> 01:25:11,988
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1336
01:25:11,989 --> 01:25:15,075
You have to think for both of us.

1337
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:20,076
For all of us.

1338
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:25,081
All right. I Will.

Here's looking at you, kid.

1340
01:25:30,383 --> 01:25:35,383
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1341
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,108
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1342
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,235
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1343
01:25:50,236 --> 01:25:55,236
Come inside.

1344
01:25:55,574 --> 01:26:00,574
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1345
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:05,663
LASZLO: Thank you.

1346
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,225
RICK: Carl, what happened?

1347
01:26:22,226 --> 01:26:24,394
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1348
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:26,062
We escaped at the last moment.

1349
01:26:26,063 --> 01:26:28,523
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1350
01:26:28,524 --> 01:26:32,026
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1351
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:35,447
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1352
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:40,448
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1353
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:50,374
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1354
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:03,141
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1355
01:27:03,142 --> 01:27:05,101
This might come in handy.

1356
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:06,436
Thank you.

1357
01:27:06,437 --> 01:27:11,065
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1358
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:13,985
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1359
01:27:13,986 --> 01:27:16,905
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1360
01:27:16,906 --> 01:27:19,199
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1361
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,909
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1362
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:23,536
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1363
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:25,955
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1364
01:27:25,956 --> 01:27:28,291
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1365
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,668
Like a man
Who's trying to convince himself...

1366
01:27:30,669 --> 01:27:33,087
of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1367
01:27:33,088 --> 01:27:36,758
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1368
01:27:36,759 --> 01:27:39,636
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1369
01:27:39,637 --> 01:27:42,931
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1370
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:44,682
and that you'll never succeed.

1371
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:48,728
You seem to know
all about my destiny.

1372
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:51,689
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1373
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:54,108
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1374
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:56,027
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1375
01:27:56,028 --> 01:27:59,113
that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1376
01:27:59,114 --> 01:28:01,449
The first evening
I came into this café...

1377
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:04,619
I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1378
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,704
Since no one is to blame...

1379
01:28:06,705 --> 01:28:08,873
I demand no explanation.

1380
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:12,335
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1381
01:28:12,336 --> 01:28:14,087
All right.

1382
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,297
But I want my wife to be safe.

1383
01:28:16,298 --> 01:28:17,882
I ask you as a favor...

1384
01:28:17,883 --> 01:28:20,969
to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1385
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:22,303
You love her that much?

1386
01:28:22,304 --> 01:28:25,682
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1387
01:28:25,683 --> 01:28:29,060
Well, I am also a human being.

1388
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:30,812

- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1391
01:28:39,822 --> 01:28:42,490
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1392
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:43,700
On what Charge?

1393
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:46,077
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1394
01:28:46,078 --> 01:28:51,078
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1395
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:04,929
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1396
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:07,390
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1397
01:29:07,391 --> 01:29:09,183
You might as well let him go now.

1398
01:29:09,184 --> 01:29:12,353
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1399
01:29:12,354 --> 01:29:14,022
If you were to help him escape...

1400
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:16,608
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1401
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:19,235
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1402
01:29:19,236 --> 01:29:22,530
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1403
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,783
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1404
01:29:25,784 --> 01:29:27,827
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1405
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:29,370
They're all excellent reasons.

1406
01:29:29,371 --> 01:29:31,497
Don't count too much
on my friendship.

1407
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:35,293
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1408
01:29:35,294 --> 01:29:40,048
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1409
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:41,716
Yes, I have the letters.

1410
01:29:41,717 --> 01:29:43,926
But I intend using them myself.

1411
01:29:43,927 --> 01:29:47,639
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1412
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,892
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1413
01:29:50,893 --> 01:29:53,019
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1414
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:56,773
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1415
01:29:56,774 --> 01:29:59,067
The last man I want to see in America.

1416
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:02,403
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1417
01:30:02,404 --> 01:30:05,740
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1418
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:08,576
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1419
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:13,039
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1420
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,166
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1421
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:17,418
but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1422
01:30:17,419 --> 01:30:19,212
in spite of their legal rights.

1423
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,214
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1424
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:22,423
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1425
01:30:22,424 --> 01:30:25,259
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1426
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,969
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1427
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:30,682
Instead of this petty Charge against him,
you could get something big...

1428
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:34,102
something that would Chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1429
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:36,896
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1430
01:30:36,897 --> 01:30:39,232
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1431
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:40,441
Then release him.

1432
01:30:40,442 --> 01:30:43,277
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1433
01:30:43,278 --> 01:30:45,988
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1434
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:48,866
and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1435
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:51,327
You get him, and we get away.

1436
01:30:51,328 --> 01:30:54,455
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1437
01:30:54,456 --> 01:30:57,458
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:00,294
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1439
01:31:00,295 --> 01:31:02,797
but you were never interested
in any woman.

1440
01:31:02,798 --> 01:31:06,050
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1441
01:31:06,051 --> 01:31:08,636
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1442
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:11,639
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

who has less scruples than I.

Oh, thanks.

01:31:18,313 --> 01:31:19,605
Go ahead, Ricky.

or is a handshake good enough?

1451
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:40,376
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

But he's worth 25.
