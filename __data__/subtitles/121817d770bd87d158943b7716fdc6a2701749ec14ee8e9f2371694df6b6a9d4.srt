about something.

896

But before I do, I...

897
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:33,682
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

898
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:36,388
Okay.

899
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:38,049

done anything to you

00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,800
that might have scared you

902
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,500
or upset you?

903
00:53:54,336 --> 00:53:55,540
Uh...

904
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,102

I see things.
[breath trembling]

910

And I can't tell
if they're real or not.

Listen to me.

912
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:28,366
When I was younger,

913
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:30,907
I... I used to have these

914
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:34,413
horrible visions.

915
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:37,386
They were so terrible that I

916
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:40,488
convinced myself
that they were real.

917
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:46,022
But I learned
that those thoughts,

918
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,455
they were just lies.

919
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:52,331

was playing on me

920
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:54,833
because I was so unhappy.

921
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:56,768
This isn't a lie.

922
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,804

for certain?

We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

And perhaps
we postpone your vows.

What? No. Why?

00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,437
We're also concerned about

1010
01:00:27,683 --> 01:00:30,815
you will keep your distance

1260

They believe the only way

1261

is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

[Brennan] It's the mark.

1267

Carlita doesn't have the mark
on her head.

Well, if this is the child

then all we have to do

1279

is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

Give it to Mama.

1613
01:49:46,604 --> 01:49:47,605
Give it to Mama.

1614
01:49:51,106 --> 01:49:53,241
[cattle crying in distance]

1615
01:49:58,616 --> 01:50:00,116
[cattle lowing]

1616
01:50:06,925 --> 01:50:08,587
- [gun cocks]
- [gasps]

1617
01:50:09,424 --> 01:50:11,260
[Brennan] I'm so sorry,
Margaret.

1618
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:15,935
I tried just to leave you be.

1619
01:50:19,638 --> 01:50:21,138
You need to go.

1620
01:50:21,808 --> 01:50:24,339
Now. [breathing shakily]

1621
01:50:25,141 --> 01:50:26,639
I came to warn you.

1622
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:29,477
They know you're alive.

1623
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:31,880
You weren't supposed
to survive.

1624
01:50:32,016 --> 01:50:33,486
None of you were.

1625
01:50:33,622 --> 01:50:35,186
Especially the girl.

1626
01:50:36,987 --> 01:50:38,058
[girl laughing]

1627
01:50:38,193 --> 01:50:39,960
[Brennan] She'll be important,
Margaret.

1628
01:50:42,591 --> 01:50:44,261
I just want to be left alone.

1629
01:50:45,896 --> 01:50:47,132
I know.

1630
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:50,664
- But they will come for you.
- [gun cocks]

1631
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:10,487
They've even
given it a name.

1632
01:51:12,354 --> 01:51:13,626
Your son.

1633
01:51:13,761 --> 01:51:15,426
[wind whistling]

1634
01:51:15,996 --> 01:51:17,099
[Brennan] Damien.

1635
01:51:17,234 --> 01:51:19,692
[♪ dramatic sinister
music playing]
