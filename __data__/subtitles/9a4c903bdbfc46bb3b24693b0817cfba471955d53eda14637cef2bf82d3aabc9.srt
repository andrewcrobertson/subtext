In a beehive,
there is something

called a "queen slayer."

1445
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,818
It's a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

for the greater good.

1452
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,760
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1453
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,551
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1454
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:29,225
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1455
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,518
and become a queen slayer.
