1
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,219
Okay... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,222
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,310
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,437
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,441
Breakfast.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,569
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

7
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,947
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,285
I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,953
I am lightning!

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,373
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,502
Yeah. Lightning's ready.

12
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,875
Ka-chow!

13
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,007
Get your antenna balls here!

14
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,100
Go, Lightnin'!

15
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,937
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

16
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,340
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

17
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,678
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

18
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,181
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

19
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,225
Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof.

20
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,645
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

21
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,021
Right, Darrell.

22
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,523
Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

23
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,568
heading into the final race of the season.

24
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:59,406
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

25
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,408
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

26
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,702
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

27
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,329
He's been Dinoco's
golden boy for years!

28
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,582
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

29
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,169
And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

30
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,046
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

31
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,007
Chick thought
this was his year.

32
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,843
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

33
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,972
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

34
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,683
You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

35
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,352
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

36
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,937
But everyone knows him now.

37
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,941
Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

38
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,569
The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

39
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,697
Three cars, one champion!

40
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,169
No, you don't.

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,049
Hey!

42
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,808
What a ride!

43
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em!

44
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,067
I love you, Lightning!

45
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,736
Dinoco is all mine.

46
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,696
Trouble, turn three!

47
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,075
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

48
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,808
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

49
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,519
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

50
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,937
Not in one piece, that is.

51
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,370
Yeah!

52
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,289
Lightning!

53
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,751
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

54
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,462
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

55
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,464
Yeah! Ka-chow!

56
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,801
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

57
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,054
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

58
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,973
While everyone
heads into the pits,

59
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,142
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,020
Don't take me out, coach. I can still race!

61
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,360
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

62
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
- McQueen made it!
- What?

63
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,447
He's not pitting!

64
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,617
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

65
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,452
McQueen's not going into the pits!

66
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,080
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

67
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,499
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

68
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,752
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

69
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,339
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

70
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,841
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

71
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,861
Come on, come on, come on!

72
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,121
We need tires now! Come on, let's go!

73
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,041
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

74
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,377
You need tires, you idiot!

75
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,421
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

76
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,923
Right. No tires again.

77
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,509
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

78
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,221
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

79
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,855
This is it, Darrell.

80
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,358
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen
has a huge lead.

81
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,736
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,072
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,414
Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,833
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

85
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,669
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

86
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,255
You fool!

87
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,134
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

88
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,635
Go, go, go!

89
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,688
He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,941
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,818
Come on.

92
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,113
I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,534
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,917
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

95
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,007
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

96
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,926
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

97
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,303
Lightning!

98
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,681
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

99
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,185
unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

100
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,312
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

101
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,992
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

102
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,244
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

103
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,872
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

104
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,416
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

105
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,501
Tell me about it!

106
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,212
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

107
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,715
Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

108
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,677
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

109
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,679
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

110
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,890
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

111
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,142
No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show.

112
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,477
What? Yeah, right.

113
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,771
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

114
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,482
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

115
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,234
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

116
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,027
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

117
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,071
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

118
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,741
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

119
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,870
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

120
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,705
Okay, leave. Fine.

121
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,501
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

122
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,547
- Adiós, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

123
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,257
Whatever.

124
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,384
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

125
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,720
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

126
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,390
- By me!
- Yeah.

127
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,642
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

128
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,395
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

129
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:50,024
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

130
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,235
In your dreams, Thunder.

131
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,071
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder?"

132
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,991
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

133
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,909
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

134
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,370
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

135
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,205
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

136
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,623
Right in the lens.

137
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,001
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

138
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,421
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

139
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,431
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

140
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,473
Thank you, King.

141
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,059
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

142
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,477
It's the least I could do.

143
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,772
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

144
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,650
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

145
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,444
Kch-i-ka-chow!

146
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,155
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

147
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,491
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

148
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,077
I love being me.

149
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,289
- Okay, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

150
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,044
Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.

151
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,712
Hey, Mr. The King.

152
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,839
You got more talent in one lug nut

153
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,217
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

154
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,844
- Really? That...
- But you're stupid.

155
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,472
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

156
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,351
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

157
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,770
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

158
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,482
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

159
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,943
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

160
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,945
Yeah...

161
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,162
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

162
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
Lightning!

163
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,272
If you figure that out
you just gonna be okay.

164
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,984
Yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

165
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,485
Thank you, Mr. The King.

166
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,654
Ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,990
for the first time in Piston Cup history...

168
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,035
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

169
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,245
Yes!

170
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,206
we have a three-way tie.

171
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,882
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

172
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,635
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

173
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,889
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

174
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:31,227
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

175
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,897
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

176
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,693
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

177
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,654
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

178
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,328
Yeah! Whoo!

179
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,414
Yep! All right! Got it!

180
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,751
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

181
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,670
We'll see who gets there first, Chick.

182
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,258
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

183
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,178
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

184
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,430
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

185
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,515
Gotta make your personal appearance.

186
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,101
No. No! No, no, no, no!

187
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,687
Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here.

188
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,274
And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper
Ointment, new rear end formula!

189
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,236
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,989
Wow! Look at that shine!

191
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,826
Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!

192
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,078
Ka-chow!

193
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,416
I met this car from Swampscott.

194
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,087
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

195
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,464
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

196
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,802
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

197
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,263
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

198
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,266
Will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

199
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,312
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

200
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,773
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

201
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,608
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

202
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,319
Hey, look! There he is!

203
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,862
Our almost champ!

204
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,614
Get your rear end in here.

205
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,282
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

206
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,952
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

207
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,079
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

208
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,206
Yes, I know.

209
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,707
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

210
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,335
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

211
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,337
Looking good, Freddie!

212
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,215
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

213
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,801
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

214
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,553
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

215
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,972
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

216
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,850
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

217
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,102
because the track is always lit.

218
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,355
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

219
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,030
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Lightning McQueen!

220
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,910
Free Bird!

221
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,372
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

222
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,207
ran a great race today.

223
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,043
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

224
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,296
And an insane
amount of luck,

225
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,884
you too, can look like me. Ka-chow.

226
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,013
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

227
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,557
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

228
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,892
Just like this year!

229
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,687
Not on your life.

230
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,566
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

231
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,569
California, here we come!

232
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,405
Dinoco, here we come!

233
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:24,020
I needed this. Hello?

234
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,856
Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?

235
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,025
Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?

236
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,694
And it is such an honor
to be your agent

237
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,155
that it almost hurts me to take
10% of your winnings.

238
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,699
Merchandising.
And ancillary rights in perpetuity.

239
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,952
Anyway, what a race, champ!

240
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,705
I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.

241
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,914
Thanks, Harv.

242
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,668
Listen, they're giving you 20
tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.

243
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,087
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.

244
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,633
- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.

245
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,635
Yes, there's...

246
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,180
Okay, I get it, Mr. Popular.

247
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,642
So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,

248
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,602
you better make time
for your best friend!

249
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,854
Break bread
with your mischpoche here!

250
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,981
That'd be great! We should totally...

251
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,817
Okay, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.

252
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,115
What? A minivan?

253
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,034
Come on, you're in the slow lane.

254
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,328
This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.

255
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,955
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

256
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,416
- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.

257
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,253
We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.

258
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,714
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

259
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,636
Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.

260
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,805
All those sleeping trucks.

261
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,599
Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.

262
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,101
Sure you can, Mack.

263
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,478
Look, it'll be easy. I'll stay up with you.

264
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,272
- All night?
- All night long.

265
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,379
Choo!

266
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,479
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

267
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,565
We got ourselves a nodder.

268
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,533
Pretty music.

269
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,037
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

270
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,414
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

271
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,751
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

272
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,524
- No, Snotrod...
- He's gonna blow!

273
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,401
Choo!

274
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,736
Gesundheit!

275
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,949
One should never drive while drowsy.

276
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,928
Mack!

277
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,310
Mack!

278
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,401
Mack!

279
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,279
Hey, Mack! Mack!

280
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,824
Mack!

281
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,617
Mack, wait for me!

282
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,336
Mack!

283
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,984
Mack! Mack!

284
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,655
Mack! Mack!

285
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,199
Wait up! Mack.

286
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,368
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,496
You're not Mack.

288
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:39,335
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

289
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,463
Turn on your lights, you moron!

290
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,595
Mack... The Interstate!

291
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,904
Not in my town, you don't.

292
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,035
No.

293
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,663
Maybe he can help me!

294
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,040
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

295
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,418
I haven't gone this fast in years.

296
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,338
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

297
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,715
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

298
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,467
What in the blue blazes?

299
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,219
Crazy hot-rodder.

300
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

301
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,499
The '60s weren't good to you,
were they?

302
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,471
What? That's not the Interstate!

303
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,857
No, no, no, no, no, no!

304
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,155
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

305
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,824
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

306
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,493
- No!
- Hey!

307
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,828
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

308
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,081
My tires!

309
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,004
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

310
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,059
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

311
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,232
We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway

312
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,860
as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,

313
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,070
is arriving at the track.

314
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,239
Is it true
he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

315
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,448
What's your strategy?

316
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,162
What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?

317
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,083
McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.

318
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,087
- McQueen was reported missing.
- to race an unprecedented...

319
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.

320
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,096
I hope Lightning's Okay. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

321
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:05,475
I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

322
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,437
Lightning
McQueen must be found at all costs!

323
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,566
They're all asking the same question,
"Where is McQueen?"

324
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,819
Boy.

325
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,947
Where am I?

326
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,491
Mornin', sleepin' beauty!

327
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,870
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

328
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,706
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

329
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,626
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

330
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,589
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

331
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,634
I like you already. My name's Mater.

332
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,303
Mater?

333
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,223
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

334
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,601
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

335
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,147
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

336
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,232
What?

337
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,070
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

338
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,405
Where are you? Shoot!

339
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,032
You're in Radiator Springs.

340
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,494
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

341
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,455
Great. Just great!

342
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:13,043
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

343
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,047
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

344
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,008
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

345
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,719
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

346
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,805
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

347
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,390
- Cool!
- Mater!

348
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,476
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

349
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,061
To not to.

350
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,524
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

351
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,609
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

352
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,696
"Later, Mater."
That's funny!

353
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,575
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

354
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,495
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

355
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,581
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

356
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,000
- Fascist!
- Commie!

357
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,752
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

358
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,629
I gotta get to California, pronto.

359
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,839
Where's your lawyer?

360
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,301
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

361
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:07,389
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

362
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,558
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

363
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,145
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

364
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,023
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.

365
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,358
Show-off.

366
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,611
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

367
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,904
All right,

368
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,199
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

369
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,285
I want his hood on a platter!

370
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,079
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

371
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,708
I'm gonna put him in jail
till the jail rots on top of him,

372
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,503
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

373
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,088
I'm...

374
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,508
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

375
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,179
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

376
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,014
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

377
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,516
Boy, I'm pretty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

378
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,101
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

379
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,148
Holy Porsche!
She's gotta be from my attorney's office.

380
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,442
Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set.

381
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,818
He's letting me go.

382
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,278
He's letting you go?

383
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,946
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

384
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,158
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

385
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,454
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

386
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,122
- What the?
- Ka-chow!

387
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,374
Please!

388
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,250
I know. I get that reaction a lot.

389
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,545
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

390
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,464
Agh!

391
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,883
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

392
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,135
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

393
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,931
Okay. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

394
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,975
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

395
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,562
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

396
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,606
Ka-ching!

397
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,818
I'll keep that in mind.

398
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,404
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

399
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,156
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

400
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,117
You know her?

401
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,828
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

402
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,912
What?

403
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,958
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

404
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,212
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

405
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,672
What do you want, Sally?

406
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,925
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

407
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,470
No. I know his type. Racecar.

408
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,514
That's the last thing this town needs.

409
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:17,018
Okay, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

410
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,106
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

411
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,482
Here she goes again.

412
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,360
Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel

413
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:29,072
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

414
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,951
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

415
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,202
on our stretch of that road.

416
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,829
Travelers? What travelers?

417
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,205
Ignore him.

418
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,709
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

419
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,919
if there is no road for them to drive on?

420
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,964
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

421
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,549
And if no one can get to you?

422
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,803
I won't sell any tires.
I will lose everything!

423
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,015
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

424
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,310
- Lotsa gas!
- Okay, boys, stay with me.

425
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,730
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

426
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,484
I'll go outta business and
we'll have to leave town.

427
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,612
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

428
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,281
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

429
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,242
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

430
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,412
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

431
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,664
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

432
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,542
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

433
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,336
He can do it.
He's got the horsepower.

434
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,837
So, what do you want him to do?

435
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,255
Fix the road!

436
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,842
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

437
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,555
Order in the court!

438
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,226
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

439
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,269
- Yeah!
- No!

440
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,604
Nice ruling.

441
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,858
I am so not taking you to dinner.

442
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,946
That's okay, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

443
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,739
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

444
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,283
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

445
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,786
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

446
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:04,417
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

447
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,462
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

448
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,298
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

449
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,551
What? This place is crazy!

450
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,719
I know this may be a bad time right now,

451
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,973
but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.

452
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,140
What?

453
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,727
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

454
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,396
You gotta be kidding me.

455
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,065
You start there where the road begins.

456
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,569
You finish down there
where the road ends.

457
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,698
Holy shoot!

458
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

459
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,288
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

460
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,497
Five days?

461
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,500
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

462
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,503
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

463
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,339
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

464
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,308
Freedom!

465
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,483
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

466
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,195
And then... Then took the boot off.

467
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,907
Whoo-hoo!

468
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,954
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

469
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,666
California, here I come! Yeah!

470
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,254
Feel that wind.

471
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,298
Yes!

472
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,676
No. No, no, no.

473
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,012
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

474
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,972
How can I be outta gas?

475
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:46,061
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

476
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,646
But how did,
how did you...

477
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,023
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

478
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,901
Ka-chow.

479
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,662
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

480
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,913
Hey, Sheriff.

481
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,040
- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.

482
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,958
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

483
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,753
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

484
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,464
I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.

485
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,592
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

486
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,428
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

487
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,348
I get fluid built up in my engine block,

488
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,810
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

489
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,062
That's why we made him the judge.

490
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:33,191
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

491
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,276
Now, I'm not one to brag

492
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,446
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

493
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,784
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

494
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,285
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

495
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,663
That ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya.

496
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,459
No, no, no!

497
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,712
That won't be necessary.

498
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,383
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

499
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,136
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

500
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
Where's he goin'?

501
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:08,309
He's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

502
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,019
I shouldn't put up with this.

503
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,647
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

504
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,859
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

505
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,154
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

506
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,906
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

507
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,994
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

508
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,538
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

509
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,665
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

510
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,667
I must scream it to the world!

511
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,838
My excitement from the top
of some place very high!

512
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,549
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

513
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,427
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

514
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,389
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

515
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,563
Is that what I think it is?

516
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,483
Customers.

517
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,986
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

518
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,446
- Okay!
- Customers?

519
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,616
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

520
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,951
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

521
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,538
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

522
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,541
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

523
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:18,087
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

524
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,507
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

525
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,176
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

526
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,804
Legendary for its service and hospitality.

527
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,013
How can we help you?

528
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,809
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

529
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,562
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

530
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,065
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

531
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,068
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

532
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,987
- Okay. Really. We're just peachy, okay?
- What you really need

533
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,408
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

534
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,077
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

535
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,163
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

536
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,542
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

537
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,919
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

538
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,421
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

539
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,424
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

540
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,759
Honey, she's got a map.

541
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,595
I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

542
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,597
Never need a map again, thank you.

543
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,974
How 'bout somethin' to drink?

544
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,270
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

545
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,521
No we just topped off.

546
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:20,316
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

547
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,610
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

548
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,239
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

549
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,284
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

550
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,786
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

551
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,079
Maybe ghost flames!

552
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,623
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

553
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,127
Honey, look. Von Dutch.

554
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,755
Okay, no.
We're gonna be going now, Okay?

555
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,969
A little somethin'
to remember us by, okay?

556
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,138
- Okay!
- Come back soon, okay?

557
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,474
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

558
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,145
Okay! Yes. You bet.

559
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,480
Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.

560
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,525
Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

561
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,818
I know how to get to the Interstate!

562
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:04,986
Do ya?

563
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,280
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,574
No, not really. But listen.

565
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,911
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

566
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,163
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

567
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,625
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

568
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,712
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

569
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,507
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

570
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,844
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

571
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,971
I'm becoming one of them!

572
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,184
Okay, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

573
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,603
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

574
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,396
We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

575
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,191
- That's good.
- after a Piston Cup update.

576
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,360
Still no sign
of Lightning McQueen.

577
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,029
Chick arrived in California

578
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,032
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

579
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,535
It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

580
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,081
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

581
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,544
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

582
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,384
Ha-ha!

583
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,931
Yeah!

584
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,236
Hey, McQueen, eat your heart out.

585
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,948
Let me get this straight.

586
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,993
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

587
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,746
- That's what they done did said.
- Okay. Outta my way.

588
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,581
I got a road to finish.

589
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,137
- He's done!
- Done?

590
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,597
It's only been an hour.

591
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,894
I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

592
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,772
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

593
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,277
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

594
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,450
It rides purty smooth.

595
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,076
It looks awful!

596
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,037
Well, it matches the rest of the town.

597
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,833
Red.

598
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,963
Who do you think you are?

599
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,633
Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go.
That was the deal.

600
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,012
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

601
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,306
Now, scrape it off! Start over again.

602
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,018
Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer.
I'm a racecar.

603
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,853
Ho-ho-ho!

604
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,690
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

605
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,775
What?

606
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,778
Me and you. That a joke?

607
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,447
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

608
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,200
If I win, you do the road my way.

609
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,826
Doc, what're you doin'?

610
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,162
I don't mean to be rude here,

611
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,582
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

612
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,251
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

613
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:11,839
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

614
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,427
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

615
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:21,015
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

616
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,768
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

617
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,604
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

618
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:31,609
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

619
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,444
and no lollygaggin'.

620
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,279
Speed. I'm speed.

621
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,698
Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.

622
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,955
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

623
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,541
Peet stop!

624
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,252
The race is only one lap, guys.

625
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,879
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

626
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,631
I work solo mio.

627
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,800
Fine. Race your way.

628
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,262
No pit stoppo. Comprendo?

629
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:00,972
Okay.

630
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,516
Gentlemen,

631
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,477
start your engines!

632
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,862
- Híjole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

633
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,031
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

634
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,491
Luigi?

635
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,744
On your mark, get set...

636
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,038
Uno for the money, due for the show,

637
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,500
tre to get ready, and quattro to...

638
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,919
I can't believe it. Go!

639
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,724
Doc, the flag means go.

640
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,060
Remember the fl... Here we go. Go.

641
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,855
Doc, what are you doing, man?

642
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,692
Dear.
It would seem I'm off to a poor start.

643
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,862
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

644
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,615
- Might need a little help.
- Okay.

645
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,035
You got your tow cable?

646
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,037
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

647
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,414
Just in case.

648
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,052
No, no, no, no, no!

649
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,638
- Man!
- Whoa.

650
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,806
Bad trip, man.

651
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,897
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac

652
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,733
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

653
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm confused.

654
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,321
You drive like you fix roads.

655
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,824
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

656
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,917
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

657
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,128
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

658
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,342
I can make a little turn on dirt.

659
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,843
You think?

660
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:07,473
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

661
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,017
Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!

662
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,354
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

663
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,231
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

664
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,359
Whoo! Watchin' him
is makin' me thirsty.

665
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,027
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

666
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,529
Nah, not me, Flo.

667
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,073
I'm on one of them there special diets.

668
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,786
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

669
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,622
"You race like you fix roads."

670
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,041
I'll show him.

671
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,544
I will show him!

672
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,973
Great! I hate it!

673
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,935
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

674
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,397
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

675
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,400
Radiator Springs,
a happy place!

676
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,611
Okay, Bessie, you think that's funny?

677
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:07,074
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

678
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,090
Wow.

679
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,092
Mornin', Sally!

680
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:30,264
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

681
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,391
Yes! Amazing!

682
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:36,103
Whoa! Yeah!

683
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:40,608
Ramone!
Mama ain't seen you that low in years.

684
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,277
I haven't seen a road like this in years.

685
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:47,406
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

686
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,867
È bellissima! It's beautiful!

687
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,913
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

688
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,998
Boy, I tell you what.

689
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,918
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

690
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,711
Doc, look at this!

691
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,631
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner?

692
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,218
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

693
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,262
Guido, look at Luigi!

694
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,306
This is fantastico!

695
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,143
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

696
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:20,481
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

697
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,859
That crazy old devil woman.

698
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,490
She's right!

699
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,033
Guido!

700
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,995
That punk actually did a good job.

701
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:40,584
Well, now, where the heck is he?

702
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,176
Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?

703
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,513
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

704
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,849
and asked me if he could
come down here.

705
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,268
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

706
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,228
No, no, no, no! Great.

707
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,315
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

708
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,613
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

709
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,073
I'll keep an eye on him.

710
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,244
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

711
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,677
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

712
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,763
Great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

713
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,184
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

714
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,479
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

715
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,690
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

716
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,776
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

717
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,778
I'll put it simple.

718
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,782
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

719
00:49:54,283 --> 00:50:00,247
Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

720
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,124
Or should I say, "No, thank you?"

721
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:06,045
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you!"

722
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,176
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

723
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,602
Turn right to go left.

724
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,023
Whoa!

725
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:34,448
That...

726
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,166
Turn right to go left.
Guess what? I tried it.

727
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,211
You know what?
This crazy thing happened. I went right!

728
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,673
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

729
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,426
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

730
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,187
- Guido, è bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

731
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,650
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace? Si, si, bellissimo.

732
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,029
Lord.

733
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,531
Mater!

734
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,992
I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.

735
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,370
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

736
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,498
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

737
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,042
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

738
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,339
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

739
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,175
Chick's in California
schmoozing Dinoco.

740
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,470
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

741
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,639
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

742
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,725
You make-a such a nice new road.

743
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,853
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

744
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,271
Even though you not a Ferrari.

745
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,567
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

746
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,529
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

747
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:58,991
I like your style?

748
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,411
You drive the hard bargain.
Okay. Luigi make you a new deal.

749
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,956
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

750
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,750
Would you look at that?

751
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,877
Ramone, Ramone!

752
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,755
Then Luigi make you
a new, new deal.

753
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,799
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

754
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,053
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

755
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:23,807
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

756
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,560
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

757
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,732
Stop! Let me...

758
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,611
Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

759
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,738
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

760
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,783
Stop, stop! That's cold!

761
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,744
Help! Please! Stop!

762
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,414
Thanks, Red.

763
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,625
What was that for?

764
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,252
Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?

765
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,712
If you do, you gotta be clean.

766
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,923
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

767
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,800
What, I... I don't get it.

768
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,594
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

769
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:04,056
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

770
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,435
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

771
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,398
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

772
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,983
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

773
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,610
I understand you criminal types.

774
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,404
No, no, no, no. That's okay.

775
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,446
Yeah, the Cozy Cone.

776
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,782
It's newly refurbished.

777
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,244
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

778
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:29,248
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

779
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,626
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

780
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,630
Figure that all out on your own, did you?

781
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,800
Cone number one, if you want.

782
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,142
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

783
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,562
That's just a...

784
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,484
You saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

785
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,862
Gonna... Yeah.

786
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,745
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

787
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,204
Good-lookin' girl.

788
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:12,541
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

789
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:16,128
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

790
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,506
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

791
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:23,677
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

792
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,931
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

793
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:31,560
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

794
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,979
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

795
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,273
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

796
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,692
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

797
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,986
I can handle anything.

798
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,238
I'm not doin' this.

799
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,991
Come on. You'll love it!

800
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,662
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

801
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,331
All right, listen.

802
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,835
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

803
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,253
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

804
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,256
Mater!

805
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,716
Wait, Mater!

806
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,553
Okay, here's what you do.

807
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,556
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

808
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,100
And they do the rest. Watch this.

809
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,333
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

810
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,128
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

811
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,798
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

812
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,189
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

813
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,899
Your turn, bud.

814
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,277
Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.

815
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,529
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

816
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,450
Fine. Stop! Stop, Okay?
All right. I'll do something.

817
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,794
That's Frank.

818
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,565
Run!

819
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,361
Here he comes, look out!

820
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,363
Whoa!

821
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
Run! He's gonna get ya!

822
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,889
Customers!

823
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,853
No, no, no.

824
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,730
Oof!

825
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,193
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

826
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,236
I can't wait, Mater.

827
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,738
Yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

828
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,826
Boy, you gotta admit that was fun!

829
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,161
Yeah... Yeah.

830
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,331
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

831
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,835
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

832
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:31,174
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Come... No. No, are you kidding?

833
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:35,387
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

834
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,514
Yeah, you probably right.

835
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,516
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

836
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,269
Where, where?

837
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,772
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

838
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,691
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

839
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,942
- Way.
- Come on, look...

840
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,318
You're in love with Miss Sally!

841
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,445
Real mature.

842
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,487
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

843
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,865
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

844
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,658
You love her! You love her. You love her.

845
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,535
All right. Okay. Mater, enough!

846
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,370
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

847
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,623
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

848
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:08,962
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

849
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,797
You just watch this right here, lover boy.

850
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,468
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

851
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,969
Mater? Mater!

852
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,347
Mater!

853
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:31,985
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

854
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,618
Oof!

855
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,829
Yee-hee!

856
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,831
He's nuts.

857
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,335
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

858
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,006
Just need to know where I've been.

859
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,009
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

860
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,138
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

861
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,683
Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

862
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:07,354
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

863
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,776
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

864
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,903
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

865
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,781
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

866
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,701
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

867
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,370
with private helicopters.

868
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,706
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

869
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,875
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

870
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,131
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

871
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,676
- Not like you. I like you.
- Nah, it's okay, buddy.

872
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:42,389
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

873
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:47,394
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

874
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,896
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

875
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,731
Yeah. Anything you say.

876
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,777
I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!

877
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,696
In what?

878
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,448
My best friend.

879
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,249
See you tomorrow, buddy!

880
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,586
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,

881
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,298
K-I-S-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-T!

882
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,595
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

883
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,935
Number one. Number one...
Number one!

884
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,480
- This is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

885
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,943
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

886
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,612
I scared myself scaring you scaring me.

887
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,281
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

888
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,783
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

889
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,454
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

890
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,372
Something about a helicopter ride.

891
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,709
Yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

892
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,045
- Did you mean it?
- What?

893
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,297
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

894
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,883
First things first. I gotta get outta here
and make the race.

895
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,639
You know... Mater trusts you.

896
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,558
Yeah, okay.

897
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,645
- Did you mean that?
- What?

898
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,813
Was it just a "Yeah, okay,"

899
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:17,484
or "Yeah, okay"
or "Yeah, okay?"

900
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,070
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

901
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,115
Yeah, okay. Good night.

902
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,204
Hey, thank you.

903
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,500
What did you just say?

904
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,378
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

905
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,173
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

906
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,175
Newly refurbished, right?

907
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,302
Yeah.

908
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,514
- Good night.
- Good night.

909
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,955
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

910
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,875
Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix!

911
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,187
No!

912
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,778
No!

913
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,032
I gotta get outta here!

914
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,201
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
My gosh.

915
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,580
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

916
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,250
I just need
my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

917
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,461
Wait for him at Flo's. Get outta here.

918
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,339
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

919
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,549
Hope you enjoyed the show!

920
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,106
Whoa, Doc.

921
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:24,486
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

922
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,795
What?

923
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,757
He has a Piston Cup?

924
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,349
My gosh.

925
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,727
Three Piston Cups?

926
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:11,991
Sign says stay out.

927
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,495
You have three
Piston Cups. How could you have...

928
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,665
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

929
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,833
You're the Hudson Hornet!

930
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,419
Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

931
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,546
Of course.
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

932
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,506
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

933
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,884
You used to hold the record for
most wins in a season. We gotta talk.

934
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,469
You gotta show me your tricks. Please.

935
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,720
I tried that.

936
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,557
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

937
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,060
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

938
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:49,737
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPMs, man.

939
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,573
Take a car wash, hippie.

940
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,868
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

941
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,663
- Yellow, baby.
- You smokin' hot!

942
01:05:58,705 --> 01:05:59,706
There he is.

943
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,876
My gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

944
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,798
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

945
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,509
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

946
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,803
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

947
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,390
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

948
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,350
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

949
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,188
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

950
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,814
He won three Piston Cups!

951
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,858
He did what in his cup?

952
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,402
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

953
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,280
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

954
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,574
I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

955
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,910
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

956
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,620
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

957
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,417
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's okay. You can trust me, right?

958
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,212
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

959
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,507
I trust him.

960
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,843
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

961
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,428
Yeah, a drive.

962
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,306
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

963
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,100
No. No, we don't.

964
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:28,086
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

965
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,179
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

966
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,139
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

967
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,142
That's so too much!

968
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,314
Okay, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

969
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,692
I don't know.

970
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,323
Whoa! Yes.

971
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,466
Ha-ha!

972
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,602
Wow. What is this place?

973
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,688
Wheel Well.

974
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,108
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

975
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,905
This place?

976
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,035
Yeah, imagine.

977
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,957
Imagine
what it must have been like to stay here.

978
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:14,961
You know, I don't get you.

979
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,673
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

980
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,466
Well, it's really pretty simple. I was...

981
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:25,138
an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

982
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,641
You were, were you? Were you rich?

983
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,311
- What?
- Just clues to the puzzle.

984
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,690
Yeah, okay. Well, that was my life.

985
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,233
And you know what?

986
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,945
It never felt happy.

987
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,783
Yeah. I mean, really?

988
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,660
Yeah. So I left California.

989
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,038
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

990
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,833
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

991
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,628
Well, they all did. And I never left.

992
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,506
Yeah. You know, I understand.

993
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,384
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

994
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:07,180
But, you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

995
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,350
I fell in love.

996
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,395
Yep.

997
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,025
- Corvette?
- No.

998
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,366
I fell in love with this.

999
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,799
Whoa. Look at that.

1000
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,886
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1001
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,138
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1002
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,058
Well, it didn't
used to be that way.

1003
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,685
Yeah?

1004
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:58,815
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1005
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,566
Really?

1006
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,820
Yeah. Back then,

1007
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,656
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1008
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,075
How do you mean?

1009
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,786
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1010
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:17,041
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1011
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,294
- Mornin'!
- Nice day?

1012
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,424
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1013
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,052
They drove on it to have a great time.

1014
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,463
Well, what happened?

1015
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,884
The town got bypassed
just to save 10 minutes of driving.

1016
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,471
How great
would it have been

1017
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,139
to see this place in its heyday!

1018
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,142
I can't tell you
how many times I've dreamed of that.

1019
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:44,355
But one of these days
we'll find a way to get it back on the map.

1020
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:48,067
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1021
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,986
I had a great time.

1022
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:53,364
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1023
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,574
You're welcome.

1024
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,583
Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you,

1025
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,961
we was out smashin' mailboxes, okay?

1026
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,255
Wha... What?

1027
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,397
Man, the paint's still wet!

1028
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,951
No, no, no, no! Get out of the store!

1029
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,455
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

1030
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,790
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1031
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,127
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1032
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,588
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1033
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,631
There's one goin' this way.

1034
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,426
I got it.

1035
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,141
Come here, little tractor, come here.

1036
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,185
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1037
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,686
No, no, no, no, come here.

1038
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,979
What are you doing?

1039
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,440
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1040
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,151
alone.

1041
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:26,165
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

1042
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,633
Come on, Doc, drive.

1043
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,462
Yeah.

1044
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,214
Wow.

1045
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,841
You're amazing!

1046
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,095
What are you doin'?

1047
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,805
Doc, wait!

1048
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,437
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1049
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,276
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1050
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,779
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1051
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,616
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on. I'm a racecar,

1052
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,701
you're a much older racecar,

1053
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:27,661
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1054
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:30,789
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1055
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,792
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1056
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,672
You think I quit?

1057
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,603
Right.

1058
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,065
Your big wreck in '54.

1059
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,109
They quit on me.

1060
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,821
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1061
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,824
You know what they said?
"You're history."

1062
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,994
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1063
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,832
There was a lot left in me.

1064
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,586
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1065
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,967
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1066
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,346
I just never expected that
that world would...

1067
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,723
Would find me here.

1068
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,185
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Yeah?

1069
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,228
No, I'm not.

1070
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,232
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1071
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:43,153
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1072
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,491
I didn't think so.

1073
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:52,037
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1074
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,499
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1075
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,752
Like you?
You've been here how long

1076
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,462
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1077
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,299
Who's caring about only himself?

1078
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:06,176
Just finish that road and get outta here!

1079
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,901
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1080
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,404
Respect the classics, man.

1081
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,265
He's done.

1082
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:57,186
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1083
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,854
Good riddance.

1084
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,447
He's gone?

1085
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,075
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1086
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:21,460
- Dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1087
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,296
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1088
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:25,672
I'm glad he's gone!

1089
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,014
What's wrong with Red?

1090
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:37,226
He's just sad 'cause you left town

1091
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,437
and went to your big race
to win the Piston Cup

1092
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,524
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life

1093
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:49,154
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1094
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,536
Wait a minute!

1095
01:21:57,371 --> 01:22:00,207
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1096
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,293
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1097
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,296
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1098
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:07,923
Thank you, Sheriff.

1099
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,925
But you know I can't go just yet.

1100
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,510
Well, why not?

1101
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,638
I'm not sure these tires...

1102
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,224
- can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

1103
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,852
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1104
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,020
I can't-a believe it!

1105
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,897
Four new tires!

1106
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,692
Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!

1107
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,863
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!

1108
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,741
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1109
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:38,537
for this is the most
glorious day of my life!

1110
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,374
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1111
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,084
No! No, no, no.

1112
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,546
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1113
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:53,218
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1114
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,053
But-a this,

1115
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,847
whitewall tires!

1116
01:22:57,014 --> 01:23:01,852
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

1117
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,645
All right, you're the expert.

1118
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,732
Don't forget the spare.

1119
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,568
- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!

1120
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,041
What did
Luigi tell you?

1121
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,586
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari?

1122
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:29,379
No.

1123
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:37,095
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1124
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,931
It's a conspiracy, man!

1125
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,725
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1126
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,978
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1127
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,022
Okay, I'll take a case.

1128
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,007
Yeah.

1129
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,343
Ka-chow.

1130
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,304
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1131
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,640
Act natural.

1132
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,308
- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!

1133
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,977
All right, what's goin' on?

1134
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,479
Ladies and gentlecars,

1135
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,483
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1136
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,152
Pow! What do you think?

1137
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,071
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1138
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,115
I'll say.

1139
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,660
Ka-chow.

1140
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,246
You're gonna fit right in in California.

1141
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,833
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1142
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,751
Yeah, everybody except one.

1143
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,714
Hey, is it getting dark out?

1144
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,008
What? What'd he say?

1145
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,136
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1146
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,513
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1147
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:28,206
They fixed their neon!

1148
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:39,343
- Low and slow?
- Yeah, baby!

1149
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,809
Just like in its heyday, right?

1150
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,855
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1151
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:21,093
Shall we cruise?

1152
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,220
Thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1153
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,471
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1154
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:28,975
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1155
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,937
Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise?

1156
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,148
Of course, Mater.

1157
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:46,118
and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1158
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:50,706
But, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1159
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:54,292
Finally I said, "All right, one little drive."

1160
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,637
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1161
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,014
Good evenin', you two.

1162
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:15,689
Stanley, I wish you could see this.

1163
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:23,822
- Is that what I think it is?
- I don't know, Flo.

1164
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:29,453
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1165
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,580
Not that. That.

1166
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,541
Customers?

1167
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,419
Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em!

1168
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,504
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1169
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:43,258
It's the ghost light!

1170
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:46,011
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1171
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:48,680
McQueen, over here!

1172
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,308
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1173
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,560
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1174
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:54,644
McQueen's
wearing whitewalls!

1175
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,980
- Your tires balding?
- McQueen!

1176
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,148
Was McQueen
your prisoner?

1177
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,357
Shoot, no!

1178
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,027
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1179
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:05,197
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1180
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,032
Sally! Sally!

1181
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:08,992
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1182
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,286
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1183
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,370
Come on,
give us some bolt!

1184
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:17,834
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1185
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,296
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1186
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,383
You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1187
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,094
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1188
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,180
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1189
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,849
Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1190
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,477
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1191
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,773
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1192
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:40,941
Where's the old
McQueen?

1193
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,068
Actually, this is my good side here.

1194
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,862
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1195
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,572
- Harv?
- Come on!

1196
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,740
Kid, I'm over here!

1197
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,325
How you doin', buddy?

1198
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:53,078
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1199
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,247
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

1200
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,333
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1201
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,754
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1202
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,257
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1203
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,926
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

1204
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,220
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1205
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,722
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1206
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,850
Playtime is over, pal.

1207
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:18,895
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1208
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,730
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1209
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:24,150
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1210
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,528
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1211
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,115
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1212
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,702
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1213
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,539
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1214
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,583
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1215
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,126
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1216
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,462
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1217
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,469
Sally, I... I want you to...

1218
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,598
Look, I wish...

1219
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,269
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1220
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,939
It was just a road.

1221
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,902
No. It was much more than that.

1222
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,658
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1223
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,745
He's gonna have me fired
if I don't get you in the truck right now!

1224
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,664
- Mack, just hold it for...
- You should go.

1225
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,666
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1226
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,297
I hope you find what you're looking for.

1227
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,215
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1228
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:30,550
Sally!

1229
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:35,013
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!
- Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1230
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,647
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1231
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,941
That's it. That's right, let's go!

1232
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,735
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1233
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,862
You don't belong there, anyway.

1234
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,366
Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1235
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,621
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1236
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,713
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1237
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,840
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1238
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,101
You called them?

1239
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:23,395
It's best for everyone, Sally.

1240
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,982
Best for everyone or best for you?

1241
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:46,584
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1242
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:49,689
Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1243
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:52,150
the biggest event in the history
of racing.

1244
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,486
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1245
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,946
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1246
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,157
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1247
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:03,703
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1248
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:06,456
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1249
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:09,626
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1250
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:12,837
I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1251
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:16,800
I never thought I'd see anything like this.
This is exciting!

1252
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,385
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1253
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:23,348
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1254
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,434
Hey, King! Good luck in your last race.

1255
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:30,563
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1256
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:33,399
- Hey, be careful out there, okay?
- Yeah, man.

1257
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:34,692
He's hot!

1258
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,528
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1259
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:40,949
A 100% chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1260
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,034
Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1261
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:46,079
Hey, you!
No admittance without a garage pass.

1262
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:49,124
It's okay.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1263
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:52,293
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1264
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:57,215
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1265
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:01,302
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1266
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,387
Sorry, pal.

1267
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,516
Okay, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1268
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:10,145
I am speed.

1269
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,233
Victory. One winner, two losers.

1270
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:22,740
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1271
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:30,582
Lightnin'! You ready?

1272
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1273
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,766
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1274
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:51,603
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1275
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,938
After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.

1276
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,399
- It is?
- Not really.

1277
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:28,973
Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16.

1278
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,309
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1279
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,479
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1280
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:36,981
In a little town called Radiator Springs.

1281
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:40,193
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1282
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,239
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1283
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,326
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1284
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:51,037
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1285
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,040
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1286
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:57,043
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1287
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,052
Agh! Shoot!

1288
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,347
Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1289
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:17,563
Come on, you can do it!

1290
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,274
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1291
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,362
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1292
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,115
McQueen's got a run
on him! He's lookin' to the inside!

1293
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,536
Chick slammed the door on him!

1294
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,871
Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1295
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,623
He lost momentum,

1296
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:38,668
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1297
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,554
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1298
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,102
Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1299
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:59,731
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1300
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,649
Hey, kid,

1301
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:05,153
- are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1302
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,738
I don't think I...

1303
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,407
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1304
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,075
Doc?

1305
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,331
Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!

1306
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:20,209
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1307
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,128
You said you'd never come back.

1308
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:26,090
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1309
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:28,718
Goodbye! Okay, I'm good.

1310
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:36,267
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1311
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,604
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1312
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,356
Now, get back out there!

1313
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,903
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1314
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,113
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1315
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:52,575
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1316
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,786
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1317
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:58,164
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1318
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,302
- Is it?
- Wow. That's him!

1319
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:15,139
Is that... That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1320
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,849
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1321
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,228
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1322
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:22,980
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1323
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:26,317
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1324
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:33,157
Wow, this is history in the making.

1325
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,452
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1326
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:37,829
Hey, Doc!

1327
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:42,125
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1328
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,800
- McQueen passes on the inside!
- He's nearly a lap down.

1329
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,511
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1330
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,347
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1331
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,141
Vai! Vai, vai!

1332
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:01,144
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you?

1333
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,564
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1334
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:07,692
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1335
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:11,529
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1336
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,796
Kid's just tryin' to be a hero?

1337
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:31,716
What do you think of this?

1338
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,885
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1339
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:38,556
What?

1340
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,349
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1341
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:46,022
I taught him that. Ka-chow!

1342
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:48,107
What a move by McQueen!

1343
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,234
He's caught up to the leaders.

1344
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:51,486
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1345
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,405
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1346
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:01,454
Look at that boy go out there!

1347
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,215
No, you don't.

1348
01:40:15,635 --> 01:40:17,094
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1349
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:20,598
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1350
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:23,893
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1351
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,022
We gotta get him
back out there fast

1352
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,816
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1353
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:32,985
Guido! It's time.

1354
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:39,575
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1355
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,003
I don't believe it!

1356
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,964
That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1357
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,550
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1358
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:57,593
It's gonna be close.

1359
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:01,472
Yeah, baby!

1360
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:02,932
He's back in!

1361
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:05,226
Peet stop.

1362
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,604
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1363
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,871
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap

1364
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:29,208
and McQueen is right behind
the leaders. What a comeback!

1365
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:33,004
A hundred and ninety-nine laps!
It all comes down to this!

1366
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:34,338
This is it, kiddo.

1367
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,383
You've got four turns left. One at a time.

1368
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,885
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1369
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,262
Go!

1370
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:45,308
We'll see about that!

1371
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,768
McQueen's going inside!

1372
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,691
- Chick and King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1373
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,330
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1374
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:10,082
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1375
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,752
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1376
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:19,342
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1377
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,469
Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers!

1378
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,724
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1379
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:38,194
No!

1380
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,006
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1381
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:02,760
I won, baby! Yeah! Yeah!

1382
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:07,181
What's he up to, Doc?

1383
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:19,235
What are you doin', kid?

1384
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:22,238
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1385
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:28,661
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1386
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,789
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1387
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,291
It's just an empty cup.

1388
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,838
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1389
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:42,383
He's not really pushin' him.
He's just givin' him a little bump draft.

1390
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,719
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1391
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,555
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1392
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,849
That's what I call racin'.

1393
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,160
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1394
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,871
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1395
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:14,123
Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.

1396
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,167
That's my hot rod.

1397
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:21,630
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1398
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:23,507
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1399
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:26,093
Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1400
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:29,597
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me?

1401
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,766
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1402
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:35,352
Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1403
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:38,314
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1404
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,191
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1405
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:45,279
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1406
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,698
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1407
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:56,123
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1408
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:00,419
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1409
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,588
You're The King! Yeah!

1410
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,435
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1411
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,233
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1412
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,068
Thanks, Doc.

1413
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:27,071
Hey, Lightnin'.

1414
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,406
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1415
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:33,369
Son, that was some real racin' out there.

1416
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,372
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1417
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:42,503
But I didn't win.

1418
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:46,257
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1419
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:49,218
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street,

1420
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:52,763
buzzards used to circle the car!

1421
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:55,099
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1422
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:58,602
But these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1423
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,856
I'm gonna stick with them.

1424
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:05,317
Well, I sure can respect that.

1425
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:10,573
Still, you know, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1426
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,158
I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1427
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:17,288
Actually, there is one thing.

1428
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:24,003
Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly!

1429
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:31,468
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1430
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:38,392
I think it's about-a
time we redecorate.

1431
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:40,102
Ciao.

1432
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:44,356
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1433
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,482
to get tires.

1434
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:48,319
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1435
01:46:49,862 --> 01:46:54,742
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1436
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,494
A real Ferrari!

1437
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,663
Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face.

1438
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:02,958
This is the most glorious day of my life.

1439
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,546
Wow. Spero che
il tuo amico si riprenda.

1440
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,007
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

1441
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,025
Just passin' through?

1442
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:30,486
Actually, I thought
I'd stop and stay awhile.

1443
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:33,530
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1444
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:37,868
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1445
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:40,287
is setting up his
big racing headquarters here.

1446
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:42,998
Really? Well, there goes the town.

1447
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,542
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1448
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:50,297
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1449
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,591
blah, blah, blah.

1450
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:55,886
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,

1451
01:47:55,928 --> 01:48:00,391
K-I-S-S... I-N-T!

1452
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:02,393
Great timing, Mater!

1453
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:06,271
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1454
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:09,483
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1455
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:12,361
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1456
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:15,072
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1457
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:16,699
Nah.

1458
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:21,328
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1459
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:30,814
Choo!

1460
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:36,612
All right, everybody,
please keep together now.

1461
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:41,408
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1462
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:44,787
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1463
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:48,665
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1464
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:52,169
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1465
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:56,215
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1466
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:02,554
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1467
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,432
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1468
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:08,560
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1469
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:14,399
Doc! Doc!

1470
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:16,401
Whoo!

1471
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,071
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1472
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:39,049
Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1473
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:42,636
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1474
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,640
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1475
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:49,935
About face! Drop and give me 20 miles!

1476
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:51,895
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1477
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:54,773
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1478
01:50:57,734 --> 01:50:59,278
Look at this!

1479
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:01,822
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1480
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:04,700
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1481
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:09,621
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? choo!

1482
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:16,170
Dang.

1483
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:25,012
You are a toy car!

1484
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,725
You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.

1485
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:32,728
Yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!

1486
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:36,940
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!

1487
01:51:37,024 --> 01:51:38,984
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

1488
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:42,863
Man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1489
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,073
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1490
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:49,870
We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!

1491
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:53,790
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!

1492
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:57,920
You're still not listening!

1493
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:01,757
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?

1494
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,928
That Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1495
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,222
Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!

1496
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:09,932
Circus cars?

1497
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:12,142
How can you be circus cars?

1498
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:15,145
These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,

1499
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,897
and they're gonna make me rich!

1500
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:18,482
