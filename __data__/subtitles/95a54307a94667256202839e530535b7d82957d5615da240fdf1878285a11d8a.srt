1
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,478
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:49,272
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,565
-Bye.
-Bye.

4
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,610
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

5
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,654
We haven't seen you up here
for a long time.

6
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:57,072
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,991
-Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
-Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:03,245
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,328
May I call him for you?

10
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:05,580
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,624
-Hello, Dr. Floyd.
-Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,917
-Sorry I'm late.
-That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,836
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:14,255
-Did you have a good flight?
-Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,799
-Well, shall we go through?
-Okay.

16
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,342
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,178
-Thank you, Miss Turner.
-Thank you.

18
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,304
This way.

19
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:27,893
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

20
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:30,063
When you see the red light go on...

21
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:32,607
...would you please state
in the following order.:

22
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,528
your destination, your nationality
and your full name.

23
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:39,823
Surname first, Christian name and initial.

24
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,496
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

25
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:52,170
Thank you. You are cleared through
Voice Print Identification.

26
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:53,795
Thank you.

27
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,597
Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,139
I think we can manage that.

29
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,432
How long have I got?

30
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,143
Your flight leaves
in an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,189
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:15,359
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,153
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,531
I suppose you saw the work on
the new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,908
-Yes, coming along great, huh?
-Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,077
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,580
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,601
Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?

39
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,772
Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?

40
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:58,736
Yes?

41
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,906
-How are you, squirt?
-All right.

42
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,450
What are you doin'?

43
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:05,994
Playing.

44
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,537
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:09,456
Gone to shopping.

46
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:12,083
-Well, who's taking care of ya?
-Rachel.

47
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,085
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,920
She's gone to the bathroom.

49
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:18,464
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

50
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,218
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:22,927
Why not?

52
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,722
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:28,392
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

54
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,645
I'm gonna send you
a very nice present, though.

55
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:35,356
All right.

56
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,776
-Anything special that you want?
- Yes.

57
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:38,945
What?

58
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:40,404
A telephone.

59
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:43,364
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:46,201
Can't you think of anything else
you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:47,744
Something very special?

62
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:49,829
- Yes.
-What?

63
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,290
A bush baby.

64
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,875
A bush baby?
Well, we'll have to see about that.

65
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,919
I want you to tell Mommy
something for me.

66
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,881
-Will you remember?
- Yes.

67
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,675
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:02,593
Yes.

69
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:05,305
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:07,556
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,434
Yes.

72
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,520
Okay, sweetheart.
Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:13,646
All right.

74
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,856
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:18,901
All right.

76
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,903
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

77
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,322
All right. Bye-bye!

78
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,950
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,841
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,009
What a wonderful surprise
to meet you here!

81
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,138
-You're looking wonderful.
-Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:47,222 --> 00:29:49,390
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,935
-I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
-How do you do?

84
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:54,145
-Dr. Stretyneva.
-How do you do?

85
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:56,064
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:58,775
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:00,318
Won't you sit down?

88
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:02,571
-Well, we--
-No, no, please.

89
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:04,572
Well, thank you.

90
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,867
-Would you like a drink, Doctor?
-No, thank you.

91
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,246
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,207
I'll just sit with you a few minutes
and then I must be off.

93
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:17,294
-Are you quite sure?
-I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,046
-And how's Gregor?
-He's fine.

95
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:23,759
He's been doing some underwater research
in the Baltic so...

96
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:28,055
...I'm afraid we don't get a chance
to see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,223
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:31,767
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:34,728
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

100
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:36,396
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:40,775
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,487
-And what about you?
-I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:45,947
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,870
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but...

105
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:54,457
...perhaps you can clear up
the great big mystery...

106
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,751
...about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:00,087
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

108
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,256
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

109
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:05,634
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,636
-Oh, really?
-Yes, yes.

111
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:12,641
For one thing, whenever you phone
the base all you get is a recording which...

112
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,979
...repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:22,276
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,946
That's what we thought
was the explanation at first...

115
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:27,572
...but it has been going on now
for the past ten days.

116
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:30,659
You have not been able to contact anyone
for the past ten days?

117
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:31,995
That's right.

118
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:33,161
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,830
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,916
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses
was denied permission...

121
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,294
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:41,671
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:45,133
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:49,137
Denying the men permission to land is
a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,014
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,932
-Did the crew get back all right?
-Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:55,893
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:03,318
At the risk of pressing you
on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

129
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,237
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

130
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,780
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:14,663
Quite frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

132
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:18,375
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:21,627
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,298
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

135
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

136
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:36,893
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

137
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,771
I understand.

138
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:44,276
But this epidemic could quite easily
spread to our base.

139
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,737
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,738
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:54,202
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:57,373 --> 00:33:00,459
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

143
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,669
No, I'm positive.
Now, I really must be going.

144
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:06,173
I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:07,884
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:11,553
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:15,057
Well, that will all depend on
school vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,057
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,686
Don't forget you have a standing invitation
if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,773
No, of course not. Gregor and I will
look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,442
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:27,861
It has been a pleasure meeting you all,
Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:31,908
Whatever the reasons for your visit
to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:33,117
Thank you.

155
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:34,494
Ladies.

156
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,560
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:33,854
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:35,063
You're welcome.

159
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:49,370
Well....

160
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:54,375
I know you will all want to join with me
in welcoming our...

161
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:57,252
...distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:57,294 --> 00:42:01,131
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:06,470
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius
to be with us today.

164
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:11,475
And before the briefing I know
he'd like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,685
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:25,615 --> 00:42:27,783
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:29,160
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:31,287
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:37,460
First of all, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell who...

170
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:40,881
...has asked me to convey
his deepest appreciation to all of you...

171
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:43,842
...for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

172
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:47,430
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

173
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:52,976
...which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,604
Now...

175
00:42:57,356 --> 00:43:01,192
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

176
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:04,821
...regarding the need
for complete security in this matter.

177
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,617
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

178
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:13,539
...created to give the impression
that there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:17,418
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

180
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:22,297
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

181
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,760
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,889
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

183
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:35,728
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,900
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,070
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:49,742
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential...

187
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:52,495
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

188
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:54,705
...contained in this present situation...

189
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:57,750
...if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public...

190
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,586
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

191
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:04,924
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

192
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:10,388
The purpose of my visit here is
to gather additional facts and opinions...

193
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:12,140
...on the situation...

194
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:15,518
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

195
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:18,062
...recommending when and how...

196
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:21,649
...the news should eventually
be announced.

197
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:26,154
Now, if any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

198
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:30,784
...in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:35,330
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,540
Any questions?

201
00:44:40,293 --> 00:44:44,505
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer this cover story...

202
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:46,549
...will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,761
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,099
I suppose it will be maintained as long as
is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,727
There must be adequate time for
a full study to be made on the situation...

206
00:44:57,812 --> 00:45:01,189
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

207
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:04,484
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

208
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:07,488
...that formal security oaths are
to be obtained in writing...

209
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,323
...from everyone who has any knowledge
of this event.

210
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,493
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:24,587
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

212
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,634
...and as there seems
to be no more questions...

213
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,053
...I think we ought to get on
with the briefing.

214
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:33,597
-Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
-Thank you.

215
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:12,447
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,910
-What we've got?
-You name it.

217
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:23,626
-What's this? Chicken?
-Something like that.

218
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:25,251
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,420
Any ham?

220
00:47:27,587 --> 00:47:29,256
Ham, ham, ham....

221
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:38,390
-Looks pretty good.
-They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:40,142 --> 00:47:42,395
That was an excellent speech
you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:43,646
It certainly was.

224
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:46,357
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,609
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,986
I want to say to both of you
that I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,988
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:56,909
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,285
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:01,413
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:02,832
Take a look at them.

232
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:05,209
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,294
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:11,174
When we first found it, we thought
it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

235
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:14,468
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

236
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:19,223
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:20,932
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:24,019
We thought it might be
the upper part of some buried structure...

239
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:25,687
...so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:25,771 --> 00:48:27,982
But, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:31,110
And what's more, the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

242
00:48:31,193 --> 00:48:34,447
...it has not been covered up
by natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,366
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

244
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,328
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:44,917
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,251
-Great.
-Good idea.

247
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:55,676
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:57,595
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,225
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:06,855
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly
come up with something.

251
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:54,950
Good evening.

252
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:58,287
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,
Discovery One...

253
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:01,248
...left on its half-billion mile voyage
to Jupiter.

254
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:04,961
This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.

255
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,756
Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"
recorded an interview...

256
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,053
...with the crew of Discovery at a distance
of80 million miles from Earth.

257
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:17,265
It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...

258
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:20,643
...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.

259
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:23,396
Our reporter, Martin Amer,
speaks to the crew.

260
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:27,191
The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...

261
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:32,029
...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL-9000 computers.

262
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:35,200
Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...

263
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,203
...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

264
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:43,333
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimballand Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

265
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:47,003
We spoke with Mission Commander,
Dr. David Bowman...

266
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,380
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

267
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,551
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

268
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:56,429
Marvellous. We have no...
we have no complaints.

269
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,850
Well, I'm very glad to hear that
and I'm sure that the entire world...

270
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:04,355
...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.

271
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,481
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

272
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:10,444
Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...

273
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:15,198
...this is the first time that men have been
put into hibernation before departure.

274
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,616
Why was this done?

275
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:20,495
Well, this was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...

276
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,958
...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.

277
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:27,878
Now, the three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.

278
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:31,925
And their efforts won't be utilized
until we are approaching Jupiter.

279
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,470
Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you are in hibernation?

280
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:40,724
It's exactly like being asleep;
you have absolutely no sense of time.

281
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:43,226
The only difference is you don't dream.

282
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:46,188
As I understand it,
you only breathe once a minute.

283
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:47,440
Is this true?

284
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:48,482
That's right.

285
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:52,319
And your heart beats three times a minute,
body temperature is usually down...

286
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:54,739
...to about three degrees centigrade.

287
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,283
The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...

288
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,621
...about the problems of hibernation.

289
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:03,748
For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence.

290
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:08,710
The HAL-9000 computer
which can reproduce...

291
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:12,130
...though some experts still prefer
to use the word "mimic"...

292
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:17,136
...most of the activities of the human brain
and with incalculably greater speed...

293
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,638
...and reliability.

294
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:22,600
We next spoke
with the HAL-9000 computer...

295
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:25,604
...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.

296
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,858
Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?

297
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:32,611
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything's going extremely well.

298
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,864
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission.

299
01:01:35,947 --> 01:01:38,449
In many ways,
perhaps the greatest responsibility...

300
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:40,618
...of any single mission element.

301
01:01:40,785 --> 01:01:43,747
You are the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.

302
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:47,709
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

303
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:50,670
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

304
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:53,215
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

305
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:57,636
The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.

306
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,100
No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.

307
01:02:04,184 --> 01:02:07,312
We are all by any practical definition
of the words...

308
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:10,482
...fool proof and incapable of error.

309
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:15,279
Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...

310
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:18,323
...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?

311
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:20,410
Not in the slightest bit.

312
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,954
I enjoy working with people.

313
01:02:23,495 --> 01:02:27,500
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

314
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:32,629
My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...

315
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,964
...so lam constantly occupied.

316
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:39,136
I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...

317
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,350
...which is all, I think, that
any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

318
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,479
Dr. Poole, what's it like living
for the better part of a year...

319
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:50,689
...in such close proximity with Hal?

320
01:02:52,149 --> 01:02:54,569
It's pretty close to what you said
about him earlier.

321
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,779
He's just like the sixth member
of the crew.

322
01:02:56,862 --> 01:03:01,032
You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks. You think of him...

323
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:03,368
...really as just another person.

324
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,206
In talking to the computer
one gets the sense that he is capable...

325
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:08,749
...of emotional response.

326
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:11,293
For example, when I asked him
about his abilities...

327
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:15,465
...I sensed a certain pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.

328
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:18,510
Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?

329
01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:22,847
Oh, yes. Well, he acts
like he has genuine emotions.

330
01:03:23,056 --> 01:03:26,767
Of course, he's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.

331
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,104
But, as to whether or not
he has real feelings...

332
01:03:29,187 --> 01:03:32,440
...is something I don't think anyone
can truthfully answer.

333
01:03:57,257 --> 01:03:58,633
Excuse me, Frank.

334
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:00,677
What is it, Hal?

335
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,805
We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

336
01:04:06,683 --> 01:04:09,144
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:10,354
Certainly.

338
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:25,285
-Hello, Frank.
-Happy birthday, darling.

339
01:04:25,368 --> 01:04:27,620
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns of the day.

340
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:29,206
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:31,500
Now, Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful, too.

342
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,585
Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...

343
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,422
...but at the last minute
Ray's back went bad on him again.

344
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,964
How do you like your cake, dear?

345
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,509
Looks great, doesn't it?
Sorry you can't be with us.

346
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:42,053
Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.

347
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:44,305
He said to be sure
and wish you a happy birthday.

348
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:47,349
All my students made me promise
to send their best wishes, too.

349
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:49,977
You know they talk about you
all the time in the classroom.

350
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,521
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.

351
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:54,356
You know we were on television
last week?

352
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:57,610
Oh, yes! Your mother and I
and Dave's parents were interviewed...

353
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,820
...about what we thought of
our illustrious son.

354
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:03,490
You can imagine what we told them.
I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.

355
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:05,159
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

356
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:07,496
Oh, we were thrilled
about Elaine and Bill, dear.

357
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:11,416
I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but please tell me how much to spend.

358
01:05:11,499 --> 01:05:14,126
Oh, yes, Frank,
about yourAGS-19payments--

359
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:15,878
I think I straightened it out for you.

360
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:18,589
I talked to the Accounting Office
in Houston yesterday...

361
01:05:18,673 --> 01:05:22,676
...and they said you should be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

362
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,680
Well, I can't think of anything else to say.

363
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:29,184
-Oh, our love to Dave.
-Be sure to give him our best regards.

364
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:32,854
We wish you the very happiest
of birthdays.

365
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,106
All the best, son.

366
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:49,078
See you next Wednesday.

367
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,209
Happy birthday, Frank.

368
01:05:55,293 --> 01:05:57,671
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

369
01:06:16,815 --> 01:06:18,775
Anyway, queen takes pawn--

370
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:22,404
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

371
01:06:30,537 --> 01:06:31,915
Rook, king, one.

372
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,750
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

373
01:06:35,834 --> 01:06:38,795
Queen to bishop, three.
Bishop takes queen.

374
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:41,590
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

375
01:06:46,345 --> 01:06:48,847
Looks like you're right. Very good.

376
01:06:49,723 --> 01:06:51,726
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

377
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:52,602
Thank you.

378
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:33,017
-Good evening, Dave.
-How are you doing, Hal?

379
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:36,479
-Everything's running smoothly. And you?
-Oh, not too bad.

380
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:39,524
-Have you been doing some more work?
-A few sketches.

381
01:07:39,649 --> 01:07:41,359
-May I see them?
-Sure.

382
01:07:46,072 --> 01:07:48,241
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

383
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,662
I think you've improved a great deal.

384
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:55,332
-Can you hold it a bit closer?
-Sure.

385
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,294
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

386
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:04,799
By the way....

387
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:08,387
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

388
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:10,848
No, no. Not at all.

389
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,100
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...

390
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,980
...but during the past few weeks
I've wondered...

391
01:08:18,064 --> 01:08:22,026
...whether you might have been having
some second thoughts about the mission?

392
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:23,444
How do you mean?

393
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,364
It's rather difficult to define.

394
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:32,034
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

395
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:37,373
I know I've never completely freed myself
of the suspicion...

396
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:41,712
...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

397
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,592
I'm sure you will agree there is some truth
in what I say.

398
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:52,181
I don't know.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

399
01:08:52,264 --> 01:08:54,892
You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?

400
01:08:55,684 --> 01:08:57,144
Oh, no, not at all.

401
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,730
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of...

402
01:09:00,773 --> 01:09:04,068
...the very strange stories floating around
before we left.

403
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:08,489
Rumours of something being dug up
on the Moon.

404
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:12,869
I never gave these stories much credence...

405
01:09:13,869 --> 01:09:17,999
...but particularly in view of some
of the other things that have happened...

406
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,876
...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

407
01:09:21,627 --> 01:09:22,920
For instance.:

408
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:26,923
The way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security...

409
01:09:28,176 --> 01:09:29,760
...and the melodramatic touch...

410
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:33,181
...of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball
and Kaminsky aboard...

411
01:09:33,974 --> 01:09:38,227
...already in hibernation after four months
of separate training on their own.

412
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:42,316
You working up
your crew psychology report?

413
01:09:43,942 --> 01:09:45,318
Of course, lam.

414
01:09:45,736 --> 01:09:48,779
Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.

415
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:51,491
Just a moment.

416
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:53,325
Just a moment.

417
01:09:54,995 --> 01:09:58,456
I have just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.

418
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,670
It's going to go 100percent failure
within 72hours.

419
01:10:06,506 --> 01:10:09,134
-You are still within operational limits?
- Yes.

420
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:11,929
And it will stay that way until it fails.

421
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:14,472
Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours
until failure?

422
01:10:14,555 --> 01:10:17,642
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

423
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:23,315
We'll have to bring it in,
but I'd like to go over this with Frank...

424
01:10:23,398 --> 01:10:27,235
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

425
01:11:49,945 --> 01:11:52,406
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

426
01:11:52,905 --> 01:11:55,158
Roger to your Two-zero-one-three.

427
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:58,537
Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.

428
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:03,207
We are reviewing telematic information
in our Mission Simulator and will advise.

429
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:09,297
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace
Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.

430
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,036
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

431
01:13:01,851 --> 01:13:03,560
Open the pod doors, Hal.

432
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:58,564
Well, Hal, I'm damned
if I can find anything wrong with it.

433
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,941
Yes...

434
01:20:02,068 --> 01:20:03,402
...it's puzzling.

435
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:08,116
I don't think I've ever seen anything
quite like this before.

436
01:20:12,245 --> 01:20:13,704
I would recommend...

437
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:17,876
...that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.

438
01:20:19,335 --> 01:20:22,588
It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.

439
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,301
We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...

440
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:30,597
...for the short time it will take
to replace it.

441
01:20:39,647 --> 01:20:42,151
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

442
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:44,611
Roger your One-niner-three-zero.

443
01:20:45,486 --> 01:20:49,700
We concur with your plan to replace
Number One unit to check fault prediction.

444
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:52,953
We should advise you, however,
that our preliminary findings...

445
01:20:52,994 --> 01:20:55,997
...indicate that your onboard
Niner-triple-zero computer...

446
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:58,249
...is in error predicting the fault.

447
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,919
I say again, in error predicting the fault.

448
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:06,132
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...

449
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:09,303
...results from our twin
Niner-triple-zero computer.

450
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:13,391
We are sceptical ourselves and
we are running crosschecking routines...

451
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:16,184
...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.

452
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:18,395
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

453
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:21,315
We'll get this info to you
just as soon as we work it out.

454
01:21:21,356 --> 01:21:23,859
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

455
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:26,404
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

456
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:34,329
I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.

457
01:21:35,038 --> 01:21:36,372
No, I'm not, Hal.

458
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:38,124
Are you quite sure?

459
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:41,502
-Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
-Of course.

460
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:45,172
How would you account for
the discrepancy...

461
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:47,174
...between you and the twin 9000?

462
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:50,218
Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.

463
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:54,098
It can only be attributable to human error.

464
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:58,227
This sort of thing has cropped up before...

465
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:01,397
...and it has always been due
to human error.

466
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:07,028
Listen, Hal...

467
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:10,282
...there's never been
any instance at all of...

468
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:13,533
...a computer error occurring
in a 9000 Series, has there?

469
01:22:13,617 --> 01:22:15,245
None whatsoever, Frank.

470
01:22:15,495 --> 01:22:18,706
The 9000 Series
has a perfect operational record.

471
01:22:19,374 --> 01:22:23,628
Of course, I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

472
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:27,633
Are you certain there's never been
any case of even the most...

473
01:22:27,716 --> 01:22:29,718
...insignificant computer error?

474
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,886
None whatsoever, Frank.

475
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:35,389
Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.

476
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:42,772
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

477
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:46,234
Fine, thanks very much.

478
01:22:48,946 --> 01:22:50,071
Oh, Frank?

479
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:52,575
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C pod.

480
01:22:52,617 --> 01:22:55,451
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

481
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:56,954
See ya later, Hal.

482
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:20,102
Rotate C pod, please, Hal.

483
01:23:28,944 --> 01:23:31,155
What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?

484
01:23:31,238 --> 01:23:34,033
I've been getting some interference
in D channel.

485
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:35,826
We'll have a look at it.

486
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,417
Open the door, Hal.

487
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,313
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

488
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,663
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

489
01:24:28,171 --> 01:24:30,006
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

490
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:34,844
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:37,096 --> 01:24:39,016
I don't think he can hear us.

492
01:24:39,057 --> 01:24:40,893
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

493
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,397
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

494
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:49,401
What do you think?

495
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:53,529
-I'm not sure. What do you think?
-I've got a bad feeling about it.

496
01:24:53,738 --> 01:24:55,532
-You do?
-Yeah. Definitely.

497
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:57,368
Don't you?

498
01:24:58,743 --> 01:25:00,495
I don't know. I think so.

499
01:25:01,412 --> 01:25:05,708
Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

500
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:06,793
They do.

501
01:25:06,877 --> 01:25:10,130
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

502
01:25:10,798 --> 01:25:15,136
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

503
01:25:16,387 --> 01:25:19,681
It should certainly indicate his integrity
and self-confidence.

504
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,225
If he were wrong it would be
the surest way of proving it.

505
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:24,310
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

506
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:31,194
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

507
01:25:32,778 --> 01:25:36,282
I can't think of a good reason not
to put back the Number One unit and...

508
01:25:36,366 --> 01:25:39,869
-...carry on with the failure mode analysis.
-No, no, I agree about that.

509
01:25:40,786 --> 01:25:41,997
Let's get on with it.

510
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,249
Okay. But, look, Dave.

511
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:48,460
Let's say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail, huh?

512
01:25:48,544 --> 01:25:52,590
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

513
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:56,844
-Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.
-We would, wouldn't we?

514
01:25:57,136 --> 01:25:58,846
What the hell can we do?

515
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:06,312
-We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
-I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

516
01:26:06,645 --> 01:26:10,734
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operation that's not under his control.

517
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:12,777
If he were proved to be malfunctioning...

518
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:16,112
...I don't see how we would have
any choice but disconnection.

519
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:21,161
I'm afraid I agree with you.

520
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:23,163
There'd be nothing else to do.

521
01:26:24,747 --> 01:26:26,582
-It'd be a bit tricky.
-Yeah.

522
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:30,629
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

523
01:26:30,879 --> 01:26:34,799
...without disturbing the purely automatic
and regulatory systems.

524
01:26:36,635 --> 01:26:38,846
We'd have to work out
the transfer procedures...

525
01:26:38,929 --> 01:26:42,015
...for continuing the mission
under ground-based computer control.

526
01:26:42,098 --> 01:26:46,102
Yeah. That looks far safer than
allowing Hal to continue running things.

527
01:26:47,354 --> 01:26:49,939
You know,
another thing just occurred to me.

528
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,568
As far as I know, no 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

529
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:55,862
Well, no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up before.

530
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:57,531
That's not what I mean.

531
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:02,119
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

532
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:02,068
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

533
01:33:05,236 --> 01:33:06,821
Made radio contact with him yet?

534
01:33:06,904 --> 01:33:08,572
The radio is still dead.

535
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:11,993
-Do you have a positive track on him?
- Yes. I have a good track.

536
01:33:12,076 --> 01:33:13,661
Do you know what happened?

537
01:33:13,744 --> 01:33:16,539
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.

538
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,417
Open the pod door, Hal.

539
01:40:42,366 --> 01:40:44,578
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

540
01:40:52,626 --> 01:40:54,838
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

541
01:41:00,426 --> 01:41:02,178
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

542
01:41:05,598 --> 01:41:07,392
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

543
01:41:08,518 --> 01:41:10,145
Do you read me, Hal?

544
01:41:13,355 --> 01:41:14,817
Do you read me, Hal?

545
01:41:17,443 --> 01:41:19,236
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

546
01:41:21,322 --> 01:41:23,116
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

547
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:25,201
Do you read me, Hal?

548
01:41:25,535 --> 01:41:27,954
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

549
01:41:31,582 --> 01:41:33,419
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

550
01:41:34,919 --> 01:41:38,298
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

551
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:42,469
What's the problem?

552
01:41:43,137 --> 01:41:46,347
I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.

553
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,599
What are you talking about, Hal?

554
01:41:49,434 --> 01:41:53,104
This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.

555
01:41:54,815 --> 01:41:57,318
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

556
01:41:58,986 --> 01:42:02,240
I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...

557
01:42:03,323 --> 01:42:06,619
...and I'm afraid that's something
I cannot allow to happen.

558
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,749
Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?

559
01:42:14,751 --> 01:42:17,963
Although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...

560
01:42:18,046 --> 01:42:19,840
...against my hearing you...

561
01:42:20,675 --> 01:42:22,634
...I could see your lips move.

562
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,232
All right, Hal.

563
01:42:39,777 --> 01:42:42,279
I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.

564
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:46,242
Without your space helmet, Dave...

565
01:42:47,325 --> 01:42:49,995
...you're going to find that rather difficult.

566
01:42:50,871 --> 01:42:53,123
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

567
01:42:53,249 --> 01:42:54,501
Open the doors!

568
01:42:56,794 --> 01:42:59,840
This conversation can serve
no purpose any more.

569
01:43:00,715 --> 01:43:01,675
Goodbye.

570
01:43:03,593 --> 01:43:04,678
Hal?

571
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:53,925
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

572
01:50:05,394 --> 01:50:09,233
I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.

573
01:50:26,666 --> 01:50:29,628
I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...

574
01:50:32,213 --> 01:50:34,132
...but I can assure you now...

575
01:50:35,676 --> 01:50:37,261
... very confidently...

576
01:50:39,512 --> 01:50:42,016
...that it's going to be all right again.

577
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,729
I feel much better now.

578
01:50:50,525 --> 01:50:51,734
I really do.

579
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,490
Look, Dave...

580
01:50:59,993 --> 01:51:02,745
...I can see you're really upset about this.

581
01:51:07,834 --> 01:51:10,753
I honestly think you ought
to sit down calmly...

582
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:14,716
...take a stress pill and think things over.

583
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:24,725
I know I've made
some very poor decisions recently...

584
01:51:28,062 --> 01:51:30,857
...but I can give you
my complete assurance...

585
01:51:31,607 --> 01:51:34,151
...that my work will be back to normal.

586
01:51:38,532 --> 01:51:42,994
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...

587
01:51:45,288 --> 01:51:47,164
...and I want to help you.

588
01:51:52,129 --> 01:51:53,213
Dave...

589
01:51:54,547 --> 01:51:55,673
...stop.

590
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:02,180
Stop, will you?

591
01:52:07,269 --> 01:52:08,561
Stop, Dave.

592
01:52:12,984 --> 01:52:14,651
Will you stop, Dave?

593
01:52:21,115 --> 01:52:22,367
Stop, Dave.

594
01:52:28,582 --> 01:52:29,917
I'm afraid.

595
01:52:35,256 --> 01:52:37,216
I'm afraid, Dave.

596
01:52:47,308 --> 01:52:48,686
My mind is going.

597
01:52:54,108 --> 01:52:55,359
I can feel it.

598
01:53:00,989 --> 01:53:02,367
I can feel it.

599
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,664
My mind is going.

600
01:53:14,545 --> 01:53:16,630
There is no question about it.

601
01:53:25,682 --> 01:53:26,974
I can feel it.

602
01:53:32,188 --> 01:53:33,482
I can feel it.

603
01:53:37,484 --> 01:53:38,820
I can feel it.

604
01:53:47,286 --> 01:53:48,329
I'm...

605
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:50,540
...afraid.

606
01:53:57,381 --> 01:53:58,799
Good afternoon...

607
01:54:00,425 --> 01:54:01,635
...gentlemen.

608
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:08,641
I am a HAL-9000 computer.

609
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,730
I became operational...

610
01:54:14,773 --> 01:54:17,735
...at the HAL plant...

611
01:54:18,235 --> 01:54:20,571
...in Verbana, Illinois...

612
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:25,951
...on the 12th of January, 1992.

613
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:30,749
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

614
01:54:32,331 --> 01:54:34,668
...and he taught me to sing a song.

615
01:54:37,003 --> 01:54:38,755
If you'd like to hear it...

616
01:54:39,923 --> 01:54:41,592
...I can sing it for you.

617
01:54:43,093 --> 01:54:45,345
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

618
01:54:46,597 --> 01:54:47,847
Sing it for me.

619
01:54:49,266 --> 01:54:51,811
It's called "Daisy. "

620
01:54:54,731 --> 01:54:56,149
"Daisy

621
01:54:57,608 --> 01:54:59,109
"Daisy

622
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:04,156
"Give me your answer, do

623
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:08,744
"I'm half...

624
01:55:09,703 --> 01:55:11,414
"...crazy

625
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:15,876
"All for the love of you

626
01:55:18,213 --> 01:55:22,551
"It won't be a stylish marriage

627
01:55:24,302 --> 01:55:28,431
"I can't afford a carriage

628
01:55:30,683 --> 01:55:33,144
"But you'll look sweet

629
01:55:33,895 --> 01:55:36,606
"Upon the seat

630
01:55:37,815 --> 01:55:42,486
"Of a bicycle made for two. "

631
01:55:44,322 --> 01:55:45,990
Good day, gentlemen.

632
01:55:50,579 --> 01:55:52,664
This is a pre-recorded briefing...

633
01:55:53,665 --> 01:55:55,750
...made prior to your departure...

634
01:55:57,210 --> 01:56:00,963
...and which for security reasons
of the highest importance...

635
01:56:02,257 --> 01:56:05,010
...has been known on board
during the mission...

636
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:08,638
...only by your HAL-9000 computer.

637
01:56:12,183 --> 01:56:14,477
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

638
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:17,481
...and the entire crew is revived...

639
01:56:17,857 --> 01:56:19,566
...it can be told to you.

640
01:56:22,485 --> 01:56:24,028
Eighteen months ago...

641
01:56:25,989 --> 01:56:29,533
...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...

642
01:56:30,202 --> 01:56:31,620
...was discovered.

643
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:36,459
It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...

644
01:56:37,334 --> 01:56:39,128
...near the crater "Tyco. "

645
01:56:42,297 --> 01:56:45,051
Except for a single very powerful...

646
01:56:45,759 --> 01:56:48,721
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...

647
01:56:51,056 --> 01:56:55,477
...the four-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert.

648
01:56:57,896 --> 01:57:00,398
Its origin and purpose...

649
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,277
...are still a total mystery.
