1
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,073
Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,408
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,953
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,789
"I'm through, never again, too dangerous.“

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,041
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,377
But you forget about it in a day or two.

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,230
Yeah, well,
the days of me forgetting are over,

8
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,214
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,359
You know when you go on like this
what you sound like?

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,819
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
that's what I sound like.

11
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,683
You sound like a duck.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,823
Take heart, cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again,

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,743
'cause since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to hear me quack

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,144
- about how I'm never gonna do it again.
- After tonight.

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,772
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

16
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,857
Can I get anyone more coffee?

17
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,901
Oh, yes.

18
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,237
Thank you.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,697
You're welcome.

20
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,616
I mean, the way it is now,

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
you're taking the same risk
as when you Rob a bank.

22
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,663
Taking more of a risk. Banks are easier.

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,708
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

24
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,751
They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

25
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,254
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

26
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,841
I heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,259
He gives the phone to the teller,

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,154
bloke on the other end of the phone says,
"we got this guy's little girl.

29
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,532
If you don't give him all your money,
we're gonna kill her."

30
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,349
- Did it work?
- Fucking right, it worked.

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,145
That's what I'm talking about. Knucklehead
walks into a bank with a telephone.

32
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,356
Not a pistol, not a shotgun,
a fucking phone.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,984
Cleans the place out.
They don't even lift a fucking finger.

34
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,777
Did they hurt the little girl?

35
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,381
I don't know. There probably never was
a little girl in the first place.

36
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,008
The point of the story
isn't the little girl.

37
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,072
The point of the story is,

38
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,876
- they robbed a bank with a telephone.
- Hmm.

39
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,680
- You want to Rob banks?
- I'm not saying I want to Rob banks.

40
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,391
I'm just illustrating if we did,
it'd be easier than what we been doing.

41
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,750
And no more liquor stores?

42
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,586
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

43
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,272
Besides, it ain't
the giggle it used to be.

44
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,940
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

45
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,067
Vietnamese, Koreans,
they don't even speak fucking English.

46
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,945
Tell 'em, "empty out the register,"
they don't know what you're talking about.

47
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,179
They make it too personal.

48
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,616
We keep on, one of these gook fucker's
gonna make us kill him.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,058
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,684
I don't want to kill anybody, either.

51
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,479
But they'll probably put us in a situation
where it's us or them.

52
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,269
And if it's not the gooks,

53
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,609
it's these old fucking Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

54
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,320
You got grandpa Irving
sitting behind the counter

55
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,780
with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

56
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,133
Try walking into one of those places
with nothing but a phone,

57
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,594
see how far that gets you.
Fuck it. Forget it. We're out of it.

58
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,495
Yeah, well, what then? Day jobs?

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,039
- Not in this life.
- What, then?

60
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,668
Garcon, coffee!

61
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,419
This place.

62
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,757
"Garcon“ means “boy."

63
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,554
This place?

64
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,264
A coffee shop?

65
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,683
What's wrong with that?

66
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,311
Nobody ever robs restaurants.

67
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,021
Why not?

68
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,442
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations.

69
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,195
You'll get your head blown off
sticking up one of them.

70
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,030
Restaurants, on the other hand,

71
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,824
you catch with their pants down.

72
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,867
They're not expecting to get robbed.

73
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,244
Not as expecting, anyway.

74
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,248
I bet you could cut down
on the hero factor in a place like this.

75
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,332
Correct.

76
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,627
Same as banks, these places are insured.

77
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,046
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

78
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,192
He's just trying to get you out the door
before you start plugging the diners.

79
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,759
Waitresses? Fucking forget it.

80
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,095
No way they're taking a bullet
for the register.

81
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,181
Busboys, some wetback
getting paid $1.50 an hour,

82
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,642
really give a fuck
you're stealing from the owner?

83
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,578
Customers sitting there
with food in their mouths,

84
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,871
they don't know what's going on.

85
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,540
One minute they're having a Denver omelet,

86
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,774
next minute someone's sticking
a gun in their face.

87
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,153
See, I got the idea

88
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,447
last liquor store we stuck up. Remember?

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,948
All the customers kept coming in?

90
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,450
Yeah.

91
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,202
- You got the idea taking their wallets.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,079
- Now, that was a good idea.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,349
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

94
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,624
Yes, we did.

95
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,228
A lot of people come into restaurants.

96
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,878
A lot of wallets.

97
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,921
Pretty smart, huh?

98
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,048
Pretty smart.

99
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,595
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

100
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,846
Come on.

101
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,972
All right.

102
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,183
Same as last time, remember?

103
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,978
- You're crowd control. I handle employees.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,109
I love you, pumpkin.

105
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,736
I love you, honey bunny.

106
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,114
Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!

107
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,451
Any of you fucking pricks move,

108
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,371
and I'll execute
every motherfucking last one of you!

109
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,318
J” jungle boogie j”

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,445
j” jungle boogie j”

111
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,529
j” get it on j”

112
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,739
j” jungle boogie j”

113
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,909
-j” jungle boogie j”
-j” gel if on j”

114
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,244
-j” jungle boogie j”
-j” get up with the boogie j”

115
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,538
-j” jungle boogie j”
-j” get up with the get down j”

116
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,707
-j” jungle boogie j”
-j” gel down with the boogie j”

117
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,251
-j” jungle boogie j”
-j” come and shake it around j”

118
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,219
Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.

119
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,554
Okay. What you want to know?

120
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,847
Hash is legal there, right?

121
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,766
Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

122
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,062
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint, and start puffing away.

123
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,315
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

124
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,401
- And those are hash bars?
- Yeah, it breaks down like this, okay?

125
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,612
It's legal to buy it,
it's legal to own it,

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,032
and if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

127
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,785
It's legal to carry it,
but that doesn't matter.

128
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,536
'Cause, get a load of this, all right?

129
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,749
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

130
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,418
I mean, that's a right
the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

131
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,004
Oh, man, I'm going.
That's all there is to it.

132
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,299
- I'm fucking going.
- I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

133
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,886
But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,138
- What?
- It's the little differences.

135
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,890
I mean, they got the same shit over there

136
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,452
that they got here, but it's just...
Just there it's a little different.

137
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,019
- Example.
- All right,

138
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,189
well, you can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

139
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,191
And I don't mean just,
like, in no paper cup.

140
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,985
I'm talking about a glass of beer.

141
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,946
And in Paris, you can
buy a beer at McDonald's.

142
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,409
And you know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?

143
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,661
They don't call it
a quarter pounder with cheese?

144
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,598
Got the metric system there. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter pounder is.

145
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,832
What do they call it?

146
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,501
They call it a "royale with cheese."

147
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,837
- "Royale with cheese."
- That's right.

148
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,046
What do they call a big Mac?

149
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,425
Well, big Mac's a big Mac,
but they call it "le big Mac."

150
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,968
"Le big Mac."

151
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,971
What do they call a whopper?

152
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,015
I don't know.
I didn't go into burger king.

153
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,736
You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?

154
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,311
- What?
- Mayonnaise.

155
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,313
Goddamn!

156
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,732
I've seen 'em do it, man.

157
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,818
- They fucking drown 'em in that shit.
- Ugh.

158
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,157
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

159
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,953
How many up there?

160
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,580
Three or four.

161
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,165
That's counting our guy?

162
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,875
I'm not sure.

163
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,961
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

164
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,171
It's possible.

165
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,965
We should have fucking shotguns.

166
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,884
- What's her name?
- Mia.

167
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,970
Mia. How did marsellus and her meet?

168
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,307
I don't know. However people meet people.

169
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,933
She used to be an actress.

170
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,561
Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?

171
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,314
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

172
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
Pilot? What's a pilot?

173
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,567
Well, you know the shows on TV?

174
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,402
I don't watch TV.

175
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,031
Yeah, but you are aware that there's
an invention called television,

176
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,492
and on this invention,
they show shows, right?

177
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
Yeah.

178
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,370
Well, the way they pick TV shows is,
they make one show.

179
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,914
That show's called a pilot.

180
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,333
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows,

181
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,896
and on the strength of that one show,

182
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,795
they decide if they
want to make more shows.

183
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,464
Some get chosen and become
television programs.

184
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,633
Some don't, become nothing.

185
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,677
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

186
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,722
You remember Antwan rockamora?

187
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,559
Half-black, half-Samoan,
used to call him "Tony rocky horror"?

188
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,061
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

189
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,146
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

190
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,042
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's the nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

191
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,151
Yeah, I think I know who you mean.
What about him?

192
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,403
Well, marsellus fucked him up good.

193
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,905
Word around the campfire is,

194
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,282
it was on account of
marsellus Wallace's wife.

195
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,417
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

196
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,920
No, no, no. Nothing that bad.

197
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,630
Well then, what, then?

198
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,382
Gave her a foot massage.

199
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,137
- A foot massage?
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,055
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,391
Then what did marsellus do?

202
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,143
Sent a couple of cats over to his place.

203
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,271
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

204
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,523
Nigger fell four stories.

205
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,483
They had a little garden
down at the bottom,

206
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,694
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

207
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,487
Nigger fell through that.

208
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,824
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

209
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,120
That's a damn shame.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,128
But still, I have to say,
you play with matches, you get burned.

211
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,296
What do you mean?

212
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,008
You don't be giving marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

213
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,676
You don't think he overreacted?

214
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,137
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect marsellus

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,388
to react the way he did,

216
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,557
but he had to expect a reaction.

217
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,726
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

218
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,079
I give my mother a foot massage.

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,398
No, it's laying hands in a familiar way
on marsellus's new wife.

220
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,942
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

221
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,195
No, but it's the same fucking ballpark.

222
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

223
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,841
Eating a bitch out
and giving a bitch a foot massage

224
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,408
ain't even the same fucking thing.

225
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,076
It's not. It's the same ballpark.

226
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,204
Ain't no fucking ballpark, neither.

227
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,165
Now, look, maybe your method of massage
differs from mine,

228
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
but, you know, touching his wife's feet

229
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,962
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies

230
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,587
ain't the same fucking ballpark.

231
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,215
It ain't the same league.
It ain't even the same fucking sport.

232
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,592
Look, foot massages don't mean shit.

233
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,220
Have you ever given a foot massage?

234
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,430
Don't be telling me about foot massages.

235
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm the foot fucking master.

236
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,266
You given a lot of 'em?

237
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,560
Shit, yeah.
Got my technique down and everything.

238
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,479
I don't be tickling or nothing.

239
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,773
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

240
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Fuck you.

241
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,737
You given 'em a lot?

242
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,113
Fuck you.

243
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,158
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage myself.

244
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,078
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.
I'm getting a little pissed here.

245
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,040
- This is the door.
- There it is.

246
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,753
What time you got?

247
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,423
7:22 in the am.

248
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,843
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

249
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,896
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage

250
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,416
don't make it right for marsellus
to throw Antwan off a building

251
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,086
into a glass motherfucking house,
fucking up the way the nigger talks.

252
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,361
That shit ain't right.

253
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,779
Motherfucker do that shit to me,

254
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,174
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I'd kill the motherfucker.

255
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,385
- You know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

256
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,345
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing

257
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,787
and I'm saying it does.

258
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,390
Now, look, I've given a million ladies

259
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,250
a million foot massages,
and they all meant something.

260
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,335
Now, we act like they don't, but they do.

261
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,254
That's what's so fucking cool about 'em.

262
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,673
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know,

263
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,759
you don't talk about it,
but you know it, and she knows it.

264
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,344
Fucking marsellus knew it,

265
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,930
and Antwan should've
fucking better known better.

266
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,599
I mean, that's his fucking wife, man.

267
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,227
This ain't a man
with a sense of humor about this shit.

268
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,812
You know what I'm saying?

269
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,690
It's an interesting point.

270
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,443
Come on. Let's get into character.

271
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,218
What's her name again?

272
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,493
- Mia.
- Mia.

273
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,288
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

274
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,224
Well,
he's going out of town, Florida,

275
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,917
and he asked me if I'd
take care of her while he's gone.

276
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,836
Take care of her?

277
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,921
No, man. Just take her out.

278
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,923
You know, show her a good time.

279
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,342
Make sure she don't get lonely.

280
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,636
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

281
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,722
It is not a date.

282
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,016
You know, it's just like
if you were going to take

283
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,602
your buddy's wife to a movie or something.

284
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,479
It's just good company, that's all.

285
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,944
It's not a date.

286
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,447
It's definitely not a date.

287
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,163
Hey, kids.

288
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,957
How you boys doing?

289
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,542
Hey, keep chilling.

290
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,386
You know who we are?

291
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,472
We're associates of your business partner,

292
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,140
marsellus Wallace.

293
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,810
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

294
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,189
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

295
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,569
You're Brett, right?

296
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,529
Yeah.

297
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,863
Ithoughtso.

298
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,117
You remember your business partner,
marsellus Wallace,

299
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,410
don't you, Brett?

300
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,704
- Yeah, I remember him.
- Good.

301
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,041
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

302
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,544
Sorry about that. What you having?

303
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,712
Hamburgers.

304
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,381
Hamburgers!

305
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,883
The cornerstone of
any nutritious breakfast.

306
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,302
What kind of hamburgers?

307
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,847
Cheeseburgers.

308
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,682
No, no, no, no. Where'd you get 'em?

309
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,393
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack in the box, where?

310
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,395
Um, big kahuna burger.

311
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,688
Big kahuna burger.

312
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,648
That's that Hawaiian burgerjoint.

313
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,608
I hear they got some tasty burgers.

314
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,610
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

315
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,865
- They're good.
- You mind if I try one of yours?

316
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,577
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,839
This is a tasty burger.

318
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,217
Vincent, you ever had a big kahuna burger?

319
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,387
Want a bite? They're real tasty.

320
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
I ain't hungry.

321
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,516
Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

322
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,977
Me, I can't usually get 'em,

323
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,729
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

324
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,064
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

325
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,860
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmm.

326
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,906
You know what they call
a quarter pounder with cheese in France?

327
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,952
- Tell him, Vincent.
- Royale with cheese.

328
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,704
Royale with cheese.

329
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,623
You know why they call it that?

330
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,377
Uh, because of the metric system?

331
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,256
Check out the big brain on Brett!

332
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,177
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

333
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
What's in this?

334
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,141
- Sprite.
- Sprite, good.

335
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,019
You mind if I have
some of your tasty beverage

336
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,562
to wash this down with?

337
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,314
Go right ahead.

338
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,203
That hit the spot.

339
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,623
You, flock of seagulls.

340
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,874
You know why we're here?

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,640
Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid at?

342
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,546
It's over there.

343
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,216
I don't remember
asking you a goddamn thing!

344
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,887
You were saying?

345
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,848
It's in the cupboard.

346
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
No. The one by your knees.

347
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,626
We happy?

348
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,045
Vincent?

349
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,425
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

350
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,428
Look...

351
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,848
I'm sorry, I... I didn't get your name.

352
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,350
I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?

353
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,561
- But... but I never got yours.
- My name's pitt,

354
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,896
and your ass ain't talking your way
out of this shit.

355
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,440
No, no, no.

356
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,068
I just want you to know how...

357
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,159
I just want you to know how sorry we are
that... that things got so fucked up

358
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,910
with us and... and Mr. Wallace.

359
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,704
We got into this thing

360
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,056
with the best intentions, really.

361
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,373
I never inten...

362
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,377
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?

363
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,465
I didn't mean to do that.
Please, continue.

364
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,302
You were saying something
about "best intentions."

365
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,846
What's the matter?

366
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,599
Oh, you were finished?

367
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,976
Well, allow me to retort.

368
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,941
What does marsellus Wallace look like?

369
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,194
What?

370
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,530
- What country are you from?
- What?

371
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,408
"What" ain't no country I ever heard of!
They speak English in "what"?

372
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,868
What?

373
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,663
- English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

374
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,414
- Then you know what I'm saying.
- Yes!

375
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,918
Describe what marsellus Wallace
looks like!

376
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,795
What? I...

377
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,422
Say "what" again. Say "what" again!

378
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,633
I dare you!
I double-dare you, motherfucker!

379
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,760
Say "what" one more goddamn time!

380
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,595
He's... he's black.

381
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,805
Go on!

382
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,014
He's bald.

383
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,724
Does he look like a bitch?

384
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,809
What?

385
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,564
Does he look like a bitch?

386
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,818
Then why you trying to fuck him
like a bitch, Brett?

387
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,319
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

388
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,571
Yes, you did, Brett!

389
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,824
- You tried to fuck him.
- No.

390
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,826
Well, marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked

391
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,370
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

392
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,455
You read the Bible, Brett?

393
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,416
Yes.

394
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,043
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

395
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,045
Sort of fits this occasion.

396
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,339
Ezekiel 25:17.

397
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,928
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides

398
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:25,725
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

399
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,730
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

400
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,108
Shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

401
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,861
for he is truly his brother's keeper

402
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,322
and the finder of lost children.

403
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,742
And I will strike down upon thee

404
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,495
with great vengeance and furious anger

405
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,958
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

406
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,920
And you will know my name is the lord

407
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,340
when I lay my vengeance upon thee!"

408
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,396
J” let's sfa y fogez'berj”

409
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,360
I think you're gonna find,

410
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,530
when all this shit is over and done...

411
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,369
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smiling motherfucker.

412
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,207
Thing is, butch,

413
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,419
right now you got ability.

414
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,548
But painful as it may be,

415
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,718
ability don't last.

416
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,431
And your days are just about over.

417
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,269
Now, that's a hard
motherfucking fact of life,

418
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,149
but that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

419
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,657
See, this business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers.

420
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,495
Motherfuckers who thought their ass
would age like wine.

421
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,333
If you mean it turns to vinegar,

422
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,751
it does.

423
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,754
If you mean it gets better with age,

424
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,714
it don't.

425
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,968
Besides, butch...

426
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,139
How many fights you think
you got in you, anyway?

427
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,394
Two?

428
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,315
Boxers don't have an old-timer's day.

429
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,695
You came close, but you never made it.

430
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,949
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

431
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,535
J” times are good or bad j”

432
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,496
j” happy or sad j”

433
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,922
J” yeah j”

434
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,885
you my nigger?

435
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:11,056
J” whether times are good or bad
happy or sad .. J”

436
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,642
it certainly appears so.

437
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,403
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

438
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,868
That's pride fucking with you.

439
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,246
Fuck pride!

440
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,083
Pride only hurts.

441
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,045
It never helps.

442
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,590
You fight through that shit.

443
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,260
'Cause a year from now,

444
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,472
when you kicking it in the Caribbean,

445
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:56,268
you gonna say to yourself,
"marsellus Wallace was right."

446
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,189
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

447
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,236
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

448
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,784
Say it.

449
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,914
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

450
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,795
Yo, Vincent vega, our man in Amsterdam.

451
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,880
Jules winnfield, our man in inglewood.

452
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,840
Get your asses on in here!

453
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,384
Goddamn, nigger!

454
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,187
- What's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

455
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,640
Where's the big man?

456
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,267
Big man's right over there
taking care of some business.

457
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,561
Why don't you hang back
for a second or two, you know?

458
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,814
When you see the white boy leave,
just go on over.

459
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,068
How you been?

460
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,946
I've been doing pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

461
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,155
All right.

462
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,411
So, I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow.

463
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,749
At marsellus's request.

464
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,920
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

465
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,506
What's so fucking funny?

466
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,342
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

467
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,554
Look, I'm not a fucking idiot, all right?

468
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,805
It's the big man's wife.

469
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

470
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,643
laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it.

471
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,855
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

472
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,691
Then what did you fucking
ask me about it for?

473
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,942
Asshole.

474
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,115
J” yeah j”

475
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,909
give me a pack of red apples.

476
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,327
- Filters?
- Nah.

477
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,790
J” whether times are good or bad
happy or sad j”

478
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,500
you looking at something, friend?

479
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,461
You ain't my friend, palooka.

480
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,924
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

481
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,510
Vincent vega's in the house?

482
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,014
My nigger. Get your ass over here.

483
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,897
J” you'd never do that to me j”

484
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,108
- What's up?
- Man, I'm sorry.

485
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,985
Don't worry about it.

486
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,779
Pack of red apples.

487
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,988
$1.40.

488
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,825
And some matches.

489
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,703
J” hereis what/ want to do j”

490
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,456
j” heyj”

491
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,541
j” we ought to stay togetherj”

492
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:29,338
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

493
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,547
Wow.

494
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,092
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

495
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,469
Well, you see how they use that gun
to Pierce your ears?

496
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,614
They don't use that to Pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

497
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,475
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

498
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,897
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

499
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,983
Five in each ear.
One through the nipple of my left breast.

500
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,195
Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

501
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,115
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

502
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,450
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

503
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,660
Excuse me.

504
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,579
I was just curious, but, um,

505
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,624
why would you wear a stud in your tongue?

506
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,709
It's a sex thing.

507
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,169
Helps fellatio.

508
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,754
Vincenzo.

509
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,215
Step into my office.

510
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,717
Let's go, man.

511
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,100
This is panda, from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

512
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,061
Now, that's bava.
Different, but equally good.

513
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,563
And that is choco.

514
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,690
From the harz mountains of Germany.

515
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,902
Now, the first two are the same...
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

516
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,114
But this one is a little more expensive.

517
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,074
This is 500 a gram.

518
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,036
But when you shoot it,
you will know where that extra money went.

519
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,332
Now, there's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

520
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,043
But this one is a fucking madman.

521
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,755
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

522
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,049
Am I a nigger? Are we in inglewood?

523
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,468
No. You're in my home.

524
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,555
Now, white people who know the difference
between good shit and bad shit,

525
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,307
this is the house they come to.

526
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,727
My shit, I'll take the Pepsi challenge
with that Amsterdam shit

527
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,437
any old day of the fucking week.

528
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,024
- That's a bold statement.
- This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

529
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,109
This is a seller's market.

530
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,071
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

531
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,033
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

532
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,663
- All right, give me three grams of madman.
- Okay.

533
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,726
And if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

534
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,878
Well, I just hope that I still have
some left for you.

535
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:37,382
But I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

536
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,468
That is what a nice guy I am.

537
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,430
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

538
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,767
- Yeah, that's cool.
- All right. I'll just get one for you.

539
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,730
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

540
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,023
Okay.

541
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,026
Hey, what do you think about Trudi?

542
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,363
She ain't got a boyfriend.
You want to hang out, get high?

543
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,824
Which one is Trudi?
The one with all the shit in her face?

544
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,327
No, that's Jody.

545
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,703
That's my wife.

546
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,624
That one hurt, man.

547
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,833
Thank you.

548
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,503
No, I can't. I gotta be some place.

549
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,879
All right. No problemo.

550
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,756
I'll take a rain check.

551
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,344
"Thank you, Jody."

552
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,388
Still got your Malibu?

553
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,059
Oh, man. You know what some fucker
did the other day?

554
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,894
- What?
- Fucking keyed it.

555
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,564
- Oh, man. That's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

556
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,317
I had it in storage for three years.

557
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,236
It was out five days,

558
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,738
and some dickless piece of shit
fucked with it.

559
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,502
They should be
fucking killed, man.

560
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,243
No trial, no jury. Straight to execution.

561
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,495
Boy, I wish I could've
caught him doing it.

562
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,039
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

563
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,126
It'd been worth him doing it
just so I could've caught him doing it.

564
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,836
What a fucker.

565
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,714
What's more chicken shit
than fucking with a man's automobile?

566
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,841
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

567
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,468
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

568
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,095
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

569
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,599
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

570
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,393
Muchas gracias.

571
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,141

I'm on the intercom.

577
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,866
Where is... where is the intercom?

578
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,286
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

579
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,246
To your right.

Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down

588
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,604

00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,229
An Elvis man should love it.

- Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

Hi, I'm buddy. What can I get you?

Bloody as hell.

Martin and Lewis.

677

00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,040
Mm-hmm.

679
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,333
That's a shake.

680
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,295
- That's milk and ice cream.
- Last I heard.

681
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,046
- That's five dollars?
- Uh-huh.

682
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,758

- No.

683
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,886
- Just checking.
- I'll be right back with your drinks.

684
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,138
J” going down to lonesome town j”

685
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,976
j” to cry my troubles away j”

686
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,648
could you, um, roll me
one of those, cowboy?

687
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,610
You can have this one, cowgirl.

688
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,861
Thanks.

689
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,072
J” the streets are filled with regret j”

690
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,576
think nothing of it.

691
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,413
J” maybe down in lonesome town j”

692
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,875
j” I can learn to forget j”

693
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:18,046
so... marsellus said you just
got back from Amsterdam.

694
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,757
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

695
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,843
Uh, just over three years.

696
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,304
J” I can learn to forget j”

697
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,224
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

698
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,476
No kidding?

699
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,019
I didn't know that.

700
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,022
Why would you?

701
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,654
I heard you did a pilot.

702
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,990
That was my 15 minutes.

703
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,617
What was it?

704
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,411
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents

705
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,372
called fox force five.

706
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,166
- What?
- Fox force five.

707
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,585
Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks.

708
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,129
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

709
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,882
And five, as in there's
one, two, three, four, five of us.

710
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,468
There was a blonde one... sommerset O'Neal.

711
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,678
She was the leader.

712
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,931
The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.

713
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,018
The black girl was a demolition expert.

714
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,938
French fox's speciality was sex.

715
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,565
What was your specialty?

716
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,317
Knives.

717
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,444
Character I played, raven McCoy,

718
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,407
her background was
she grew up raised by circus performers.

719
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,867
According to the show,

720
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,744
she was the deadliest woman in the world
with a knife.

721
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,581
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

722
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,001
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

723
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,879
And if we would've got picked up,

724
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,339
they would've worked in a gimmick
where every show,

725
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,092
I would've told anotherjoke.

726
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,096
You know any of them old jokes?

727
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,892
Well, I only got the chance to say one,
'cause we only did one show.

728
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,018
Tell me.

729
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,352
It's corny.

730
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,397
Don't be that way. Tell me.

731
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,525
Nah. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

732
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:07,280
You'd be em... you told, like,
50 million people, and you can't tell me?

733
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,574
I promise I won't laugh.

734
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,242
That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

735
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,620
That's not what I meant, and you know it.

736
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:17,123
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you,
'cause it's been built up too much.

737
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,125
What a gyp.

738
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,338
Martin and Lewis.

739
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,009
Vanilla coke.

740
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,390
Mmm.

741
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,476
Yummy.

742
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,519
You think I could have a sip of that?

743
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,232
Be my guest.

744
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,110
I gotta know
what a five-dollar shake tastes like.

745
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,447
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

746
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,283
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

747
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,328
All right.

748
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,713
Goddamn,
that's a pretty fucking good milk shake.

749
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,798
Told ya.

750
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,842
Don't know if it was worth five dollars,
but it was pretty fucking good.

751
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,587
Don't you hate that?

752
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,717
- Hate what?
- Uncomfortable silences.

753
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,596
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit

754
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,265
in order to be comfortable?

755
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,560
I don't know, but it's a good question.

756
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:05,398
That's when you know
you've found somebody really special,

757
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,693
when you can just shut the fuck up
for a minute

758
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,862
and comfortably share a silence.

759
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,340
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad.

760
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,033
We just met each other.

761
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,869
I'll tell you what.

762
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,957
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

763
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,252
You sit here and think
of something to say.

764
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,796
I'll do that.

765
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,718
Okay.

766
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,037
I said goddamn!

767
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,206
Goddamn.

768
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,415
Goddamn.

769
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,336
I need some hair spray.

770
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,847
Don't you just love it
when you come back from the bathroom

771
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,849
to find your food waiting for you?

772
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,268
We're lucky we got anything at all.

773
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,479
I don't think buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

774
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,583
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

775
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,835
- Would you like some coffee?
- Which one? There's two monroes.

776
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,899
No, there's not.

777
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,904
That is Marilyn Monroe.

778
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,158
That is mamie Van doren.

779
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,080
And I don't see jayne Mansfield.
She must have the night off or something.

780
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,748
Pretty smart.

781
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,583
Yeah, I got my moments.

782
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:51,170
- So, did you think of something to say?
- Actually, I did.

783
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,757
However...

784
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,681
You seem like a really nice person,
and I... I don't want to offend you.

785
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,432
Ooh!

786
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,269
This doesn't sound like
the usual mindless, boring,

787
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,563
getting-to-know-you chitchat.

788
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,023
This sounds like you actually
have something to say.

789
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,401
Well, well, I do. I do.

790
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,280
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

791
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,656
No! No, no, no.

792
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,660
You can't promise something like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

793
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,847
So you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me,

794
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,874
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

795
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,394
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would've broken my promise.

796
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,087
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

797
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,506
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this

798
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,216
would be an exercise in futility.

799
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,593
Is that a fact?

800
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,097
And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?

801
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,599
All right. All right.

802
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,267
Well, here goes.

803
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,563
Uh, what did you, uh, think
about what happened to Antwan?

804
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,647
Who's Antwan?

805
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,066
Tony rocky horror. You know him.

806
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,651
He fell out of a window.

807
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,528
Mmm. Hmm.

808
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,363
Well, that is one way to say it.

809
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,158
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

810
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,411
Another way would be
was he was thrown out by marsellus,

811
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,496
and yet even another way is to say

812
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,583
he was thrown out of a window by marsellus
because of you.

813
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,585
Is that a fact?

814
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,962
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

815
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,297
It's just what I heard.

816
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,007
Who told you?

817
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,342
They.

818
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,802
They talk a lot, don't they?

819
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,641
They certainly do. They certainly do.

820
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,726
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

821
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,604
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy. I don't...

822
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,731
Did it involve the f-word?

823
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,149
No. No, no, no.

824
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,777
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

825
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,488
And?

826
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,782
And nothing. That's it.

827
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,203
You heard marsellus

828
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,580
threw Tony rocky horror
out of a four-story window

829
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,249
for giving me a foot massage?

830
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,459
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

831
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,089
Well, I mean, at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

832
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,342
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window

833
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,761
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?

834
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,181
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

835
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,643
I mean, I understand that marsellus
is very, very protective of you.

836
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,189
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

837
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,833
A husband almost killing another man
for touching his wife's feet

838
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,151
is something else.

839
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,320
But did it happen?

840
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,573
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine
was my hand when he shook it...

841
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,784
At my wedding.

842
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,203
Really?

843
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,790
Truth is, nobody knows why marsellus
threw Tony out of that four-story window

844
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,875
except marsellus and Tony.

845
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,963
But when you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

846
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,048
Ladies and gentlemen.

847
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,551
Now the moment you've all
been waiting for,

848
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:48,222
the world-famous Jack rabbit slim's
twist contest.

849
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,479
This is where one lucky couple

850
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,608
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

851
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:03,195
Now, who will be our first contestants?

852
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,488
Right here!

853
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,073
Hey, all right!

854
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,160
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

855
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,370
No, no, no, no, no, no.

856
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,998
I do believe marsellus,
my husband, your boss,

857
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,043
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

858
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,628
And now I want to dance. I want to win.

00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,644
j” they had a hi-fi' phono j”

j” did truly love the mademoiselle... j”

897
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,405
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

898
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,575
I don't know what you call that.

899
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,538
Drinks. Music.

900
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,957
I'm gonna take a piss.

901
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:48,712
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.

902
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,394
J” glr/...J”

j” he is not your kind j”

908

j” they ne ver get tired

909
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:26,333
j” and / never know when / come around j”

00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,752
j” what I'm gonna find j”

911
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,298

j” you'll be a woman soon j”

914
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,184
one drink and that's it.

915
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,478
Don't be rude. Drink your drink.

916
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,355
But do it quickly.

917
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,192
Say good night and go home.

918
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,361
J” girl j”

919
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:58,657
j” you'll be a woman soon j”

00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,869

the y'i/ end it for sure j”

927
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,098
j” surely would j”

928
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,648
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

929
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,859
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

930
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,321
Because being loyal is very important.

931
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,174
J” they ne ver get tired
of putting me down j”

932
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,992

j” don't let them make up your mind j”

935
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,710
j” don't you know, girl j”

936
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:57,508
j” you'll be a woman soon j”

"good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."

947
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,046
Walk out the door, get in the car.

948
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,716
Go home, jerk off,
and that's all you're gonna do.

All right, Mia.

958
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,559
So, listen, I gotta go.

959
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,311
All right?

960
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,900
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

961
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,236
You fu... oh, Jesus Christ.

Oh, come on, girl.

We gotta walk now.

Don't fucking die on me, Mia.

Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

977
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,889
I can hear it.

978
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:54,059
I thought you told those fucking
assholes never to call here this late.

979
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,561
Yeah, I told 'em,

980
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,814

Don't you dare strike me!

Hello?

984
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,904
Lance, Vincent.

985
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,491
I'm in big fucking trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

986
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:12,035
Whoa, whoa. Hold your horses, man.

987
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,662
What's the problem?

988
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:14,663
I got this chick,

989
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,058
- she's fucking od'ing on me.
- Well, don't bring her here.

990
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,042
I'm not even fucking joking with you, man.

991
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,446
Don't not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-butt to my house.

992
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,547
- No choice.
- She's od'ing?

993
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,591
She's fucking dying on me, man!

994
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,011
Okay, well, then you bite
the fucking bullet,

995
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,096
and you take her to a hospital
and call a lawyer.

996
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,765
- Negative.
- This is not my fucking problem, man!

997
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,059
You fucked her up,
you fucking deal with this!

998
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,938
Are you talking to me on a cellular phone?

999
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,751
I don't know you. Who is this?
Don't come here. I'm hanging up the phone.

1000
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,235
Prank caller! Prank caller!

1001
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,247
What the hell was that?

1002
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,543
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1003
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,646
- You were talking about drug shit...
- Lance, help me.

1004
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,350
You crashed your car
into my fucking house!

1005
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,133
- Grab her feet.
- Hey, hey! Are you deaf?

1006
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,219
You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

1007
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,347
This fucked-up bitch is
marsellus Wallace's wife.

1008
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,515
Do you know who marsellus Wallace is?
Do you?

1009
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,701
- Yeah.
- If she croaks on me,

1010
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,352
I'm a fucking grease spot!

1011
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,689
Now, look, I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help

1012
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,775
and that you let her die
on your fucking lawn.

1013
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,277
Now, come on, help me.
Help me. Pick her up.

1014
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,947
Shit!

1015
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,867
Lance!

1016
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,078
Shit!

1017
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,206
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

1018
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,375
What the fuck's going on out here?

1019
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,461
Who's she?

1020
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,629
Look, go in the fridge

1021
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,673
and get the thing
with that adrenaline shot.

1022
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,757
What's wrong with her?

1023
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,925
She's od'ing!

1024
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,010
- Get her the hell out of here!
- Get the shot!

1025
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,262
Fuck you! Fuck you, too!

1026
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,639
What a fucking bitch.

1027
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,802
You just keep talking to her.
She's getting the shot.

1028
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,577
I'm gonna go get my little
black medical book.

1029
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,162
What the fuck you need a medical book for?

1030
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,581
To tell me what to do. I never had to give
an adrenaline shot before.

1031
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,541
- You've never given an adrenaline shot?
- I never had to.

1032
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,377
I don't go joypopping
with a bunch of bubblegummers.

1033
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,170
- My friends can handle their highs.
- Get the shot!

1034
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,381
- Look, I am if you'll let me.
- I ain't fucking stopping you!

1035
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,924
Well, stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

1036
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,658
- Get the shot!
- All right!

1037
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,747
Hurry up, Lance! We're losing her!

1038
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,311
- I'm looking as fast as I can!
- What's he looking for?

1039
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,836
I don't know. Some book.

1040
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,880
- What are you looking for?
- My little black medical book!

1041
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,609
- What are you looking for?
- A little black fucking medical book!

1042
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,344
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

1043
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,514
- I never saw no medical book.
- Well, trust me, I have one.

1044
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,993
Well, if it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?

1045
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,560
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

1046
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,330
Listen, while you're looking for it,
that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

1047
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,957
You're never gonna find anything in here.

1048
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,792
I'm going to fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!

1049
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,776
- Clean this shit up!
- Get in here!

1050
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,820
Christ.

1051
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,572
Get the fuck out of my way.

1052
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,949
- Pig.
- Quit fucking around. Give her the shot.

1053
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,075
- Come on.
- Okay.

1054
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,120
Look, while I'm doing this,
you take off her shirt and find her heart.

1055
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,266
- Got to be exact?
- Yeah, it's got to be exact.

1056
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,685
I'm giving her a shot in the heart,
so I guess it's got to be exact.

1057
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,062
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

1058
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,671
- That's it.
- This it? All right.

1059
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,757
What I need is a big fat magic marker.

1060
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:13,925
- You got it?
- What?

1061
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,845
A magic marker! A felt pen!

1062
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,680
A fucking black magic marker!

1063
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,931
All right. All right.

1064
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,518
- Come on, man. Hurry up.
- Fuck. Okay, okay. Okay.

1065
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,603
I think it's ready.

1066
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,275
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- Here, I'll tell you what to do.

1067
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,336
No. Man, I ain't giving...
You're gonna give her the shot.

1068
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,796
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't.

1069
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,715
- I ain't giving her the shot.
- I never done this before.

1070
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,759
I ain't never done it before either.
I ain't starting now.

1071
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,927
You brought her here. That means
you're gonna give her the shot.

1072
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,471
The day I bring an od'ing bitch
to your house,

1073
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,972
I give her the shot. Give her the shot.

1074
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,831
- Give it to me. Give me that.
- Here.

1075
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,043
All right. Tell me what to do.

1076
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,879
Okay. Uh, you're giving her
an injection of adrenaline

1077
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,941
straight to her heart, but she's got
a breastplate. Got to Pierce through that.

1078
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,069
So what you gotta do is you
gotta bring the needle down

1079
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,470
- in a stabbing motion.
- I gotta stab her three times?

1080
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,193
No! You don't gotta stab her three times.

1081
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,783
Stab her once,
but it's gotta be hard enough

1082
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,576
to get through her breastplate
into her heart.

1083
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,353
All right? And then once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

1084
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,271
Okay, then what happens?

1085
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,084
- I'm kind of curious about that myself.
- This ain't no fucking joke, man!

1086
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,400
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!

1087
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,653
She's supposed to come out of it
like that. It's...

1088
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,780
All right. Count to three.
All right. Ready?

1089
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,240
One...

1090
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,080
Two...

1091
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,006
Three!

1092
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,022
If you're all right,

1093
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,858
then say something.

1094
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,068
Something.

1095
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,196
That was fucking trippy.

1096
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,285
Oh, man.

1097
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,520
Mia. Mia.

1098
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,149
What's...

1099
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,569
What's your thoughts on...

1100
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,863
On how to handle this?

1101
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,073
What's yours?

1102
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,621
Well, I'm of the opinion

1103
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,623
that if marsellus lived his whole life,

1104
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,334
he don't need to know nothing
about this incident.

1105
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,879
If marsellus knew about this incident,

1106
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,173
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

1107
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,175
I seriously doubt that.

1108
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,470
I can keep a secret if you can.

1109
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,182
Shake on it?

1110
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,940
Mum's the word?

1111
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,234
Cool.

1112
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,748
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go home and have a heart attack.

1113
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,325
Vincent.

1114
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,206
Do you want to hear
my fox force fivejoke?

1115
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,416
Sure.

1116
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,545
Except that I think
I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.

1117
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,257
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

1118
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,717
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

1119
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,928
I can't wait.

1120
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,012
Okay.

1121
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,431
Three tomatoes are walking
down the street.

1122
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,934
Papa tomato, mama tomato, and baby tomato.

1123
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:55,814
Baby tomato starts lagging behind
and papa tomato gets really angry,

1124
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,857
goes back and squishes him,

1125
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,859
and says, "catch up."

1126
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,029
Mmm.

1127
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,698
Ketchup.

1128
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,079
See you around.

1129
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,604
Oh, that padd/efoot... he funny, silly dog.

1130
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,691
He think totem pole alive.

1131
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,610
He arctic tenderfoot.

1132
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,115
That totem pole been here forever.

1133
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,867
Butch?

1134
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,954
Butch, stop watching TV a second.

1135
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,749
- Yeah?
- We got a special visitor.

1136
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,545
Now...

1137
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,132
Do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a pow camp?

1138
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,429
Well, this here is captain koons.

1139
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,431
He was in the pow camp with daddy.

1140
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,898
Hello, little man.

1141
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,650
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

1142
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,237
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

1143
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,325
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together

1144
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,868
over five years.

1145
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,287
Hopefully...

1146
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,582
You'll never have to
experience this yourself,

1147
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,126
but when two men are in a situation

1148
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,088
like me and your dad were,
for as long as we were,

1149
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,175
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

1150
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,178
If it had been me who'd...

1151
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,723
Not made it,

1152
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:58,103
major coolidge would be talking right now
to my son Jim.

1153
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,231
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you...

1154
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,609
Butch.

1155
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,779
I got something for ya.

1156
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,372
This watch I got here

1157
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,749
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather

1158
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,501
during the first world war.

1159
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,337
It was bought in a little general store

1160
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,005
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1161
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:30,427
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1162
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,263
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1163
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,766
It was bought
by private doughboy erine coolidge

1164
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,060
on the day he set sail for Paris.

1165
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,938
This was your great-grandfather's
war watch,

1166
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,816
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1167
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:49,446
And when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

1168
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,156
took the watch off,

1169
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,783
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed

1170
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,703
till your grandad, Dane coolidge,

1171
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,163
was called upon by his country

1172
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:02,083
to go overseas and fight the Germans
once again.

1173
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,335
This time they called it world war two.

1174
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,716
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your grandad for good luck.

1175
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,928
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1176
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,097
Dane was a marine, and he was killed

1177
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,726
along with all the other marines
at the battle of wake island.

1178
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,896
Your grandad was facing death.

1179
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,148
He knew it.

1180
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:30,028
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive.

1181
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,239
So, three days before
the Japanese took the island,

1182
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,493
your grandad asked a gunner
on an air force transport,

1183
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,119
name of winocki,

1184
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:41,414
a man he had never met before in his life,

1185
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,917
to deliver to his infant son,

1186
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,920
who he had never seen in the flesh,

1187
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,296
his gold watch.

1188
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:53,593
Three days later, your grandad was dead,
but winocki kept his word.

1189
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,931
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

1190
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,308
delivering to your infant father

1191
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,227
his dad's gold watch.

1192
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,645
This watch.

1193
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,445
This watch was on your daddy's wrist

1194
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,532
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

1195
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,035
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1196
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,997
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

1197
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,209
they'd confiscate it and take it away.

1198
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,588
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1199
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,192
He'd be damned if any slopes
gonna put their greasy yellow hands

1200
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,342
on his boy's birthright,

1201
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:38,721
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something, his ass.

1202
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,807
Five long years he wore this watch

1203
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,141
up his ass.

1204
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,811
Then he died of dysentery,

1205
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,521
he give me the watch.

1206
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:50,149
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal
up my ass, two years.

1207
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,403
Then... after seven years,

1208
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,446
I was sent home to my family. And...

1209
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,699
Now...

1210
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,371
Little man, I give the watch to you.

1211
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,667
[Gasps}

1212
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,313
It's time, butch.

1213
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,163
Weighing 270 pounds,

1214
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,459
Floyd ray Wilson. I

1215
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,565
Ltis ohicial
it's ofi'icial. Wilson is dead!

1216
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,650
Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest

1217
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,902
and hands down the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen.

1218
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,206
Coolidge was out of there faster

1219
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,555
than / 've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

1220
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,116
Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?

1221
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,576
My guess would be yes, Richard

1222
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,852
I could see fiom my position here
the fienzy in his eyes

1223
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,788
give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

1224
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,624
I think any man would have
left the ring that fast.

1225
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,208
Dan, do you feel that this tragedy

1226
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,918
is gonna have an efi'ect
on the world of boxing?

1227
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,253
Richard a tragedy like this

1228
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,714
can't help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations,

1229
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,050
but its of Paramount importance
that during the sad weeks ahead,

1230
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,242
the eyes of the wba remain...

1231
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:02,073
Marsellus?

1232
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,742
I didn't do it, man. I didn't do it.

1233
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,285
How you doing?

1234
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,997
Great. I never thanked you for dinner.

1235
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,210
- What you got?
- He booked.

1236
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,461
His trainer?

1237
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,630
Says he don't know nothing. I believe him.

1238
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:22,468
- Think butch surprised his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna think, we wanna know.

1239
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,846
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1240
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,640
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1241
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,404
Butch's search... how do you want it done?

1242
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,770
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1243
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:36,149
If butch goes to indochina,
I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice,

1244
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,151
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

1245
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,945
I will take care of it.

1246
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,206
Mister?

1247
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,545
Hey, mister?

1248
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,629
What?

1249
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,506
You were in that fight?

1250
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,717
The fight on the radio.

1251
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,136
You're the fighter?

1252
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,013
Now, what gave you that idea?

1253
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,390
No, come on.

1254
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,851
You're him.

1255
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,437
I know you're him.

1256
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:17,982
Tell me you're him.

1257
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,734
I'm him.

1258
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,279
You killed the other boxing man.

1259
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,743
He's dead?

1260
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,204
The radio said he was dead.

1261
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,751
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1262
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,879
What does it feel like?

1263
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,548
What does what feel like?

1264
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,091
Killing a man.

1265
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:50,181
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1266
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,643
- Are you a weirdo?
- No.

1267
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,979
It is a subject I have much interest in.

1268
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,152
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

1269
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,160
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1270
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,038
I'll tell you what.

1271
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,475
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there,

1272
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:17,834
and I'll tell you all about it.

1273
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:39,814
Esmarelda...

1274
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,775
Villa lobos.

1275
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,402
Is that Mexican?

1276
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,697
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

1277
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,407
That's some handle you got there, honey.

1278
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,908
Thank you.

1279
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,077
And what is your name?

1280
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:54,829
Butch.

1281
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,747
Butch.

1282
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:58,791
What does it mean?

1283
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,419
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1284
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:07,174
So, moving right along, esmarelda.

1285
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,302
What is it you wanna know?

1286
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,930
I want to know what it feels like
to kill a man.

1287
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,223
I couldn't tell ya.

1288
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,982
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1289
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,695
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1290
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,703
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1291
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,926
What the fuck I tell ya? Huh?

1292
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,889
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man,

1293
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,387
the odds went through the roof.

1294
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,640
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1295
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,266
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1296
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,518
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1297
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:00,882
If he never laced up his gloves,

1298
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,017
which he never should've done in the first
fucking place, he'd still be alive.

1299
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,109
Yeah, well...

1300
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,862
Who gives a fuck? It's over now.

1301
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,573
Yeah, well, enough about
the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1302
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:15,451
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1303
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,788
How many bookies you lay it around on?

1304
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,957
All eight?

1305
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,375
How long to collect?

1306
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,795
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?

1307
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,255
No, I understand, a few stragglers aside.

1308
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:31,842
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
That is great news, man.

1309
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,886
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1310
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,597
No, me and fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1311
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,850
Yeah, it'll probably take us a couple days
to get down to Knoxville.

1312
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,602
Okay, my brother.

1313
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,439
You're right. You're goddamn right.

1314
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:47,566
All right, Scotty.

1315
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,860
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1316
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,404
Be cool, brother.

1317
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,296
45.60.

1318
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:18,097
And, uh, here's a little something
for the effort.

1319
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,223
Now...

1320
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,732
If anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight,

1321
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:24,270
- what are you gonna say?
- The truth.

1322
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:28,190
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1323
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,528
Bonsoir, esmarelda villa lobos.

1324
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,905
Buenas noches, butch.

1325
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,464
Keep the light off.

1326
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,550
- Is that better, sugar pop?
- Oui.

1327
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,140
Hard day at the office?

1328
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,349
Pretty hard.

1329
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,602
I got in a fight.

1330
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,104
Poor baby.

1331
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,565
Can we make spoons?

1332
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,377
You know what?
I was thinking about taking a shower.

1333
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,361
I'm stinking like a dog over here.

1334
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,405
I like the way you stink.

1335
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,492
Let me take this jacket off.

1336
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,288
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

1337
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,623
Uh-huh?

1338
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,500
I wish I had a pot.

1339
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,848
You were looking at yourself
in the mirror,

1340
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,338
and you wish you had some pot?

1341
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,591
A pot belly.

1342
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,010
Pot bellies are sexy.

1343
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,513
Well, you should be happy...

1344
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,015
'Cause you have one.

1345
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,642
Shut up, fatso!

1346
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,352
I don't have a pot.

1347
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:50,189
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "lucky star."

1348
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,816
It's not the same thing.

1349
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,069
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1350
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,113
The difference is huge.

1351
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,534
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1352
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:07,248
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1353
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,918
But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy.

1354
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,920
The rest of you is normal.

1355
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,005
Normal face, normal legs,

1356
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,424
normal hips, normal ass,

1357
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,970
but with a big perfectly round pot belly.

1358
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,766
If I had one, I'd wear a t-shirt
two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1359
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,018
You think men would find that attractive?

1360
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,230
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1361
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,150
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch

1362
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,111
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1363
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,241
If you had a pot belly,

1364
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,368
I would punch you in it.

1365
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,912
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1366
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,373
I'd smother you.

1367
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,250
I'd drop it right on your face...

1368
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,544
Till you couldn't breathe.

1369
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,547
- You'd do that?
- Yes. Yes.

1370
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:12,813
Did you get everything?

1371
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,440
Yes, I did.

1372
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,525
Good job, sugar pop.

1373
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,860
Did everything go as planned?

1374
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,362
You didn't listen to the... ow!

1375
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:24,950
- You didn't listen to the radio?
- I never listen to your fights.

1376
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,035
Were you the winner?

1377
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,495
I won, all right.

1378
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:29,914
Are you still retiring?

1379
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,457
Sure am.

1380
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,876
So, it all worked out in the finish?

1381
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,588
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1382
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,308
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1383
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,938
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1384
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,275
But they won't find us, will they?

1385
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,365
Do you still want me to go with you?

1386
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,828
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.

1387
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:10,996
It's...

1388
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,504
Say it.

1389
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,215
Fabienne,

1390
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,884
I want you to be with me.

1391
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:26,637
Forever?

1392
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,180
Forever and ever.

1393
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,809
Do you love me?

1394
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,144
Very, very much.

1395
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,735
Butch?

1396
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,820
Yes.

1397
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,699
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1398
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,702
Will you kiss it?

1399
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,580
But you first.

1400
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,292
- Okay.
- Okay.

1401
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,470
Butch.

1402
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,993
I think I cracked a rib.

1403
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,037
Giving me oral pleasure?

1404
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,747
No, retard. From the fight.

1405
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,165
Don't call me retard.

1406
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,916
My name is fabby.

1407
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,337
- My name is fabienne.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1408
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,589
- My name is fabienne.
- Shut up, fuckhead!

1409
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,507
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1410
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,760
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

1411
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,763
I take it back.

1412
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,977
Would you hand me a dry towel,
miss beautiful tulip?

1413
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,437
Oh, I like that.

1414
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,689
I like being called a tulip.

1415
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,983
Tulip is much better than mongoloid.

1416
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,693
I didn't call you a mongoloid.

1417
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,446
I called you a retard, and I took it back.

1418
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,657
Butch?

1419
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,493
Yes, lemon pie.

1420
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,078
Where are we going to go?

1421
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,621
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1422
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:17,748
Wherever you want.

1423
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,586
We're gonna get a lot of money from this,
but it ain't gonna be the kinda money

1424
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,923
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

1425
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,552
I was thinking maybe we could go down
some place in the south pacific.

1426
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,431
The kinda money we're gonna have
is gonna carry us a long way down there.

1427
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,559
- If we wanted, we could live in bora bora?
- You betcha.

1428
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:39,937
And if after a while you didn't dig that,

1429
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,524
go some place else, maybe Tahiti. Mexico.

1430
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,317
But I do not speak Spanish.

1431
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,945
Well, you do not speak bora-boran, either.

1432
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,531
Besides, Mexican is easy.

1433
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,411
- What does that mean?
- Where is the shoe store?

1434
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,287
Spit, please.

1435
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,168
Excellent pronunciation.

1436
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,256
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1437
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:09,883
Oué hora es?

1438
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,093
Que hora es?

1439
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,137
- "What time is it?"
- "What time is it?"

1440
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,680
Time for bed.

1441
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,683
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1442
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,025
Butch?

1443
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,783
Never mind.

1444
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,588
Merde. You startled me.

1445
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,006
Did you have a bad dream?

1446
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,552
Shit.

1447
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,515
What is this you're watching?

1448
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,397
A motorcycle movie. I'm not sure the name.

1449
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,817
Are you watching it?

1450
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,028
In a way.

1451
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,991
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1452
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,496
What was it about?

1453
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:23,179
How should I know, fabienne?
You were the one who was watching it.

1454
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:26,043
No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?

1455
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,338
I don't know. I don't remember.

1456
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,341
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1457
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,802
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning.

1458
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:40,849
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast?

1459
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,101
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1460
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,105
Satisfied?

1461
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,316
Yep.

1462
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,737
Then get up, lazy bones.

1463
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,697
God.

1464
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,575
What time is it?

1465
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,744
Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1466
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,788
What time does our train arrive?

1467
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:03,872
11:00.

1468
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,458
You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?

1469
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:07,834
What, lemon pie?

1470
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,755
I'm gonna order a big plate

1471
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:15,092
of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup.

1472
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,554
Eggs over easy, and five sausages.

1473
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,889
Anything to drink with that?

1474
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:24,601
Ah, that looks nice.

1475
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:25,936
To drink,

1476
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:30,482
a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1477
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,068
After that,
I'm going to have a slice of pie.

1478
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,279
Pie for breakfast?

1479
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,907
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1480
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,577
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1481
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,122
And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese...

1482
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,582
Where's my watch?

1483
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,171
It's there.

1484
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,215
No, it's not.

1485
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,217
Have you looked?

1486
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,970
Yes, I fucking looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

1487
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:02,347
You sure you got it?

1488
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,517
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1489
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,729
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes. It was on the little kangaroo.

1490
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:11,148
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1491
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,901
Well, it should be.

1492
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:17,696
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now.

1493
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:18,780
So where the fuck is it?

1494
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,871
Fabienne,

1495
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,831
that was my father's fucking watch.

1496
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:33,128
Do you have any idea of what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1497
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,115
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1498
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,013
Now, all this other shit
you could set on fire,

1499
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:42,179
but I specifically reminded you
not to forget the fucking watch!

1500
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,432
Now think. Did you get it?

1501
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:47,309
I believe so.

1502
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,152
You believe so?
What the fuck does that mean?

1503
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,666
You either did, or you didn't get it!

1504
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,982
Then I did.

1505
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,277
Are you sure?

1506
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,368
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1507
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,787
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

1508
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:11,208
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1509
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,798
It's not your fault.

1510
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,097
If you left
it at the apartment...

1511
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,730
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1512
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,276
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1513
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:45,158
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate

1514
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,035
how personal the watch was to me.

1515
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,163
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,

1516
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,456
I should've told you that.

1517
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,459
You're not a mind reader,

1518
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,712
are you?

1519
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,182
I'm... I'm sorry.

1520
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,853
Don't be. It just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1521
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,647
Why does it mean that?

1522
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:22,446
Because I got to go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1523
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,866
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1524
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,660
Well, that's what I'm going to find out.

1525
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,037
If they are,

1526
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:32,914
and I don't think I can handle it,

1527
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,082
then I'll split.

1528
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,835
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it.

1529
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,296
I'm so sorry.

1530
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,553
Here's some money.

1531
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,930
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.

1532
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,601
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say blueberry pie.

1533
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,019
Blueberry pie.

1534
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,063
Maybe not that fast,

1535
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:00,734
- but pretty fast, okay?
- Okay.

1536
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,944
- Bye.
- Bye.

1537
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:06,198
Shit! Of all the fucking things
she could fucking forget,

1538
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,200
she forgets my father's watch!

1539
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,160
I specifically reminded her.

1540
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,704
"Bedside table, on the kangaroo."

1541
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:16,041
I said the words,
"don't forget my father's watch."

1542
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,033
Looking good, butch.

1543
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,380

to beat 'em, butch.

1548
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:08,560
They keep underestimating you.

1549
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,272

He's dead.

1562
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,693
- Oh, my god.
- He's dead.

1563
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:11,390
If you need someone to go to court,
I will be glad to help, okay?

1564
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:12,707
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1565
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,709
He hit you, and then
he crashed into that car.

1566
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,503
- Who?
- Him.

1567
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,801
I'll be damned.

1568
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,528
I'm shot!

1569
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,970
- Can I help you with something?
- Shut the fuck up.

1570
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:10,682
Now you just wait a goddamn minute now.

1571
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,850
What the fuck are you up to?

1572
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,352
Come here, motherfucker!

1573
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:18,940
You feel that sting,
big boy, huh?

1574
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,483
That's pride fucking with you, see?

1575
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,485
You got to fight through that shit.

1576
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,238
- Huh?
- You better kill me.

1577
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:27,031
Yeah, somebody's going to get killed.

1578
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:29,701
Somebody's going to get
their motherfucking head blown to...

1579
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,161
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1580
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:34,163
This ain't none of your business, mister.

1581
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,125
I'm making it my business.
Toss the weapon.

1582
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,420
- You don't understand, man.
- Toss the weapon.

1583
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,262
Take your foot off the nigger.

1584
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,055
Put your hands behind your head.

1585
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,391
Approach the counter right now.

1586
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:56,519
This motherfucker's trying to kill me.

1587
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:57,770
Shut up.

1588
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:00,523
Keep a-coming. Come on.

1589
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:27,425
Zed, it's maynard.

1590
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:31,137
Yeah. The spiderjust caught
a couple of flies.

1591
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,604
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business

1592
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:23,356
except me or zed.

1593
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,444
That's zed.

1594
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,721
I thought you said
you waited for me.

1595
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:44,836
I did.

1596
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,510
So how come they're all beat up?

1597
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,806
They did that to each other,
man. They came in fighting.

1598
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:58,891
Now, this one right here,

1599
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,477
he was going to shoot that one.

1600
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,647
Is that right?
You were going to shoot him, boy?

1601
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:06,816
Huh?

1602
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,571
Hey, is grace all right out front?

1603
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,323
Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?

1604
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:15,825
No. It's Thursday.

1605
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,118
She ought to be fine.

1606
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,411
Mmm.

1607
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,873
Well...

1608
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,292
Bring out the gimp.

1609
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,752
I think the gimp's sleeping.

1610
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:31,048
Well, I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up, now, won't you?

1611
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:12,298
Get up.

1612
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,480
Get down.

1613
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:41,202
Which one of 'em you want to do first?

1614
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,330
I ain't for sure yet.

1615
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:52,088
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1616
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:56,551
Catch a nigger by the toe.

1617
01:40:56,634 --> 01:41:00,388
If he hollers, let him go.

1618
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:05,476
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1619
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,565
My mother said

1620
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:14,277
to pick the perfect one.

1621
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,822
And you are...

1622
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,453
I guess that means you, big boy.

1623
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:28,708
Shh.

1624
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:31,625
You want to do it in here?

1625
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:34,922
No. Let's do it back there
in Russell's old room.

1626
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,133
Sounds good to me.

1627
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,951
You keep an eye on this one.

1628
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:24,138
Goddamn it, hold his arm.

1629
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:26,514
Yeah!

1630
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:38,861
Yeah, go!

1631
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:40,946
Come on, motherfucker!

1632
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:42,698
Now, motherfucker!

1633
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:06,681
Yeah!

1634
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,191
Yeehaw!

1635
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,197
Come on, motherfucker!

1636
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,036
Come on!

1637
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,338
Yeah!

1638
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:47,346
Yeah!

1639
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,348
Come on!

1640
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,737
Now, motherfucker!

1641
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,160
Come on!

1642
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:10,536
Yeah!

1643
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,043
Yeah!

1644
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,051
Yeah!

1645
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,021
Yeah! Yeah, baby!

1646
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:53,788
Shut the fuck up!

1647
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,126
Fuck!

1648
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,464
Come on!

1649
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:11,055
Yeah.

1650
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,213
You want that gun, don't you, zed?

1651
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,424
Huh?

1652
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:50,761
Go ahead and pick it up.

1653
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:54,515
Go ahead, pick it up.

1654
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,271
Come on. Atta boy.

1655
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,315
I want you to pick it up,

1656
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:05,943
zed.

1657
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,658
Step aside, butch.

1658
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,714
Fuck!

1659
01:46:27,673 --> 01:46:28,674
Fuck!

1660
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:32,511
You okay?

1661
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:36,849
No, man.

1662
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,811
I'm pretty fucking far from okay.

1663
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:53,741
What now?

1664
01:46:57,369 --> 01:46:58,579
What now?

1665
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:01,957
Let me tell you what now.

1666
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:07,087
I'm going to call a couple of hard
pipe-hitting niggers

1667
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:09,048
to go to work on the homes here

1668
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:12,092
with a pair of pliers and a blow torch.

1669
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,473
You hear me talking, hillbilly boy?

1670
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:21,310
I ain't through with you by a damn sight.

1671
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,604
I'm going to get medieval on your ass.

1672
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,110
I meant what now between me and you.

1673
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,284
Oh, that what now.

1674
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:42,081
I tell you what now between me and you.

1675
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:47,544
There is no me and you.

1676
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,631
Not no more.

1677
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,761
So are we cool?

1678
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:58,847
Yeah, we cool.

1679
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:01,934
Two things...

1680
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,230
Don't tell nobody about this.

1681
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,944
This shit is between me, you,

1682
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:16,448
and Mr. "soon to be living the rest
of his short-ass life in agonizing pain"

1683
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:17,950
rapist here.

1684
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,912
It ain't nobody else's business.

1685
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,747
Two,

1686
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:28,252
you leave town tonight, right now.

1687
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:32,506
And when you're gone, you stay gone,

1688
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:36,010
or you be gone.

1689
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,721
You lost all your la privileges. Deal?

1690
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:42,516
Deal.

1691
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:46,020
Get your ass out of here.

1692
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:49,416
Fabienne!

1693
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:52,711
Fabienne!

1694
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:57,257
Fabienne.

1695
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:59,569
Come on, baby, come on. Get your shit.
We got to go right now.

1696
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,571
Butch, I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1697
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,573
Fuck the bags.
If we don't split right now,

1698
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,784
we're going to miss the train.
Come on. I'll be downstairs.

1699
01:50:05,808 --> 01:50:08,852
- Is everything well?
- Just come on! No talking now.

1700
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,521
Are we in danger?

1701
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:15,526
Come on, honey!

1702
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:20,864
Where did you get this motorcycle?

1703
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:24,159
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Come on, let's go.

1704
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:25,452
What happened to my Honda?

1705
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,038
I'm sorry, baby.
I had to crash that Honda.

1706
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:30,124
Will you come on now, please?

1707
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,209
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1708
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:37,548
You're hurt?

1709
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,759
No, no. I might've broken my nose.
It's no biggie. Come on, hop on.

1710
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:44,471
Baby, please, we got...
Honey, we got to hit the fucking road.

1711
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:45,556
Get on.

1712
01:50:48,433 --> 01:50:50,936
I'm sorry. Come here, come here.

1713
01:50:51,019 --> 01:50:52,020
I'm sorry.

1714
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:54,189
I'm so sorry.

1715
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:57,151
You were gone so long
I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1716
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,278
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't mean to worry you.

1717
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:00,922
Everything's fine. How was your breakfast?

1718
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:02,423
- It was good.
- Did you get the pancakes?

1719
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:04,801
- The blueberry pancakes?
- They didn't have blueberry pancakes.

1720
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,161
I had to get buttermilk.
Are you sure you're okay?

1721
01:51:07,244 --> 01:51:08,704
Honey, since I left you it has...

1722
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:09,947
This has been without a doubt

1723
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,957
the single weirdest
fucking day of my life.

1724
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,726
Come on, hop on.
I'll tell you all about it.

1725
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,128
Come on, get on.
Gotta go, gotta go. Come on.

1726
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:18,755
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1727
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:20,174
It's a chopper, baby.

1728
01:51:20,257 --> 01:51:21,592
Whose chopper is this?

1729
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,552
- Zed's.
- Who's zed?

1730
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:25,053
Zed's dead, baby.

1731
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,847
Zed's dead.

1732
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:44,698
Yes, you did, Brett!

1733
01:51:44,781 --> 01:51:46,676
- You tried to fuck him.
- No.

1734
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,953
And marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked by anybody

1735
01:51:50,037 --> 01:51:52,706
- except Mrs. Wallace.
- Oh, god, please. I don't want to die.

1736
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:55,417
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

1737
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,878
Well, there's
this passage I got memorized.

1738
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:59,755
It sort of fits the occasion.

1739
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:02,341
Ezekiel 25:17.

1740
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:05,594
"The path of the righteous man

1741
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,638
is beset on all sides

1742
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,723
by the inequities of the selfish

1743
01:52:09,806 --> 01:52:12,184
and the tyranny of evil men.

1744
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,603
Blessed is he

1745
01:52:14,686 --> 01:52:17,731
who in the name of charity and good will

1746
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:20,817
Shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1747
01:52:20,901 --> 01:52:23,487
for he is truly his brother's keeper

1748
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,281
and the finder of lost children."

1749
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:29,159
"And I will strike down upon thee

1750
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:32,955
with great vengeance and furious anger

1751
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,332
those who attempt to poison

1752
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,334
and destroy my brothers.

1753
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:41,421
And you will know my name is the lord

1754
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:44,716
when I lay my vengeance upon thee."

1755
01:52:52,808 --> 01:52:54,476
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

1756
01:52:54,559 --> 01:52:55,602
I'm fucked.

1757
01:52:55,686 --> 01:52:57,896
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, god...

1758
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,315
Hmm? Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

1759
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,126
Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

1760
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,528
- He's getting on my nerves.
- Marvin. Marvin.

1761
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,654
Marvin!

1762
01:53:05,737 --> 01:53:07,906
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1763
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,617
Die, you motherfuckers!

1764
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,910
Die!

1765
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:43,233
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1766
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:44,651
Slip your mind?

1767
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:47,779
Did you forget that someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-Cannon?

1768
01:53:47,863 --> 01:53:50,282
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

1769
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:51,616
It was bigger than him.

1770
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:59,166
We should be fucking dead, man.

1771
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,668
I know. We was lucky.

1772
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,379
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1773
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:05,839
Yeah, maybe.

1774
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:09,176
This was divine intervention.

1775
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,261
You know what divine intervention is?

1776
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,436
I think so.

1777
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,564
That means that god came down from heaven
and stopped the bullets.

1778
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:25,067
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1779
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,111
God came down from heaven
and stopped these motherfucking bullets.

1780
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,323
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1781
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:33,784
Don't do that.
Don't fucking blow this shit off.

1782
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:35,952
What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

1783
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:37,829
Chill, Jules. This shit happens.

1784
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:41,416
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

1785
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:44,836
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car?

1786
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,505
Or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1787
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:48,423
We should be fucking dead, my friend.

1788
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:53,678
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.

1789
01:54:53,762 --> 01:54:55,680
All right, it was a miracle.

1790
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:57,849
Can we go now?

1791
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,067
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

1792
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:08,860
Shit.

1793
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:13,091
You ever seen that show cops?

1794
01:55:13,115 --> 01:55:15,468
Well, I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1795
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:19,287
and he was talking about this gunfight
he had in a hallway with this guy, right?

1796
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,998
And he just unloaded on this guy
and nothing happened.

1797
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:25,085
He didn't hit nothing.
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1798
01:55:25,794 --> 01:55:27,254
I mean, you know...

1799
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:29,506
It's freaky, but it happens.

1800
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:32,050
Look, you want to play blind man,
go walk with the Shepherd.

1801
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:34,511
But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.

1802
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:36,304
What the fuck does that mean?

1803
01:55:36,388 --> 01:55:38,014
It means that's it for me.

1804
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:40,267
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1805
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,953
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

1806
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,417
- Goddamn it.
- I said don't do that.

1807
01:55:43,478 --> 01:55:45,647
You know, why are you
fucking freaking out on us?

1808
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:48,275
Look, I'm telling marsellus today.
I'm through.

1809
01:55:48,358 --> 01:55:50,444
Well, why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

1810
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:51,528
Don't worry. I will.

1811
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:54,072
Yeah, and I'll bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.

1812
01:55:54,156 --> 01:55:55,866
I don't give a damn if he does.

1813
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:59,661
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1814
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:01,538
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1815
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:03,248
Well, you got to have an opinion.

1816
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:05,931
I mean, do you think that god
came down from heaven and stopped...

1817
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:09,754
- What the fuck's happening? Shit, man!
- Ah, man!

1818
01:56:09,838 --> 01:56:11,548
Ah, man, I shot Marvin in the face.

1819
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,799
Why the fuck did you do that?

1820
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,777
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

1821
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,196
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time, but this...

1822
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,990
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

1823
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:20,950
You probably...
You went over a bump or something.

1824
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:22,702
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

1825
01:56:22,726 --> 01:56:25,103
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

1826
01:56:25,187 --> 01:56:26,605
The gun went off. I don't know why.

1827
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:28,166
Well, look at this fucking mess, man!

1828
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,792
We're on a city street in broad daylight.

1829
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:32,003
- I can't believe it, man.
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker.

1830
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:34,630
We got to get this car off the road.
You know, cops tend to notice shit

1831
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:36,694
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

1832
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,468
Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all.

1833
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,970
This is the valley, Vincent.
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places.

1834
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:42,871
Well, Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

1835
01:56:42,954 --> 01:56:43,955
Shit!

1836
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,875
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in toluca lake.

1837
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:47,959
Where's toluca lake?

1838
01:56:48,043 --> 01:56:50,462
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank studios.

1839
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:52,339
If jimmie's ass ain't home,

1840
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:53,858
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man,

1841
01:56:53,882 --> 01:56:56,009
because I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1842
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:59,346
Jimmie, yo, how you doing, man?
It's Jules.

1843
01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:00,597
Just listen up, man.

1844
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,825
Me and my homeboy
are in some serious fucking shit, man.

1845
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:04,827
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

1846
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,770
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1847
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:11,191
We got to be real fucking delicate
with this jimmie situation, you know.

1848
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:13,568
He's one remark away
from kicking our asses out the door.

1849
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:14,962
If he does, what do we do?

1850
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:17,656
Well, we ain't leaving
until we made a couple calls,

1851
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,258
but I don't want it to reach that pitch.

1852
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:20,322
I mean, jimmie's a friend.

1853
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:23,054
You don't come into your friend's house
and start telling him what's what.

1854
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,972
Well, just tell him
not to be abusive, that's all.

1855
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,791
I mean, he kind of freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1856
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,268
Well, put yourself in his position.

1857
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:30,603
I mean, it's 8:00 in the morning.

1858
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:32,879
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

1859
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:35,715
I mean, shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

1860
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:37,801
Well, if that favor means
that I got to take shit,

1861
01:57:37,884 --> 01:57:40,387
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass. I don't care.

1862
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,110
Hey, fuck, nigger. What the fuck did you
just do to his towel, man?

1863
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:45,576
- I was drying my hands.
- Well, you're supposed to wash them first.

1864
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,103
- Well, you watched me wash them.
- I watched you get them wet.

1865
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:50,772
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

1866
01:57:50,855 --> 01:57:52,792
Maybe if he had lava,
I could've done a betterjob.

1867
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:54,317
I used the same fucking soap you did,

1868
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:57,153
and when I finished, the towel didn't look
like no goddamn maxi pad.

1869
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,007
Now, what if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this, Vincent?

1870
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:03,285
It's shit like this that's going
to bring this situation to a head, man.

1871
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:08,623
Look... I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

1872
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,542
You know I respect you and all,

1873
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:13,211
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

1874
01:58:13,295 --> 01:58:15,964
All right. Fine. Fine.

1875
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:18,008
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1876
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:21,803
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1877
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,516
Mmm. Goddamn, jimmie.

1878
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,560
This is some serious gourmet shit.

1879
01:58:28,643 --> 01:58:30,562
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied

1880
01:58:30,645 --> 01:58:33,940
with some freeze-dried
taster's choice, right?

1881
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:37,068
And he Springs
this serious gourmet shit on us.

1882
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:39,738
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1883
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:40,947
What?

1884
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:43,908
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is, okay?

1885
01:58:43,992 --> 01:58:46,286
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1886
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:48,413
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1887
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:50,206
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff

1888
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:52,167
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

1889
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,044
But you know what's on my mind right now?

1890
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:56,254
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1891
01:58:56,338 --> 01:58:58,381
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1892
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:00,234
- Oh, jimmie, don't even worry about it.
- No, no, no.

1893
01:59:00,258 --> 01:59:02,820
Don't tell me don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

1894
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:05,781
When you came pulling in here, did you
notice a sign out in the front of my house

1895
01:59:05,805 --> 01:59:07,140
that said "dead nigger storage"?

1896
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:08,933
Jimmie, you know I didn't see no shit...

1897
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:11,019
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house

1898
01:59:11,102 --> 01:59:12,646
that said "dead nigger storage"?

1899
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,732
No. I didn't.

1900
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:18,443
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1901
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:20,463
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers

1902
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:23,073
ain't my fucking business, that's why!

1903
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:26,276
- Jimmie, we're not going to store...
- No, no. Don't you fucking realize, man,

1904
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:29,329
that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,

1905
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:30,580
I'm going to get divorced?

1906
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:32,683
All right? No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

1907
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:36,753
I'm going to get fucking divorced, okay?
And I don't want to get fucking divorced.

1908
01:59:37,379 --> 01:59:40,131
Now, man, you know, fuck.
I mean, I want to help you.

1909
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:42,384
But I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

1910
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:44,552
Jimmie, jimmie,
she ain't going to leave you.

1911
01:59:44,636 --> 01:59:46,471
Don't fucking "jimmie" me, Jules!

1912
01:59:46,554 --> 01:59:48,932
Okay? Don't fucking “jimmie" me.

1913
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:50,495
There's nothing that you're gonna say

1914
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:53,311
that's going to make me forget
that I love my wife, is there?

1915
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:56,815
Now, look, you know,

1916
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:59,943
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

1917
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:03,154
Graveyard shift at the hospital.

1918
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:06,783
You got to make some phone calls?
You got to call some people?

1919
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:09,577
Well, then do it, and then
get the fuck out of my house

1920
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:10,870
before she gets here.

1921
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,205
Hey, that's kool and the gang.

1922
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,974
You know, we don't want
to fuck your shit up.

1923
02:00:13,998 --> 02:00:16,769
All I want to do is call my people,
get them to bring us in, that's all.

1924
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:19,671
You don't want to fuck my shit up?
You're fucking my shit up right now.

1925
02:00:19,754 --> 02:00:22,507
You're going to fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

1926
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:24,426
So just do me that favor, all right?

1927
02:00:24,509 --> 02:00:26,529
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1928
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:28,680
Well, say she comes home,

1929
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:31,099
what do you think she'll do?

1930
02:00:33,393 --> 02:00:35,895
Oh, no fucking shit, she'll freak.

1931
02:00:35,979 --> 02:00:37,647
That ain't no kind of answer.

1932
02:00:38,273 --> 02:00:41,317
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1933
02:00:41,401 --> 02:00:44,612
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element

1934
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:46,239
this Bonnie situation is.

1935
02:00:46,322 --> 02:00:48,575
I mean, if she comes home
fiom a hard days work

1936
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:50,418
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen

1937
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:52,078
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1938
02:00:52,162 --> 02:00:54,372
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

1939
02:00:57,584 --> 02:00:59,461
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

1940
02:01:00,128 --> 02:01:02,172
All I'm doing is contemplating the "ifs."

1941
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,382
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking “ifs."

1942
02:01:04,466 --> 02:01:07,343
All I want to hear from your ass is,
"you ain't got no problem, Jules.

1943
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:08,803
I'm on the motherfucker.

1944
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:10,527
Go back in there, chill them niggers out,

1945
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:13,391
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1946
02:01:13,475 --> 02:01:15,769
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1947
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:18,188
I'm on the motherfucker.

1948
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,940
Go back in there and
chill them niggers out

1949
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:23,985
and wait for the wolf,
who should be coming directly.

1950
02:01:25,153 --> 02:01:26,488
You're sending the wolf?

1951
02:01:27,197 --> 02:01:28,740
You feel better, motherfucker?

1952
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:33,161
Shit, negro, that's all you had to say.

1953
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:36,372
Is she the hysterical type?

1954
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:39,209
When is she due?

1955
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:40,835
Bank six, dianne.

1956
02:01:40,919 --> 02:01:44,631
Mm-hmm.
Give me the principals' names again.

1957
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:45,924
Place your bets.

1958
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:49,135
Jules.

1959
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:54,098
Mm-hmm. Vincent.

1960
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:56,392
Bank?

1961
02:01:57,644 --> 02:02:00,104
- Bank wins...
- Jimmie.

1962
02:02:01,272 --> 02:02:04,275
- Place a bet.
- Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1963
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:10,114
It's 30 minutes away.

1964
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:11,198
I'll be there in ten.

1965
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:31,636
You're jimmie, right? This is your house?

1966
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:32,762
Sure is.

1967
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:35,473
I'm Winston wolf. I solve problems.

1968
02:02:35,557 --> 02:02:36,766
Good. We got one.

1969
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,268
So I heard. May I come in?

1970
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,394
Yeah, please do.

1971
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:44,274
You must be Jules,
which would make you Vincent.

1972
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:46,526
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1973
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:47,711
If I was informed correctly,

1974
02:02:47,735 --> 02:02:49,455
the clock is ticking,
is that right, jimmie?

1975
02:02:49,529 --> 02:02:50,655
Uh, 100%.

1976
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:54,576
Your wife, Bonnie, comes home
at 9:30 in the am, is that correct?

1977
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:55,660
Uh-huh.

1978
02:02:55,743 --> 02:02:58,413
I was led to believe
if she comes home and finds us here,

1979
02:02:58,496 --> 02:03:00,248
she wouldn't appreciate it none too much?

1980
02:03:00,331 --> 02:03:01,416
You wouldn't bet.

1981
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:04,669
All right, that gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck out of dodge,

1982
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:07,922
which, if you do what I say when I say it,
should be plenty.

1983
02:03:08,006 --> 02:03:12,594
Now, you got a corpse in a car
minus a head in a garage. Take me to it.

1984
02:03:20,435 --> 02:03:22,061
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh?

1985
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:24,022
Do me a favor, will you?

1986
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:25,666
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

1987
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:26,816
Would you make me a cup?

1988
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:29,319
Uh, yeah, sure.

1989
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:33,656
Oh, um, how do you take it?

1990
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,283
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.

1991
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,598
About the car, is there
anything I need to know?

1992
02:03:40,622 --> 02:03:42,999
Does it stall, does it smoke,
does it make a lot of noise?

1993
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:44,584
Is there gas in it? Anything?

1994
02:03:44,667 --> 02:03:46,628
Aside from how it looks, the car is cool.

1995
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,589
Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road,

1996
02:03:49,672 --> 02:03:51,232
I find out the brake lights don't work.

1997
02:03:51,257 --> 02:03:53,801
Hey, man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.

1998
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:55,845
Good enough.

1999
02:03:56,679 --> 02:03:58,556
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2000
02:04:04,395 --> 02:04:05,438
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2001
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,606
Thank you, jimmie.

2002
02:04:12,362 --> 02:04:13,446
Mmm.

2003
02:04:15,031 --> 02:04:16,658
Okay. First thing.

2004
02:04:16,741 --> 02:04:19,452
You two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2005
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:22,163
Now, jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2006
02:04:22,246 --> 02:04:24,475
That would lead me to believe
in the garage or under the sink,

2007
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:26,226
you got a bunch of cleaners
and shit like that.

2008
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:28,086
- Yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink.
- Good.

2009
02:04:28,169 --> 02:04:30,522
What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products

2010
02:04:30,546 --> 02:04:31,965
and clean the inside of the car.

2011
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:33,883
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2012
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:35,426
You need to go in the back seat,

2013
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:38,554
scoop up all those little pieces
of brain and skull.

2014
02:04:38,638 --> 02:04:40,640
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2015
02:04:40,723 --> 02:04:43,410
Now, when it comes to upholstery,
it don't need to be spick-and-span.

2016
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:46,270
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once-over.

2017
02:04:46,354 --> 02:04:48,982
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2018
02:04:49,065 --> 02:04:52,068
The pools of blood that have collected,
you got to soak that shit up.

2019
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:53,152
Now, jimmie,

2020
02:04:53,903 --> 02:04:55,488
we need to raid your linen closet.

2021
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:56,990
I need blankets. I need comforters.

2022
02:04:57,073 --> 02:04:58,783
I need quilts. I need bedspreads.

2023
02:04:58,866 --> 02:05:00,511
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2024
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:02,453
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2025
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:04,789
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2026
02:05:04,872 --> 02:05:07,750
We're going to line the front seat
and the back seat and the floorboards

2027
02:05:07,834 --> 02:05:09,377
with quilts and blankets.

2028
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:10,503
So if a cop stops us

2029
02:05:10,586 --> 02:05:12,346
and starts sticking
his big snout in the car,

2030
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:13,840
the subterfuge won't last,

2031
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,925
but at a glance,
the car will appear to be normal.

2032
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:19,554
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

2033
02:05:19,637 --> 02:05:20,638
A "please" would be nice.

2034
02:05:21,973 --> 02:05:22,974
Come again?

2035
02:05:23,057 --> 02:05:25,059
I said a "please" would be nice.

2036
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:29,230
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2037
02:05:29,313 --> 02:05:30,815
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2038
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:34,569
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

2039
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:36,529
you better fucking do it and do it quick.

2040
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,198
I'm here to help.

2041
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:41,993
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2042
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:43,716
No, no, no, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that.

2043
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:46,414
- Your help is definitely appreciated.
- Mr. Wolf, listen.

2044
02:05:46,497 --> 02:05:48,916
I don't mean disrespect, okay?
I respect you.

2045
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,294
I just don't like people
barking orders at me, that's all.

2046
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:54,213
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2047
02:05:54,297 --> 02:05:56,174
I think fast, I talk fast,

2048
02:05:56,257 --> 02:05:59,302
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want to get out of this.

2049
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:01,345
So pretty please with sugar on top,

2050
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:02,597
clean the fucking car.

2051
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:08,978
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2052
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:10,271
I can feel your look.

2053
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:15,735
It's a 1974 Chevy nova.

2054
02:06:18,237 --> 02:06:19,280
Green.

2055
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:23,701
Nothing except for the mess inside.

2056
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:29,207
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

2057
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:32,418
Nobody who'll be missed.

2058
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:36,631
You're a good man, Joe.

2059
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:37,799
Thanks a bunch.

2060
02:06:39,008 --> 02:06:40,093
How we coming, jimmie?

2061
02:06:40,176 --> 02:06:42,303
Uh, pretty good.
I got... I got it all here,

2062
02:06:42,386 --> 02:06:44,222
but, uh...

2063
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:45,945
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.

2064
02:06:45,973 --> 02:06:47,642
Winston, jimmie, please. Winston.

2065
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:48,726
Okay.

2066
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:51,395
You gotta
understand something now, Winston.

2067
02:06:51,479 --> 02:06:53,397
Uh, no, thank you.

2068
02:06:53,481 --> 02:06:56,567
Uh, this is our best linen here,

2069
02:06:56,651 --> 02:06:58,194
and it's a...

2070
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:01,489
It was a wedding present
from my uncle Conrad and my aunt Ginny,

2071
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:02,990
and they're not with us anymore.

2072
02:07:03,074 --> 02:07:06,234
- And I really want to help you guys out...
- Let me ask you a question, jimmie.

2073
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:09,372
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please, please. Go ahead.

2074
02:07:11,207 --> 02:07:14,085
Your uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny,

2075
02:07:14,836 --> 02:07:16,003
were they millionaires?

2076
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:20,508
Well, your uncle marsellus is,

2077
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:24,762
and I'm positive if
uncle Conrad and aunt...

2078
02:07:25,429 --> 02:07:27,682
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

2079
02:07:27,765 --> 02:07:31,227
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

2080
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:34,564
which your uncle marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2081
02:07:39,152 --> 02:07:40,444
I like oak myself.

2082
02:07:40,528 --> 02:07:42,947
That's what I have in my bedroom.

2083
02:07:44,198 --> 02:07:45,449
How about you, jimmie?

2084
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:48,536
You an oak man?

2085
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:51,497
Oak's nice.

2086
02:07:58,296 --> 02:08:00,131
Oh, man.

2087
02:08:00,214 --> 02:08:02,091
I will never forgive your ass
for this shit.

2088
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:04,260
This is some fucked-up repugnant shit.

2089
02:08:04,343 --> 02:08:07,680
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong

2090
02:08:07,763 --> 02:08:10,224
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2091
02:08:10,308 --> 02:08:11,350
Have you ever heard that?

2092
02:08:11,434 --> 02:08:13,060
Get the fuck out my face with that shit.

2093
02:08:13,144 --> 02:08:14,395
The motherfucker said that shit

2094
02:08:14,478 --> 02:08:17,565
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull on account of your dumb ass.

2095
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:18,774
I got a threshold, Jules.

2096
02:08:18,858 --> 02:08:20,943
I got a threshold for
the abuse that I will take.

2097
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:22,987
Now, right now,
I'm a fucking race car, all right?

2098
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:24,882
And you got me in the red.
And I'm just saying...

2099
02:08:24,906 --> 02:08:26,657
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous

2100
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:29,035
to have a race car in
the fucking red, that's all.

2101
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,119
I could blow.

2102
02:08:30,203 --> 02:08:32,203
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2103
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:35,082
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2104
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:36,792
Every time my fingers touch brain,

2105
02:08:36,876 --> 02:08:40,213
I'm super fly t.N.T.
I'm the guns of the navarone.

2106
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,632
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2107
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,926
You the motherfucker who
should be on brain detail.

2108
02:08:45,009 --> 02:08:46,010
We fucking switching.

2109
02:08:46,093 --> 02:08:48,721
I'm washing the windows,
and you picking up this nigger's skull.

2110
02:08:58,898 --> 02:09:00,233
Fine job, gentlemen.

2111
02:09:01,901 --> 02:09:03,694
We may get out of this yet.

2112
02:09:03,778 --> 02:09:05,613
I can't believe this is the same car.

2113
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:09,533
Well, let's not start
sucking each other's dicks quite yet.

2114
02:09:10,201 --> 02:09:11,744
Phase one is complete, clean the car,

2115
02:09:11,827 --> 02:09:13,579
which moves us right along to phase two.

2116
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:14,789
Clean you two.

2117
02:09:18,167 --> 02:09:19,168
Strip.

2118
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,670
All the way?

2119
02:09:20,753 --> 02:09:22,046
To your bare ass.

2120
02:09:23,089 --> 02:09:24,674
Quickly, gentlemen.

2121
02:09:25,299 --> 02:09:26,384
We got about 15 minutes

2122
02:09:26,467 --> 02:09:29,303
before jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

2123
02:09:29,387 --> 02:09:31,806
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2124
02:09:31,889 --> 02:09:33,724
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

2125
02:09:33,808 --> 02:09:35,268
You know what you two look like?

2126
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,352
What?

2127
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:38,635
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

2128
02:09:39,939 --> 02:09:43,192
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2129
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:49,407
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2130
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:51,826
Don't do nothing stupid,
like leaving this shit out front

2131
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:54,412
for Otto the garbageman to pick up,
you know what I'm saying?

2132
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,414
Don't worry. We're taking it with us.

2133
02:09:56,497 --> 02:09:58,165
Jim, the soap.

2134
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:02,712
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen,

2135
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:05,715
you've both been to county before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

2136
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,301
- Goddamn! The water's fucking cold.
- Oh!

2137
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:10,094
Better you than me, gentlemen.

2138
02:10:12,638 --> 02:10:15,016
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

2139
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:16,785
Get him up there a little bit.

2140
02:10:16,809 --> 02:10:18,249
- Vincent's hair.
- Shit out my hair.

2141
02:10:18,311 --> 02:10:20,021
Come on, do it, goddamn it. Do it!

2142
02:10:20,104 --> 02:10:21,147
Uh, uh...

2143
02:10:22,106 --> 02:10:23,232
Towel 'em.

2144
02:10:34,618 --> 02:10:36,778
They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2145
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:40,958
Perfect.

2146
02:10:41,042 --> 02:10:43,377
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2147
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:45,921
You guys look like...

2148
02:10:47,089 --> 02:10:48,632
What do they look like, jimmie?

2149
02:10:49,342 --> 02:10:50,384
Dorks.

2150
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,928
They look like a couple of dorks.

2151
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:56,223
Ha-ha-ha.
They're your clothes, motherfucker.

2152
02:10:56,307 --> 02:10:59,101
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

2153
02:10:59,185 --> 02:11:00,311
Don't make me beg.

2154
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:07,485
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules of the road straight.

2155
02:11:07,568 --> 02:11:10,071
We're going to a place
called monster Joe's truck and tow.

2156
02:11:10,821 --> 02:11:14,158
Now, monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2157
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:16,327
The place is north Hollywood,

2158
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:17,912
so a few twists and turns aside,

2159
02:11:17,995 --> 02:11:19,413
we'll be going up Hollywood way.

2160
02:11:20,331 --> 02:11:22,541
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.

2161
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:23,626
Jules, you ride with me.

2162
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:24,919
Mm-hmm.

2163
02:11:25,002 --> 02:11:26,962
Vincent, you follow in my acura.

2164
02:11:27,046 --> 02:11:31,050
Now, if we come across
the path of any John q. Laws,

2165
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:33,135
nobody does a fucking thing
until I do something.

2166
02:11:33,219 --> 02:11:34,762
- Right.
- What did I say?

2167
02:11:35,429 --> 02:11:36,972
Don't do shit unless.

2168
02:11:37,056 --> 02:11:38,182
Unless what?

2169
02:11:38,265 --> 02:11:39,475
Unless you do it first.

2170
02:11:39,558 --> 02:11:41,894
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2171
02:11:41,977 --> 02:11:43,104
How about you, lash la rue?

2172
02:11:43,187 --> 02:11:45,606
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2173
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:47,274
Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off.

2174
02:11:47,358 --> 02:11:49,652
I don't why. I'm cool. I promise you.

2175
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:50,778
Fair enough.

2176
02:11:50,861 --> 02:11:53,030
Now, I drive real fucking fast,
so keep up.

2177
02:11:53,114 --> 02:11:55,449
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it,

2178
02:11:55,533 --> 02:11:58,202
monster Joe's going
to be disposing of two bodies.

2179
02:12:01,831 --> 02:12:03,082
Out of my way, Rex.

2180
02:12:05,459 --> 02:12:07,837
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

2181
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:09,630
All right.

2182
02:12:09,713 --> 02:12:11,715
Boys, this is Raquel.

2183
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:13,759
Someday, all this will be hers.

2184
02:12:13,843 --> 02:12:17,221
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2185
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:19,640
You guys going
to a volleyball game or something?

2186
02:12:22,143 --> 02:12:24,145
I'm taking my lady out for breakfast.

2187
02:12:24,228 --> 02:12:26,123
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

2188
02:12:26,147 --> 02:12:27,523
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

2189
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:31,026
It's... it's your future. I...

2190
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:33,446
I see a... a cab ride.

2191
02:12:34,196 --> 02:12:35,906
Move out of the sticks, fellas.

2192
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:37,199
Say good night, Raquel.

2193
02:12:37,283 --> 02:12:38,451
Good night, Raquel.

2194
02:12:38,534 --> 02:12:39,910
I'll see you guys around.

2195
02:12:39,994 --> 02:12:41,745
Stay out of trouble, you crazy kids.

2196
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:45,666
Mr. Wolf, I just want to tell you
it was a real pleasure watching you work.

2197
02:12:45,749 --> 02:12:48,127
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

2198
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,130
Call me Winston.

2199
02:12:53,007 --> 02:12:56,051
You see that, young lady? Respect.

2200
02:12:56,135 --> 02:13:00,389
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

2201
02:13:00,473 --> 02:13:02,224
Because you are a character

2202
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:04,268
doesn't mean that you have character.

2203
02:13:12,401 --> 02:13:13,569
Wanna share a cab?

2204
02:13:13,652 --> 02:13:15,922
You know, I could go for some breakfast.

2205
02:13:15,946 --> 02:13:17,531
Feel like having breakfast with me?

2206
02:13:18,407 --> 02:13:19,617
Cool.

2207
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:26,040
I don't know why,

2208
02:13:26,123 --> 02:13:28,268
I just thought he'd be European
or something, because he...

2209
02:13:28,292 --> 02:13:30,544
Yo, man, he's about as
European as fucking English Bob.

2210
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:32,588
- I know that now, but...
- Was he cool or what?

2211
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:33,672
Thank you.

2212
02:13:33,756 --> 02:13:36,634
Totally fucking cool, in control.

2213
02:13:36,717 --> 02:13:39,803
Didn't even, you know, really get pissed
when you were fucking with him.

2214
02:13:39,887 --> 02:13:41,055
I was amazed.

2215
02:13:42,473 --> 02:13:43,682
Want some bacon?

2216
02:13:43,766 --> 02:13:45,601
No, man. I don't eat pork.

2217
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:46,810
Are you Jewish?

2218
02:13:46,894 --> 02:13:49,230
No, I ain't Jewish.
I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

2219
02:13:49,313 --> 02:13:50,731
Why not?

2220
02:13:50,814 --> 02:13:53,692
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

2221
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:55,861
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.

2222
02:13:55,945 --> 02:13:57,404
Pork chops taste good.

2223
02:13:57,488 --> 02:13:59,532
Hey, a sewer rat
may taste like pumpkin pie,

2224
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,576
but I'd never know because I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

2225
02:14:03,494 --> 02:14:05,412
Pigs sleep and root in shit.

2226
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:06,997
That's a filthy animal.

2227
02:14:07,081 --> 02:14:10,161
I ain't eating nothing that ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

2228
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:12,878
How about a dog? A dog eats his own feces.

2229
02:14:12,962 --> 02:14:14,213
I don't eat dog, either.

2230
02:14:15,089 --> 02:14:17,591
Yeah, but do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

2231
02:14:18,592 --> 02:14:20,678
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

2232
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:22,680
but they're definitely dirty.

2233
02:14:22,763 --> 02:14:24,557
But a dog's got personality.

2234
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:26,183
Personality goes a long way.

2235
02:14:26,267 --> 02:14:27,685
Ah. So by that rationale,

2236
02:14:27,768 --> 02:14:29,353
if a pig had a better personality,

2237
02:14:29,436 --> 02:14:31,230
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

2238
02:14:31,313 --> 02:14:32,314
Is that true?

2239
02:14:32,398 --> 02:14:35,317
Well, we'd have to be talking about
one charming motherfucking pig.

2240
02:14:35,401 --> 02:14:37,319
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming

2241
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:39,523
than that Arnold on green acres,
know what I'm saying?

2242
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:46,954
Oh, man, that's good.

2243
02:14:47,037 --> 02:14:49,832
That's good, man.
You're starting to lighten up.

2244
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,210
You been sitting there
all serious and shit.

2245
02:14:53,294 --> 02:14:55,129
Man, I've just been sitting here thinking.

2246
02:14:55,212 --> 02:14:56,380
About what?

2247
02:14:56,463 --> 02:14:57,756
About the miracle we witnessed.

2248
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:01,135
The miracle you witnessed.
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

2249
02:15:01,218 --> 02:15:02,553
What is a miracle, Vincent?

2250
02:15:04,805 --> 02:15:05,973
An act of god.

2251
02:15:06,056 --> 02:15:07,600
And what's an act of god?

2252
02:15:11,395 --> 02:15:14,982
When, um,
god makes the impossible possible.

2253
02:15:16,025 --> 02:15:20,112
But this morning I don't think qualifies.

2254
02:15:20,195 --> 02:15:22,948
Hey, Vincent, don't you see
that shit don't matter?

2255
02:15:23,032 --> 02:15:24,592
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

2256
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:27,161
I mean, it could be
god stopped the bullets,

2257
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:30,122
or he changed coke to Pepsi,
he found my fucking car keys.

2258
02:15:30,205 --> 02:15:32,583
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

2259
02:15:32,666 --> 02:15:34,585
Now, whether or not what we experienced

2260
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:38,422
was an "according to hoyle" miracle
is insignificant.

2261
02:15:38,505 --> 02:15:42,760
But what is significant
is I felt the touch of god.

2262
02:15:42,843 --> 02:15:44,178
God got involved.

2263
02:15:44,928 --> 02:15:45,971
But why?

2264
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:49,183
Well, that's what's fucking with me.
I don't know why.

2265
02:15:49,266 --> 02:15:51,185
But I can't go back to sleep.

2266
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:54,104
You're serious?
You're really thinking about quitting?

2267
02:15:54,188 --> 02:15:55,773
- The life?
- Yeah.

2268
02:15:55,856 --> 02:15:56,857
Most definitely.

2269
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:58,275
Fuck.

2270
02:15:58,984 --> 02:16:00,277
What you going to do, then?

2271
02:16:01,695 --> 02:16:03,113
Well...

2272
02:16:03,197 --> 02:16:05,237
That's what I've been
sitting here contemplating.

2273
02:16:06,033 --> 02:16:09,161
First, I'm going to deliver this case
to marsellus.

2274
02:16:09,828 --> 02:16:12,665
Then, basically,
I'm just going to walk the earth.

2275
02:16:12,748 --> 02:16:14,124
What you mean, "walk the earth"?

2276
02:16:14,208 --> 02:16:16,293
You know, like caine in kung fu.

2277
02:16:16,377 --> 02:16:19,213
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

2278
02:16:19,296 --> 02:16:21,548
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

2279
02:16:21,632 --> 02:16:23,717
Until god puts me where he wants me to be.

2280
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:24,961
And what if he don't do that?

2281
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:27,388
If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

2282
02:16:28,347 --> 02:16:29,932
So you decided to be a bum?

2283
02:16:30,015 --> 02:16:33,644
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

2284
02:16:33,727 --> 02:16:35,688
No, Jules. You decided to be a bum.

2285
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:37,731
Just like all those pieces of shit
out there

2286
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:40,609
who beg for change,
who sleep in garbage bins,

2287
02:16:40,693 --> 02:16:42,069
eat what I throw away.

2288
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,696
They got a name for that, Jules.

2289
02:16:43,779 --> 02:16:45,239
It's called a bum.

2290
02:16:45,322 --> 02:16:48,242
And without a job,
a residence, or legal tender,

2291
02:16:48,325 --> 02:16:50,887
that's what you're going to be, man.
You're going to be a fucking bum.

2292
02:16:50,911 --> 02:16:53,831
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

2293
02:16:53,914 --> 02:16:55,082
Garcon.

2294
02:16:55,749 --> 02:16:56,750
Coffee.

2295
02:16:56,834 --> 02:17:01,422
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

2296
02:17:01,505 --> 02:17:04,508
- But water into wine. I...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

2297
02:17:04,591 --> 02:17:07,845
- Don't fucking talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you, Vincent,

2298
02:17:07,928 --> 02:17:10,347
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

2299
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:15,144
I'm going to take a shit.

2300
02:17:19,565 --> 02:17:22,401
Let me ask you something.
When did you make this decision?

2301
02:17:22,484 --> 02:17:24,129
When you were sitting there
eating that muffin?

2302
02:17:24,153 --> 02:17:25,362
Well, yeah.

2303
02:17:25,446 --> 02:17:27,948
I was sitting here eating my muffin
and drinking my coffee

2304
02:17:28,031 --> 02:17:29,867
and replaying the incident in my head

2305
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:33,954
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

2306
02:17:34,705 --> 02:17:35,914
Fuck.

2307
02:17:35,998 --> 02:17:37,458
To be continued.

2308
02:17:49,178 --> 02:17:50,679
I love you, pumpkin.

2309
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:52,514
And I love you, honey bunny.

2310
02:17:53,724 --> 02:17:55,684
Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!

2311
02:17:55,768 --> 02:17:58,520
Any of you fucking pricks move,

2312
02:17:58,604 --> 02:18:01,940
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

2313
02:18:02,024 --> 02:18:03,609
You got that?

2314
02:18:03,692 --> 02:18:05,194
You just be quiet over there!

2315
02:18:05,277 --> 02:18:06,987
Get the fuck down!

2316
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:08,322
Get the fuck down!

2317
02:18:08,405 --> 02:18:10,240
You, you're in a blind spot.

2318
02:18:10,324 --> 02:18:13,118
Take your dames over to that booth
over there on the count of ten.

2319
02:18:13,202 --> 02:18:14,703
Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!

2320
02:18:14,787 --> 02:18:17,748
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

2321
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:20,918
Where the fuck are you going?
You fucking yuppie! Get down!

2322
02:18:21,001 --> 02:18:25,589
- Hey, you, throw those bags!
- Fucking wanker! Move! Move!

2323
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:28,383
What the fuck are you doing? Move!

2324
02:18:28,467 --> 02:18:31,507
- The restaurant's ours!
- Move! Get down on the fucking floor!

2325
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:33,388
Grandpa, down!

2326
02:18:33,472 --> 02:18:34,973
I'm the manager here,

2327
02:18:35,057 --> 02:18:37,059
and there's no problem. No problem at all.

2328
02:18:37,142 --> 02:18:39,704
- You're going to give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

2329
02:18:39,728 --> 02:18:41,998
I thought you said
you're going to give me a fucking problem!

2330
02:18:42,022 --> 02:18:43,732
You're going to give me a fucking problem?

2331
02:18:45,317 --> 02:18:49,446
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny!
- Well, just execute him!

2332
02:18:50,072 --> 02:18:52,616
I am not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop...

2333
02:18:52,699 --> 02:18:53,909
Get the fuck down!

2334
02:18:53,992 --> 02:18:55,744
The restaurant's ours!

2335
02:18:55,828 --> 02:18:57,830
Just take whatever you want.

2336
02:18:58,914 --> 02:19:00,833
- All right, you talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

2337
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:02,835
- You tell them to be fucking cool...
- Yes.

2338
02:19:02,918 --> 02:19:04,354
- And everything will be over!
- Yeah.

2339
02:19:04,378 --> 02:19:06,004
- You understand me?
- Yes.

2340
02:19:08,423 --> 02:19:09,675
Listen, everybody.

2341
02:19:10,342 --> 02:19:13,053
Be calm, cooperate,

2342
02:19:13,136 --> 02:19:15,347
and this will all be over in a minute.

2343
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:17,224
Get the fuck down! Well done.

2344
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:31,029
All right, now, people,

2345
02:19:31,113 --> 02:19:33,049
I'm going to come around
and collect your wallets.

2346
02:19:33,073 --> 02:19:34,199
You don't fucking talk.

2347
02:19:34,283 --> 02:19:36,702
You just throw them in the bag.
Are we clear?

2348
02:19:36,785 --> 02:19:38,537
I said, are we fucking clear?

2349
02:19:39,037 --> 02:19:40,789
Good. Now wallets out.

2350
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:44,376
That's it. Get the fuck down.

2351
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:45,669
In the bag.

2352
02:19:45,752 --> 02:19:47,087
In the fucking bag!

2353
02:19:47,170 --> 02:19:48,964
I don't have nothing on me, man.

2354
02:19:51,508 --> 02:19:53,528
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

2355
02:19:53,552 --> 02:19:55,846
Laura? Laura, tips.

2356
02:19:55,929 --> 02:19:57,264
- In the bag.
- Yeah.

2357
02:19:57,848 --> 02:19:58,849
Is that a cellular phone?

2358
02:19:58,932 --> 02:20:00,475
- Yeah.
- In the fucking bag.

2359
02:20:02,477 --> 02:20:05,898
Tidy up, tidy up. That's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

2360
02:20:05,981 --> 02:20:07,482
In the bag.

2361
02:20:07,566 --> 02:20:08,817
In the bag.

2362
02:20:21,121 --> 02:20:22,414
In the bag.

2363
02:20:38,096 --> 02:20:40,474
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

2364
02:20:40,557 --> 02:20:43,036
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

2365
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:44,061
Sounds like a shitjob.

2366
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:46,897
- Funny. I was thinking the same thing.
- Open it.

2367
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:48,857
Afraid I can't do that.

2368
02:20:50,817 --> 02:20:51,818
I didn't hear you.

2369
02:20:51,902 --> 02:20:53,236
Yes, you did.

2370
02:20:54,363 --> 02:20:55,656
What's going on?

2371
02:20:56,698 --> 02:20:58,676
Looks like we got a vigilante
in our midst.

2372
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:00,327
Shoot him in the face.

2373
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:02,639
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time

2374
02:21:02,663 --> 02:21:03,997
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2375
02:21:04,081 --> 02:21:06,517
You don't take your fucking hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2376
02:21:06,541 --> 02:21:08,728
Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2377
02:21:08,752 --> 02:21:10,396
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here!

2378
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:13,799
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your goddamn business.

2379
02:21:15,008 --> 02:21:17,177
Be cool, honey bunny. Be cool.

2380
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,096
It's no problem. I got it under control.

2381
02:21:20,889 --> 02:21:22,683
Now, I'm going to count to three.

2382
02:21:24,393 --> 02:21:25,936
If you don't open that case,

2383
02:21:26,019 --> 02:21:28,230
I'm going to unload in your fucking face.

2384
02:21:32,651 --> 02:21:33,986
We clear?

2385
02:21:37,614 --> 02:21:38,615
One...

2386
02:21:42,536 --> 02:21:43,704
Two...

2387
02:21:45,038 --> 02:21:46,123
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

2388
02:21:46,206 --> 02:21:47,457
You win.

2389
02:21:48,542 --> 02:21:49,793
It's yours.

2390
02:21:55,632 --> 02:21:57,050
Open it.

2391
02:22:01,221 --> 02:22:02,556
What is it?

2392
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:05,017
What is it?

2393
02:22:07,102 --> 02:22:09,521
- Is that what I think it is?
- Mm-hmm.

2394
02:22:13,108 --> 02:22:14,748
It's beautiful.

2395
02:22:14,776 --> 02:22:17,320
Goddamn it, what is it?

2396
02:22:19,489 --> 02:22:22,784
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2397
02:22:22,868 --> 02:22:24,846
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2398
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:26,639
- Say, "bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, honey bunny!

2399
02:22:26,663 --> 02:22:28,081
- Say, "bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2400
02:22:28,165 --> 02:22:30,584
- Tell that fucking bitch to chill!
- Be cool, honey bunny!

2401
02:22:30,667 --> 02:22:32,961
- Chill that fucking bitch out!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

2402
02:22:33,045 --> 02:22:34,188
- Let go of him!
- Chill!

2403
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:35,481
Chill out, honey bunny!

2404
02:22:35,505 --> 02:22:36,945
Tell her it's going to be all right.

2405
02:22:37,007 --> 02:22:38,568
- It's going to be all right.
- Promise her!

2406
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:39,872
- I promise!
- Tell her to chill!

2407
02:22:39,926 --> 02:22:42,196
- Just chill out, honey bunny!
- All right, now tell me her name.

2408
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:44,222
- Yolanda.
- All right, now, yolanda!

2409
02:22:44,306 --> 02:22:46,099
We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2410
02:22:46,183 --> 02:22:49,061
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2411
02:22:49,144 --> 02:22:51,396
We're all gonna be like
three little fonzies here.

2412
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:52,481
And what's fonzie like?

2413
02:22:54,107 --> 02:22:55,817
Come on, yolanda, what's fonzie like?

2414
02:22:55,901 --> 02:22:56,901
He's cool?

2415
02:22:56,943 --> 02:22:58,195
- What?
- Cool.

2416
02:22:58,278 --> 02:22:59,821
Correctamundo!

2417
02:22:59,905 --> 02:23:03,116
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2418
02:23:03,742 --> 02:23:07,454
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

2419
02:23:08,538 --> 02:23:10,373
And when I count three,

2420
02:23:10,457 --> 02:23:12,709
I want you to let go of your gun,

2421
02:23:12,793 --> 02:23:14,711
put your palms flat on the table,

2422
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:17,214
and sit your ass down.

2423
02:23:17,923 --> 02:23:21,593
But when you do it, you do it cool.

2424
02:23:22,511 --> 02:23:23,678
You ready?

2425
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:26,014
One...

2426
02:23:26,932 --> 02:23:28,183
Two...

2427
02:23:29,351 --> 02:23:30,393
Three.

2428
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:40,487
Okay, now you let him go!

2429
02:23:40,570 --> 02:23:42,739
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.

2430
02:23:42,823 --> 02:23:44,699
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2431
02:23:44,783 --> 02:23:46,868
And when I get nervous, I get scared.

2432
02:23:46,952 --> 02:23:48,912
And when motherfuckers get scared,

2433
02:23:48,995 --> 02:23:51,498
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2434
02:23:52,791 --> 02:23:56,044
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2435
02:23:57,295 --> 02:23:59,840
Well, that seems to be the situation.

2436
02:23:59,923 --> 02:24:03,593
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that,

2437
02:24:03,677 --> 02:24:06,596
and Ringo here
definitely doesn't want that.

2438
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,473
So let's see what we can do.

2439
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:11,393
Now...

2440
02:24:12,227 --> 02:24:13,812
Here's the situation.

2441
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:18,108
Normally both your asses
would be dead as fucking fried chicken,

2442
02:24:18,191 --> 02:24:19,544
but you happened to pull this shit

2443
02:24:19,568 --> 02:24:22,088
while I'm in a transitional period,
and I don't want to kill you.

2444
02:24:22,112 --> 02:24:23,613
I want to help you.

2445
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:25,657
But I can't give you this case,

2446
02:24:26,366 --> 02:24:27,951
'cause it don't belong to me.

2447
02:24:28,577 --> 02:24:31,913
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning

2448
02:24:31,997 --> 02:24:33,915
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

2449
02:24:35,041 --> 02:24:36,501
- Vincent!
- [Gasps}

2450
02:24:36,585 --> 02:24:37,627
be cool!

2451
02:24:38,253 --> 02:24:41,298
Yolanda, it's cool, baby! It's cool!

2452
02:24:41,381 --> 02:24:43,842
We still just talking!
Come on, point the gun at me!

2453
02:24:43,925 --> 02:24:46,636
Point the gun at me! There you go.

2454
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:50,849
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2455
02:24:50,932 --> 02:24:52,475
Tell her we're still cool.

2456
02:24:53,393 --> 02:24:56,271
- We're still cool, honey bunny.
- How we doing, baby?

2457
02:24:57,439 --> 02:24:59,316
I... I gotta go pee.

2458
02:25:00,317 --> 02:25:02,319
- I want to go home.
- Just hang in there, baby.

2459
02:25:02,402 --> 02:25:05,197
You're doing great. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2460
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,698
It's almost over.

2461
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:08,200
Tell her you're proud of her.

2462
02:25:08,992 --> 02:25:11,828
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

2463
02:25:11,912 --> 02:25:13,622
I love you, too, honey bunny.

2464
02:25:13,705 --> 02:25:17,459
Now, I want you to go in that bag

2465
02:25:17,542 --> 02:25:19,127
and find my wallet.

2466
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:22,964
Which one is it?

2467
02:25:23,048 --> 02:25:25,258
It's the one that says,
"bad motherfucker."

2468
02:25:39,856 --> 02:25:43,235
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

2469
02:25:43,318 --> 02:25:45,570
Open it up. Take out the money.

2470
02:25:51,618 --> 02:25:52,786
Count it.

2471
02:25:59,501 --> 02:26:00,794
How much is there?

2472
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:05,465
About $1,500.

2473
02:26:05,548 --> 02:26:07,842
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

2474
02:26:08,802 --> 02:26:11,513
Now, with the rest of those wallets
and the register,

2475
02:26:11,596 --> 02:26:14,182
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?

2476
02:26:14,266 --> 02:26:16,476
Jules, you give
that fucking nimrod $1,500,

2477
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:19,080
- and I'll shoot him on general principle.
- No, yolanda, yolanda!

2478
02:26:19,104 --> 02:26:21,189
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfucking thing.

2479
02:26:21,273 --> 02:26:23,233
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2480
02:26:24,067 --> 02:26:26,861
- Shut up!
- Come on, yolanda, stay with me, baby.

2481
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,282
Now, I ain't giving it to him, Vincent.

2482
02:26:30,949 --> 02:26:32,742
I'm buying something for my money.

2483
02:26:34,244 --> 02:26:35,787
Wanna know what I'm buying, Ringo?

2484
02:26:36,413 --> 02:26:38,331
- What?
- Your life.

2485
02:26:39,124 --> 02:26:42,002
I'm giving you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2486
02:26:43,461 --> 02:26:44,754
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2487
02:26:46,214 --> 02:26:47,757
Not regularly, no.

2488
02:26:47,841 --> 02:26:50,260
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2489
02:26:50,844 --> 02:26:53,096
Ezekiel 25:17.

2490
02:26:54,222 --> 02:26:55,765
"The path of the righteous man

2491
02:26:55,849 --> 02:26:59,144
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish

2492
02:26:59,227 --> 02:27:00,770
and the tyranny of evil men.

2493
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:04,524
Blessed is he
who in the name of charity and good will

2494
02:27:04,607 --> 02:27:06,776
Shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2495
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:10,572
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2496
02:27:11,197 --> 02:27:15,535
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger

2497
02:27:15,618 --> 02:27:18,413
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2498
02:27:19,372 --> 02:27:21,666
And you will know I am the lord

2499
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:24,085
when I lay my vengeance upon you."

2500
02:27:26,338 --> 02:27:28,590
Now, I been saying that shit for years.

2501
02:27:28,673 --> 02:27:31,634
And if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2502
02:27:33,178 --> 02:27:34,888
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2503
02:27:34,971 --> 02:27:36,765
I just thought it was
some cold-blooded shit

2504
02:27:36,848 --> 02:27:40,393
to say to a motherfucker
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2505
02:27:40,477 --> 02:27:42,854
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2506
02:27:44,147 --> 02:27:45,565
See, now I'm thinking

2507
02:27:46,358 --> 02:27:49,819
maybe it means you're the evil man

2508
02:27:49,903 --> 02:27:51,988
and I'm the righteous man,

2509
02:27:52,072 --> 02:27:53,948
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,

2510
02:27:54,032 --> 02:27:56,201
he's the Shepherd
protecting my righteous ass

2511
02:27:56,284 --> 02:27:57,952
in the valley of darkness.

2512
02:27:58,745 --> 02:28:00,163
Or it could mean

2513
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:04,084
you're the righteous man
and I'm the Shepherd,

2514
02:28:04,167 --> 02:28:07,337
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2515
02:28:08,296 --> 02:28:09,756
Now, I'd like that.

2516
02:28:10,507 --> 02:28:12,342
But that shit ain't the truth.

2517
02:28:13,718 --> 02:28:14,969
The truth is...

2518
02:28:16,805 --> 02:28:18,848
You're the weak...

2519
02:28:19,891 --> 02:28:23,019
And I am the tyranny of evil men.

2520
02:28:24,521 --> 02:28:26,439
But I'm trying, Ringo.

2521
02:28:27,774 --> 02:28:32,195
I'm trying real hard to be the Shepherd.

2522
02:29:08,648 --> 02:29:11,025
I think we should be leaving now.

2523
02:29:11,109 --> 02:29:13,027
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
