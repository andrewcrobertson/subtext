believe it.

What kind of
a shark is that?

518

I don't know.

519
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,139
I think it's a mako.

520
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,473
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

521
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

522
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,810
Tiger shark.

523
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,855

524

plenty of pictures?

Oh, you bet he is.

What is this
bite radius crap?

528
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,195
That is a big mouth.

529
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,239
You stuff
your frigging head
in there, man,

530
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,325
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

531
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,832
All I'm saying is
that it may not be
the shark.

532
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,083
It's just a slight...

533

This is Larry Vaughn,
our mayor.

Nice to meet you.

536
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,341
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

537
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,721
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

538
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,015
Hammerheads,
white tips,
blues, makos.

539
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,101
And the chances
that these bozos
got the exact shark...

540
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,103
There are no other
sharks like this here.

541
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,105
It's 100-to-1.

542
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,818
I'm not saying that
this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

543
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare
for these waters.

544
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,365
But the fact is,
the bite radius
on this animal

545
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,910
is different
than the wounds
on the victim.

546
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,080
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

547
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,707
We all want to
be sure, okay?

548
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,417
What I want to do
is very simple.

549
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,295
The digestive system
of this animal
is very slow.

550
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,505
Let's cut it open.

551
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,507
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

552
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,050
is bound to
still be in there.

553
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,093
And then we'll be sure.

554
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,143
It may be the only way
to confirm it.

555
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,562
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

This is not
the time or the place

to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy
on a fish.

558
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,532
And I am not
going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

is dead now.

Yeah, I love them.

612
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,362
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

613
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,197
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

614
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,449
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

615
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,369
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

616
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,079
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

617
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,209
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

He turned an inboard
into an outboard

619

scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

620
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,633
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

621
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,677
and actually saw
my boat being
taken apart.

Ever since then,
I have been
studying sharks

623

that I'm going to go
to the Institute tomorrow

that you still have
a shark problem here.

to tell them that?

the shark was caught.

I heard it on
the Cape station.

not the shark.

Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

631

And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

to prove today by

knew what they were missing

00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,942
that a lot
of these attacks
weren't reported?

supply is gone, right?

I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate
into him.

close enough.

No, I can't do that.

close to the cage,

1536
