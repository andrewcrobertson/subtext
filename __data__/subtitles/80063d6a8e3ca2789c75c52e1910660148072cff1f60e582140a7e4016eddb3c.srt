1
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,306
We're off the east coast of America,

2
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,571
on the ferry from Cape Cod
to Martha's Vineyard.

3
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,515
Martha's Vineyard is a tiny island

4
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,310
which achieved an international fame

5
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,153
five years ago this summer
when senator Edward Kennedy

6
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:34,041
drove his car off the bridge and
into the river at Chappaquiddick.

7
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,830
It's a tiny island, the holiday preserve

8
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,304
of the rich from New York and from Boston.

9
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,435
But this summer it's the location

10
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,476
for one of America's
biggest motion pictures,

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,636
<i>Jaws.</i>

12
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,622
Based on the novel by Peter Benchley.

13
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,540
It's a best seller in England right now.

14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,765
<i>It's the story of how a killer shark</i>

15
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,029
<i>marauds and threatens the lives</i>

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,016
<i>and the livelihood of a small
New England beach community.</i>

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,237
<i>Making a feature film on dry
land is a complex enough process.</i>

18
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,378
<i>There seem to be at least
three people for every job.</i>

19
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:07,816
<i>Making a feature film at sea
stops just short of a nightmare.</i>

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,128
<i>It's the second day of
American shooting on Jaws.</i>

21
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,229
<i>They've already been to Australia</i>

22
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,348
<i>for the underwater shots of the shark.</i>

23
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,089
Turn on the walkie-talkie please, Freddy.

24
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,191
I don't think Freddy can lift his anchor.

25
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,430
I need to talk to you, Fred.

26
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,581
Turn on the walkie-talkie.
Stand up, we're not shooting.

27
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:29,145
<i>All the usual panoply of
assistant directors with megaphones</i>

28
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,520
<i>continuity girls, barks, and chippies</i>

00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,889
<i>are obliged to float round the action.</i>

30
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,738
<i>They're still in the process of learning</i>

31
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,053
<i>which side is port and which is starboard.</i>

32
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,209
Guys we can't shoot right now, hold on.

33
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:50,117
Have that boat go out and pull the
anchor up and reset it out there, okay?

34
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:56,228
<i>Film stars, Roy Scheider
of The</i> French <i>Connection</i>

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,928
<i>and Richard Dreyfuss of American Graffiti.</i>

36
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,147
Director faced the head of the studio

37
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,104
and he said, "I can't do it in time."

38
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,288
<i>But in the age of "director as superstar"</i>

39
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,087
<i>the movie will probably be sold</i>

40
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,185
<i>on the latest American
star behind the camera,</i>

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,098
<i>Steven Spielberg.</i>

42
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,880
<i>Jaws is one of the hottest
properties in the film world this year.</i>

43
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,051
<i>The book was an instant hit in America</i>

44
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,367
<i>and the film rights
were commensurately costly.</i>

45
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:27,036
<i>To shoot for 13 weeks</i>

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,064
<i>at a budget of over a million pounds</i>

47
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,162
<i>is something of a rarity these days.</i>

48
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,862
<i>So the producers, Richard
Zanuck and David Brown</i>

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,166
<i>must have a lot of faith in their property</i>

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,583
<i>and even more in their
director Mr. Spielberg</i>

51
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,178
<i>who is only 26 years old.</i>

52
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,706
<i>In America he's already provided them</i>

53
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,562
<i>with a financial and critical success in</i>

54
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,715
<i>Sugar land Express, which he directed.</i>

55
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,432
<i>He won the award for best
screenplay at the recent Cannes festival.</i>

56
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,298
<i>Age never seems to have
daunted Mr. Spielberg.</i>

57
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,674
<i>At 20, he was directing
episodes of Columbo in Hollywood.</i>

58
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:03,023
<i>At 22, he made Duel. A story of
a motorist being chased by a lorry.</i>

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,899
<i>Which got rave reviews when
it was eventually released here.</i>

60
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,879
<i>And now Jaws.</i>

61
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:12,515
<i>It's lunchtime and the afternoon
dialog is being doctored a little.</i>

62
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,424
No, because he'll be so energetic.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,622
He'll be screaming and yelling,

64
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,574
"It's a great white!
I knew it all along."

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,262
And there's only room in there for
one quick, expository line about...

66
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,967
The mate.
...the mate.

67
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,689
The mate is dead.
Where's the body?

68
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,169
Why is the boat torn to pieces?

69
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,903
Because it's a great white shark.

70
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,389
And then all we have
to do is, uh, cut out.

71
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,076
Where are they feeding him?

72
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,293
I don't know.

73
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,666
There have been
known attacks...

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,568
There's a theory
called the bumping theory.

75
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:42,888
And it's not a theory anymore,

76
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,408
it's a proven fact that sharks will

77
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,775
nudge and bump a, uh, boat

78
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,342
or an intended victim before they attack.

79
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,261
Uh, uh, not so much in a playful manner

80
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,560
but in a way of testing its, uh, defenses.

81
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,901
To see if it's going to bump back

82
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,209
and when it doesn't,
it comes in for the kill.

83
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,689
Kosher salami!

84
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,845
<i>Spielberg himself had
the idea for</i> Sugar land <i>Express.</i>

85
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,683
<i>He found it in a newspaper.</i>

86
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,310
It had to do with, uh,
the loss of their baby

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,606
and it had to do with,
um, this media event.

88
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,606
Where it sort of
sprang up all of a sudden.

89
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,486
In Texas, there's a posse theory.

90
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,388
When a fellow officer is in trouble

91
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,617
everybody jumps into their
automobiles, all the fellow officers

92
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:32,018
they fall in behind to try to help
the guy out. The posse theory

93
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:34,648
<i>sort of is the backdrop</i>
issue <i>for Sugar land Express.</i>

94
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,591
I was able to, within
the budget of my picture,

95
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,459
afford 40 police cars

96
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,765
and in real life 90
police cars were involved

97
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,709
in a bumper-to-bumper pursuit.

98
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,878
That was strung out over,
uh, about 150 miles.

99
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,081
I had seen Goldie in Butterflies are Free.

100
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,250
And there was one scene she
had with Eileen Heckart in the car

101
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,478
that I felt was, uh, really heart turning.

102
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:01,098
Uh, I knew there was
serious actress somewhere

103
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,010
underneath that Laugh-In facade.

104
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,430
She was anxious to break out of
that mold and do something dramatic

105
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,952
and do something very serious,
and that's why she

106
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:12,051
became a part of the company
and that's why I hired her.

107
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,689
You seem to get very strong performances

108
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,759
and naturalistic performances from
your actors. What's your technique?

109
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,724
I don't know if it's so much of
a technique. I asked the actor

110
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,758
For the most part to give me too much.

111
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,559
So I can then take it down to
a level that I feel is believable.

112
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,885
I don't like casting actors who are

113
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,187
low-key people.
I like people with energy.

114
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,734
So in the initial casting,
I think that half of

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,252
what a director does
is cast his picture well.

116
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:47,661
The other half is, uh, the
control of the people within that.

117
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,358
But I think half of the secret

118
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,264
when you do see a good
picture and you like the people,

119
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,824
it's in the casting.

120
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:56,737
Uh, I like people who are
outspoken and who are very large

121
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,740
so I can bring them down to life level.

122
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,937
You know in King <i>Kong,</i> when
they run into the jungle, all talking?

123
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,947
There's 40 extras and
everybody had three things to say.

124
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,074
All through the picture,
they're ad-libbing.

125
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:10,266
"It's big! Do you see it coming
there? Look out Charlie! Fire now!

126
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,650
"Throw the grenade! Duck!"

127
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,656
Everybody had three lines to
say, they all overlapped. Terrific.

128
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,022
They haven't made a movie
like that since King Kong.

129
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,039
A lot of, "What's the
matter? "What's wrong with it?

130
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,029
"Looks like it's broken."
Right.

131
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,758
"That rear cleat's all torn up."

132
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,860
The scene they're taking
is one early in the film.

133
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,883
Where a fisherman has gone
out to try and catch the shark

134
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,981
but it's holed his boat and
it's sunk and it's killed him.

135
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:36,245
The two men, the sheriff, Brody,
and Hooper, the shark expert

136
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,031
come upon his body.

137
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,309
Roll sound.

138
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:46,583
<i>It's taken pretty
well all day to get this shot.</i>

139
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,390
Marker.

140
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,843
<i>Time and tides still refuse
to obey the director.</i>

141
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,276
<i>One of the actors has to climb</i>

142
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,849
<i>from the rescue craft
into the half-sunk</i> boat.

143
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,498
<i>An easy enough task, you might think.</i>

144
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:00,793
Whoa!

145
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:06,119
Forget it. Don't
roll. CREW MEMBER: Save it.

146
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,123
<i>Over half an hour is wasted
for dry clothes and new make-up.</i>

147
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,198
<i>By then the light is wrong and the shot</i>

148
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,233
<i>is put off till the following day.</i>

149
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,647
it seemed to me almost
fanciful in the book that a shark

150
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,464
could actually threaten
people on a large boat.

151
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:23,720
But nevertheless, this is the case, is it?

152
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,046
Sharks have... Here's
an interesting example,

153
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,296
when we were shooting
the Australian sequences

154
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,833
of the great white sharks

155
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:33,460
one of the great white sharks
jumped into the cage boat

156
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,301
and sank the cage boat and sank the cages.

157
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,592
The shark grabbed between its jaws,

158
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,571
which can close and squeeze
at 21 tons per square inch,

159
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:44,740
grabbed and twisted a cage
and then sounded with the cage.

160
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:48,091
When we recovered the cage it
was torn up, completely torn up.

161
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,118
It's not very big,
it'll never hold that boat.

162
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,120
It will hold something.

163
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,168
<i>This is my second day at sea</i>

164
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,910
<i>and I have 54 more days to go</i>

165
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,922
<i>and if I survive this, uh,
I will have learned a lot.</i>

166
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,493
<i>Right now, all I can tell you is</i>

167
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,344
<i>it's twice as slow shooting at
sea as it is shooting on land.</i>

168
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,605
<i>Because when you set
your camera for a shot</i>

169
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:12,984
<i>invariably the boat which began here</i>

170
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,391
<i>is over here when you're ready to shoot.</i>

171
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,608
<i>Uh, with tide and wind,
uh, there are a lot</i>

172
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,515
<i>of factors to take into consideration.</i>

173
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,781
<i>You really can't, uh, uh,
hold composition, hold frame.</i>

174
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,344
<i>You have to do a lot of pot-shotting</i>

175
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,948
<i>and shooting loose at open sea.</i>

176
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,901
Pull the anchor up and reset it.

177
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,308
It doesn't come easily.
I don't even think about it.

178
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,642
If I thought about
multi-million dollar pictures

179
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,594
and all the equipment and all the
responsibility I'd probably go bananas.
