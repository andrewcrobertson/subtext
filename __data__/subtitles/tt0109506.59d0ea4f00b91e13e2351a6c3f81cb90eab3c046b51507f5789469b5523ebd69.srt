1
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:18,263
No!

2
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,786
Oh!

3
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,640
<i>When someone</i>
<i>you love dies...</i>

4
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,982
<i>...you will know emptiness.</i>

5
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:16,654
<i>You will know what it is</i>
<i>to be completely</i>

6
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,157
<i>and utterly alone.</i>

7
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:24,997
<i>You will never forget...</i>

8
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,103
<i>...and you will never...</i>

9
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,040
<i>ever forgive.</i>

10
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,471
-Zadie?
<i>-Shelly.</i>

11
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,373
Did you see what I sent you?

12
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:16,408
<i>No. What is it?</i>

13
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,542
I showed the video to someone.

14
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,878
I think they found out.

15
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,314
What the fuck is going on?

16
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,715
<i>Check your texts.</i>

17
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:32,357
<i>Hey, Shelly.</i>

18
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,527
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

19
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,135
<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

20
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,240
Where did you get this?

21
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:49,808
Dom shot it.

22
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,977
Look, we can get him with this.

23
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,413
He's not invincible, Shelly.

24
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:56,348
Yes, he is.

25
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,051
I'm getting my shit
and getting the fuck out.

26
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:02,087
Come with me.

27
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,488
You and Dom.

28
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:04,956
<i>The three of us.</i>

29
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,657
Why the fuck did you do this?

30
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,260
It's not safe
for us here anymore.

31
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,430
<i>Stay there.</i>
<i>I'm coming to you.</i>

32
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:12,964
I think
they've got someone on me.

33
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:14,665
If they're following me,
they're following you.

34
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:15,901
Hello, Zadie.

35
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,569
<i>Zadie?</i>

36
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,746
Zadie?

37
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,216
Zadie?

38
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,128
<i>Hey, Shelly.</i>

39
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:46,898
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

40
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,367
There were
other options, Zadie.

41
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,969
I wish you'd talked to me first.

42
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,497
<i>Hi, you've reached Dom.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

43
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,998
Dom, it's me.

44
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,699
Zadie's lost her fucking mind.

45
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:24,069
She just sent me
some video that you shot.

46
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,304
Meet me at Zadie's.
I'm gonna check on her.

47
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,393
Whoa, whoa.
What're you doing, huh?

48
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,605
- Yeah, we have a 10-50,
female in her 20s.

49
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:34,673
Bringing her in.

50
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,837
- Say something.
- Wake up, Eric.

51
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,138
Are you gonna
stand up for yourself?

52
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,273
Look at me.

53
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,608
What're you gonna do about it?

54
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,276
You're fucking old enough
to look after yourself.

55
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:12,711
Daddy's gonna come back.

56
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,878
- We're here.
- Say something.

57
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:15,347
-Hello. Are you there?
-Say something!

58
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,382
-Nothin'? You got nothin'?
-Where's your mom right now?

59
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:19,918
Say something, son!

60
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,122
-Wake the fuck up.
-Say something, man!

61
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,658
Say fucking something!

62
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,027
<i>I know</i>
<i>this is hard, Eric.</i>

63
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,630
<i>But these exercises</i>
<i>are meant to get you past</i>

64
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,932
the destructive behaviors
that brought you here.

65
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,303
Burying it... using drugs...

66
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,305
That's the easy way out.

67
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:43,875
It's what allows you
to hide that pain away.

68
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:49,948
You, uh, going to join us?

69
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,388
You know, Hemingway wrote,
"The world breaks everyone,

70
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,323
<i>"and afterwards,</i>

71
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:01,860
<i>"many are strong</i>
<i>at the broken places.</i>

72
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:04,162
<i>"But those</i>
<i>that will not break...</i>

73
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,631
<i>"it kills."</i>

74
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,219
...group therapy after that.

75
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:30,922
No phones.
No talking after dark.

76
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,824
No fraternizing with the men.

77
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,732
Mr. Roeg.

78
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,500
Here's the young protege
from Vienna

79
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,836
I was telling Marion about.

80
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,372
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Roeg.

81
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:22,407
Please.

82
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:23,875
Sit.

83
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Now, you know
I was born in Vienna,

84
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,418
a cradle of immortal music.

85
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,187
I've lived long enough to see
some of the greats play.

86
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,390
They tell me that
you're quite dynamic yourself.

87
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,327
-May I borrow you?
-Yes.

88
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,295
Um...

89
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,030
I look forward
to hearing you play.

90
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:52,437
What is it?

91
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:54,205
We found her.

92
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,825
It's all right, Zadie.

93
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:13,925
It's all right.

94
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,060
What's done is done.

95
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,864
We're looking for your friends.

96
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,466
Have you seen Shelly?

97
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,236
No.

98
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,305
You're a good person, Zadie.

99
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,108
You wouldn't tell me
if you knew.

100
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,377
Would you?

101
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:39,651
I've killed hundreds
of innocents like you

102
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,486
in the centuries
that I've been here.

103
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,489
It never gets any easier.

104
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:53,665
I wish
the murderers and rapists,

105
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:55,967
and scum of the earth would do,

106
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:57,803
but...

107
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,005
they go to hell already,
you see.

108
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,043
Whereas people like you,

109
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:07,545
those are the souls
that he wants.

110
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,148
That's the... the deal I made.

111
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,984
You go to hell

112
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:15,320
so I don't have to.

113
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:19,859
Please...
Please let me go.

114
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,626
You can go.

115
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,329
What the fuck is going on here?

116
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,464
Get your shit together!

117
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,967
You know why we still out here?

118
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,869
It's because of your bullshit!
Huh?

119
00:13:58,222 --> 00:13:59,357
Hi.

120
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:10,869
They don't like you in here,
do they?

121
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,405
No, not really.

122
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,376
They have a thing about

123
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,711
men and women
not sitting together.

124
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:20,745
I know.

125
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:22,714
They told me.

126
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,318
I like your tattoo.

127
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:29,220
Thanks.

128
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:33,691
"Laugh now. Cry later."

129
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:36,061
It's kind of how things
have been playing out for me.

130
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,162
Well, for me,
it's more like "cry now,

131
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:40,065
"cry later."

132
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,939
Wanna hear a joke?

133
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:48,941
Uh, I don't know. Is it funny?

134
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,241
Not really.

135
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,510
Great. Go for it.

136
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,914
What kind of tea
is hard to drink?

137
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,117
I don't know.

138
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,484
Reali-ty.

139
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,254
Yeah. Wow. Well, that's...

140
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:04,923
That's something.

141
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll keep working on it.

142
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,928
Hey, time
for your group session.

143
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:11,930
Here he comes,
like fucking clockwork.

144
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:12,965
What's your name?

145
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:14,833
I'm Eric.

146
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,434
Shelly.

147
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,103
I'll see you around, Shelly.

148
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,531
If you were
forced to be silent,

149
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,801
step into the circle.

150
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:54,006
If you were made
to feel that anything wrong

151
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,306
is your fault,

152
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,375
step into the circle.

153
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,146
If you were abandoned,

154
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,082
neglected, manipulated

155
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:05,216
by those who were
meant to protect you,

156
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,652
step into the circle.

157
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:12,356
If you are ready to look forward

158
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,659
to the good things
that life will bring you,

159
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,394
step into the circle.

160
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:31,442
We're pleased you found her.

161
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,748
We're so fond of you
and your daughter.

162
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,401
You all right?

163
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,874
Oh, hey. Yeah.

164
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:04,009
Fuck, they really
trashed the place, huh?

165
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,377
Um... Yeah.

166
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,049
Is this me?

167
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:18,056
All right.

168
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,698
These songs or poems?

169
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,601
I wouldn't call them either.
It's just shit that I write.

170
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,343
You write beautifully.

171
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,345
Some of this would be great
set to music.

172
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,782
Do you play music?

173
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:45,683
Used to.

174
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,620
Well, maybe we could, um...

175
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:51,757
I don't know, maybe, um...

176
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,028
Maybe we could
play together sometime.

177
00:17:57,963 --> 00:17:59,730
Maybe.

178
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:01,599
See how we get along.

179
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,435
What are you doing in here?

180
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,537
I don't know.

181
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,042
I guess everything
just finally caught up with me.

182
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:41,505
<i>Patient 005, Shelly,</i>

183
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,276
<i>please be advised</i>
<i>you have a visitor.</i>

184
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,576
No one knows I'm here.

185
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,480
Hey. I'll go have a look, okay?

186
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,794
I mean, it just looks
like fucking lawyers to me.

187
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:03,996
Come on, take a look.

188
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,702
What the fuck?

189
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

190
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,774
-Who are they?
-They can't find me here.

191
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,009
If they find me here,
I'm fucked.

192
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:18,844
Her room is right this way.

193
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:21,679
-I've got to get out of here.
-Yeah, yeah.

194
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:22,915
-They can't find me here.
-Um...

195
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,018
-Fuck!
-Come with me.

196
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:29,487
Could you give me a location
update on Patient 005?

197
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:39,131
Okay, here it is. You see
those windows up there?

198
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,399
-Yeah.
-They'll take you out
to the yard.

199
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,401
-Okay.
-Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,701
You gotta get the tag off.

201
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,340
Can you pick up their signal?

202
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:49,808
<i>They're in the laundry room.</i>

203
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,053
What're you doing?

204
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,754
Fuck this place.

205
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:04,423
I'm rehabilitated.

206
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,196
Think we fucking did it.

207
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,838
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

208
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,373
Hey, slow, slow down.

209
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:55,506
Stop.

210
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:01,179
Who were those people?

211
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,448
A former life.

212
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:06,517
Right.

213
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:08,787
Got one of those.

214
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:14,558
I bet you do.

215
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,158
Jesus, this is crazy.

216
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:49,494
It's my friend's place.
He lives in Antigua.

217
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,096
Lets me crash here sometimes.

218
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,504
So, um...

219
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:01,739
What now?

220
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:07,412
You know,
you don't have to stay.

221
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:10,382
Maybe it's safer if you don't.

222
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:16,421
I want to stay.

223
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,225
Okay. Well, then,

224
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:22,894
we'll hide out here for a while.

225
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:26,231
And then what?

226
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,734
We'll hide somewhere else.

227
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,271
Just figure it out.

228
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:35,874
Good plan.

229
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,642
It is a good plan.

230
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:45,417
You stink, dude.

231
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,985
I'm sorry.

232
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:48,487
Do you mind if I use the shower?

233
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:50,322
Not yet.

234
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:49,781
Pretty good.

235
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,057
What's the first thing
you liked about me

236
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,292
when you saw me?

237
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,427
What's, um...

238
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,664
There's like an aura about you.

239
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:07,731
It feels powerful.

240
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,636
What's the first thing
you liked about me?

241
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:16,341
I thought that you were
quite brilliantly broken.

242
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,411
You are.

243
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:26,750
What's the, um...

244
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,520
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

245
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:37,262
I once escaped rehab with
a complete fucking degenerate.

246
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:41,666
Probably the best thing
I've ever done.

247
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,603
Mm.

248
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:46,371
Wait, I just
remembered something.

249
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,946
You have a secret stash here?

250
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:56,848
All right.

251
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,350
Hello.

252
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:00,719
Aha.

253
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:02,454
-Those are the ones?
-Mm-hmm.

254
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:05,490
Lamb of God.

255
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:14,332
Stop looking at me
or I'll poke your eye out.

256
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:16,601
-Poke out my eye?
-Mm-hmm. You don't need that.

257
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,336
You've got me now.

258
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:03,014
How many people have you loved?

259
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:07,652
Like seriously, seriously loved?

260
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:10,689
Mm.

261
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:14,426
Me neither.

262
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:22,000
Promise me something.

263
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,035
What?

264
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,105
If I'm ever hard to love,

265
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,208
try to love me harder.

266
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,705
Marion.

267
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:35,940
You have a problem.

268
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:01,366
Call for you, Mr. Roeg.

269
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,173
Yes?

270
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:10,375
They found Zadie's body.

271
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:13,011
And here I thought
there was nothing left to find.

272
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:16,648
It's a setback, but we're close
on one of the others.

273
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,717
<i>If this video gets out,</i>
<i>you know what they'll do to me.</i>

274
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:24,489
I find this tiresome, Marion.
This running around.

275
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:26,658
<i>I can feel you sweating</i>
<i>through the phone.</i>

276
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,495
<i>This ends here.</i>

277
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,714
You're infatuated.

278
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:50,916
You're obsessed, bro.

279
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:01,493
- Hi.
- Hi.

280
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,597
What are you reading?

281
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,631
Rimbaud.

282
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:09,067
Shall I read you some?

283
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,435
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

284
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:18,142
Hell yeah!

285
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:33,792
I don't want it to end.

286
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:37,662
Doesn't have to.

287
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:42,467
We could be living like this
all the fucking time.

288
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:36,021
Why'd you stop?
That was beautiful.

289
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:38,289
Mm...

290
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:40,759
Why don't you play?

291
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,963
No.

292
00:30:43,996 --> 00:30:45,998
No. We both know
you're better at this than me.

293
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,131
No. No, no, no.
Please, please.

294
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,199
Yes. Go on.

295
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,801
I can't do this right now.

296
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:25,004
Okay.

297
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,272
You all right? What's going on?

298
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:36,015
Could we just go out for a bit?

299
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:40,284
I haven't played piano
for a while.

300
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:43,421
I loved playing.

301
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:46,925
It was my whole life.

302
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:53,297
But my mom took it
and twisted it all,

303
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:55,199
pushed me
into performing at places

304
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,869
I was too young to be at.

305
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,538
Didn't want to play
for any of them.

306
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,779
I saw things.

307
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:08,981
I shouldn't have seen any of it.

308
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:12,717
I hurt people.

309
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,888
And I just...

310
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,024
I know.

311
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,193
It's okay.

312
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:24,195
It's not okay.

313
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,399
What did you do?

314
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,002
I can't tell you.

315
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:34,672
If you knew, you'd leave me.

316
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:39,410
And if you left me, I'd die.

317
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:42,114
If I left you,
I'd already be dead.

318
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:43,816
I just want to start over.

319
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:45,184
Well, why don't we?

320
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,285
Where would we go?

321
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:48,921
Fuckin' anywhere.

322
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:53,391
Anywhere is better
than this fucking place.

323
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:55,460
Anywhere?

324
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,594
Anywhere.

325
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:59,230
So you're saying
if I jumped,

326
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,600
you'd jump with me.

327
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,440
Of course I would.

328
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:16,447
Do you think angsty teens

329
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,716
would build
little shrines for us?

330
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:24,355
Yeah. They'd be lining up
to leave cigarettes and whiskey.

331
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:25,456
No.

332
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,457
No?

333
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,459
Lilies.

334
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:31,897
A sea of white lilies.

335
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:37,202
All right. Lilies, it is.

336
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:18,177
I told you, bro.

337
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,913
I fucking love this guy!

338
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:25,583
I'm gonna go
and get some water.

339
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:26,751
I can get it for you.

340
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:27,853
No, no. You stay there.

341
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:28,854
Sure.

342
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:34,760
Can I get
some water, please?

343
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:35,961
Shelly! Shelly!

344
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:37,062
-Dom... What the fuck?
-Just listen to me.

345
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:38,263
Just listen to me. Just listen.

346
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:40,398
Zadie's dead.

347
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,400
They're gonna
come for us, Shelly.

348
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,236
You need to leave town now.

349
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,469
What do you mean?

350
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:47,105
Shelly, you gotta
listen to me. It's true.

351
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,041
No, no, no.
I'm not leaving without Eric.

352
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:50,474
No.
Shelly, just listen to me.

353
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,144
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

354
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,511
Zadie's fucking dead!

355
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:57,883
-Come on, we've gotta leave.
-What's going on?

356
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,118
-We've gotta leave, Eric.
-Who the fuck was that?

357
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:01,320
I'll tell you
everything.

358
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:02,855
Let's just get back
to your place.

359
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:00,779
Shelly?

360
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:03,481
Shelly!

361
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:05,918
Get off her! Get off her!

362
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:10,355
No, don't do this.

363
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:12,858
No, please don't do this.
Get off of her!

364
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,226
Please don't do this.

365
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,421
What the fuck!

366
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:35,333
Shelly?

367
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,911
Hey.

368
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:47,446
Hey!

369
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:52,250
Hey?

370
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:12,237
Hey!

371
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,371
Where am I?

372
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,041
What is this place?

373
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:19,811
You'd think they'd come up
with something better,

374
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:20,812
wouldn't you?

375
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:23,515
But you know,

376
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:25,283
they don't expect us to linger.

377
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:32,257
How long we stay here
is entirely up to you.

378
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:37,129
<i>...we stay</i>
<i>here is entirely up to you.</i>

379
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,743
What the fuck
is happening to me?

380
00:39:52,777 --> 00:39:56,680
People once believed
when someone dies,

381
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:59,451
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

382
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:02,254
But sometimes,
something so bad happens

383
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,956
that a terrible sadness
is carried with it...

384
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:07,993
and the soul cannot rest.

385
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,264
What are you talking about?

386
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:17,335
The crow will guide you
to put the wrong things right.

387
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:21,907
What do you mean?

388
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,042
Oh, fuck this. This isn't real.

389
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:26,478
You stay the fuck away from me.

390
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:29,247
There's nothing there but here.

391
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:30,982
This is all
just a fucking nightmare.

392
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,486
This is just
a fucking nightmare.

393
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,489
Then go wake up.

394
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:46,398
<i>The sadness is killing...</i>

395
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:06,251
Shelly?

396
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,823
Shelly?

397
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,465
My turn.

398
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:56,268
Come on, Shelly.
You don't respect my art.

399
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:13,084
I'm here.

400
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:15,854
What am I looking for exactly?

401
00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:17,989
<i>- Her cell phone.</i>
- All right.

402
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:19,891
<i>We looked,</i>
<i>but we were interrupted.</i>

403
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,062
- What's on it?
<i>- You don't need to know.</i>

404
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:25,765
<i>Just find it.</i>

405
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:26,998
All right. All right.

406
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:36,975
You can come out, boy.

407
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,278
Who are you?

408
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,946
I'm a cop.

409
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,115
Here.

410
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,217
Come on.

411
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,385
- Okay.
- It's okay.

412
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:48,586
-Drop that. Drop that.
-Yeah.

413
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:50,855
Listen, I think I'm going crazy.

414
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:52,691
I don't know what's real
or not anymore.

415
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:54,092
I just think
something really bad

416
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,193
has happened with my girlfriend.

417
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:02,467
Fuck.

418
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:19,017
What the fuck?

419
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:21,453
Oh, fuck.

420
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,081
Oh, no.

421
00:45:01,052 --> 00:45:03,021
Ah, what the fuck!

422
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,389
What the fuck!

423
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:20,738
<i>The crow will guide you</i>
<i>to put the wrong things right.</i>

424
00:45:20,773 --> 00:45:23,909
<i>...wrong things right.</i>

425
00:45:23,943 --> 00:45:27,178
<i>The crow will guide you</i>

426
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:28,379

434
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:06,718
Shelly?

435
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:09,922
Shelly, baby.

436
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:11,556
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

437
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:13,224
It's okay. Don't...
Look, come down from there.

438
00:46:18,129 --> 00:46:19,798
It's okay. No, no, no, no, no!

439
00:46:20,365 --> 00:46:21,366
No!

440
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:41,519
She's dead, isn't she?

441
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:43,655
We're both dead.

442
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:45,590
I'm afraid so.

443
00:46:56,835 --> 00:46:57,903
What are you?

444
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,973
Some kind of angel?

445
00:47:03,074 --> 00:47:04,709
Do I look like an angel?

446
00:47:07,512 --> 00:47:08,781
I don't understand.

447
00:47:10,582 --> 00:47:12,250
Why am I here and she isn't?

448
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:15,955
You're not gonna
like the answer.

449
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:17,455
Just tell me.

450
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:20,158
She's on her way down.

451
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,460
To a place far worse than this.

452
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:28,466
You said I could make
the wrong things right.

453
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,069
What does that mean?

454
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,670
The one who killed you
is not supposed to be
in your world.

455
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,572
They made a deal with the devil

456
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:36,708
to gain eternal life

457
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:38,610
by sending the innocent to hell.

458
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,980
That's not balance.

459
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:43,983
Kill them.

460
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,684
Kill them all.

461
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:48,686
And you get your lives back.

462
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,321
You're saying
I can get her back?

463
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:52,057
Yeah.

464
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:57,261
Kill the ones who killed you,

465
00:47:57,295 --> 00:47:58,630
and you will get her back.

466
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:07,338
When I was up there,

467
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:09,374
I got shot.

468
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:11,509
And it taught you something,
didn't it?

469
00:48:12,276 --> 00:48:14,712
What I, um... I can heal?

470
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:16,015
I can't die?

471
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:17,950
Your body? No.

472
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:21,754
Feel pain? Yes.

473
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:24,957
If your love remains pure,
you cannot die.

474
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:27,960
How am I supposed to trust you?

475
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,162
Do you have another choice?

476
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:35,134
Are you ready?

477
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:49,848
Holy shit.

478
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:52,717
Eric, what the fuck?

479
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,186
Where have you been?
Everyone thought you was dead.

480
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:57,790
Everyone was right.

481
00:48:57,823 --> 00:48:59,624
Very funny. Just come inside.

482
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,963
I need your help, man.

483
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:07,365
What do you need?

484
00:49:10,702 --> 00:49:12,004
I need a gun.

485
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:14,006
A gun.

486
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:16,207
Eric, what...
What are you gonna do with a...

487
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:20,578
You know what, it's not my...

488
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:37,595
You're going to need these.

489
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,522
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

490
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:07,192
We need to talk.

491
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:22,607
Who was after her?

492
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,210
Why did you
come for her that day?

493
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:27,311
I saw you there
with the people who killed her.

494
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:28,981
What are you talking about?

495
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:30,414
It was an overdose.

496
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,218
How would you know?

497
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:34,318
Because I was there.

498
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:47,132
You don't understand
who you're dealing with.

499
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:57,508
I loved her.

500
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:00,279
I need to know
who these people are

501
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:02,014
because I'm going to kill them.

502
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:04,415
Every single one of them.

503
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:08,419
And I'm gonna bring her back.

504
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:10,823
She's not coming back.

505
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,425
My baby's gone.

506
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:19,664
She's gone.

507
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:22,935
And she's not coming back.

508
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,375
Please leave me.

509
00:51:31,944 --> 00:51:32,945
Just stop.

510
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:37,682
She's gone.

511
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:54,518
I fucking killed you.

512
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,089
Yeah. You did.

513
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,591
Don't move.

514
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,935
Turn it off.

515
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:14,873
I want names

516
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:16,640
of all the people
that you work for.

517
00:54:19,945 --> 00:54:21,113
Don't!

518
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:24,249
Fuck!

519
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:25,944
Get down!

520
00:55:27,813 --> 00:55:29,915
Drive!

521
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:48,632
Get in the back!

522
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:16,888
Hello, Sophia.

523
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:25,463
I'm sorry it's been so long.

524
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,300
Truly.

525
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:31,436
My condolences.

526
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:33,471
Shelly was such a special girl.

527
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:45,984
I heard you had a visitor.

528
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:48,719
What did he want?

529
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:50,922
He wants to kill you.

530
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,691
Oh. Anger.

531
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:54,492
First impulse.

532
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:55,827
It's not anger.

533
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,062
What is it, then?

534
00:58:07,305 --> 00:58:08,340
Love.

535
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:11,276
Loved her so much.

536
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:13,912
He told me he was going
to bring her back.

537
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:17,482
What was that?

538
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:20,218
He thinks if he kills you,

539
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:22,354
he'll be able to bring
her back from the dead.

540
00:58:31,162 --> 00:58:32,897
Oh, Shelly.

541
00:58:32,931 --> 00:58:37,535
So many times you needed me,
and I was never there.

542
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:42,974
Stop it.

543
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,744
She's gone.

544
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:50,215
You traded her
for a better life.

545
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:54,252
That took a lot of courage.

546
00:58:56,621 --> 00:58:59,324
What you gave me was not a gift,

547
00:58:59,357 --> 00:59:00,625
it was a curse.

548
00:59:02,127 --> 00:59:04,362
I would rather have died.

549
00:59:04,396 --> 00:59:07,132
Well, then you should
go and be with her.

550
00:59:33,158 --> 00:59:34,426
No!

551
00:59:57,749 --> 00:59:59,150
-Marion.
<i>-Yes?</i>

552
00:59:59,184 --> 01:00:01,152
He has been sent back.

553
01:00:01,186 --> 01:00:03,823
The power to escape death
exists within him.

554
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:06,291
Bring him to me.

555
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:25,845
Fuck.

556
01:00:25,877 --> 01:00:27,512
I'm just... Don't hurt me, man.

557
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:28,747
-Please.
-Why the fuck not?

558
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:31,249
-I didn't do anything, man.
-I saw you.

559
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:32,517
-What?
-In the club.

560
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,685
You brought them to us.

561
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,353
No, no. I was just
trying to get her out.

562
01:00:35,387 --> 01:00:36,955
I was just trying
to help her get away, man.

563
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:38,758
Get away from what?

564
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:41,459
Get away from what? Huh?

565
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:44,162
That woman who was after her,
who is she?

566
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:45,463
Who, Marion?

567
01:00:45,497 --> 01:00:47,031
No. No. She's just part of it.

568
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:48,600
She just works for him.

569
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,269
Who are you talking about? Who?

570
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:55,940
His name is Vincent Roeg, man.

571
01:00:55,974 --> 01:00:58,109
He used to have us
over to party.

572
01:00:58,143 --> 01:00:59,911
I thought it was just
an easy place to score.

573
01:01:00,745 --> 01:01:02,180
That shit got so dark.

574
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:06,017
He made it so dark.

575
01:01:09,755 --> 01:01:11,423
He's got this voice, man.

576
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:14,926
Voice.

577
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:19,497
He... burrows inside you.

578
01:01:19,531 --> 01:01:21,867
Finds the darkest parts
of your soul

579
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:24,035
and gives them a voice.

580
01:01:24,068 --> 01:01:27,773
And it just gets
louder and louder

581
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:31,309
until you do something evil.

582
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,311
I still hear it.

583
01:01:40,552 --> 01:01:42,020
I never would have
made that fucking video

584
01:01:42,053 --> 01:01:43,555
if I'd known
what would have happened, man.

585
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:44,924
What video?

586
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:46,859
Where is it?

587
01:01:46,892 --> 01:01:48,560
Shelly had it on her phone.

588
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,196
Said she had it hidden.

589
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:53,998
She didn't want
anyone to see it.

590
01:01:54,032 --> 01:01:56,401
I tried to warn her,
but she wouldn't leave
without you.

591
01:01:58,904 --> 01:02:01,105
I knew Shelly a long time.

592
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:02,740
When I saw the way
she looked at you,

593
01:02:04,108 --> 01:02:05,343
something was different.

594
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,581
I tried to do
something right, man.

595
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:11,583
I just fucked it up.

596
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:15,153
I'm sorry.

597
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,491
They won't be far behind me.

598
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:24,864
You do what we couldn't do.
Get the fuck out.

599
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:29,400
Thanks, man.

600
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:36,167
<i>How many people</i>
<i>have you loved?</i>

601
01:03:39,137 --> 01:03:42,540
<i>Like seriously,</i>
<i>seriously loved?</i>

602
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:57,116
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

603
01:04:57,148 --> 01:04:58,984
<i>I will come back.</i>

604
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,237
<i>What the fuck!</i>

605
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,638
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

606
01:05:20,672 --> 01:05:22,074
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>there's blood everywhere.</i>

607
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:24,275
<i>What the fuck, Shelly? Help me!</i>

608
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:27,545
<i>She's dying.</i>

609
01:05:27,578 --> 01:05:28,881
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

610
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:30,682
Oh...

611
01:05:32,151 --> 01:05:33,152
Oh...

612
01:05:34,953 --> 01:05:36,621
Oh...

613
01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:05,643
I found
what they killed her for.

614
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:08,646
Shelly, she did something
really bad.

615
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,581
And now I can't get it
out of my head.

616
01:07:12,517 --> 01:07:14,186
I don't think I can do this.

617
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:15,854
I don't think
I can do this, man.

618
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:16,989
Eric, you just need
to sit down, bro.

619
01:07:17,022 --> 01:07:18,257
-Fuck.
-Eric, sit down, please.

620
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:20,424
Please. Eric, come on.
Come on. Just sit down.

621
01:07:24,362 --> 01:07:25,596
What's going on?

622
01:07:28,366 --> 01:07:29,868
Holy shit.

623
01:07:29,902 --> 01:07:32,171
Why didn't she just
fucking tell me?

624
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:33,939
She should have
just fucking told me.

625
01:07:33,972 --> 01:07:36,775
Okay, but, if she did tell you,

626
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:38,911
could you still love her?

627
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,151
Eric?

628
01:07:46,885 --> 01:07:48,319
What the fuck?

629
01:07:53,624 --> 01:07:54,860
You need to come with us.

630
01:08:36,134 --> 01:08:37,568
Fuck.

631
01:09:03,694 --> 01:09:05,197
What the fuck have you done?

632
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,238
Why am I back here?

633
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,607
You couldn't see it through.

634
01:09:50,242 --> 01:09:52,210
Hey. Why...

635
01:09:54,545 --> 01:09:56,315
Why did I stop healing?

636
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:59,217
I said your love
needed to remain pure.

637
01:10:00,451 --> 01:10:02,753
The enemy of love is not hate.

638
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:03,922
It's doubt.

639
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:05,489
I never doubted her.

640
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:08,794
Didn't you?

641
01:10:17,702 --> 01:10:20,372
You had a chance
and you wasted it.

642
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:23,541
You were given
the power of a god.

643
01:10:23,574 --> 01:10:25,777
In the end, you were just a boy.

644
01:10:27,312 --> 01:10:30,581
At least your soul can move on.

645
01:10:30,614 --> 01:10:33,751
Her soul is gone forever
into the darkness.

646
01:10:33,785 --> 01:10:36,922
For you, eternity is easy.

647
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,357
You just have to breathe.

648
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:42,361
And let her go.

649
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,029
I can't.

650
01:10:46,898 --> 01:10:48,133
I'm sorry.

651
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:03,281
Mine for hers.

652
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:12,656
My soul for hers.

653
01:11:19,164 --> 01:11:21,732
Her soul is damned.

654
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:23,969
The place she's going,
you can't imagine it.

655
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:25,536
It's not about me.

656
01:11:30,008 --> 01:11:31,810
Even if you save her,

657
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:33,677
you will never
be with her again.

658
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:37,482
I know.

659
01:11:41,685 --> 01:11:43,088
Now let me do this.

660
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:05,576
It's not up to me.

661
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:20,425
There is no going back
from this.

662
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:23,788
With this black blood,
you will move between worlds,

663
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:25,824
just like them.

664
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:29,528
Go put the wrong things right.

665
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,841
Hold this.

666
01:15:13,398 --> 01:15:14,532
Hmm.

667
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:10,682
Marion.

668
01:17:14,018 --> 01:17:15,053
Vincent.

669
01:17:15,086 --> 01:17:16,254
<i>Is it true?</i>

670
01:17:17,155 --> 01:17:18,423
I'm afraid so.

671
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:19,491
He was killed.

672
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:21,226
<i>Are you sure?</i>

673
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,328
I'm sorry.

674
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:28,768
Damn.

675
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:02,033
<i>Please can we ask you</i>

676
01:18:02,066 --> 01:18:04,068
<i>to make your way</i>
<i>to your seats. Thank you.</i>

677
01:18:04,736 --> 01:18:06,171
Stefan?

678
01:18:06,204 --> 01:18:07,773
Front entrance secure.

679
01:19:59,952 --> 01:20:02,086
Hey!

680
01:20:27,078 --> 01:20:28,212
<i>We have a situation.</i>

681
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:30,950
He's here.

682
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:49,181
He's here.

683
01:23:49,214 --> 01:23:51,216
<i>He's killing all of our people.</i>

684
01:23:54,853 --> 01:23:56,687
I'm so grateful to you, Marion.

685
01:23:56,721 --> 01:23:57,890
For what? Wh...

686
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,658
<i>For getting us this far.</i>

687
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:05,764
That's all you're going to say?

688
01:24:05,798 --> 01:24:08,399
We're on this ride
together, Marion.

689
01:24:08,432 --> 01:24:09,968
You just happen
to be in the front.

690
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:15,733
Where is he?

691
01:25:16,335 --> 01:25:17,501
He's not in here.

692
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:21,974
Where is he?

693
01:25:22,007 --> 01:25:23,041
He's...

694
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:28,981
His country estate.

695
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:30,849
Hillhurst Manor.

696
01:25:43,896 --> 01:25:45,396
You fucking killed us.

697
01:25:46,164 --> 01:25:47,232
For what?

698
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:48,934
Was it worth it?

699
01:26:01,346 --> 01:26:03,382
It starts off so small.

700
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:07,352
It's all kept from you.

701
01:26:07,386 --> 01:26:10,521
You know what's being done,
but you're not part of it.

702
01:26:10,554 --> 01:26:12,324
And then, just like that,

703
01:26:12,357 --> 01:26:13,358
you are.

704
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:16,594
You're swallowed up.

705
01:26:17,763 --> 01:26:19,031
And the only direction

706
01:26:19,064 --> 01:26:20,265
you can go is down.

707
01:26:26,338 --> 01:26:28,307
You have the same look as him.

708
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,075
What look is that?

709
01:26:30,108 --> 01:26:33,378
The look of someone who hates
everything inside of him.

710
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:38,016
He just hides it
better than you.

711
01:27:58,529 --> 01:27:59,630
<i>Lilies.</i>

712
01:27:59,663 --> 01:28:01,466
<i>A sea of white lilies.</i>

713
01:31:15,327 --> 01:31:16,761
Face me.

714
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,708
Who are you?

715
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,176
Just an old man...

716
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:35,413
but I'm real.

717
01:31:44,389 --> 01:31:45,724
See?

718
01:31:45,757 --> 01:31:47,292
I'm flesh and blood.

719
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:49,628
Not like you.

720
01:31:55,033 --> 01:31:56,801
I heard you think
you can bring her back.

721
01:31:57,902 --> 01:31:59,237
You can't.

722
01:32:00,772 --> 01:32:04,609
Where she is,
you don't come back from that.

723
01:32:08,613 --> 01:32:11,483
That video, did you see it?

724
01:32:13,285 --> 01:32:15,754
I know, I'm sorry.

725
01:32:15,787 --> 01:32:17,322
She's not what
you thought she was.

726
01:32:17,355 --> 01:32:18,890
No, it wasn't her.

727
01:32:21,393 --> 01:32:22,494
It was you.

728
01:32:24,396 --> 01:32:25,530
You corrupt people.

729
01:32:25,563 --> 01:32:27,732
You can't corrupt
what's not already there.

730
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:30,468
A pearl. It's a seed.

731
01:32:31,469 --> 01:32:32,470
Hmm.

732
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:37,509
Look at yourself.

733
01:32:41,179 --> 01:32:42,514
Look at what you've become.

734
01:32:44,716 --> 01:32:46,017
Those eyes.

735
01:32:49,254 --> 01:32:50,355
That face.

736
01:32:53,558 --> 01:32:55,761
Why would she want
to be with you?

737
01:32:55,795 --> 01:32:59,531
You have no love left.
Only hate.

738
01:33:01,299 --> 01:33:02,500
You fool.

739
01:33:15,013 --> 01:33:16,448
You don't feel anything.

740
01:33:17,817 --> 01:33:19,651
Do you?
You don't feel any of it.

741
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,621
I feel it all.

742
01:33:49,013 --> 01:33:50,115
<i>Say something!</i>

743
01:33:50,148 --> 01:33:51,649
-Wake the fuck up.
-Say something, man!

744
01:33:56,454 --> 01:33:58,156
<i>You have no love left.</i>

745
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:59,624
<i>Only hate.</i>

746
01:34:04,462 --> 01:34:06,197
<i>She's not what</i>
<i>you thought she was.</i>

747
01:34:20,478 --> 01:34:22,947
<i>When I'm hard to love,</i>
<i>love me harder.</i>

748
01:34:22,981 --> 01:34:24,349
<i>Love me harder.</i>

749
01:34:26,084 --> 01:34:28,253
<i>How many people have you loved?</i>

750
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,724
<i>Like seriously,</i>
<i>seriously loved?</i>

751
01:34:33,992 --> 01:34:35,560
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

752
01:34:40,498 --> 01:34:41,933
<i>I don't want it to end.</i>

753
01:35:22,474 --> 01:35:23,641
What is this place?

754
01:35:25,076 --> 01:35:28,213
This is the place
where it all ends.

755
01:35:28,246 --> 01:35:30,482
Where you pay
for what you did to her...

756
01:35:32,584 --> 01:35:33,886
to all of them.

757
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:43,161
Are you scared?

758
01:35:44,496 --> 01:35:45,831
You should be.

759
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:51,236
Oh, you stupid boy.

760
01:35:51,269 --> 01:35:52,670
Is this what you want?

761
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:54,706
You think she's worth it?

762
01:35:55,841 --> 01:35:57,041
All this?

763
01:35:57,943 --> 01:35:59,177
Eternal hell?

764
01:36:00,578 --> 01:36:01,613
For what?

765
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:04,783
For some fucking whore?

766
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:35,313
You have no idea
what hell awaits you.

767
01:36:35,346 --> 01:36:37,248
Yeah, I do.

768
01:37:55,193 --> 01:37:56,728
Eric.

769
01:37:56,762 --> 01:37:58,998
I had this terrible dream.

770
01:37:59,597 --> 01:38:01,100
I was falling.

771
01:38:02,367 --> 01:38:03,769
I thought I'd lost you.

772
01:38:04,435 --> 01:38:06,105
It's okay, baby.

773
01:38:06,972 --> 01:38:08,139
It's over.

774
01:38:09,273 --> 01:38:10,642
It's all over.

775
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,247
You get to go back.

776
01:38:26,759 --> 01:38:27,793
Eric...

777
01:38:30,095 --> 01:38:31,130
what have you done?

778
01:38:33,731 --> 01:38:35,533
I can't come with you.

779
01:38:38,003 --> 01:38:39,038
What?

780
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,141
This was the only way.

781
01:38:44,475 --> 01:38:45,476
No.

782
01:38:46,344 --> 01:38:48,479
I'm going with you.

783
01:38:48,513 --> 01:38:51,315
This isn't the way
it was supposed to end.

784
01:38:51,349 --> 01:38:52,818
I would do it again.

785
01:38:54,452 --> 01:38:55,720
All of it.

786
01:38:55,753 --> 01:38:56,789
Every moment.

787
01:39:01,592 --> 01:39:02,694
I love you.

788
01:39:03,428 --> 01:39:04,562
Forever.

789
01:39:18,276 --> 01:39:19,610
Do you hear me?

790
01:39:19,644 --> 01:39:20,678
Yes.

791
01:39:20,712 --> 01:39:21,980
It's okay.

792
01:39:31,824 --> 01:39:33,357
He fought hard for you.

793
01:40:02,921 --> 01:40:04,890
<i>Our love</i>

794
01:40:04,923 --> 01:40:07,226
<i>will live on</i>
<i>in everything she does.</i>

795
01:40:14,432 --> 01:40:16,400
<i>Someday, I know...</i>

796
01:40:18,237 --> 01:40:20,404
<i>our souls</i>
<i>will find each other again.</i>

797
01:40:23,674 --> 01:40:26,812
<i>Till then,</i>
<i>I will have just the memory.</i>

798
01:40:32,885 --> 01:40:36,088
<i>That perfect sensation</i>
<i>of loving her.</i>

799
01:40:41,059 --> 01:40:42,393
<i>And that's enough.</i>

800
01:40:47,065 --> 01:40:48,399
<i>Almost enough.</i>
