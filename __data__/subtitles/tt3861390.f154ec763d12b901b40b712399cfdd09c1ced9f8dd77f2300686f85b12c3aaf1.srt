1
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,329
Come on, time to go.

2
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,798
We haven't got all day.

3
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,294
Get that monkey on the train.

4
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,924
The Medici Brothers' circus is taking off!

5
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,254
Breathing normal...

6
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,021
heart rate normal.

7
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,719
You're cleared to perform.

8
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,827
Milly! Another train!

9
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,270
Niños, wait!
We are coming, too!

10
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,793
Joplin!

11
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,503
Joplin, Missouri!

12
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,763
Hey, sweetheart!
Daddy!

13
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,064
I meant to tell ya.

14
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,615
You know, in the letter I sent?

15
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm so sorry,

16
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,812
that I wasn't here.

17
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,680
Well, come here now.

18
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,170
Still me.

19
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,525
And you...

20
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,337
you're just as pretty as your momma.

21
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,233
We missed you, Dad.

22
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:44,908
I missed you, too.

23
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,455
Ivan and Catherine, thank you both for...

24
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,957
looking out for them.

25
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,742
Captain Farrier, of course.

26
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,298
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

27
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,720
It's just Holt.

28
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,297
Don't you worry.

29
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,435
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

30
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,808
Come on! Come on!
Home sweet home.

31
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,211
Hey! Holt!

32
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,318
Hey, Puck.

33
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,047
Hey, Thomas.
Milly, come on!

34
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,048
Hi, Holt.

35
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,534
Hey, Miss Atlantis.

36
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,020
Pramesh!

37
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:24,196
The very best journey, dear friend.

38
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,940
The road that leads home.

39
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,468
Welcome home.

40
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,287
No hugs.

41
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,388
No hugs.

42
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,008
Pramesh, I missed you too.

43
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,720
What's going on?

44
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,412
The camp's half the size it used to be.

45
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,247
Hard times, my friend.

46
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,044
For everyone.

47
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,198
Attention everybody!

48
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,686
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

49
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,534
Because keep the cages locked,

50
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,466
is the most important rule of all!

51
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,772
When I catch that fugitive scalawag

52
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,298
who interrupted my dream.

53
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,446
Rongo!

54
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,833
Where is Rongo?

55
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:09,705
Who's heading camp management?

56
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,294
I'm the strongman.

57
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,687
Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats!

58
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,584
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

59
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,207
Which means, animal whereabouts!

60
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:21,609
Now go find that monkey!

61
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,865
I'll have a look around.

62
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,001
Alright, alright, everybody.
Back to work.

63
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,913
Holt!

64
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,292
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

65
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,097
Natalya, Vincenzo...

66
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,637
the Vanderjees,

67
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,028
and then...

68
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,298
your wife.

69
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,754
Poor Annie.

70
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,126
How she fought.

71
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,012
She was the best of us.

72
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,215
I know it.

73
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,772
So...

74
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,484
you know for her let's...

75
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,103
let's have our best season yet!

76
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,922
Now where's my horses?

77
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,060
Funny story about that.

78
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:27,571
Funny how?

79
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,672
He sold them.

80
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,320
But our act is the soul of this show!

81
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,537
And first we lost you,

82
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,295
and then Annie, to ride them!

83
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,823
If only Milly would have learned the trade.

84
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,836
I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus.

85
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,516
Show-off?

86
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:42,043
You see?

87
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,320
I wanna make scientific discoveries.

88
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,376
I wanna be noticed for my mind.

89
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,647
Ok.

90
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,659
Then learn clairvoyance.

91
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,503
Telepathy! Something!

92
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,955
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

93
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,123
Child does handstand.

94
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,857
We'll be broke by July.

95
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,059
Hang on now.

96
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,855
Without horses, what the hell's my act?

97
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,516
The crowds come to see me!

98
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,362
Max, please.

99
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,113
I need to work.

100
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,316
Good news.

101
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,410
One job, I have.

102
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,353
Ok, then.
Give me a showstopper.

103
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,281
You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee?

104
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,975
He finally ran off with the bearded lady.

105
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,240
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

106
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,314
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

107
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,456
No, you can't.
You're not serious.

108
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,604
I am on occasion.

109
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,176
This is a big job and you know it.

110
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,782
No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of...

111
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,806
Dad.

112
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,655
So you sold my horses,

113
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:42,263
and kept your elephants.
Your scrawny...

114
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,747
mangy, cut-rate elephants.

115
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,249
They're important.

116
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,528
Especially this season.

117
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:48,961
Why's that?

118
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,079
I know it goes against my nature...

119
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,956
but for once, I made an investment.

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,095
Bellissima! There she is.

121
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,744
Our brand-new Asian female.

122
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,702
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

123
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,707
I had to get him
way down on the price.

124
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,413
But I swear to you, Holt,

125
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,545
I saw something special in her eyes.

126
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,053
This is your investment?

127
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,769
An old, sick elephant.

128
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,298
Oh, no.

129
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,373
She's not sick.

130
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,441
Any day now...

131
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,969
she's having a baby.

132
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,045
Dad, watch! Dad!

133
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:30,201
I'm getting better!

134
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:31,911
Hang on now, this is our tent?

135
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,405
What happened to our things?

136
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,891
We had nice furniture, we...

137
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,334
we had rooms.

138
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,070
Max, what didn't you sell?

139
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,696
You son of a gun.

140
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,083
Dad, look!

141
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,854
Toys?

142
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,751
They're not toys.

143
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,328
They're for my science experiments.

144
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,005
Well, we're a circus darling, a circus.

145
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,023
You know we need to be...

146
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:54,675
practical if we want to survive.

147
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,843
You couldn't just...

148
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,978
take up one act?

149
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,580
Tumbling or tightrope.

150
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,632
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

151
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,601
Maybe I'm just not you and Mom.

152
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,287
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

153
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,523
Mom did.

154
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,467
Yeah well, I make them now so just...

155
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,388
just, just...

156
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,333
Go to your room!

157
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,705
This is my room.

158
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,546
This is all our rooms.

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
See this?

160
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,871
You know what this is?

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,418
It's your inheritance.

162
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,832
Dad!

163
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,533
Don't worry,

164
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,167
he's not going anywhere.

165
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,094
He's stuck here.

166
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,695
Like you and me.

167
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
Come on, come on, you're missing it!

168
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,108
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

169
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,935
A new season!

170
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,292
Let me in, you little hairball!

171
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,430
Hey!

172
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,852
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

173
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,245
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

174
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,510
The elephants need us!

175
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,765
Good God, son,

176
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,291
you're gonna make me miss the war.

177
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,733
Give me that.
Go on, lead the way.

178
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,027
Move it!

179
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,026
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

180
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,003
Don't make me have to incentivize.

181
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,493
Get her out of there, boys.

182
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,487
Easy, Rufus.

183
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,914
That's a lady in there.

184
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:33,142
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
riding in to the rescue.

185
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,335
But he just aingt
on the marquee no more.

186
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,003
Time to see what he's been missing.

187
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,826
Do you ever get that feeling?

188
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,259
Like there is something you're missing?

189
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,168
Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist.

190
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,545
Weak ticker. Doc's advice.

191
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,227
Dad? Something's wrong.

192
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,530
She doesn't wanna leave.

193
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,315
Come on!

194
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,598
Let's get her outta there!

195
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,691
What are you doing?
Come on!

196
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,277
Leave her alone!

197
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,053
Stop hurting her, please!
Leave her alone!

198
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,089
Dad, look.

199
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,239
What now?

200
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,795
Move her!

201
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,985
We got a baby in here.

202
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,731
She had a baby!

203
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,732
Baby!

204
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,932
Notify the press!

205
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,454
The Medici Brothers proudly present,

206
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,359
America's newest precious
bundle of joy!

207
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,569
Look at that.

208
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,119
It's ok now.

209
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,925
Don't be scared.

210
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,411
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

211
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,318
Baby! A baby!

212
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,703
We got a baby!

213
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,668
What is that?

214
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,170
Baby Jumbo.

215
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,170
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

216
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,467
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

217
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,553
Rongo!

218
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,266
We've been swindled!

219
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,891
Gone and bought yourself a baby monster.

220
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,512
Think he can hear me?

221
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,923
Rongo! Telegram to Brugelbecker.

222
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,109
We have been bilked with damaged goods.

223
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,502
This is an aberration, travestation,

224
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,126
and I demand my money back.

225
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,924
But whatever you do,
do not call the papers.

226
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,568
We are not advertising this baby.

227
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,465
Tell me you didn't do it.

228
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,183
You did it?

229
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,268
Never do anything I tell you,

230
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,311
without checking with me first!

231
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:45,875
Why me?

232
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,176
Why me?

233
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,817
A face only a mother could love.

234
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,007
Sir?

235
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,400
Many of us find you handsome.

236
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,081
I was talking about the elephant!

237
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,465
Look,

238
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,560
she's drawing him a bath.

239
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,250
Need a vet to come to look at him, Max.

240
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,906
No, no witnesses!

241
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,837
We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks.

242
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,635
We promised them a beautiful baby!

243
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,967
You have until tomorrow night, to fix that!

244
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,642
Me?
Yes, you!

245
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:20,937
This is my problem?
Yes!

246
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,224
You tend the elephants.

247
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,047
Make those ears disappear!

248
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,682
Don't look at me.

249
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,547
Look at him,

250
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:44,853
those giant ears weigh him down.

251
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,389
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

252
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,216
Welcome to the circus.

253
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,942
We're all family here.

254
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,424
No matter how small.

255
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,582
Aren't elephants afraid of mice?

256
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,935
Says who?

257
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,567
That's why we experiment.

258
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,381
Someone needs to keep him company.

259
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,846
When he's not with his momma.

260
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,237
Look. Give him one.

261
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,511
If he can lift his ears out of the way.

262
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,983
No. You have to blow your ears
out of the way, like this.

263
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,668
Good luck with that.

264
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,545
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

265
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,797
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

266
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,968
Do what I do.

267
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,055
Blow.

268
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,127
No, not the feather.

269
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:47,919
Your ears. Blow!

270
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,666
He thinks it's a game.

271
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,061
Oh, Max, come here.
What?

272
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,155
Watch this.

273
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,071
I ride out, I do some jumps,

274
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:58,392
then all of a sudden...

275
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,086
Stampede!

276
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:01,888
Send them!

277
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,365
Get out of the way, Max!

278
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,932
I'm still... still working out the timing.

279
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,039
Let me have a turn.

280
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,531
Meanwhile, for when you
lead out the elephants...

281
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,967
I had the costume departments
make you up a little something.

282
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,791
Ok.

283
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,825
What in gosh...

284
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,677
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

285
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,529
A lot of kids come to the show.

286
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:46,235
You don't want me to scare anyone,
I get it.

287
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,225
Dad, Dad!

288
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,842
It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.

289
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:50,802
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

290
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,187
Guys, I said leave him be.

291
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,725
But he was this far off the ground!

292
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,716
Yeah, I bet he was.

293
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,457
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

294
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,289
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

295
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:59,995
Just leave the poor guy alone.

296
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,957
First rule of science,

297
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,415
you have to have interest.

298
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,672
Otherwise, you don't deserve to know.

299
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,009
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

300
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,853
Annie knew how to talk to them.

301
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,701
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

302
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,155
<i>boys and girls, step right up.</i>

303
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,329
<i>Hurry, hurry.</i>

304
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:28,856
<i>Come see the circus today.</i>

305
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,748
To be or not to be...

306
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,743
that is the question.

307
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,761
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

308
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,807
to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous...

309
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,945
That aingt no snake.

310
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,242
Heck, I could do it.

311
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,244
As you wish.

312
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,737
Get out of here!

313
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,795
Rongo, let's go!

314
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,526
Hey, get away from the baby elephant!

315
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,698
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

316
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,929
Ladies and gentlemen...

317
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,202
I am your Master of Ceremonies,

318
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,156
Maximilian Medici.

319
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,543
And now, I give to you...

320
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,995
the Medici Brothers' circus.

321
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,431
Ok.

322
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,386
Ok, ok, no one's gonna hurt him.

323
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,584
Ok, little guy, let's put on a show.

324
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,755
Hey, aingt that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

325
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,751
Hey! Aingt you Holt Farrier?

326
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,379
Nah, he died in the war.
So sad.

327
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:03,629
What's he doing?

328
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,983
He's reaching for the feathers.

329
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,568
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

330
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,136
What'd you do to that thing?

331
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,444
That aingt a real elephant.

332
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,861
Those ears are fake!

333
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:45,534
Look!

334
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:46,842
Look at the sign!

335
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,373
Dumbo!

336
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,583
Calm down, now.

337
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:04,835
He's a fake!

338
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,166
Yeah, he's a fake!

339
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,296
Shut up!

340
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,228
You're scaring the elephants!

341
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,677
Take it easy now. Calm down.

342
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,744
Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

343
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,128
Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

344
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:19,775
I said, sit down!

345
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,186
It's ok, little fella.

346
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,977
Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake!

347
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,822
Rongo!

348
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:28,563
Music!

349
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,594
Happiness, joy!

350
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,680
Hear them making
fun of your ugly baby?

351
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,520
Who's gonna help him now?

352
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,297
Holt, get those ears off the stage!

353
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,560
Ok, alright.

354
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,374
Ok, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

355
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:02,815
Just calm down.

356
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,993
Ok. Attagirl.

357
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,788
We're here to protect him.

358
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:08,919
Same as you.

359
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,723
Attagirl.

360
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,175
Nice and easy.

361
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,213
It's ok, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

362
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:22,534
Rufus, no!

363
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,042
Rufus, stop!
Mad elephant!

364
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,131
Get back!

365
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,179
Max, get the kids out of here!

366
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,006
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

367
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,412
Careful, careful.

368
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,734
Kids?

369
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,276
Go, go, go!

370
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,589
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

371
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,693
Come on. This way, come on.

372
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,809
How do you like your job now, cowboy?

373
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,850
Milly, Joe!

374
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:04,497
Come on!

375
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,754
Let's go!
Come on!

376
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,830
And I wanna just emphasize,

377
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,202
we did everything right.

378
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,310
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

379
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,619
It just collapsed.

380
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,875
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

381
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,559
Brugelbecker, I have a man dead,

382
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:00,669
do you understand?

383
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:02,469
This is what they're reading

384
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,922
from the Great Lakes to the Gulf!

385
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,008
You have a moral responsibility

386
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,887
to buy your killer elephant back.

387
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,389
What about the baby?

388
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,907
Well, at least he got a few laughs.

389
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,811
I'll put him in the clown act,

390
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,810
see if I can salvage something.

391
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,905
I'll buy her back half price.

392
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,910
You will buy her back full price.

393
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,411
Quarter price.

394
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,829
Half price it is!

395
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,428
Up!

396
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,824
What's happening?

397
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:42,005
Where are they taking her?
Away. Back to your tent now.

398
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:43,457
But she's his mom!

399
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:45,213
Dad, please. Stop them.

400
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,148
Please!

401
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,553
Do something.

402
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,226
Mom would have done something.

403
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,645
Momma's not here.

404
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,874
Ok, little fella.
Ok. Come on.

405
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,533
I know, I do.

406
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,448
Beautiful creature,

407
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,805
we'll take care of your son.

408
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,038
Darling, it's late.

409
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,577
Go on now.

410
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:29,838
I know.

411
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:31,822
I can't sleep either.

412
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,416
My momma told me,

413
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:38,078
there'd be times when my life
seemed locked behind a door.

414
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,500
So...

415
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:42,596
she gave me this key that...

416
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,143
her momma gave her.

417
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,918
And said...

418
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,743
whenever I have that feeling,

419
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,025
imagine that door,

420
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,734
and just turn the key.

421
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,271
So, I keep trying.

422
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,297
Not supposed to be in here alone.

423
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,709
I'm not. You're here.

424
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,103
What's that?

425
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:13,255
I just thought he might be hungry.

426
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,240
He's sad.

427
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,892
You don't eat when you're sad.

428
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,189
The mermaid does.

429
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,335
Come on.

430
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,381
Have one, Dumbo.

431
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,810
We're calling him Dumbo now?

432
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,654
If we call him Jumbo Junior,

433
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,597
it might make him miss his mom.

434
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,825
Here you go...

435
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,626
Dumbo.

436
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,706
Come on,

437
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,573
and flap those ears again.

438
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,280
To show us we didn't imagine it.

439
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,775
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

440
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:56,665
She was just protecting you.

441
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,588
And we think your ears are great.

442
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,026
Maybe he wants to be alone.

443
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,074
Like Dad.

444
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,644
Nobody wants to be alone.

445
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,414
Well...

446
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,666
if you change your mind...

447
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,445
Night-night, Dumbo.

448
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,541
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

449
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,033
It's the feathers!

450
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,008
Dumbo!

451
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,556
Dumbo,

452
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:39,237
you gotta do this in the show.

453
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,327
What do you mean?

454
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,889
Because if the circus sells more tickets

455
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,120
and Medici makes more money...

456
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,392
then we can get him to use some

457
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,716
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

458
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,633
Yeah!

459
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,332
We can get her back, Dumbo.

460
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,393
You can.

461
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,074
Just show them all what you can do.

462
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,575
Come on. We gotta tell Dad.

463
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,808
No. He'll just tell us to be practical.

464
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,168
Shows got canceled for a week, right?

465
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,299
We can research and study and test.

466
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,109
You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo.

467
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,564
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

468
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,073
Fire!

469
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,408
So low.

470
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,289
An all-time low.

471
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,315
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

472
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,463
Ok, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

473
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,557
Except for lights, music, fire and crowds.

474
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,133
You can do it.
Come on, Dumbo.

475
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,432
You can do it, Dumbo!

476
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,763
Show them all like you showed us!

477
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,269
Come! Come! Come!
Attaboy, come on.

478
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,897
Keep coming. Come on.

479
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,784
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

480
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,081
Hey! Hey!

481
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,064
They love it! They love it!

482
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,451
Alright, Dumbo.

483
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,779
You put out the fire.

484
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,506
He won't fly. He's scared.

485
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,262
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

486
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,568
Go on, Dumbo!

487
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,825
Attaboy.

488
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,259
Yeah!

489
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,758
Rule Number One.

490
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:40,555
Always have a big finish!

491
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,367
Ok, guys.
Bring him down.

492
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,812
Yeah!

493
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,114
Holt!

494
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,317
Look, Max!
What? What?

495
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,198
He's trapped up there.
Put the fire out!

496
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,032
Dumbo! Fly!

497
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,912
He won't fly without a feather!

498
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,973
Put the fire out!

499
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,283
Put it out!

500
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,053
Joe!
Stop!

501
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,802
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

502
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:34,937
Milly!

503
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,866
Here, Dumbo!

504
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:54,930
Come on.

505
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,067
Show them.

506
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,551
Come on, Dumbo.

507
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,774
Fly, Dumbo. Fly.

508
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,049
Yeah!

509
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,007
You knew he could do this?

510
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,814
You should talk to your kids more.

511
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,224
Sotheby...

512
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:39,911
cancel my dinner with the president.

513
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,229
We've got business with an elephant.

514
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,159
Friends,

515
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,688
the next available shows are in Arkansas!

516
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,073
<i>Happy clowns!</i>

517
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,461
Rongo the Strong!
Boss.

518
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,382
Hello, Jo!

519
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,836
The Medici Brothers' circus.

520
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,843
Where true love
and mystery abound.

521
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:12,147
Now where's my star?

522
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:15,020
Dumbo!

523
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,406
How's your bath?

524
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,431
Too warm? Too cold?

525
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,682
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

526
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:23,251
In our country,

527
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:26,490
legend tells us the gods
can take animal forms.

528
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,601
Champagne for Dumbo!

529
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,078
No booze near the baby!

530
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,951
Sorry, Dumbo.

531
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,549
It's not your momma.

532
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:58,026
Take Dumbo back inside.

533
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,752
Ladies and gentlemen, please make way
for the emperor of enchantment.

534
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,278
For the architect of dreams.

535
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,347
For the Columbus of Coney Island.

536
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,033
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

537
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,495
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

538
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,491
Colette Marchant,

539
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:28,752
the Queen of the Heavens!

540
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,428
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

541
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,986
Signore Medici!

542
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,121
He knows who I am.

543
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,097
We were just passing through Missouri...

544
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,041
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

545
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,165
Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.

546
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,515
No, sir. The honor is mine.

547
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,204
I would like to offer you a drink.

548
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,338
But I'm all out of bourbon.

549
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,150
And cognac and scotch.

550
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,763
Not now!

551
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,095
Is that a monkey in your desk?

552
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,489
Just for emergencies.

553
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,662
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

554
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,569
I probably should tell you...

555
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,676
the elephant is not for sale.

556
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,723
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

557
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,823
That's assuming he is real.

558
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,661
See for yourself.

559
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,804
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

560
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,678
Pleasure to meet you...
Excuse me.

561
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,903
Hello there.

562
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,077
So this, creature of yours...

563
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,832
is supposed to fly?

564
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,693
Trade secrets.

565
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,511
Max, if you don't mind my asking...

566
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:10,360
where did you...

567
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:13,099
come upon the animal?

568
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,209
He hails from the far east.

569
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,610
How far?

570
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:18,007
Far.

571
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:20,079
He doesn't look like magic to me.

572
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,297
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

573
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,999
And you train flying elephants, too?

574
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,371
Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side.

575
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,202
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

576
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:37,610
Yes.

577
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,320
Yeah.

578
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,196
And how on earth did you do that?

579
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,469
With the scientific method.

580
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,540
One picture, one picture!

581
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:52,531
Max.

582
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,271
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

583
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,398
And the tragedy of it is,

584
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,820
you don't even know that you have it.

585
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,829
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

586
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,419
No.

587
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,769
It's mystique.

588
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,510
Max, I know your type.

589
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,367
Charlatan, con man, opportunist.

590
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,454
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

591
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,914
And I know it comes
from a deep desire,

592
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,840
to build something authentic and true.

593
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,534
I know your game.

594
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,961
It's not a game.

595
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,671
Some men cheat the rules,

596
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:27,614
others change them.

597
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,925
It's up your sleeve.

598
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,619
It's in your pocket.

599
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,687
The secret to show business

600
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,990
is always keep a rabbit in your hat.

601
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,429
Or a monkey in your desk, I guess.

602
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,814
Ownership shares?

603
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,321
Max, look around you.

604
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,747
Your entire way of life is dying.

605
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,449
The future of the entertainment business

606
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,250
is to bring the audience to you.

607
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,169
And I've built that destination.

608
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,614
What I'm lacking...

609
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,162
is a protégé.

610
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,273
I know there is no Medici Brothers.

611
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,568
You probably always wanted one.

612
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,933
You're offering me a partnership?

613
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:17,223
Yes.

614
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,840
And a home.

615
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,138
For you and the entire troupe.

616
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,038
A home?

617
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:23,966
For all of us?

618
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,189
Yes. Join me.

619
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,612
Join me and my family.

620
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,241
Let me take us all,

621
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:31,513
into the future.

622
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:32,906
Let me take us all...

623
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,670
to Dreamland!

624
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,977
I wish Momma could've seen this.

625
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,439
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

626
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,547
Way to work your magic, Max.

627
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,959
We hear you, Dumbo!

628
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,687
Why won't you let him see outside?

629
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,123
Remember, young lady...

630
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,157
mystique.

631
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,784
Now this is why I joined the circus.

632
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:01,247
Dad.

633
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:02,640
Wonders of Science!

634
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,581
Alright sugar plum, remember
we got a job to do here.

635
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,591
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

636
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,675
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

637
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,982
Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't.

638
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,775
What is it exactly that we do here,

639
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:19,345
ma chérie?

640
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,740
We make the impossible,

641
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:22,761
possible.

642
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,233
And that's where you'll perform.

643
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:31,364
The Colosseum!

644
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,609
Dumbo will stay in the training
tent behind.

645
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,531
Dumbo!

646
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,618
Why aren't we going with him?

647
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,125
Because that,

648
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:46,146
is your new home.

649
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,797
Look at this place!

650
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,449
A library.

651
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,500
And the children shall lead them.

652
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,647
We're grateful for the opportunity,
Mr. Vandevere.

653
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,472
Oh, your family's mine.

654
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,537
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

655
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,660
Kentucky's top trick rider.

656
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,951
Well, there is no reason
you can't be again,

657
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,570
only here, you'd be Captain Farrier...

658
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,744
war hero.

659
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,500
One-armed wonder.

660
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,896
National treasure.

661
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,374
Well, I still can ride.

662
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:28,865
I know you can.

663
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,252
And you're going to.

664
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,551
Right after you get that
little elephant,

665
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,802
off the ground for me.

666
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:35,650
You mean once his act's working?

667
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,255
You're back in the saddle.

668
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:39,361
We're still working on the schedule,

669
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:41,196
for the rest of your troupe but...

670
00:49:41,197 --> 00:49:42,276
on Friday...

671
00:49:42,863 --> 00:49:44,525
we premiere our little Dumbo.

672
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,274
I get goose bumps.

673
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,708
Why are you looking at me?

674
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,423
Well...

675
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,564
because the only thing more
amazing than a flying elephant...

676
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,965
is the goddess who can fly it.

677
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,216
Have you lost your mind?

678
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,083
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

679
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,187
So we fly Friday!

680
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:17,470
Dumbo's never flown with anyone.

681
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,616
That's why it's become
abundantly clear,

682
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,309
why we need you.

683
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,111
Dumbo!

684
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:31,480
Hey, buddy.
We missed you. You alright?

685
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,233
Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge.

686
00:50:34,523 --> 00:50:36,435
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

687
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:37,784
Holt.

688
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,137
Just call me Holt.

689
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,575
I thought you were a military man.

690
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,907
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

691
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,917
No.

692
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:50,249
So you better keep your elephant
friend on my good side.

693
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:57,336
Hiya, Dumbo.

694
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,668
Dumbo, you mind?

695
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,471
Can I get my arm?

696
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,233
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

697
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,906
Welcome.

698
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,109
For the record, this was not my idea.

699
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,689
Dumbo works alone.

700
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,174
So do I.

701
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,469
Bonjour, Milly, Joe...

702
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,225
And you...

703
00:51:29,403 --> 00:51:30,403
Charming.

704
00:51:30,662 --> 00:51:33,054
Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you
without your makeup.

705
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,857
So I gotta teach you to fly?

706
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,639
I know how to fly,

707
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,315
ever since I was a child.

708
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,459
They taught Dumbo to fly, no?

709
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,512
So I don't need your expertise.

710
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,270
Alright.

711
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,505
Just so you know
I've been to France.

712
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,707
It wasn't a good experience.

713
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,667
Show me your secret!

714
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,819
How on earth does your elephant fly?

715
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,147
Well, first, he needs a feather.

716
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,983
He won't fly without a feather.

717
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,038
Well then, neither will I.

718
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:11,439
Allez Dumbo.

719
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,440
Allez.

720
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,850
Slow down, princess.
Safety first.

721
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,025
Guys, nets.

722
00:52:37,412 --> 00:52:38,419
Come on, hurry.

723
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,895
Alright guys, good.

724
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,451
See, Dumbo?

725
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,500
I fly!

726
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,048
See if you can catch me!

727
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,290
Here, Dumbo!

728
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,874
Oh, we got some work to do.

729
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:24,502
Friends and colleagues,

730
00:54:24,503 --> 00:54:27,796
let's give a warm Dreamland welcome
to our new executive vice president,

731
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,490
Mr. Max Medici.

732
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,806
Anything he needs, anything at all...

733
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:35,708
make it happen as you always do.

734
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,951
This is Miss Verna.

735
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,603
She will handle your schedule,

736
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,964
correspondence and all your calls.

737
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,758
When you're needed in meetings,

738
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:48,979
she'll let you know.

739
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,735
Are there meetings today?

740
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,411
I'll let you know!

741
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,267
Mr. Vandevere, one question.

742
00:54:57,268 --> 00:54:58,910
Exactly what do I do?

743
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,637
So where'd Vandevere find you?

744
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,208
I was a street performer in Paris.

745
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,016
He discovered me.

746
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:13,558
And here I am.

747
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,366
A millionaire's girlfriend.

748
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,803
That's a...

749
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:19,697
tough break.

750
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,083
It's all for show.

751
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,212
So you and he you're...

752
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,204
you're not...

753
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,346
I'm one of many gems he wears,

754
00:55:27,347 --> 00:55:29,352
to reflect the light back onto him.

755
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,779
Good boy, Dumbo.

756
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:35,093
Good job.
Yeah!

757
00:55:35,194 --> 00:55:35,994
They're gonna love him.

758
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:37,649
I think you are the lucky one.

759
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,902
Well done, Dumbo.
Good boy.

760
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,233
Who's been dreaming

761
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:44,794
like I've been dreaming?

762
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:47,642
So...

763
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:49,722
how's everything, good?

764
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:52,614
We're making progress but
he aingt quite ready yet.

765
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:53,874
What's the problem?

766
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:55,516
Doesn't the animal trust you?

767
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,974
It's not that simple.

768
00:55:56,975 --> 00:55:57,975
Ma chérie.

769
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,302
We've already sold all the tickets.

770
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,642
Maybe our little scientist here

771
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,375
can show us that it's going to work.

772
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,436
Prepare for takeoff.

773
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,926
Right wing?
Check!

774
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,877
Left wing?

775
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:24,964
Check!

776
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,341
Take her up, Dumbo.

777
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,121
Let's go.

778
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,516
Come on, buddy.

779
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:35,555
Come on, Dumbo.
Come on.

780
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,261
That's it.

781
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:39,572
Come on.

782
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,952
Let's try it again.

783
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,651
You got this.

784
00:56:49,652 --> 00:56:50,317
Here you go.

785
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,372
You beautiful one-armed cowboy.

786
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,725
You've made me a child again.

787
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,132
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

788
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,525
<i>where the impossible is possible.</i>

789
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,727
Buonasera.

790
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:14,076
Max Medici.

791
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,408
I discovered the elephant, my elephant.

792
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,826
And basically I said no.

793
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,515
I walked out and that was
the end of that.

794
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,871
The flying elephant's mine.

795
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,757
Yeah.

796
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,616
You're the guy!

797
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,103
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

798
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,755
Max.

799
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,420
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

800
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,996
He's the money man.

801
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:35,886
The J?

802
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:39,022
It's a pleasure to meet you.

803
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,177
How are you?

804
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:42,561
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

805
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:45,144
That's why they're going to send
a man up there one of these days.

806
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,224
And my bank is going to be the bank
that finances the expedition.

807
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,191
What do you think of that?

808
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,861
Needless to say Max,

809
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,688
we all have high hopes for tonight.

810
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:57,768
Oh, yeah. High hopes.

811
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:58,950
High hopes.

812
00:58:59,044 --> 00:59:02,028
Well you know hopes, dreams,
that's one thing. That's words.

813
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:04,339
But what we're talking about here, is facts!

814
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,832
Plans!

815
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,933
Plans! That takes a lot of money.

816
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:09,555
Which he hasn't got!

817
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,308
So, we are hoping that your pachyderm

818
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,039
comes through with the goods.

819
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,621
Now let's get this show on the road!

820
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,217
We are looking good!

821
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:26,685
Don't worry, Big D.

822
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,805
There's just more room to fly
out there, that's all.

823
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,078
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

824
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,964
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

825
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,154
About the what?

826
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,570
We made a deal with Dumbo.

827
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,113
We promised we'd buy his mom back

828
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,719
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

829
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,204
That's why he flies.

830
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:43,591
Joe, not now!
Are we ready?

831
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:45,581
Yeah.

832
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:49,782
Bonne chance.

833
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,746
Ok, let's go.

834
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,957
Ok, Dumbo, let's do this.

835
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,435
Pink elephants?

836
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,529
So?

837
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,355
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

838
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:06,784
<i>This is the moment,
we've all been waiting for!</i>

839
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:09,056
<i>V.A. Vandevere,</i>

840
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,304
<i>in association with Max Medici,</i>

841
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:16,189
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut.</i>

842
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:18,395
<i>You've seen a horse fly.</i>

843
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:20,677
<i>You've seen a dragon fly.</i>

844
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:23,484
<i>You've even seen a house fly.</i>

845
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,107
<i>But you haven't seen anything,</i>

846
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:27,836
<i>until you see,</i>

847
01:02:27,837 --> 01:02:29,937
<i>an elephant fly.</i>

848
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,909
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

849
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,350
Coming through.

850
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,186
Come on.

851
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,322
He can do it.

852
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,917
I know he can.

853
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,839
<i>And here to welcome him,</i>

854
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:30,087
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

855
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:21,998
Dumbo.

856
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,565
Five times around the ring.

857
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,236
That's all we have to do.

858
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,176
Nice and easy, like we practiced.

859
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,664
Dad?

860
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,649
Why aren't they putting up the nets?

861
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,473
Hey, guys?

862
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:44,963
Guys, what's going on?

863
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,233
Your men are supposed to be out there!

864
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,817
Change of plan. From the top.

865
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,327
I can't see the nets.

866
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,505
They're invisible.

867
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,684
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

868
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,863
Colette!

869
01:05:10,264 --> 01:05:11,880
Wait, don't take off!

870
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,450
Dumbo.

871
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,536
Oh, boy!

872
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,253
Prince of the Elephants.

873
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,112
I command you to fly with me.

874
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:53,991
Colette!

875
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,527
Lower the platform!

876
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:32,336
Fly, little one!

877
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,131
Magic dust!

878
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:22,236
Where's my show?

879
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,136
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

880
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,283
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.

881
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:47,623
Dumbo, it's ok.

882
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:48,844
We're here.

883
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,834
Good evening.

884
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,086
It's Mr. Vandevere.

885
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,721
Hello, hi.
Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

886
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:56,008
Everyone having fun?

887
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,132
Good.

888
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,777
Having a good time?
Yes, sir.

889
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,109
Fantastic.

890
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:02,707
Get him outta here.

891
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,092
Yes.
Over here!

892
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,424
Folks, please.
Hello.

893
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,317
Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit.

894
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:10,390
Come on.

895
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,977
Guys, guys, go easy, he's just a baby.

896
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,784
Soldier, I give the orders here.

897
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,409
It's his bedtime.

898
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:29,808
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

899
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,048
Dad?

900
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,955
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

901
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,036
I want see Dumbo!

902
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,548
I want my money back!

903
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,888
I don't understand.

904
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:55,722
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

905
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,891
I saw a vanishing act.

906
01:09:58,185 --> 01:10:01,244
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

907
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,318
You can't control your animal.

908
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,991
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

909
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:07,331
Whatever!

910
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,545
Till then, the bank is closed.

911
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,079
What happened up there?

912
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:16,576
You lost control of the animal.

913
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:17,662
You're the animal.

914
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:18,795
Where was my net?

915
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,923
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

916
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,200
Training?

917
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,304
You call that training?

918
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,643
Now hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

919
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,845
He recognized that other
elephant's call.

920
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:32,972
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

921
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,062
It's true. It's her.

922
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,913
She was sold from our circus
two months ago.

923
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,507
Every child knows its mother.

924
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,859
And they say,
elephants never forget.

925
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,553
They can be together now.

926
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,025
Why are there children in my office?

927
01:10:44,215 --> 01:10:45,631
Mr. Vandevere please,

928
01:10:46,332 --> 01:10:47,650
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

929
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,071
Just reunite them,

930
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,544
and he'll do whatever you want.

931
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,947
No,

932
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,313
he'll do whatever she wants.

933
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,366
You think I'd have bought her

934
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:56,943
if I thought she was related to him?

935
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,258
Doesn't help me at all.

936
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,865
You wanna know the most
important thing about growing up?

937
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:10,940
You've got to learn...

938
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:13,601
to go it alone.

939
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,312
Get rid of the mother.

940
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:19,356
You know where to take her.

941
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:20,982
And treat yourself to some new boots.

942
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,151
But, sir, you can't just kill her.

943
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,796
Why not?

944
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:25,989
Mr. Vandevere.

945
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,457
Wait!

946
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,016
Don't separate them, please.
Don't do that to my kids.

947
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:31,987
You know Holt,

948
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,070
when my father left us,

949
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:34,621
it was a blessing really.

950
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,420
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

951
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,622
Maybe that's what your children need.

952
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,315
Don't tell me what my children need.

953
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,126
Best take a step back, Elephant Man.

954
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,363
Darling...

955
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:50,518
Dumbo and his mom need
a little alone time.

956
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,949
So, Mommy's going to take a little trip...

957
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,126
so that Dumbo won't be distracted.

958
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,368
Milly!

959
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:00,877
Milly!

960
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:14,996
Colette?

961
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,223
I have rehearsal.

962
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,610
Max.

963
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,569
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

964
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,510
Milly?

965
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,049
<i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i>

966
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,520
Sir, park's closing.

967
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:40,713
Milly!

968
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:45,827
Milly!

969
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,445
Did you find her?

970
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,703
No.

971
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,779
Well, her momma always
knew what to say.

972
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,350
No matter what.

973
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:02,943
She always knew.

974
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,614
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

975
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,350
They just need you
to believe in them.

976
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,527
That simple?

977
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,271
Alright well...

978
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:22,254
I'm gonna keep looking.

979
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,376
That's my daughter alright.

980
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,798
The only girl I know
who runs away to go to school.

981
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,816
It's our fault.

982
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:54,290
Better Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

983
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,963
You showed him he could fly.

984
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,216
You think he'd ever trade that?

985
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,936
He would to have his mom back.

986
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,859
I miss Momma.

987
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,209
Yeah, so do I.

988
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,061
There's something I want to show you.

989
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,614
<i>With advances in both
engineering and medicine...</i>

990
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,291
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

991
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:28,621
<i>to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.</i>

992
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,797
<i>All kinds of technological marvels</i>

993
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,966
<i>await us in the 20th century.</i>

994
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,065
You're gonna do great things.

995
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:38,765
I know it.

996
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,221
What's this?

997
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:52,353
Oh, give me a break.

998
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,284
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

999
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:01,645
Oh Max!

1000
01:15:01,646 --> 01:15:02,492
Hello!

1001
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,600
Good, you brought the paperwork.

1002
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:06,793
Max.

1003
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,640
I was reviewing your troupe and...

1004
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,626
to be honest with you...

1005
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,983
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

1006
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:16,262
So I was thinking,

1007
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:16,910
I don't know,

1008
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:18,666
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

1009
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:19,756
Capisce?

1010
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,179
I. I thought you promised to...

1011
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,018
Max.

1012
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,057
The contract says that I'd hire them.

1013
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:27,704
It never stipulated for how long.

1014
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,228
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

1015
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,918
But they're my troupe.

1016
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:34,486
They're counting on me.

1017
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,872
Ok, let's have a heart.

1018
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,898
Why don't you tell them?

1019
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,216
About time, boss.

1020
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:54,072
So, when do we start?

1021
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,605
What's going on, guys?

1022
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,762
Vandevere's fired them all.

1023
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,518
They're to leave by tomorrow.

1024
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,672
Goodbye, little friend.

1025
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,047
Goodbye.

1026
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,746
We wanted to see him one last time.

1027
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,752
One last time to see him fly.

1028
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,667
I don't think he wants to anymore.

1029
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,177
Oh, no. But he must.

1030
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,680
He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again!

1031
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,162
I'm afraid it's rather worse than that.

1032
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,517
Mr. Sotheby?

1033
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,897
I've come to clear my conscience.

1034
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,687
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

1035
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,034
What order?

1036
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,731
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

1037
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,011
And she's not meant to survive.

1038
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,720
This Dreamland doesn't deserve him.

1039
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,140
No circus does.

1040
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,369
Well...

1041
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,406
Who's gonna be willing to help me?

1042
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,577
Set Dumbo and his momma free.

1043
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,482
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,</i>

1044
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,515
<i>where the impossible is possible.</i>

1045
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:21,479
Ok. Second time's the charm.

1046
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:24,261
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

1047
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,326
<i>Here to pick up the elephant
from Nightmare Island?</i>

1048
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,159
Confirmed.

1049
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:29,381
Unlock the back gates.

1050
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,233
Dumbo in position!

1051
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,069
Soon as he flies, you run back
to his tent and I'll find you there.

1052
01:18:58,859 --> 01:18:59,991
Alright, Big D.

1053
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,316
It's all up to you now.

1054
01:19:05,648 --> 01:19:06,656
Come on, Holt!

1055
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,967
To hell with it.

1056
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,292
Ready for positions.

1057
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,727
We could have used a little rehearsal.

1058
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,332
Rehearsal?

1059
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,980
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

1060
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,713
You sure you can do this?

1061
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,790
I fly elephants all the time.

1062
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,626
Are you sure you can do this?

1063
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,524
With one hand tied behind my back.

1064
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,219
Wait.

1065
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,820
What's that?

1066
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,252
Ma'am?

1067
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,005
Ma'am?

1068
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,799
Sorry ma'am, attraction's closed.

1069
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,512
My dream...

1070
01:20:06,813 --> 01:20:08,201
to be a mermaid...

1071
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:10,420
and now they've taken it away.

1072
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:14,599
And yet I hear the water singing.
I hear them beckoning me home.

1073
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,517
Lady, just be careful, ok?

1074
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,212
Return me to the vast abyss.
Let's go.

1075
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,685
My destiny, the sea!
Ok.

1076
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,399
We've lost power!

1077
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,825
Even the cages?

1078
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,048
But the animals...

1079
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,205
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

1080
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,370
And make sure
those cages are locked.

1081
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,373
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1082
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,209
<i>boys and girls.</i>

1083
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,392
<i>Making his second Dreamland debut.</i>

1084
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,728
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

1085
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840
Hey!

1086
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,543
It's a trick!

1087
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:00,889
Get back to the...

1088
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:17,470
<i>And once again,</i>

1089
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:20,823
<i>our very own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

1090
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:43,726
You.

1091
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,240
Where is your circus of freaks?

1092
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:49,548
What's going on?

1093
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,529
The elephant's mother is gone!

1094
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:53,685
His troupe's behind it!

1095
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,026
Alert the tower and secure the gates.

1096
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,199
Don't let them get out.

1097
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,861
But why would they only
take the one?

1098
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,507
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

1099
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,908
You, come with us.

1100
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,307
There they are!

1101
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:27,562
Hey!

1102
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,730
Hey, you!

1103
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,607
What are you doing up there?

1104
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,363
That's private property.

1105
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,239
Come on! Get down here!

1106
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,329
Now!

1107
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:46,184
Hey.

1108
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:48,990
I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner.

1109
01:24:49,275 --> 01:24:51,242
He's just a maintenance
man fixing a light!

1110
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,622
Get back to your posts!

1111
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,045
Yes sir, Mr. Medici.

1112
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,233
Let's try this again.

1113
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,889
You and me.

1114
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,498
Hey, the kids?

1115
01:25:29,933 --> 01:25:30,933
Where are the kids?

1116
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,988
Hey, have you seen the kids?
Dumbo.

1117
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:35,371
Prince of the Elephants.

1118
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:39,258
I command you to fly with me.

1119
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,495
Dumbo, please fly.

1120
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,502
Do it for your momma.

1121
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,926
Where's your father?

1122
01:27:10,524 --> 01:27:11,586
Dumbo!

1123
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,104
Hey! Get those kids!

1124
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,426
Dumbo!

1125
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,463
Come on.

1126
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,822
There!

1127
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,504
Bonsoir.

1128
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,296
Just passing through!

1129
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,357
Hey! You can't do that!

1130
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:35,478
Get the elephant!

1131
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:36,949
You get the elephant!

1132
01:28:58,917 --> 01:28:59,967
Don't worry.

1133
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,425
Dad'll be here soon.

1134
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,372
Where's the elephant?

1135
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:11,669
Why are you just standing there?

1136
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:12,763
Get to the tower!

1137
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:15,219
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

1138
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,800
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

1139
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,706
<i>We seem to be experiencing</i>

1140
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,442
<i>some technical difficulties.</i>

1141
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,872
What happened to my power?

1142
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,274
What power, mon chéri?

1143
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,696
You ungrateful...

1144
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:46,396
You were nothing before
I made you my...

1145
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:50,162
I believe the word is queen.

1146
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,436
I need lights!

1147
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,931
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1148
01:29:58,418 --> 01:30:00,476
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1149
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:01,723
Right now it's impossible!

1150
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,480
Nothing's impossible!

1151
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,266
Mr. Vandevere!

1152
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,907
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1153
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:41,964
Milly! Joe!

1154
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,816
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1155
01:31:20,132 --> 01:31:21,152
Get everyone out!

1156
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:22,413
Evacuate the park!

1157
01:31:27,365 --> 01:31:28,647
Milly! Joe!

1158
01:31:42,313 --> 01:31:43,113
Hey!

1159
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,644
Where is the elephant?

1160
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:52,171
Let her go!

1161
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,174
Come on!

1162
01:32:11,267 --> 01:32:12,074
Milly! Joe!

1163
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:12,992
Dad!

1164
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,239
You alright? Alright?
We're fine.

1165
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,008
Ok, come on.
Alright, cover your faces.

1166
01:32:17,132 --> 01:32:18,314
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1167
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:19,861
Back!

1168
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,200
Stay close.

1169
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:33,800
Come on everybody.

1170
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,628
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1171
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:37,570
Where are the Farriers?

1172
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,638
They must still be inside.

1173
01:33:11,928 --> 01:33:12,628
Dad!

1174
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,620
It's ok, Joe.

1175
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:17,422
Come here. Come here.

1176
01:33:20,645 --> 01:33:21,445
Dumbo!

1177
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,395
Dumbo!

1178
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,880
Come on!

1179
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,648
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Jump!

1180
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,608
Come on. Come on.

1181
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,212
Alright, let's go.
Stay close, come on.

1182
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,406
Ok. Go! Go! Go!

1183
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,936
Come on!

1184
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:54,238
Dumbo!
Come on!

1185
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:56,374
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1186
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,171
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

1187
01:33:58,658 --> 01:33:59,794
Dumbo, let's go!

1188
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:04,841
Go!

1189
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,118
Dumbo!

1190
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,197
Get him!
Yes sir.

1191
01:34:13,698 --> 01:34:15,731
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1192
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:17,336
They're coming for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1193
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:18,460
He lost the feather.

1194
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:19,566
Feather doesn't do nothing.

1195
01:34:19,812 --> 01:34:21,395
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

1196
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,297
Dad, they're coming!

1197
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:25,708
Stand back! Stand back!

1198
01:34:25,902 --> 01:34:26,938
Out of my way!

1199
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:31,030
Dumbo, remember this?

1200
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:32,536
From my momma?

1201
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,439
I can unlock any door.

1202
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,970
And you can, too.

1203
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:39,480
But I don't need this key to do it.

1204
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,960
And you don't need the feather.

1205
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:43,218
Come on.

1206
01:34:58,568 --> 01:34:59,568
Dad!

1207
01:34:59,852 --> 01:35:00,968
Gotta go. Come on!

1208
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,614
What are you doing?

1209
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,009
There aingt room for the three of us.

1210
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,993
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1211
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:08,568
Go on, Big D.

1212
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,079
Grab them!

1213
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,169
Hey!

1214
01:35:23,943 --> 01:35:25,035
Hey!

1215
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,567
That's my elephant!

1216
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:43,911
They're safe.

1217
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:45,596
Come on, let's go!

1218
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:50,579
Hey! Get back here!

1219
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,247
You freak!
What have you done?

1220
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:57,423
What they pay me for, mister.

1221
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,021
Put on a hell of a show.

1222
01:36:02,406 --> 01:36:03,106
Hey!

1223
01:36:03,107 --> 01:36:05,633
Him! Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1224
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:08,105
Hey, we had a contract, Medici!

1225
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:11,575
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

1226
01:36:24,069 --> 01:36:25,486
This is a disaster.

1227
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,863
Come on, I'll buy you a hot dog.

1228
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,681
Sounds good, J.G.

1229
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,903
Last call for cargo!

1230
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,529
All aboard!

1231
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:36,840
Colette!

1232
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:46,470
Where's your father?

1233
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,778
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1234
01:37:55,886 --> 01:37:56,652
Dad!

1235
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:57,878
I knew you could ride.

1236
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:06,230
Pramesh, we have to go.

1237
01:38:06,231 --> 01:38:06,954
Please, hurry.

1238
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,454
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1239
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,047
Come.

1240
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,312
Let's go home.

1241
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,443
Hey!

1242
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:57,341
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1243
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:01,217
Go on.

1244
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:42,925
Ladies and gentlemen...

1245
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:47,484
introducing our world famous
flying elephant.

1246
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:58,440
Welcome to the Medici Family circus!

1247
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,742
Where we believe no wild animals

1248
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,420
shall be held in captivity.

1249
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,525
See Rongo...

1250
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:16,129
the world's strongest
and most versatile man.

1251
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:21,297
Meet the bewitching Miss Atlantis...

1252
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,973
now performing underwater Shakespeare,

1253
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,894
with the world's only living merman.

1254
01:40:26,995 --> 01:40:27,804
Puck!

1255
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,978
And visit our newest attraction,

1256
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:38,655

01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:42,155

01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:45,113
that are shaping tomorrow today.

1259
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:06,668
Marvel at the skills of the legendary Holt...

1260
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,769
our cowboy of the future.

1261
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,163
And the Pearl of Paris, Colette.

1262
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,582
Queen of the Heavens.

1263
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:56,706
Friends, young and old,

1264
01:41:56,707 --> 01:41:58,736
you have a home at our circus.

1265
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:02,485

and miracles happen.

1266
