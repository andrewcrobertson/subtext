1
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:54,089
And we're on
in four, three,

2
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:56,089
two, one.

3
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,006
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

4
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,172
could be made
completely safe.

5
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,256
And what if I told you that
this could be accomplished

6
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:08,547
without risking the life

7
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,506
of one single
law enforcement officer.

8
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,089
How do I know this?

9
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,381
Because it's happening
right now

10
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:17,756
in every country
in the world

11
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,631
but this one.

12
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,672
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to The Novak Element.

13
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,922
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

14
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,047
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe

15
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,339
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

16
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,839
General Monroe,
welcome back.

17
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,089
Good to see you, Pat.

18
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:43,506
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

19
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:47,297
Could you walk us through
what we're seeing here?

20
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,672
Well, this is
a routine operation.

21
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:51,922
We found that
random patrols

22
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,381
<i>helped the local population
to feel safer and to trust us.</i>

23
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:56,464
It's amazing.

24
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,881
And what are
these colored dots

25
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,464
that we're seeing here,
General?

26
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:03,547
<i>These are our assets
on the ground.</i>

27
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,214
In green,
we got the ED-209s.

28
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:09,006
They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.

29
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,339
Purple are
the smaller EM-208s.

30
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,964
They sweep and mop up.

31
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:16,006
And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.

32
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:20,214
It is great to see
American machines

33
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:23,589
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

34
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,422
All right, you guys, this
is a standard op, all right?

35
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,881
There's no
opposition expected.

36
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,131
I'm gonna set your markers
to code red.

37
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:35,006
All our drones are gonna
give top priority to your safety.

38
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,214
No red assets
have ever been lost.

39
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,422
Okay.
Okay?

40
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,839
Does that
make you feel better?

41
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,839
But, listen,

42
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:43,672
keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.

43
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:44,839
Okay?

44
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:46,172
Good. Enjoy the show.

45
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,422
All right. Let's go.

46
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,506
May peace
be upon you.

47
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:05,339
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

48
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:07,922
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

49
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,006
No one will be harmed.

50
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,589
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

51
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,339
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

52
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,589
No one will be harmed.

53
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:31,797
Scott, get me
a shot of this.

54
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,547
Your cooperation
is appreciated.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,547
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

56
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,339
May peace be upon you.

57
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:50,506
Incredible.

58
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,922
Incredible!

59
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:57,339
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

60
00:03:57,422 --> 00:04:00,589
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

61
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,881
General, you care
to comment on this?

62
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:06,422
Well, Pat,
we had Vietnam,

63
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,297
we had Iraq,
we had Afghanistan.

64
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,047
Never again.

65
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:14,589
From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.

66
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,464
We can accomplish
our objectives

67
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,589
without any loss
to American lives

68
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:22,006
and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.

69
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:23,922
And why wouldn't they?

70
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,339
For the first time
in their lives

71
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,756
they get to watch
their children grow up

72
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,714
in an environment
of safety and security.

73
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:34,756
Navid!

74
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,172
Get away from the window!

75
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:38,339
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

76
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,172
Come here! Come here right now!

77
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:42,339
Arash!

78
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,381
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

79
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,256
But he's just a kid.

80
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:46,672
Sayeh!

81
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,672
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

82
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:50,881
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

83
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,506
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

84
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,756
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

85
00:04:59,422 --> 00:04:59,964
Navid!

86
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:01,506
Shut the door!

87
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:04,506
We're not here to kill any of them.

88
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:06,006
Got it?

89
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,214
The goal is to die on television.

90
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:10,214
Let's go!

91
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:12,506
Kelly!

92
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,256
Can you hear me out there?

93
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:17,256
Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran

94
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,589
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

95
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,631
As you can see behind me,
they're working

96
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,506
in collaboration
with the robots

97
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,089
and obviously their safety
IS everyone's top priority.

98
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,506
Don't make a move before I say...

99
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,714
I wanna make sure they're recording.

100
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:52,672
Yes!

101
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:53,547
Yes! Yes!

102
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:54,756
We're ready.

103
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,422
You'll notice children

104
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,547
in the streets as well.
This is everyday life

105
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,714
happening in perfect harmony.

106
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,256
Oh, great.
Here, come here.

107
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,464
Stay put,
stay put, stay put.

108
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,006
It's fine. Don't worry.
My guy's got it.

109
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,422
Navid! It's dangerous here!

110
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,256
Come away! Come...

111
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,756
Navid, where are you going?

112
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:35,714
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

113
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,172
What are you looking for? Navid!

114
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,756
Navid! Navid! What are you...

115
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,214
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

116
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:58,964
Oh, my God!

117
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,172
Drop your weapon.

118
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:13,506
Kelly?

119
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,589
Kelly!
Are you all right? Kelly!

120
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:16,839
We're okay, Pat.

121
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:19,339
<i>Our robots have just repelled
some suicide bombers.</i>

122
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,131
I'm sorry, Kelly,

123
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:25,006
but for security reasons the Pentagon's
going to cut our feed to Tehran.

124
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:26,381
But, please, be careful.

125
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:28,256
Yeah. I'll continue
to stand by.

126
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:35,256
Now you see how fundamental
these robots are to our foreign policy.

127
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,131
So then tell me.

128
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:41,631
Why can't we use these
machines here at home?

129
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:46,756
Why is America
so robophobic?

130
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,672
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars.

131
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,756
An entrepreneur
and true American

132
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,006
whose product just saved
my colleague's life.

133
00:07:58,297 --> 00:08:00,381
And on the other.

134
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,881
Hubert Dreyfus.

135
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:07,006
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

136
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:11,464
whose bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

137
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,672
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

138
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,297
because they haven't
experienced this technology

139
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,506
and they fear
what they don't understand.

140
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:25,506
We at The Novak Element
support Mr. Sellars' efforts

141
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,922
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

142
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,006
After all,

143
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,131
what's more important than the
safety of the American people?

144
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,964
Hey, Murphy.
Hey.

145
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,589
How's Jack?

146
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,464
We don't know yet.

147
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,672
Murphy.

148
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,672
How's it going?
Good.

149
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,714
What the hell
are they doing here?

150
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:23,714
Six in the morgue.
Lewis in the hospital.

151
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,714
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

152
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,756
We got a lead on
Antoine Vallon, we took it.

153
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,839
What lead?

154
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,089
Not in front of them.

155
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,506
This is bullshit. Yeah?

156
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,256
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

157
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,422
Vallon's our case.

158
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:40,339
Yeah, two years without no arrest, no
nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

159
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,756
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

160
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,839
No, it's nothing personal.

161
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,089
Although, I don't
like you as a person.

162
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,172
Okay, you two, out.

163
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,756
No problem.

164
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,589
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

165
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,214
your partner would
still be standing.

166
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,131
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

167
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:02,506
Okay, Alex.

168
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:07,089
It's just you and me now.

169
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,172
So me and Jack, we've
been doin' some street buys.

170
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:11,839
We get a line on some guns.

171
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,506
We meet up with this
low-level G called Jerry

172
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,131
who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.

173
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,089
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry?

174
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:22,089
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

175
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,256
Two crates?

176
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,422
No disrespect, J,

177
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,339
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

178
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,672
What's it matter
where it comes from?

179
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,422
Why it matters, we don't
want no dirty guns, Jerry.

180
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,339
These guns got bodies
on' em, Jerry?

181
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,672
Yo, look,
they're clean, all right?

182
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,214
You gonna buy
this shit or not?

183
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:36,756
Why you acting
SO nervous, man?

184
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,672
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

185
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:39,839
What'd you say?

186
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:41,922
You think he fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.

187
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,422
Yo, what the hell
are they talkin' about, man?

188
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,839
Hey, let me see your phone.

189
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:46,339
Let me see your phone.

190
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,631
I'm not showing you
my phone, man!

191
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,964
You recordin' this?

192
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:50,714
I think you're
a goddamn cop!

193
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:51,797
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

194
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,172
I'm not showing you
my phone!

195
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,339
Hey! Put your gun down!

196
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,631
Put your phones
on the table.

197
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,631
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

198
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,839
What?

199
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,797
Shut up! Shut up!
What'd you say?

200
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:02,964
Ends up he works
for Vallon.

201
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,922
Before the meet, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

202
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,256
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

203
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:11,006
Not out on the street.

204
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,256
Intake papers blank.
No signatures.

205
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,672
What do you got?
Nothin'.

206
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:18,339
How do you think
that happened?

207
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,256
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

208
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:25,339
These guys'll shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

209
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:26,797
We need backup.

210
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:29,256
If we call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station.

211
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,672
He's gonna disappear.

212
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,506
It's gonna be all right.

213
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,589
So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,

214
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:36,922
and he bought it.

215
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,006
What do you two need with that
much product? You plotting a coup?

216
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:44,339
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

217
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,422
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

218
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,547
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

219
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,506
Hey, boss.

220
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,506
What do you got for me?

221
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,297
Really?

222
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:00,172
We were just about to
close the deal but someone tipped him off.

223
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,756
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

224
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,339
Two minutes.

225
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,839
Make sure
you Kill 'em both!

226
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:24,589
I got two handguns,
one automatic.

227
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,506
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

228
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:40,964
You sure about this?

229
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,297
You ready?

230
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:05,589
Move.

231
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,256
Lewis!

232
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,297
Lewis!

233
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,839
Officer down!
Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

234
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:57,464
This is Detective Alex Murphy

235
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,464
in need of immediate
medical assistance.

236
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,631
331 Hamilton Road.

237
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:03,672
Jack.

238
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,631
Jack, come on.
Jack. Can you hear me?

239
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,131
Jack. Stay with me.

240
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,172
Jack.

241
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:16,006
Alex, you don't
do something like this

242
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,839
unless you bring it
to me first.

243
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,339
Vallon's connected.

244
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:23,297
I'm warning you, don't make
any more moves until I vet this.

245
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,172
If officers are
supplying him with guns...

246
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:27,339
That's up to IAD.

247
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,297
I'll handle it.

248
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:39,631
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

249
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,339
A machine does not know
what it feels like to be human.

250
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,881
It can't understand
the value of human life.

251
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,464
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

252
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:53,047
To legislate
over life and death,

253
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:56,922
we need people who
understand right from wrong.

254
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:59,339
What do your machines feel?

255
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:02,964
Well, they feel no anger.
They feel no prejudice.

256
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:07,672
They feel no fatigue, which makes
them ideal for law enforcement.

257
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:11,839
Putting these machines
on the streets

258
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:15,006
will save countless
American lives.

259
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,006
You're evading
the question. No, I'm not.

260
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,214
Yes,
you're evading the question.

261
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:21,756
I asked what do
these machines feel?

262
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,756
If one of them
killed a child,

263
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,297
what would it feel?

264
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,797
Nothing.
And that's the problem.

265
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:38,256
That's why 72% of Americans will
not stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

266
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,214
America is the world's most
valuable market, and we can't touch it.

267
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:54,797
With a domestic expansion,
we'd clear $600 billion per annum.

268
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:59,839
In other words, every second that law is
in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.

269
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,006
What do you
want me to do?

270
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,506
We've thrown cash at senators at
both sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.

271
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,589
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

272
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:09,797
So unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

273
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,922
Now, to that effect,

274
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,339
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

275
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:19,006
Wow factor
off-the-charts.

276
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:22,006
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

277
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,006
A figure
they can rally behind.

278
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:27,172
Sir, I have dissected this
bill. There are no loopholes.

279
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,006
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

280
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,297
Forget machines.

281
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:31,839
You saw the polls.

282
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:34,506
Americans don't
want a machine.

283
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,339
They want

284
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:40,172
a product
with a conscience.

285
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,756
They want

286
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,714
something that knows

287
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,256
what it feels like

288
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,797
to be human.

289
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,672
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

290
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:07,297
You're not you because
of your legs, your arms, your hands.

291
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,047
You're you because
of your brain.

292
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:13,547
It's your brain's capacity to process
information that makes you who you are.

293
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:19,172
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

294
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,797
I've never played
with these.

295
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:29,297
The music doesn't come from your
fingers, Michael, it comes from your mind.

296
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,422
All you have to do
is let it out.

297
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:33,506
Please.

298
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:05,797
Oh, my God.

299
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,714
No, it's okay. Easy.

300
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,464
His emotions are peaking.
The readings are getting clouded.

301
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:17,797
It's okay.

302
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,797
Relax. If you get
too emotional,

303
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,756
it'll change the chemistry
in your brain,

304
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:24,672
It'll throw the system out.

305
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,256
You're doing great.
Come on.

306
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,839
I need emotion to play.

307
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:49,797
Concierto de
Aranjuez, second movement.

308
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,672
Beautiful piece.

309
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,547
Dennett, when you
have a moment. Thank you.

310
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:58,797
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

311
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:02,589
I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

312
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,922
My work here is driven
by its own questions.

313
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:09,547
And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

314
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,381
Look, I think
I found a way

315
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:16,214
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

316
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:19,964
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

317
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,172
You're not
keeping up your end,

318
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,589
leaving me exposed
like that.

319
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,547
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

320
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:38,797
So put him
on the payroll.

321
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:39,881
Why are we talkin'
about this?

322
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,589
It won't work. And now that
his partner got hit,

323
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,589
he's never gonna let it go.

324
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,631
What is that?
Lewis' hospital.

325
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,089
Alex is dropping by
this afternoon,

326
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,256
in case you want
to send flowers.

327
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,672
Yeah.

328
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,214
I kill a cop,

329
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,964
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

330
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,381
That's not good
for business.

331
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,464
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

332
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,964
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

333
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,672
I'm gonna have 'em in
bracelets within a month, man.

334
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:19,131
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

335
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:21,714
Cameras off?

336
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,089
Clear.

337
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:28,964
You were right.
We should've had backup.

338
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,506
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,839
You're not really sleeping,
are ya?

340
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:39,589
Asshole.

341
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:46,756
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

342
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,214
He has let himself go a
little since the accident.

343
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,506
Pass.

344
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:54,131
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

345
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,131
Officer Alfred Miller,
Denver.

346
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,839
"Severe Cerebellar..."

347
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,506
Cerebellar ataxia.

348
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,256
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

349
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,506
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

350
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,172
Let's keep this one
in mind. I like this guy.

351
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:13,131
Very good, sir.
I saved the best for last.

352
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:18,756
I give you Sergeant Jack
Freeman, masculinity incarnate.

353
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,214
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

354
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,381
now confined
to a wheelchair.

355
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,922
I think I can
see the appeal.

356
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:29,006
No.

357
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,964
What? Why?

358
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:34,047
Well, check the psych
evaluation. He's far too unstable.

359
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,006
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

360
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:38,672
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

361
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,089
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

362
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:44,297
We have to be scientific.

363
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:47,172
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

364
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,047
He's right. Okay.
Keep looking.

365
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:54,881
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.

366
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,047
Hey, guys.
Hi, Dad.

367
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,006
Hey, little monkey.
Hey.

368
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,464
How's the game, buddy?

369
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:08,506
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

370
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,506
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

371
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,131
Hey, D, why don't
you head upstairs

372
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,881
and start getting ready
for bed.

373
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:16,714
But he just got home.

374
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,797
I'll be up in a second.

375
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,339
Tuck you in, okay?
All right?

376
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,089
Now give your mom a Kiss.
Good night, baby.

377
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:28,464
Too slow, boy.

378
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,047
You're just too slow.

379
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,131
How's Jack holding up?

380
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,756
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

381
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:45,589
It's my fault.

382
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,047
We shouldn't even
have been there.

383
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:50,714
Here.

384
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:56,756
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

385
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,214
It'll stop.

386
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:06,256
It's gonna
wake up David.

387
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:54,464
He suffered 4th
degree burns over 80% of his body.

388
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:57,464
Lower spine
has been severed.

389
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,339
If he survives,

390
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:05,006
he'll be paralyzed from the waist
down and confined to a wheelchair.

391
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,464
Mrs. Murphy,

392
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,547
we don't have to do this.

393
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,922
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

394
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:22,672
Please continue.

395
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,797
Vestibulocochlear,

396
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,964
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

397
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,131
He'll be blind in one eye.

398
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:34,214
Most likely deaf.

399
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:37,422
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

400
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:39,006
are the leaders
in this field.

401
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:42,756
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

402
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:45,297
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

403
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,381
I'm sorry, Doctor.

404
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,381
I need time to think.

405
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:56,464
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

406
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:03,339
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

407
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:08,547
What kind of life
will he have?

408
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:20,422
Fly me to the moon

409
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,797
Let me play
among the stars

410
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,881
Thanks.
Thanks, buddy.

411
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,839
You know she's gonna
make me dance again.

412
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,672
Now that I've gotta see.

413
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,839
You don't want
to see that.

414
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,589
Here she comes now.

415
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:35,881
Hold on to that.

416
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:37,214
Get out there, partner.

417
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:40,506
Every time.

418
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,422
Get her, boy.

419
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:52,964
Fill my heart with song

420
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:57,381
And let me sing forever more

421
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:01,631
You are all I long for

422
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,797
All I worship...

423
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:05,839
Subject is
still dreaming.

424
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,756
He's retrieving memories,

425
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,256
trying to make sense of
sensorial stimulation package 37.

426
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,797
Perfect, Kim.

427
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:18,297
Let's reconnect the spine.

428
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,797
Time to wake him up.

429
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:27,422
Fill my heart with song

430
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:31,089
Let me sing forever more

431
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:35,589
You are all I long for

432
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:40,006
All I worship and adore

433
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,672
In other words

434
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:47,172
Please be true

435
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:48,797
Excuse me?

436
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,006
What are you doing here?

437
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:52,756
Baby, where you going?

438
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,131
In other words

439
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:57,339
Lewis.

440
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:01,297
I love

441
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,297
You

442
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:11,214
Subject regaining
cognitive functions.

443
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,381
What's happening?

444
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:17,797
Where am I?

445
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:22,464
You were in an explosion,
Alex. You're in a hospital.

446
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:27,381
Where's Clara? My wife.
Where's my wife?

447
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:29,881
I want you to calm down,
Alex. Listen to me.

448
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:33,631
You're okay. And your family's
fine. Both your wife and your son.

449
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,922
Who the hell are you?

450
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,089
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.

451
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:40,839
Heart rate rising.

452
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,964
I can't move.

453
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:50,131
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?

454
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:51,422
Visual input unstable.

455
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,006
I want you to relax, Alex.

456
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:54,464
Subject's dumping
too much epinephrine.

457
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:55,922
Should we purge it?
Not yet.

458
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,547
Unlock vertebrae.

459
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:04,881
Go ahead, Kim.

460
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:08,464
Unlock upper,
lower extremities.

461
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,214
What kind of suit is this?

462
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:26,881
It's not a suit, Alex.

463
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:30,256
It's you.

464
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,839
This was the only option.

465
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:37,506
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

466
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,464
Full body unlock.

467
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:41,922
I want you
to walk now, Alex.

468
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:43,589
You can do that.

469
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,089
This seems so real.

470
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,881
Alex,
it's very important

471
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:15,547
you understand
what is happening.

472
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,006
This is real.

473
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:20,256
It's not a dream, it's
not drugs or anesthetics.

474
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:23,256
I know I'm dreaming
'cause I can feel all of this.

475
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,381
Alex, amputees can often
feel their missing appendages.

476
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:27,756
It's called
phantom limb sensation.

477
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,089
What do you mean "amputees"?

478
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:31,422
What the hell did you do
to me? You need to relax.

479
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:32,881
Take this off me now.

480
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,506
I need to get out of this
thing. What did you do to me?

481
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,631
What have you done to me?

482
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:40,131
Alex? Hey!

483
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,506
Shut him down.

484
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,214
No! Let him run!
Let him run!

485
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,047
Where am I?

486
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,089
Alex, please.

487
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:35,922
Stop.

488
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:38,672
Alex, you have to stop.

489
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,339
Please.

490
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:43,589
Alex.

491
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:46,589
Please stop.

492
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,589
Stay where you are

493
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:51,506
and we'll come
and pick you up.

494
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,464
Okay, Kim.

495
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,089
Shut him down.

496
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,506
Alex,

497
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:59,047
you can't run from this.

498
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:05,214
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

499
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,047
Show me.

500
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:13,422
Kim.

501
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:30,631
Oh!

502
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,089
No.

503
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:39,839
Holy Christ.

504
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,214
Holy Christ.

505
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:46,672
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

506
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,464
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

507
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,631
That's not even my brain.

508
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:07,922
We had to repair
the damaged areas.

509
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,214
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

510
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:13,839
Do you understand me, Alex?

511
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:17,297
You're in control.

512
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:20,547
I'm in control?
Yes.

513
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:24,589
Okay.

514
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:30,089
If I'm in control,

515
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:33,214
then I wanna die.

516
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:39,964
Just unplug whatever it is keepin'
me alive and end this nightmare.

517
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,339
Now, say I did that.

518
00:34:42,506 --> 00:34:45,047
Which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

519
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,131
but say I did.

520
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,256
What do I say
to your wife?

521
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,464
What does she say
to your son?

522
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:56,297
That it didn't work.
That you tried.

523
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:59,006
Somethin' went wrong.

524
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:02,881
You did everything
you could,

525
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:07,172
but I died.

526
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,172
So after all
they've been through,

527
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:12,589
all the pain,
all their hope restored,

528
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,881
we would just
rip that away?

529
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:18,464
Your wife
loves you, Alex.

530
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,714
She signed
the consent forms herself.

531
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:24,131
Otherwise, you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

532
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:38,922
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

533
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,714
I need you to take it.

534
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:50,672
I don't wanna see myself
like this again.

535
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,297
Ever.

536
00:35:53,464 --> 00:35:55,631
And the same goes
for my family.

537
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:05,089
Just put me back in.

538
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,714
Zoom in.

539
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,297
Stop.

540
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:18,381
Zoom in.

541
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:22,089
Stop.

542
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,881
Accept the connection.

543
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,422
It's so good
to finally see you.

544
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:38,922
I was gonna say
the same thing.

545
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:41,547
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,881
I know how I must
look to you.

547
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,381
I think you look beautiful.

548
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:53,172
Are they treating you okay,
baby?

549
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:57,756
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

550
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:01,256
Does David know
you're calling?

551
00:37:04,714 --> 00:37:06,297
He misses you.

552
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,172
I can go get him.
No.

553
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:12,714
I don't want him
to see me like this.

554
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:15,964
Not yet.

555
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:17,339
Sure.

556
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:25,714
We're gonna
get through this, baby.

557
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,797
We're gonna make it
like it was.

558
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:36,839
When are you comin' home?

559
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,339
Well, they've still
got some tests.

560
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:42,547
But they're sayin'
it's goin' really well.

561
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:45,964
The minute they let me.

562
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:49,922
I gotta go.

563
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:52,339
I love you.

564
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,131
End the connection.

565
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:12,339
Okay,
blood cleansing initiated.

566
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:17,714
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

567
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,381
Releasing proteins, fats,

568
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:26,339
minerals and carbs.

569
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:33,547
Energy inflow
is at 1320 kilocalories.

570
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:39,297
Now starting anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones

571
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:42,381
and antibiotic protocols.

572
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,006
Standard daily intake.

573
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:49,547
Release antidepressants.

574
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:53,047
Let's give him a nice dream.

575
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:05,672
All right, here's
what you're dealin' with.

576
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:08,464
Modified M2 battle rifle.

577
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:11,006
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

578
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,922
Three-shot bursts
or full auto.

579
00:39:14,256 --> 00:39:15,297
Heavy-duty.

580
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:19,756
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven
taser pistol.

581
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:24,256
Each projectile releases up to
200,000 volts. It can stun, it can Kill

582
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:25,797
and it's nasty shit.

583
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,214
Your armor,

584
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,631
state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

585
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:31,339
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and Kill.

586
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:35,214
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

587
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,422
If you sense you need a
weapon or are threatened

588
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:44,547
the visor goes down and the
system makes the weapons available.

589
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:47,589
But you gotta remember, it's
not the weapons that count.

590
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:48,714
It's who's handling them.

591
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,006
Or, in your case, what.

592
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,922
You think you can do this?
Oh, just stick to your job.

593
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,881
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

594
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:01,131
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was
there. Our machines run perfectly.

595
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,339
You ask me, stickin'
organics into the system

596
00:40:03,422 --> 00:40:05,506
is a huge step backwards.

597
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:07,881
I don't care how well
you designed this thing.

598
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:10,339
Without my sign-off, it
better start learnin' Chinese,

599
00:40:10,422 --> 00:40:11,881
'cause it ain't
never goin' home.

600
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,297
It's nice to meet you, too.

601
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,297
Let's do this,

602
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,922
Tin Man.

603
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,256
Quality control,
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

604
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:39,339
Rendering scenario one now.

605
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,797
Hey, Doc,
hope you don't mind.

606
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:43,006
I like a little music
while I'm workin'.

607
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:47,047
When a man's an empty kettle

608
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:52,172
All right. All right, let's let the
games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.

609
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,339
Commence scenario.

610
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:58,506
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

611
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,881
If I only had a heart

612
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:07,922
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

613
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,547
Regarding love and art

614
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:14,381
I'd be friends
with the sparrows

615
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,547
And the boy
who shoots the arrows

616
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:19,589
If I only had a heart

617
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:25,172
Picture me a balcony

618
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:29,172
Above a voice sings low...

619
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,131
Laggin' on
the corners.

620
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:32,714
No, there,
do you see that?

621
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:34,672
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

622
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:38,214
New product's afraid.

623
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:42,422
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

624
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,297
Don't shoot! He has a gun!

625
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:46,422
Drop your gun!

626
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,881
Drop your gun!

627
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,339
Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!

628
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:55,672
Oh, well, it's worried that
the kid's gonna get hurt.

629
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,339
- Let the kid go!
- Too bad.

630
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:02,839
Well, there you have it. 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

631
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:04,881
I wouldn't buy that
for a dollar.

632
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,756
Let's do it again.
Your funeral.

633
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:17,631
Detective Alex Murphy.

634
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:19,006
Search results.

635
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,131
"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."

636
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:23,422
"Alex Murphy.
Man or Machine?”

637
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:26,964
"Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk."”

638
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,589
Antoine Vallon.

639
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,756
Search results.

640
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,964
"DPD says Antoine Vallon no longer
suspect due to lack of evidence.”

641
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:40,381
Detroit Free Press.

642
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,631
Unfortunately, Murphy's
investigation into Antoine Vallon

643
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:45,131
wasn't authorized
in the first place.

644
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:48,922
Look, Detective Murphy was
simply overzealous, okay?

645
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:52,131
We have absolutely no evidence
linking Vallon to the attempt on his life.

646
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:54,506
All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.

647
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:58,089
And I won't rest until the men who
tried to kill him are brought to justice.

648
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:02,964
What's wrong with him?

649
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,131
No, nothing, nothing.

650
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:08,714
Watch the procedural bars
on the 208.

651
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:13,089
The machine assesses
the threat and acts.

652
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:15,089
That's it.

653
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:17,964
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

654
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:23,089
The software assesses
the threat, just like the robot.

655
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:25,131
And it sends the information
to the brain.

656
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:28,047
Alex's brain receives the information
and decides what to do with it

657
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:32,756
based on his emotional cognitive
abilities like any man would.

658
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:36,089
Then the brain relates this
to the Al module and...

659
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:38,964
Yeah, like, you know,
a year later.

660
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:40,256
And our computers
finish the job.

661
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:44,089
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

662
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:45,756
And that's what you've got.

663
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,964
But the human element
will always be present.

664
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:50,631
Fear, instinct,
bias, compassion,

665
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:51,964
they will always interfere
with the system!

666
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,589
Okay, but, Dennett,

667
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,089
I've gotta give the American
people something they can root for.

668
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:58,922
Something aspirational, right?

669
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,422
They have to
believe in this thing.

670
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:04,006
"Pretty good"? I don't
know how to sell "okay."

671
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:05,714
We, you and I,
have got a release date,

672
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,214
and we've gotta
make it, okay?

673
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:09,881
So I don't care how you do it. I'm
askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

674
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:13,422
Just get him to do that.
Get him to do that.

675
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:14,922
That is a machine.

676
00:44:15,006 --> 00:44:16,464
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

677
00:44:16,547 --> 00:44:19,422
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

678
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:20,589
And his life depends on it.

679
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:22,047
And the future of Omnicorp
depends on it

680
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:24,964
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

681
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,214
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

682
00:44:42,672 --> 00:44:45,756
It tastes like
peanut butter.

683
00:44:49,714 --> 00:44:51,881
I can't get it
out of my mouth.

684
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,339
And you
don't like peanut butter?

685
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:55,714
No.

686
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,047
You like peanut butter, Kim?

687
00:44:58,214 --> 00:44:59,631
I love it.

688
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:02,756
Okay.

689
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:05,381
I'm gonna put you
to sleep now, Alex.

690
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:06,547
Okay.

691
00:45:07,797 --> 00:45:09,797
Now, put him under, Kim.

692
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:16,881
What are you planning to do?

693
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,756
Consciousness
is nothing more

694
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,631
than the processing
of information.

695
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:28,006
I'm gonna fix him.

696
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:31,506
And he won't
know the difference.

697
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,422
Raymond?
Yeah?

698
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:47,964
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

699
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,922
We call this Combat Mode.

700
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,797
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

701
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:56,089
Yeah, that's okay.

702
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:58,006
And get a load of this.

703
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,589
What's that? He
transforms. Kids love it.

704
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:05,256
Really? Focus group
numbers through the roof.

705
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:06,756
Really?
Oh, yeah.

706
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:08,881
Well, that's really
embarrassing.

707
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:11,006
What is this?
You know what?

708
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:13,006
People really don't know
what they want

709
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:15,297
until you show it to 'em
most of the time.

710
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,381
Make him more, uh,

711
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:19,464
tactical.

712
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,089
Make him look, uh...

713
00:46:23,256 --> 00:46:25,006
Let's go with black.

714
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,506
Yeah.

715
00:47:02,631 --> 00:47:03,631
Alex.

716
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:05,881
He looks
like a billion dollars.

717
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,006
2.6 billion.

718
00:47:08,464 --> 00:47:10,172
Raymond Sellars.

719
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:12,381
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

720
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,547
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

721
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,839
Well, we funded
this program

722
00:47:16,922 --> 00:47:19,131
to give men like you
a second chance.

723
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:21,756
You just do
your best today.

724
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,381
Shall we?
Let's.

725
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:28,964
Mr. Sellars, we're ready
for you. Okay, great.

726
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:30,589
Chief Technician Shuman.

727
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,131
Mornin', folks.

728
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,464
Okay, so this is how it's gonna be.

729
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,922
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

730
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,631
I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.

731
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:45,214
You hit me,
you get a ticket back home.

732
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:49,047
My guys are gonna be
shootin' .47 caliber rounds.

733
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,381
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

734
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:54,881
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

735
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:11,464
Alex, listen to me.

736
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:14,256
The EM-208s will
try to maneuver you

737
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:15,672
so Mattox can
get a clear shot.

738
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:18,881
Do not let that happen.

739
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:22,339
If Mattox hits you, everything
but your life support will shut down.

740
00:48:22,422 --> 00:48:25,547
You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.

741
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:28,547
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.

742
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:35,797
All right.

743
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:38,506
I say we go on three.

744
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:39,672
Three.

745
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:03,214
How's it going down there?

746
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:08,339
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

747
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,839
Wow.

748
00:49:45,006 --> 00:49:47,797
Dr. Norton,
how is he doing this?

749
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:52,089
His software is
faster. His hardware is stronger.

750
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,756
He's a better machine.

751
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:58,589
But you said
humans hesitate.

752
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:01,047
Only when they're
making decisions.

753
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,089
He's not
making decisions?

754
00:50:03,256 --> 00:50:05,006
Yes and no.

755
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:08,297
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

756
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,422
Alex makes his own decisions.

757
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,631
Now, when he
engages in battle,

758
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:15,922
the visor comes down
and the software takes over.

759
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:18,047
Then the machine
does everything.

760
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:21,464
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

761
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:26,381
But if the machine
is in control,

762
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:27,881
then how is Murphy
accountable?

763
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:29,089
Who's pulling the trigger?

764
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:30,547
Well, when
the machine fights,

765
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:33,131
the system releases signals
into Alex's brain

766
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:35,797
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

767
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:38,714
I mean, Alex believes
right now he is in control.

768
00:50:38,797 --> 00:50:42,256
But he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

769
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:53,047
Crap!

770
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:18,297
So you've circumvented the law by
creating a machine that thinks it's a man.

771
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:19,381
But that's illegal.

772
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:21,339
No. No, no, no.

773
00:51:22,464 --> 00:51:24,839
It's a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.

774
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:26,297
And in my book

775
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:28,256
that's legal.

776
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:31,381
Well done.

777
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,422
Well done.

778
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:42,256
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

779
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:46,631
[, uh, I think we're
all curious to find out.

780
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:48,131
Go ahead.

781
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:27,506
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

782
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:30,339
She's been waiting
four months.

783
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:32,672
I'm sure hers is, too.

784
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,839
You're gonna do fine.

785
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:48,464
I love your sign, D.

786
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:52,922
Hey.

787
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:59,006
There's nothin' to be
nervous about.

788
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:04,922
Thank you, Dennett.

789
00:53:05,797 --> 00:53:07,422
It's been a privilege.

790
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:43,172
Hi, Dad.

791
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:47,839
You know
I missed you, buddy.

792
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,172
Me, too.

793
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:58,797
Wanna feel it?

794
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:03,964
What is it?

795
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:06,839
It's okay, sweetie.

796
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:21,089
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

797
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:23,506
You did?

798
00:55:26,506 --> 00:55:28,464
How'd they do?
I don't know.

799
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:30,839
I've been waiting
to watch them with you.

800
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:34,089
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

801
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:36,506
But I can't tonight.

802
00:55:37,172 --> 00:55:39,506
You know, 'cause
Daddy's suit needs some...

803
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,464
Some special handling.

804
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:45,506
Do you understand?

805
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,089
Thanks for coming, Jack.

806
00:56:18,339 --> 00:56:19,839
I heard you
went home already.

807
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,672
I know Clara must be
thrilled to have you back.

808
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:24,006
I saw Clara

809
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,339
and David.

810
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,339
That ain't my home right now.

811
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:33,756
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

812
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:35,631
I'm sorry, Alex.

813
00:56:36,006 --> 00:56:39,839
Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

814
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,797
I was waitin'
to hear you say that.

815
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:48,089
Least I know
you're the right color now.

816
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:23,131
Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today

817
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:25,381
certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.

818
00:57:25,464 --> 00:57:27,922
We're expecting people
from every corner of the city

819
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:29,256
here in Detroit

820
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:31,214
to come out and
show their support

821
00:57:31,297 --> 00:57:32,547
for Detective Alex Murphy.

822
00:57:32,631 --> 00:57:36,172
<i>You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is what will he look like.</i>

823
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:38,089
Is he a changed man?

824
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:39,922
Rumor has it
he is in the building

825
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,506
preparing to come out...

826
00:57:42,297 --> 00:57:47,631
Alex, we're gonna upload the
entire DPD database into your brain.

827
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:52,589
That means you'll have
instantaneous access to criminal records

828
00:57:52,672 --> 00:57:56,839
plus an archive of CCTV
footage from 2011 to the present.

829
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,006
All right.

830
00:57:58,964 --> 00:58:00,131
Hit me.

831
00:58:00,756 --> 00:58:03,006
Okay. Kim,
it's all yours.

832
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:07,256
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

833
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:10,006
Your system draws
connections automatically.

834
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:11,922
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes

835
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:15,339
and give you their exact
locations whenever available.

836
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:19,172
I got evidence
to make 138... No, no.

837
00:58:19,506 --> 00:58:21,672
166 arrests.

838
00:58:22,422 --> 00:58:24,381
His emotions are stable.

839
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,589
This is incredible.

840
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:30,756
You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.

841
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,922
The mayor is standing
onstage behind me.

842
00:58:33,006 --> 00:58:35,172
Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.

843
00:58:35,256 --> 00:58:36,506
They seem like great friends

844
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:39,506
obviously echoing the partnership
that they've brought together.

845
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:42,089
How much longer
will this take?

846
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:45,256
Well, the feed from the
database is almost done, so.

847
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,006
We're approaching
present day.

848
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:50,589
634 pending arrests.

849
00:58:50,672 --> 00:58:53,089
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

850
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,672
He's on top of her.

851
00:58:56,756 --> 00:58:58,589
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

852
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:00,256
I gotta do something!
Alex.

853
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:02,506
Alex, calm down.

854
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,422
Take a breath.

855
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:06,089
Relax.

856
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:07,589
Kim, what are the readings?

857
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:09,464
I haven't seen him
at levels like this.

858
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:10,714
- He's gonna shoot "em!
- Alex!

859
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,214
Alex, Alex, relax.

860
00:59:14,172 --> 00:59:15,172
Relax.

861
00:59:16,172 --> 00:59:17,172
Alex?

862
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,839
What is this? LIZ:
This just a computer glitch?

863
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:21,756
No. That's
his own crime scene.

864
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:22,839
Alex!

865
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:23,922
He's spiking
all over the place.

866
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,172
Alex!

867
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,589
Alex? KIM: The system
is crashing, Doctor.

868
00:59:27,756 --> 00:59:28,839
Alex, can you hear me?

869
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:30,422
Alex! Alex!

870
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:32,756
I'm not sure he can
handle this. I gotta do something!

871
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:33,839
He's emotionally overloaded.

872
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:35,089
Unlock me!

873
00:59:35,256 --> 00:59:36,672
Alex! Stop!

874
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:38,797
Stop! He's having a seizure!

875
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:40,839
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

876
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:42,172
Get me a live feed!

877
00:59:42,256 --> 00:59:43,422
I can't do it.
Dr. Norton's with the patient.

878
00:59:43,506 --> 00:59:44,506
Do it now!

879
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:45,797
Jesus Christ!

880
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:47,589
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

881
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:49,131
What?
The press is waiting!

882
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:50,297
We have to
get him up there now!

883
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:51,506
What do you
want me to do?

884
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,464
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

885
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:57,881
Your reputation is on the
line every bit as much as ours.

886
00:59:58,214 --> 01:00:00,839
We're running out of time.

887
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:02,922
Okay.

888
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:05,756
Everybody out!

889
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:08,339
Out!

890
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:09,922
Mayor Durant is
about to take to the stage

891
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,589
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

892
01:00:13,672 --> 01:00:16,922
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

893
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:23,714
Heart rate rising. He
might start spiking, Doctor.

894
01:00:23,797 --> 01:00:26,422
Set modules to
absorb dopamine and nor adrenaline.

895
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:27,672
But you'll be
taking away his emotions.

896
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:29,506
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

897
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,589
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

898
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:33,297
Now, please!

899
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:41,172
Pull the footage.
Put it on a loop.

900
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,006
Dopamine level's at 20%.

901
01:00:45,172 --> 01:00:46,172
More.

902
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:49,922
Dopamine
level's at 10%.

903
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:51,131
More.

904
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:53,964
Dopamine level's at 5%.
Lower.

905
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:56,006
You're flattening him out.
Lower!

906
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:00,672
2%.
Hold it there.

907
01:01:07,756 --> 01:01:09,006
Alex?

908
01:01:10,339 --> 01:01:12,339
Alex, how do you feel?

909
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,422
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

910
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:24,506
Well, today I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

911
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:28,297
I am here
to give you the cure.

912
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:29,506
That's right!

913
01:01:37,172 --> 01:01:38,297
Hi, Dad!

914
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:41,756
Dad?

915
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:51,422
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now

916
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:54,506
with Detective Alex Murphy!

917
01:02:11,547 --> 01:02:12,547
Detective.

918
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:29,839
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

919
01:02:30,506 --> 01:02:32,839
I think he's
accessing criminal data.

920
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,464
Thomas King!
You are under arrest!

921
01:02:59,506 --> 01:03:03,214
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

922
01:03:03,297 --> 01:03:06,839
wanted for rape, arson,
and murder.

923
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:11,006
This man has torn
apart American families.

924
01:03:11,422 --> 01:03:14,714
On the loose for six years.

925
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:21,006
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

926
01:03:24,172 --> 01:03:29,131
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

927
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:33,839
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

928
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:37,922
These two officers
are completely unaware

929
01:03:38,006 --> 01:03:41,006
of the monster
in their midst.

930
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:45,881
And then, in 60 seconds...

931
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:49,964
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

932
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:53,631
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

933
01:03:53,714 --> 01:03:57,589
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

934
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:03,547
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

935
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:07,381
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

936
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:10,631
now that RoboCop is here?

937
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:12,589
Yes,

938
01:04:12,672 --> 01:04:17,172
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

939
01:04:17,672 --> 01:04:21,589
Men weren't up to the task.

940
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:23,214
But Alex Murphy,

941
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:25,547
a robot cop,

942
01:04:25,631 --> 01:04:26,672
was.

943
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,256
We can't take him
off the street.

944
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:30,881
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.

945
01:04:30,964 --> 01:04:32,672
A big, fat, stinking hit.

946
01:04:32,756 --> 01:04:35,006
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

947
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:38,297
Hey, we all knew there
would be issues. It's inevitable.

948
01:04:38,464 --> 01:04:41,047
Dennett, you're my guy. I just
need you to get a handle on this.

949
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,256
I know,
but I need more time.

950
01:04:42,339 --> 01:04:44,839
Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

951
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,089
We need to take him back
to the lab and do more tests.

952
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:50,589
I mean, it was like something
was interfering with our system.

953
01:04:50,672 --> 01:04:53,089
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

954
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,089
Like what? His soul?

955
01:04:55,172 --> 01:04:57,672
Hey, look, this train has
already left the station.

956
01:04:57,756 --> 01:05:00,047
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

957
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:02,631
"Sorry, I released
a defective product.”

958
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:05,672
So, no matter what we do, we
just need to keep him on the streets.

959
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,422
What about the interviews?

960
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:09,922
Cancel 'em.
Cancel all of 'em.

961
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:11,422
Everything.

962
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:13,839
In fact, Dennett.

963
01:05:16,297 --> 01:05:19,172
<i>Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.</i>

964
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:21,506
I'd like to see him.

965
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:23,797
Can you arrange that?

966
01:05:23,964 --> 01:05:25,797
Look, I won't lie to you.

967
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,756
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

968
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:32,589
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

969
01:05:32,672 --> 01:05:36,631
And then he just shoots a man in
front of our son. That's not sedation.

970
01:05:37,797 --> 01:05:40,964
He's responding
to drugs differently now.

971
01:05:42,964 --> 01:05:45,297
We both knew from day one,

972
01:05:45,964 --> 01:05:48,464
there would be complications.

973
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:54,797
Just give me
a little more time.

974
01:05:55,756 --> 01:05:57,339
I promise,

975
01:05:58,464 --> 01:06:00,464
you'll have your husband back.

976
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:06,464
This goes for every
squad in every department.

977
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:10,089
Detective Murphy will have
full access to all investigations.

978
01:06:10,256 --> 01:06:12,797
Robberies,
narcotics, homicides.

979
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:15,422
If he requests
to take over a case,

980
01:06:15,506 --> 01:06:17,089
the case will be
handed to him.

981
01:06:17,256 --> 01:06:19,006
No arguments,
no complaints.

982
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:20,172
This is bullshit!

983
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:24,131
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

984
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:27,839
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

985
01:06:28,006 --> 01:06:31,131
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

986
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:33,172
John Biggs
is target number one.

987
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:34,672
I'll be
taking over this case.

988
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:36,589
<i>Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners</i>

989
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:39,256
should be ready to
move in on my request.

990
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:41,464
I wish you all
a very good day.

991
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:50,006
Murphy.

992
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:52,089
You okay, man?

993
01:06:53,964 --> 01:06:55,631
I'm fine, Sergeant.

994
01:06:56,172 --> 01:06:57,964
Can't wait to
get back to work.

995
01:06:58,131 --> 01:06:59,922
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

996
01:07:00,006 --> 01:07:01,672
Excuse me,
I have casework.

997
01:07:54,506 --> 01:07:56,172
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

998
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:04,464
Walter Karrel,
look at me.

999
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:05,922
You have two options.

1000
01:08:06,089 --> 01:08:07,089
Option one.

1001
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,006
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

1002
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:13,506
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1003
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,006
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control.

1004
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:17,881
And then I arrest you.

1005
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:19,506
Option two.
You tell me where

1006
01:08:19,589 --> 01:08:21,922
John Biggs' drug
lab is located.

1007
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:24,089
And then I arrest you.

1008
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,131
You have
two seconds to decide.

1009
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,089
Totally justifiable.

1010
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,506
We are going to make
a lot of money.

1011
01:09:39,672 --> 01:09:43,339
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

1012
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:46,839
No traces of anger
whatsoever.

1013
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:49,422
Congratulations, Doctor.

1014
01:09:49,756 --> 01:09:51,089
You did it.

1015
01:09:52,339 --> 01:09:53,839
Yes, I did.

1016
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:03,464
I told you, sir.

1017
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:06,422
Norton clearly never
had control of the product.

1018
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:09,506
I agree. And
that's why I called you here.

1019
01:10:09,797 --> 01:10:12,506
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1020
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:13,672
Okay.

1021
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,714
I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head

1022
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:17,922
plus full surveillance of the
lab, and...

1023
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,506
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

1024
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,506
If anything comes up,

1025
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:24,297
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1026
01:10:28,339 --> 01:10:29,631
He brought peace

1027
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:32,256
to this country's
most violent city.

1028
01:10:32,506 --> 01:10:33,506
He showed us all

1029
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:36,672
that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.

1030
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:40,672
A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.

1031
01:10:41,006 --> 01:10:45,006
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

1032
01:10:45,172 --> 01:10:48,756
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1033
01:10:51,172 --> 01:10:52,172
Hello, Pat.
Raymond.

1034
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:53,256
Thanks for havin' me.

1035
01:10:53,422 --> 01:10:55,922
You must be doing
a victory lap about now.

1036
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:57,006
Well.

1037
01:10:57,089 --> 01:11:01,006
Two weeks ago, Omni's
stock went through the roof.

1038
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,422
And the Senate
has finally agreed

1039
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,464
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1040
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:09,006
Well, look, I mean, the
tide is definitely turning.

1041
01:11:09,172 --> 01:11:12,006
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.

1042
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:13,089
I certainly hope so.

1043
01:11:13,464 --> 01:11:16,422
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.

1044
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:17,506
Mmm-hmm.

1045
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:18,964
Hubert Dreyfus.

1046
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,339
Senator,
thank you for joining us.

1047
01:11:21,506 --> 01:11:23,214
Hello, Pat.
Mr. Sellars.

1048
01:11:23,297 --> 01:11:25,589
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1049
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:28,506
The American public
is divided

1050
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:30,006
on the Dreyfus Act.

1051
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:35,297
Our polls at Novakelement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1052
01:11:35,506 --> 01:11:39,256
There is no doubt
Omnicorp created a sensation

1053
01:11:39,339 --> 01:11:42,756
but this bill is
not about Alex Murphy.

1054
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:45,881
It's about whether America's
willing to give robots

1055
01:11:45,964 --> 01:11:47,589
the authority
over human lives.

1056
01:11:47,672 --> 01:11:49,256
No. Look, look, look.

1057
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,006
This sea change
we're witnessing,

1058
01:11:52,089 --> 01:11:53,506
and it is a sea change,

1059
01:11:53,589 --> 01:11:55,256
shows that Americans
don't really care

1060
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:58,089
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1061
01:11:58,172 --> 01:12:01,214
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

1062
01:12:01,297 --> 01:12:02,547
You're clouding the issue.

1063
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:04,172
This is clearly an attempt

1064
01:12:04,256 --> 01:12:06,672
to sway public opinion
with a marketing stunt.

1065
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,172
What's clear is

1066
01:12:08,339 --> 01:12:11,797
that with just one system in
place, we've cut crime by 80%.

1067
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:13,922
Just imagine if we put,

1068
01:12:14,006 --> 01:12:16,214
I dunno, let's say
100 systems in place.

1069
01:12:16,464 --> 01:12:18,339
And then,
I want you to ask yourself,

1070
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:20,214
why are you holding us back?

1071
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:21,631
Is that your plan?
Thank you, Senator.

1072
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:23,422
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.

1073
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,506
Well, there you have it.

1074
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:29,089
Who could argue with that?

1075
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:31,131
Which begs the question.

1076
01:12:31,922 --> 01:12:36,381
Has the US Senate
become pro-crime?

1077
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,214
Yeah, hi.

1078
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:49,006
No, no, 5000.

1079
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:50,839
Call me tomorrow.

1080
01:12:52,256 --> 01:12:55,506
Hey, guys. Vallon's
waitin' for you inside.

1081
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:58,381
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1082
01:12:58,464 --> 01:12:59,922
I'm out here makin' money.

1083
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,922
Where are my trip
wires? I gotta do this myself?

1084
01:13:03,339 --> 01:13:05,672
What took you so long? DANIELS:
What the hell is all this shit?

1085
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:07,089
I can't move any product

1086
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:08,672
with this thing
on the streets.

1087
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:10,881
What are you doing
to protect me?

1088
01:13:11,047 --> 01:13:13,006
Relax. The guy's
a walkin' zombie.

1089
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,672
And tell me
your phones are off.

1090
01:13:14,839 --> 01:13:17,006
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

1091
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:19,339
He can't manufacture
evidence outta thin air.

1092
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:21,214
If he does,
I'm ready for him.

1093
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:31,006
Well?

1094
01:13:34,839 --> 01:13:36,172
I've been getting calls.

1095
01:13:36,339 --> 01:13:37,506
From whom?

1096
01:13:38,172 --> 01:13:39,547
Well, Clara.

1097
01:13:39,714 --> 01:13:43,339
You need to let her see
her husband. She has rights.

1098
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:46,881
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

1099
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,547
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1100
01:13:49,631 --> 01:13:51,506
before she turns up
on television.

1101
01:13:51,839 --> 01:13:53,339
Well, she can try.

1102
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:56,881
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1103
01:13:58,339 --> 01:13:59,714
I'd hop to it.

1104
01:14:00,506 --> 01:14:03,131
Alex. Alex!

1105
01:14:05,506 --> 01:14:08,297
Alex. You need to come home.

1106
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:09,839
Clara, please stand aside.

1107
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:11,339
You need to speak
to your son.

1108
01:14:11,506 --> 01:14:13,464
Right now, I see three
crimes in progress.

1109
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,047
Alex, listen to me.

1110
01:14:16,506 --> 01:14:17,506
I know you're in there.

1111
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:22,172
David won't show
his face at school.

1112
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:24,631
He's having nightmares.

1113
01:14:26,464 --> 01:14:29,172
He's falling apart.
I am falling apart.

1114
01:14:30,464 --> 01:14:31,672
Please.

1115
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:35,547
I can't do this on my own.

1116
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:39,172
He's been scared
ever since that night.

1117
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:49,881
What do you think
she's gonna do?

1118
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:52,506
What's he gonna do?

1119
01:15:13,339 --> 01:15:14,672
Are you okay?

1120
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:16,839
David? David.

1121
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:20,006
Stand back.
Come on, stand back!

1122
01:15:40,464 --> 01:15:42,506
He's supposed to be
watching this.

1123
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:47,256
Instead, he's accessing images of
Clara and David arriving at school.

1124
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:48,631
Over and over again.

1125
01:15:49,214 --> 01:15:53,381
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

1126
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,964
- Do you want me to shut
him down? DR. - No.

1127
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:07,506
Not yet.

1128
01:16:09,006 --> 01:16:10,714
I wanna see what happens.

1129
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:32,547
What's he doing
at his house?

1130
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:36,714
Look, he's disobeying
protocol.

1131
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,047
You have to shut him down.

1132
01:16:38,339 --> 01:16:41,297
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1133
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:43,506
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

1134
01:17:45,297 --> 01:17:47,714
He's undoing
what we did to him.

1135
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:50,839
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

1136
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:53,464
How is that
even possible?

1137
01:17:54,672 --> 01:17:56,964
I haven't the faintest idea.

1138
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,672
Alex.

1139
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:27,506
Alex, please return
to the station.

1140
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,339
I wanna run some tests.

1141
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:32,839
Well, this should
be interesting.

1142
01:18:49,839 --> 01:18:51,006
And your phone
on the table!

1143
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:53,339
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1144
01:18:53,506 --> 01:18:55,714
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

1145
01:18:56,506 --> 01:18:58,339
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1146
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:28,464
My hand, man!

1147
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:29,714
Where's Antoine Vallon?

1148
01:19:29,839 --> 01:19:31,047
You broke my hand, man!

1149
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,714
I know you
remember me, Jerry.

1150
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:38,922
Where's Vallon?

1151
01:19:39,006 --> 01:19:40,089
Wait a minute.

1152
01:19:40,172 --> 01:19:42,339
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1153
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:47,714
Your wife left you in 2019 after
filing charges for domestic abuse.

1154
01:19:47,797 --> 01:19:49,672
And you don't have a kid.

1155
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:51,089
But I do.

1156
01:19:52,714 --> 01:19:53,964
I'm not askin' again!

1157
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:56,214
Look, I swear, man. I don't
know where Vallon is, okay?

1158
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:59,714
The only guy I talk to is his driver
Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!

1159
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:02,172
Does he have a phone number?

1160
01:20:18,506 --> 01:20:21,714
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

1161
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:22,881
What's he doing?

1162
01:20:23,047 --> 01:20:25,172
He's off solving
his own murder.

1163
01:20:25,339 --> 01:20:28,089
Oh, that is genius.

1164
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:30,131
Why didn't I think of that?

1165
01:20:37,172 --> 01:20:38,672
How long
till he gets here?

1166
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:40,839
Five minutes.
All right.

1167
01:20:41,214 --> 01:20:42,881
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

1168
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,339
What happened?

1169
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:48,339
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

1170
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:50,797
Shit.

1171
01:20:59,047 --> 01:21:00,672
All right, everyone,
listen up!

1172
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:02,339
He's coming.

1173
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:05,339
He leaves alive, you don't.

1174
01:21:06,506 --> 01:21:08,172
How do we stop him?

1175
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:12,714
.50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

1176
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,172
This one's set.

1177
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,631
Let's go. Go!

1178
01:21:27,797 --> 01:21:29,131
All right, move! Let's go!

1179
01:21:30,506 --> 01:21:32,339
Come on. Come on!

1180
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:35,131
Ready to go!

1181
01:21:36,172 --> 01:21:37,506
They're all set.

1182
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,672
Finish it!

1183
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:22,339
You freak, die!

1184
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:12,839
Watch out.

1185
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:14,631
Need me
to call a doctor?

1186
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:16,797
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

1187
01:24:19,506 --> 01:24:20,589
What the hell
you doin' here?

1188
01:24:20,672 --> 01:24:21,964
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

1189
01:24:22,047 --> 01:24:24,756
Nah, Daniels.
Bad cop, RoboCop.

1190
01:24:26,714 --> 01:24:29,839
I've recovered 26
guns from Vallon's warehouse.

1191
01:24:30,006 --> 01:24:32,797
Thirteen serial numbers match
weapons missing from Evidence.

1192
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:34,797
And I got your prints
all over 'em.

1193
01:24:34,964 --> 01:24:35,964
This is bullshit.

1194
01:24:36,131 --> 01:24:37,922
I also
have CCTV footage

1195
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,006
of you and Vallon the
same day he tried to kill me.

1196
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:42,339
So put him on the
payroll. Why we talkin' about this?

1197
01:24:42,506 --> 01:24:45,797
It won't work. Now that his
partner got hit, he's never gonna let it go.

1198
01:24:45,964 --> 01:24:47,381
- What is that?
- Lewis' hospital.

1199
01:24:47,547 --> 01:24:49,006
Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.

1200
01:24:49,172 --> 01:24:52,047
I kill a cop, I'm lookin'
over my shoulder...

1201
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:54,506
You know what they do
to cops in prison, man?

1202
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:57,547
Being locked up with the
same dudes you put in there?

1203
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:02,589
How long you think
before he gives you up?

1204
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:09,006
Don't shoot me. Okay?

1205
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:12,339
I swear to Christ.
It was Dean.

1206
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:15,381
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1207
01:25:17,339 --> 01:25:19,339
Thank you
for your cooperation.

1208
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,006
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1209
01:25:32,089 --> 01:25:33,964
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1210
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,381
"Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1211
01:25:37,464 --> 01:25:39,172
Alex, I can explain.

1212
01:25:39,839 --> 01:25:41,214
You tipped
him off today.

1213
01:25:41,297 --> 01:25:42,547
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

1214
01:25:42,631 --> 01:25:44,547
You tried to kill me twice.

1215
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:47,922
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

1216
01:25:48,214 --> 01:25:49,214
Confess.

1217
01:25:50,547 --> 01:25:52,214
Now, in front of everyone.

1218
01:25:52,339 --> 01:25:53,339
Confess!

1219
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:04,172
What happened?

1220
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:06,464
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.

1221
01:26:06,631 --> 01:26:07,631
Why?

1222
01:26:07,797 --> 01:26:09,047
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1223
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:10,589
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

1224
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:13,172
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

1225
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:14,714
We got anything on her?

1226
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:17,214
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1227
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,172
What do you think?

1228
01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:24,297
You know what?

1229
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,964
This might actually tip
this thing right into the net.

1230
01:26:35,381 --> 01:26:38,547
Alex, I
don't know if you can hear me.

1231
01:26:38,839 --> 01:26:42,131
But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers

1232
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,714
inside
the Detroit Police Department.

1233
01:26:44,881 --> 01:26:49,214
And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.

1234
01:26:49,839 --> 01:26:51,297
Even the police,

1235
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:55,381
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

1236
01:26:56,172 --> 01:26:57,672
they can be bribed.

1237
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:01,172
They can be bought.

1238
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:06,922
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

1239
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:10,089
Americans could be
living in a country

1240
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:13,506
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1241
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:15,339
but incorruptible.

1242
01:27:16,672 --> 01:27:18,964
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done.

1243
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:20,839
And for all that you are.

1244
01:27:21,339 --> 01:27:24,506
Detective Murphy is
currently in critical condition.

1245
01:27:25,172 --> 01:27:27,922
Our doctors
are working ceaselessly

1246
01:27:28,006 --> 01:27:30,756
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1247
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,047
Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt

1248
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:36,006
on Detective
Alex Murphy's life

1249
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:38,381
will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?

1250
01:27:38,464 --> 01:27:40,339
At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern

1251
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,506
is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.

1252
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:45,797
How many times
does Detective Murphy

1253
01:27:45,881 --> 01:27:48,297
have to give his life
for his country?

1254
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:53,797
I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow

1255
01:27:53,881 --> 01:27:58,464
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.

1256
01:28:03,172 --> 01:28:05,422
Senator Dreyfus is my friend.

1257
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:08,297
He has been
my mentor and my strength

1258
01:28:08,381 --> 01:28:10,839
in times of difficulty
on this floor.

1259
01:28:11,339 --> 01:28:14,422
But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,

1260
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:17,631
and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.

1261
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:19,047
So I vote yes.

1262
01:28:19,214 --> 01:28:21,506
The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.

1263
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:24,006
That's us ahead,
39 to 10.

1264
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:27,089
I spoke to the Senate liaison
and it looks like it's in the bag,

1265
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:30,256
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1266
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,089
We're here live
at DPD headquarters

1267
01:28:34,172 --> 01:28:36,922
where moments ago, Clara
Murphy made a shocking statement.

1268
01:28:37,006 --> 01:28:38,214
What the hell?

1269
01:28:38,297 --> 01:28:43,339
Omnicorp has denied me and
my son access to Alex for weeks.

1270
01:28:44,006 --> 01:28:45,839
I demand to know why.

1271
01:28:46,839 --> 01:28:51,839
This treatment is inhuman and
somebody needs to be held accountable.

1272
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:54,839
Oh, we're fucked.

1273
01:28:55,006 --> 01:28:56,381
No, we only need 12 votes.

1274
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,964
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1275
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:00,339
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1276
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:02,256
I mean, those two should
not be allowed contact.

1277
01:29:02,339 --> 01:29:04,756
If she starts
putting ideas in his head...

1278
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,547
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.

1279
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:09,172
And what about Alex?

1280
01:29:09,256 --> 01:29:11,506
You know, unfortunately,
we can't just keep him on ice.

1281
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:14,714
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1282
01:29:14,797 --> 01:29:17,297
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

1283
01:29:17,464 --> 01:29:20,881
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1284
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:24,256
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

1285
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:26,714
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

1286
01:29:26,797 --> 01:29:28,756
It's property of Omnicorp.

1287
01:29:28,839 --> 01:29:31,089
And politics are
the least of your concern.

1288
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:32,839
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1289
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:35,381
How long till it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?

1290
01:29:35,464 --> 01:29:36,589
If that happens,

1291
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:39,589
every journalist in this
country is dying to speak to him.

1292
01:29:39,672 --> 01:29:41,631
I mean, we created a hero.

1293
01:29:42,172 --> 01:29:44,839
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1294
01:29:48,339 --> 01:29:50,047
What's bigger than a hero?

1295
01:30:01,714 --> 01:30:03,006
Dead hero.

1296
01:30:07,339 --> 01:30:09,297
Get me Dr. Norton.

1297
01:30:18,339 --> 01:30:19,464
What is this, Raymond?

1298
01:30:20,589 --> 01:30:24,589
You have Mattox spying on me and now
this bullshit about a "critical condition"?

1299
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:27,464
You know and I know
Alex is fine!

1300
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:28,797
Calm down.

1301
01:30:28,964 --> 01:30:30,464
Dennett.

1302
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:31,797
Your work is so good,
I don't...

1303
01:30:31,881 --> 01:30:33,214
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1304
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:35,214
You saw the woman on TV!

1305
01:30:35,381 --> 01:30:37,506
This has to stop!

1306
01:30:39,339 --> 01:30:40,631
You're right.

1307
01:30:41,339 --> 01:30:43,339
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1308
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,922
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1309
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:49,547
He's never gonna be a normal
man, a father, a husband.

1310
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:52,881
By the time we put the other
units on the street, he's just...

1311
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:54,131
Dennett.

1312
01:30:56,006 --> 01:30:57,506
Let's face it.

1313
01:30:58,339 --> 01:30:59,839
We failed him.

1314
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,214
We failed Alex Murphy.

1315
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:04,922
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1316
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:06,506
because that's what
we're talking about.

1317
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:09,381
The work you've done with him
is gonna be studied for decades.

1318
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,672
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1319
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:16,047
No policeman is ever going
to die in the line of duty again

1320
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:18,339
because of you.

1321
01:31:20,006 --> 01:31:21,464
You think about that.

1322
01:31:29,964 --> 01:31:33,922
I want that family
taken care of

1323
01:31:34,006 --> 01:31:35,506
beyond their wildest dreams.

1324
01:31:35,547 --> 01:31:37,631
We owe them that.
I agree.

1325
01:31:38,381 --> 01:31:41,714
I want full funding.
Ten years.

1326
01:31:42,131 --> 01:31:43,797
New staff, all my own people.

1327
01:31:43,964 --> 01:31:45,506
Fantastic.

1328
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:47,214
Deal.

1329
01:31:57,589 --> 01:31:59,089
Hey. What's going on?

1330
01:31:59,172 --> 01:32:01,256
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

1331
01:32:01,339 --> 01:32:03,089
They're not waking him up.

1332
01:32:03,172 --> 01:32:05,047
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1333
01:32:05,131 --> 01:32:06,672
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1334
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:09,881
The voting period has ended.

1335
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:12,547
The clerks have
tabulated the results.

1336
01:32:12,631 --> 01:32:14,672
The yeas are 63.

1337
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:17,464
The nays are 22.

1338
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:20,047
A majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.

1339
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:23,881
The Dreyfus Act has been
repealed by Congress.

1340
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:31,922
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1341
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:33,089
This is Mattox.

1342
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,547
Dennett's on board.

1343
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:36,214
It's about time.

1344
01:32:41,297 --> 01:32:42,422
Call it.

1345
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:44,589
Get it done.

1346
01:32:45,589 --> 01:32:47,006
My pleasure.

1347
01:32:55,714 --> 01:32:57,922
Mrs. Murphy... You can come
here as much as you want.

1348
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:01,256
You can threaten me. You can
sue me. You can take my home.

1349
01:33:01,339 --> 01:33:04,256
But I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

1350
01:33:04,547 --> 01:33:07,297
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1351
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:10,339
Is Alex okay?

1352
01:33:10,589 --> 01:33:14,047
He has important information to
share with you. Will you accompany me?

1353
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:17,547
David.

1354
01:33:19,256 --> 01:33:21,506
We gotta go.
Can you grab your coat?

1355
01:33:22,839 --> 01:33:23,839
Hey!

1356
01:33:23,922 --> 01:33:24,964
I'm in the
elevator, on my way down.

1357
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:26,589
I need access to the lab.

1358
01:33:26,672 --> 01:33:28,297
That's insane.
They're still here.

1359
01:33:28,381 --> 01:33:30,089
Distract them.

1360
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:31,297
Okay.

1361
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:33,547
I cannot...

1362
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,797
There's a lady in here going hysterical.

1363
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:37,756
She will not let us in. She's
got the codes for the door.

1364
01:33:37,839 --> 01:33:39,506
I repeat,
she will not let us in.

1365
01:33:39,589 --> 01:33:41,881
Lady, you need to let us in
there now. We have to get in there.

1366
01:33:41,964 --> 01:33:43,464
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1367
01:33:43,547 --> 01:33:46,381
Do you wanna be responsible for
the deaths of everyone in this building?

1368
01:33:46,672 --> 01:33:48,047
Hey! Stop!

1369
01:33:52,214 --> 01:33:53,339
Don't shoot!

1370
01:33:53,422 --> 01:33:54,797
Step outside.

1371
01:34:01,256 --> 01:34:02,922
Unlock the transmitter!

1372
01:34:04,297 --> 01:34:05,297
Transmitter
unlocked!

1373
01:34:12,756 --> 01:34:14,631
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1374
01:34:14,714 --> 01:34:16,172
Right away, sir.

1375
01:34:18,339 --> 01:34:19,589
Wake him up!

1376
01:34:20,006 --> 01:34:23,089
Alex! Alex!

1377
01:34:23,506 --> 01:34:26,672
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

1378
01:34:26,756 --> 01:34:27,964
Alex, can you hear me?

1379
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:31,256
These men are here
to kill us.

1380
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:33,797
They're here to Kill us,
for Christ sakes!

1381
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:40,381
Mrs. Murphy, last night,

1382
01:34:40,464 --> 01:34:42,464
Alex had a psychotic break.

1383
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:46,839
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

1384
01:34:47,964 --> 01:34:49,464
We did everything,

1385
01:34:49,547 --> 01:34:52,464
everything, we could, but
the doctors couldn't save him.

1386
01:34:53,922 --> 01:34:55,964
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1387
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,797
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1388
01:34:59,256 --> 01:35:01,714
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

1389
01:35:02,339 --> 01:35:04,006
Mattox shut you down.

1390
01:35:05,339 --> 01:35:08,214
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

1391
01:35:08,631 --> 01:35:10,797
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1392
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:13,964
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1393
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:17,922
He wants you dead, Alex.
Do you understand?

1394
01:35:18,089 --> 01:35:19,922
Sorry. If there's
anything we can do

1395
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:21,339
for you and David,
we'll do it.

1396
01:35:21,506 --> 01:35:23,631
I want nothing from you.

1397
01:35:24,589 --> 01:35:25,881
I understand.

1398
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,756
You stay out of our lives.

1399
01:35:30,172 --> 01:35:31,381
You and your company.

1400
01:35:31,672 --> 01:35:33,547
If that's what
you think is best.

1401
01:35:34,506 --> 01:35:35,964
There's one more thing.

1402
01:35:36,047 --> 01:35:38,881
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David

1403
01:35:38,964 --> 01:35:41,172
if we kept
this matter private.

1404
01:35:41,422 --> 01:35:43,964
We don't wanna
damage Alex's legacy.

1405
01:35:46,631 --> 01:35:48,464
Alex! Alex!

1406
01:35:48,839 --> 01:35:50,464
I can fix this!

1407
01:35:50,547 --> 01:35:52,006
You lied to me.

1408
01:35:52,089 --> 01:35:53,339
You lied to my wife.

1409
01:35:53,422 --> 01:35:55,047
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1410
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:56,381
You want me
to trust you, Doctor?

1411
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:58,506
Alex, I can go to the press!

1412
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,506
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1413
01:36:02,797 --> 01:36:04,256
Alex!

1414
01:36:04,797 --> 01:36:06,714
Listen to me, please!

1415
01:36:07,714 --> 01:36:11,006
Alex! Alex!

1416
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:23,672
What the hell?

1417
01:36:32,047 --> 01:36:33,422
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1418
01:36:33,506 --> 01:36:35,589
and for Christ sakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1419
01:36:35,672 --> 01:36:36,672
Roger that.

1420
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:38,714
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1421
01:36:40,047 --> 01:36:41,631
Look at this city.

1422
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,006
So beautiful.

1423
01:36:46,006 --> 01:36:48,672
It's become so peaceful.

1424
01:36:51,464 --> 01:36:52,797
I wish

1425
01:36:53,797 --> 01:36:56,047
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1426
01:36:56,547 --> 01:36:58,297
I have very sad news.

1427
01:36:58,464 --> 01:37:01,131
Despite our best efforts
to save him,

1428
01:37:01,422 --> 01:37:03,881
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1429
01:37:04,297 --> 01:37:05,589
Alex Murphy was...

1430
01:37:05,672 --> 01:37:06,881
Mr. Sellars.

1431
01:37:07,297 --> 01:37:08,881
What is it?
Mattox just called.

1432
01:37:09,464 --> 01:37:11,297
We need you to
come with us now.

1433
01:37:17,589 --> 01:37:19,381
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1434
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:21,506
What are you talking about?
We have a security situation here.

1435
01:37:21,589 --> 01:37:23,006
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1436
01:37:23,089 --> 01:37:24,964
Sir, there's a car outside
that's supposed to...

1437
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:26,672
That area is locked down.
Now go.

1438
01:37:26,756 --> 01:37:28,422
What's happening?
I said go! o

1439
01:37:28,756 --> 01:37:30,756
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

1440
01:37:33,672 --> 01:37:34,756
Mr. Sellars.

1441
01:37:34,922 --> 01:37:36,881
How close is that helicopter?
About 10 minutes, sir.

1442
01:37:54,714 --> 01:37:55,964
Yes?
Excuse me.

1443
01:37:56,131 --> 01:37:58,464
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1444
01:37:58,631 --> 01:37:59,839
It's an emergency.

1445
01:38:00,006 --> 01:38:01,631
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

1446
01:38:02,089 --> 01:38:03,797
Apparently there's a
Clara Murphy in the lobby.

1447
01:38:03,964 --> 01:38:07,297
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

1448
01:38:07,464 --> 01:38:09,797
What do you wanna do?
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1449
01:38:09,964 --> 01:38:11,047
Yes, sir.

1450
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:17,756
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

1451
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:19,964
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1452
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:22,756
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed. Clear?

1453
01:38:22,839 --> 01:38:23,839
Clear.
Clear.

1454
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:41,589
Hold it right there.

1455
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:43,589
Don't move.

1456
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:50,672
This is private property. You
are not authorized to be here!

1457
01:38:54,589 --> 01:38:56,922
I'd put those guns down now
if I were you.

1458
01:38:57,089 --> 01:38:58,756
Stand down.
All right, man, we're good.

1459
01:39:45,172 --> 01:39:46,506
Head to the lower level.

1460
01:39:48,131 --> 01:39:49,131
Hold up, hold up!

1461
01:39:49,256 --> 01:39:50,464
Ram it!

1462
01:40:50,672 --> 01:40:51,964
Gun it.

1463
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:55,006
Go, go, go! Now!

1464
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:12,464
Alex, run!

1465
01:41:13,297 --> 01:41:15,339
Omnicorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

1466
01:41:15,506 --> 01:41:17,422
Drop your weapon.

1467
01:41:17,589 --> 01:41:20,381
Keep your hands above your
head and no one will be harmed.

1468
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,756
What's going on?

1469
01:41:36,839 --> 01:41:39,089
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

1470
01:41:39,256 --> 01:41:41,756
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

1471
01:41:41,839 --> 01:41:43,964
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1472
01:41:44,047 --> 01:41:45,131
and he's shooting up
the building.

1473
01:41:45,214 --> 01:41:48,006
So we've gotta get you and
your son out of here right away.

1474
01:41:48,172 --> 01:41:49,714
I gotta take this call.

1475
01:41:51,006 --> 01:41:52,589
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

1476
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:54,214
Roger that, sir.

1477
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:57,672
Don't shoot. My robot.
You just flank. Got it.

1478
01:41:57,839 --> 01:41:59,089
Tin Man.

1479
01:42:01,839 --> 01:42:03,047
Tin Man.

1480
01:42:04,089 --> 01:42:05,339
Tin Man.

1481
01:42:05,922 --> 01:42:07,089
Oh, there it is.

1482
01:42:07,756 --> 01:42:09,131
You look like crap.

1483
01:42:11,756 --> 01:42:12,922
What's the matter?

1484
01:42:13,089 --> 01:42:14,297
Can't shoot?

1485
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:17,172
Huh?

1486
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:20,006
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1487
01:42:20,089 --> 01:42:21,089
You're a robot.

1488
01:42:21,297 --> 01:42:23,506
I'm a red asset.
Wrote that myself.

1489
01:42:23,964 --> 01:42:25,256
What do you think?

1490
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,506
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1491
01:42:28,672 --> 01:42:29,672
Pull it.

1492
01:42:30,464 --> 01:42:31,547
You can run.

1493
01:42:32,089 --> 01:42:33,089
Go on.

1494
01:42:33,339 --> 01:42:34,464
Run.

1495
01:42:34,922 --> 01:42:36,047
Run!

1496
01:42:36,381 --> 01:42:38,214
There you go. Run.

1497
01:42:38,672 --> 01:42:40,006
Run. Run!

1498
01:42:43,172 --> 01:42:44,589
Whoo!

1499
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:46,797
Stings like a bitch,
don't it?

1500
01:42:46,964 --> 01:42:50,256
Aren't you lucky I didn't
have my gun set to "kill"?

1501
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:52,839
Hey, listen.

1502
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:54,881
This isn't personal.

1503
01:42:55,922 --> 01:42:57,672
Well, maybe a little.

1504
01:42:59,422 --> 01:43:01,256
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1505
01:43:12,964 --> 01:43:14,422
Helicopter's approaching.

1506
01:43:14,506 --> 01:43:15,756
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1507
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:18,797
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you
and your son can get on first.

1508
01:43:24,214 --> 01:43:25,506
Officer down.

1509
01:43:25,589 --> 01:43:26,714
Mechanical room.

1510
01:43:26,797 --> 01:43:28,381
Omnicorp Building.

1511
01:43:28,547 --> 01:43:30,422
Roger that. EMS on the way.

1512
01:43:32,047 --> 01:43:33,631
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1513
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:34,964
It's nonfatal.

1514
01:43:35,047 --> 01:43:36,631
Go. Go.

1515
01:43:37,839 --> 01:43:40,631
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

1516
01:43:47,381 --> 01:43:48,381
What's that?

1517
01:43:50,297 --> 01:43:51,422
He's got a gun!
What?

1518
01:43:51,589 --> 01:43:52,589
Pull up! Pull up!

1519
01:43:57,547 --> 01:43:59,839
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1520
01:44:05,381 --> 01:44:06,381
Alex?

1521
01:44:06,547 --> 01:44:07,547
Dad?

1522
01:44:10,964 --> 01:44:12,381
Clara, David.

1523
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:14,547
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1524
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:15,631
Wait.

1525
01:44:16,714 --> 01:44:18,589
Get out of the way.
Alex, put down the gun.

1526
01:44:18,756 --> 01:44:20,839
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1527
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:24,089
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1528
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:25,922
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1529
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:32,131
Are you here to cuff me?
All right.

1530
01:44:32,922 --> 01:44:34,381
Go 'head, cuff me.

1531
01:44:35,589 --> 01:44:38,172
You can't. You're not
programmed that way.

1532
01:44:38,256 --> 01:44:39,756
If you go against
the program,

1533
01:44:39,839 --> 01:44:41,672
the entire system
shuts down, so.

1534
01:44:41,839 --> 01:44:43,922
You don't even have a
warrant. We'll overlook this little...

1535
01:44:44,089 --> 01:44:46,172
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your back.

1536
01:44:46,339 --> 01:44:47,339
I'm just from marketing.

1537
01:44:47,506 --> 01:44:49,839
Now!
Okay, yep, yep, yep. Yep.

1538
01:44:50,006 --> 01:44:52,172
Alex, we need to
work together here.

1539
01:44:52,339 --> 01:44:55,422
Because I'm the only one with
the technology to keep you alive.

1540
01:44:56,547 --> 01:44:58,172
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1541
01:45:04,297 --> 01:45:05,297
All right.

1542
01:45:05,464 --> 01:45:06,464
Weapon.

1543
01:45:08,131 --> 01:45:11,256
Alex, honestly,
I mean you no harm.

1544
01:45:11,422 --> 01:45:13,714
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.

1545
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:15,756
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1546
01:45:15,839 --> 01:45:17,672
Sellars, please! Don't!

1547
01:45:17,839 --> 01:45:20,381
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family

1548
01:45:21,714 --> 01:45:23,297
and I could just
kill them too.

1549
01:45:23,422 --> 01:45:25,089
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it

1550
01:45:25,172 --> 01:45:27,172
because, let's face it,

1551
01:45:27,797 --> 01:45:29,131
you're a robot.

1552
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:31,214
Do you understand that?

1553
01:45:35,464 --> 01:45:36,464
Alex.

1554
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:40,881
Dad!

1555
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:46,256
Baby.

1556
01:45:51,839 --> 01:45:52,922
Hey.

1557
01:45:54,547 --> 01:45:55,547
Hey.

1558
01:45:56,047 --> 01:45:58,047
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1559
01:45:59,006 --> 01:46:01,256
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1560
01:46:51,089 --> 01:46:52,839
How you feeling, Alex?

1561
01:46:54,756 --> 01:46:55,881
I'm ready.

1562
01:47:33,631 --> 01:47:35,006
He's ready.

1563
01:48:09,089 --> 01:48:10,256
There's still no word

1564
01:48:10,339 --> 01:48:13,339
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

1565
01:48:14,256 --> 01:48:18,006
And although the government
says they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1566
01:48:18,089 --> 01:48:20,797
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

1567
01:48:20,881 --> 01:48:25,422
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by cell phone

1568
01:48:25,506 --> 01:48:27,922
that shows
the people of Detroit

1569
01:48:28,006 --> 01:48:30,089
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

1570
01:48:30,172 --> 01:48:31,756
sooner than they think.

1571
01:48:33,797 --> 01:48:35,297
The real tragedy here

1572
01:48:35,381 --> 01:48:40,172
is that our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1573
01:48:41,547 --> 01:48:46,297
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

1574
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:49,839
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

1575
01:48:49,922 --> 01:48:53,672
I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.

1576
01:48:54,672 --> 01:48:57,589
But I do believe
my research program is sound.

1577
01:48:59,172 --> 01:49:00,422
What I did with it

1578
01:49:01,922 --> 01:49:02,964
was wrong.

1579
01:49:03,047 --> 01:49:06,047
The fact that this
mother...

1580
01:49:06,131 --> 01:49:09,381
Is not serving time
in some federal penitentiary

1581
01:49:09,464 --> 01:49:13,464
is a huge, hot, heaping
pile of horse...

1582
01:49:19,214 --> 01:49:23,589
Now I know some of you may think
that this kind of thinking is dangerous

1583
01:49:23,672 --> 01:49:27,672
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1584
01:49:27,839 --> 01:49:31,964
Some of you even believe that
the use of these drones overseas

1585
01:49:32,047 --> 01:49:36,714
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists

1586
01:49:36,797 --> 01:49:39,547
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1587
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:42,464
To you, I say...

1588
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:45,006
Stop whining!

1589
01:49:46,839 --> 01:49:49,464
America is now

1590
01:49:49,547 --> 01:49:51,839
and always will be

1591
01:49:51,922 --> 01:49:56,339
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1592
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:02,422
I'm Pat Novak.

1593
01:50:03,922 --> 01:50:05,172
Good night.

1594
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:15,297
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun

1595
01:50:15,381 --> 01:50:18,381
I fought the law
and the law won

1596
01:50:18,797 --> 01:50:21,589
I fought the law
and the law won

1597
01:50:21,672 --> 01:50:24,881
I needed the money
'cause I had none

1598
01:50:24,964 --> 01:50:27,922
I fought the law
and the law won

1599
01:50:28,006 --> 01:50:31,089
I fought the law
and the law won

1600
01:50:31,172 --> 01:50:34,297
I left my baby
and it feels so bad

1601
01:50:34,381 --> 01:50:37,006
I guess my race is run

1602
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,631
She's the best girl
that I ever had

1603
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:43,839
I fought the law
and the law won

1604
01:50:43,922 --> 01:50:46,589
I fought the law and the

1605
01:50:47,089 --> 01:50:50,256
Robbin' people with a six gun

1606
01:50:50,339 --> 01:50:53,381
I fought the law
and the law won

1607
01:50:53,464 --> 01:50:56,589
I fought the law
and the law won

1608
01:50:56,672 --> 01:50:59,756
I lost my girl
and I lost my fun

1609
01:50:59,839 --> 01:51:03,089
I fought the law
and the law won

1610
01:51:03,172 --> 01:51:06,006
I fought the law
and the law won

1611
01:51:06,089 --> 01:51:09,422
I left my baby
and it feels so bad

1612
01:51:09,506 --> 01:51:12,047
I guess my race is run

1613
01:51:12,547 --> 01:51:15,756
She's the best girl
that I ever had

1614
01:51:15,839 --> 01:51:18,797
I fought the law
and the law won

1615
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:21,089
I fought the law and the

1616
01:51:22,172 --> 01:51:25,172
I fought the law
and the law won

1617
01:51:25,256 --> 01:51:28,297
I fought the law
and the law won

1618
01:51:28,381 --> 01:51:31,589
I fought the law
and the law won

1619
01:51:31,672 --> 01:51:33,506
I fought the law and the...
