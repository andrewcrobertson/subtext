1
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
Hey, look over here.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Here! A few more.

3
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,640
What do we have here? Look at this.

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,120
This guy got a gold chain.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,840
He's alive!

6
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,480
Run!

7
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,480
Ah!

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
Stop right there! Hands up!

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
Don't think, just do it!

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,640
Get down, now! Down!

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,839
What'd I tell you, huh? Huh?

12
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Get up. Up!

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,559
Go.

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
Go!

15
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
The lawyer should be here any minute.

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,440
My friend, I never trusted
anybody in my whole life.

17
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,640
I hope I don't regret it
right now. You hold the deed.

18
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
C'mon.

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,119
John Ellis.

20
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,639
May the devil carry you away.

21
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,679
Yeah, he probably
would if you asked him,

22
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,999
considering all the business
you two've done together.

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,439
Unless there's some other
reason I keep getting older

24
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,799
- and you stay the same.
- Oh!

25
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,480
C'mere.

26
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,599
Is this a new one?

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,959
Well, this here's Django.

28
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,839
He only got to New
Babylon a little while ago.

29
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,239
Ah. You Mexican?

30
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,679
I'm French.

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
His mother was from Paris.

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,600
Well then, Paris... Come on in!

33
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,239
I thought I found all of
Barney's hiding places.

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,719
Even from beyond, he
never ceases to surprise.

35
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,559
I paid off all his debts and
managed to keep a little aside.

36
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,640
When this bottle's
finished, I'm heading west.

37
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,520
From what I hear, you
should do the same.

38
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
What'd you hear?

39
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,159
That you found oil underneath
that nothing town of yours,

40
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,919
and now everybody wants you dead.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,479
Yeah, that oil's our chance to
show the world who we really are.

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,079
All it does is give them one more chance

43
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,799
to finally wipe you out.

44
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,679
Well, we can defend ourselves just fine.

45
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,199
Our lawyer's coming here
to help sort this out.

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,879
He'll meet with the judge in Elmdale.

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,559
I've known you a long time.

48
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,999
I'm gonna give you
some unsolicited advice.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,599
Sell, tomorrow.

50
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,359
For the best price that you
can get and light a shuck.

51
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,319
Maybe, in a place where no one knows
you, what you wanna do is possible.

52
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,520
But not around here.

53
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,679
You got no place to walk
with your head held high

54
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,359
if all you've done is hang it at home.

55
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,040
What about you, Paris?

56
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,119
How'd you get in cahoots
with this stubborn old ass?

57
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,960
Still wondering about it.

58
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
Chin-chin.

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,920
Is that Gress?

60
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,600
John Ellis, it's Sheriff Boone.

61
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,840
How's your aim, Paris?

62
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,400
C'mon out, we know you're in there.

63
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,399
Let's think about this for a second.

64
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,759
He's looking for a reason to shoot
me dead and burn down our city.

65
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,559
- And I ain't gonna give him one.
- John!

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,559
If you don't come out by three,

67
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,999
we're gonna have to start shootin'.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,640
One... Two...

69
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
You keep that deed safe.

70
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Three...

71
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,559
Smart choice, Ellis.

72
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,239
Now, you come with us, hm?

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,559
You'll be seeing me
soon enough in court.

74
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,479
I'm just waiting for my lawyer
to come and work everything out.

75
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,039
Your lawyer is Martin
Gress, is that right?

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,079
Uh-huh.

77
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,120
Well, he was killed on the road
to San Antonio earlier today.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,280
Now I'm worried whoever killed
him might be comin' for you next.

79
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,199
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,599
And I'm here to ensure that you
make it to Elmdale safe and sound.

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,359
You pull that trigger,
he's gonna be dead for sure.

82
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,319
And once we're there,
we can make sure you have

83
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
proper representation.

84
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,839
All right. Just let
me get my things first.

85
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,119
I'll come with you.

86
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,919
Make sure your friend
knows he's invited too.

87
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,639
I saw two horses out back.

88
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,600
Unless you rode in here
with one ass cheek on each.

89
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,319
What do you idiots want?

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,439
Sorry to bother you at
this hour, Mrs. Bailey.

91
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,319
Not so sorry as to turn your ass around.

92
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,039
Well, it seems...

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,799
..Mr. Ellis

94
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,319
doesn't want to introduce
me to his companion.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,559
And I guess neither do you.

96
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,279
There's no one else here.

97
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,559
So, you won't mind if I...

98
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,559
..take a little look
back here, will you?

99
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,080
Doesn't seem to matter much what I mind.

100
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,280
There's no need to go rifling
through a dead man's things.

101
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,280
Well then, Mr. Ellis...

102
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,680
Shall we?

103
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,840
Paris...

104
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,599
Come on.

105
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,679
Barney owed a lot of
people a lot of money.

106
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
Sometimes they'd come lookin'.
What's your plan, Paris?

107
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,800
'Cause the Sheriff ain't exactly
got John's best interests at heart.

108
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,719
Can I borrow this?

109
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,039
Barney wore that when we got
hitched, it's fifty years old.

110
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,240
Well, it doesn't smell
one day over forty.

111
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,560
Paris!

112
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,799
I'll bring you back double.

113
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,280
That's what Barney used to say.

114
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,400
I brought you something
for John's trial tomorrow.

115
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,680
Go on, try it.

116
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,280
Let me help you.

117
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,360
If he's convicted, they'll kill him.

118
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,879
Will God forgive us?

119
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
There's nothing to forgive.

120
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
You're doing your father a favour.

121
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,520
Thanks to you, he will pay for his sins.

122
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,799
You are kidding me.

123
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Colonel Fourier.

124
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,280
Come on in.

125
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,599
Colonel Fourier, I'm sorry.

126
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,000
You had good intuition,
it just wasn't enough.

127
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,199
How's your leg?

128
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
It's fine, why? Is
something wrong with it?

129
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
Listen...

130
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,799
They're gonna take us to
Camp Hoffman in Maryland.

131
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,920
If we wanna see our families
again, we gotta escape on the way.

132
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,720
I already got a plan,
I just need your help.

133
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
Shh, shh.

134
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,840
Ah!

135
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
Stop right there.

136
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,599
What regiment you in?

137
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,879
I'm Captain Tanhill of First Maryland.

138
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
Show yourself.

139
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,559
What the hell are you doing out here?

140
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,439
Is it just you?

141
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,239
We're on patrol around Chambersburg,
checking for stragglers.

142
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,600
Put the goddamn gun down.

143
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,840
Well, we got two prisoners
we're taking to Camp Hoffman.

144
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,639
Guess you haven't heard.

145
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,359
General Sykes gave the order to,
uh, close the door on new prisoners.

146
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,679
Rations are scarce enough as it is.

147
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,119
We've been marching
'em for three days...

148
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,440
Those are Sykes's orders.

149
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,399
Well, what are we
supposed to do with 'em?

150
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
We can take care of them, if you prefer.

151
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,960
No, no, no... We got 'em.

152
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,640
As you wish.

153
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,000
To the Union.

154
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,200
Whatcha doin' in Elmdale?

155
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,719
You're here to try a case, right?

156
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,519
Sure.

157
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,719
A land dispute?

158
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,799
It's got something to do with you?

159
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,839
Well, kind of, my...

160
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,039
..my daughter is close to
the person being accused.

161
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,479
- Mr. John Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
He's a Negro.

163
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,039
Well, I am surprised you're
sticking your neck out,

164
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,960
given everything that happened.

165
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,319
He's not gonna last.

166
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,119
You're really gonna
waste morphine on him?

167
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,679
Shut up, I've made a decision,
okay? You listen to me.

168
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
All right, you're in charge.

169
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,759
How're you doing?

170
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,199
Be better with a drink in me.

171
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
You two, up.

172
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,719
He can't walk.

173
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
Then help him.

174
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,719
We got two days and some rough ground.

175
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,599
Once we get to Camp Hoffman, a
doctor will take care of that leg.

176
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,680
We're not going anywhere with you.

177
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,480
Here, it's morphine.
It'll help with the pain.

178
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Here.

179
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,159
Now, let your friend help you

180
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,119
or we'll drag your
ass all the way there.

181
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,760
C'mon now.

182
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,760
Ah!

183
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,079
We have to run away.

184
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,519
You heard what the captain said.

185
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,639
Sooner or later that
nigger will kill us.

186
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,399
We're running nowhere.

187
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,119
But you can. If you
get a chance, take it.

188
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not going to abandon you, sir.

189
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,919
From what I've read,

190
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,519
Mrs. Thurmann has a solid
case against Mr. Ellis.

191
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,280
No, it's based on a lie.

192
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,320
The deed to the property shows
Mr. Ellis is the rightful owner.

193
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,039
I'm not sure I understand.

194
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,479
You're saying this deed
was made out to a Negro?

195
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
Well, it's right here, black on white.

196
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,559
What are you really doing here?

197
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,479
I'm just trying to help a friend, sir.

198
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,599
- A friend, huh?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,879
- Mr. Ellis is your friend?
- Yes, sir.

200
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,359
What's the matter with you?

201
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,399
I thought you had some spine,
yet you come here and ask me

202
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,079
to side with that Negro?

203
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,519
Mr. Ellis is a good man, and honest.

204
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,879
Like anyone gives a shit.

205
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
You gotta take a side, Julian.

206
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,079
It's us against them.
The war's not over.

207
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes, it is, and we lost.

208
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,560
How's your colonel?

209
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
Great.

210
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,680
Can't you tell?

211
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,159
I don't want him to die.

212
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
Well, you shouldn't have shot him then.

213
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,960
It ain't personal.

214
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,439
You two are just in the way.

215
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,959
In the way of what?

216
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,200
Freedom.

217
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,800
I'm fighting for the right to exist.

218
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,479
And for the lives of
my brothers and sisters.

219
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,400
We're all fighting to survive.

220
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,400
No.

221
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,039
No, now you fightin' for that
fancy house on the top of the hill.

222
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,439
For your right to be called "master"

223
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,920
by the folks who built
everything you have

224
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,839
for nothing but scraps and beatings.

225
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,159
Well, you must take me for a rich man.

226
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,959
Well, you must take
yourself for a poor one.

227
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,079
I never owned a slave...

228
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,960
Because you thought it was sinful
or because you couldn't afford one?

229
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,360
It doesn't matter, you're
still fighting for it.

230
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,440
You put on that uniform,
that's your cause.

231
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Wanna know what my cause is?

232
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,679
I put on this uniform

233
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,159
because my family need
money to survive, that's it.

234
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,919
Should've put on mine then.

235
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,320
Yeah, maybe I should.

236
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,999
What were you hoping to accomplish here?

237
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Sir, we go back a long time, right?

238
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,039
And I was hoping you could
see things more clearly.

239
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,919
I do, old friend. It's you
that's missing the bigger picture.

240
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,559
Nah. The deed is right there,
you can see the truth yourself.

241
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,039
There are facts and
then there's the truth.

242
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,639
- Best not to confuse 'em.
- So, he's not getting a fair shake.

243
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
He's getting what he deserves,
just like the rest of us.

244
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,360
I was hoping it didn't come to this.

245
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,279
Are you serious?

246
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,439
I'm not gonna let you steal his land.

247
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,599
Doesn't belong to him even if
it does. Don't you get that?

248
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,399
Release him on bail tonight

249
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,159
and we'll never set
foot in Elmdale again.

250
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,120
Oh, my Lord. You really
don't know, do you?

251
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,439
You think John Ellis won't
put a bullet in your head

252
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,159
when he finds out what you did?

253
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,959
Well, it's been a long
time since the war and

254
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,439
I'm not just some reb soldier.

255
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not talking about who you are,
I'm talking about what you did.

256
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,520
You know why we're gonna win?

257
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,960
Because all men, all men, are
created equal in God's image.

258
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,879
And we're on the right side.

259
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,559
And the right side always wins.

260
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,120
You're a dreamer.

261
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
Who's been pissing
that stuff in your ear?

262
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,040
The man with the biggest heart and
the freest spirit I've ever known.

263
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
My father.

264
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,719
You know that Black
lieutenant, uh, who captured us?

265
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,959
You ever learn his name?

266
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,999
Andrew Ellis, son of John Ellis.

267
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
- You're lying.
- Huh.

268
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,319
No matter what you do for him
in this room, no matter how much

269
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,840
you help him, John Ellis
will never forgive you.

270
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,280
Put the gun down, son.

271
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,120
I won't hold it against you.

272
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,840
It's better now that
you know the truth, yes?

273
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
Hmm?

274
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,600
At the end of the day, there's
just us and there's them.

275
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,800
And you killed that boy
because you are one of us.

276
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,879
Lieutenant Ellis. We've
got to get rid of 'em.

277
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,999
I'm in trouble, not you, me.

278
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,079
You ready to go, Colonel?

279
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,039
When have I ever let you down?

280
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,360
Anything that goes wrong is on me.

281
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,520
Look out!

282
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,520
I have no more bullets.

283
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,519
Where's he gone? Where's he gone?!

284
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,000
Speak! Speak!

285
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,839
Please, please just go.

286
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,399
If you go south no one is going
to see you. I'll say you're dead.

287
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,639
Might as well kill you now.

288
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,119
No, no, no, no, please I'm
begging you. I have a family.

289
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,879
You let him live, he'll send
half the army to track us down.

290
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,999
No, no! Please, please,
I beg you to have mercy.

291
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,719
- You've got to finish it now!
- No!

292
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Fuck!

293
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,200
Another bad dream?

294
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,040
What do you want, Elizabeth?

295
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,880
That you atone for what you did to me.

296
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
A race to the village.

297
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
I didn't know it was him.

298
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,800
It wasn't my fault.

299
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
I just wanted to love ya.

300
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
Slowpoke.

301
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
Mama?

302
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,560
Who's John's father?

303
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,600
Goodbye, John.

304
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
Good morning, sir.

305
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,599
Do you need something?

306
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,999
I'm Peter Wilson, I'm the
counsellor for the defence.

307
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,439
I would like to file a petition
to release my client on bail.

308
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,239
The trial's starting in just
a few minutes, Mr. Wilson.

309
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,959
Your petition's a little late.

310
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm afraid that's not so, Mr...

311
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,319
McGee, Bexar County Clerk.

312
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,199
Mr. McGee, I ran into
the judge on my way here,

313
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
he told me to hand you this over.

314
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,719
You dirty, thieving bastard.

315
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,680
You thought you could get away...

316
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,799
Sheriff, please, release Mr. Ellis.

317
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,719
His bail's been paid and
the trial's been postponed

318
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,119
for at least three days.

319
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,639
If Judge Fourier's not back by then,
the county will appoint a new one.

320
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,560
Appoint a new one? Wh
what happened to the judge?

321
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,319
In the meantime, the defence's
counsel has submitted a new piece

322
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,759
of evidence to the court, which
will undergo a graphological analysis

323
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,399
to determine its veracity as
a legitimate deed of property,

324
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,079
belonging to Mr. John Ellis.

325
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,800
This is ridiculous.

326
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,039
No, Sheriff Boone.

327
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,600
What would be ridiculous is
holding a trial without a judge.

328
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,040
- Sheriff.
- You and I are done.

329
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,919
Trial's delayed

330
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,279
and Ellis is out on bail.

331
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,559
Judge Fourier took off
sometime last night.

332
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,319
I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothin'
I can do with the clerk here.

333
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,159
There's something else,
ma'am. A new piece of evidence.

334
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
They claim they have the authentic deed.

335
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
Go.

336
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
Now!

337
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,720
Now he'll kill us both.

338
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,599
So, it's over.

339
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,920
No.

340
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,999
I'm guessing the sheriff is
trying to trap us in the valley.

341
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
Let's take the high route. Come on.

342
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,480
Let Phillip know that Seymour is here.

343
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,480
Open the gate!

344
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
Hey!

345
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,160
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Setting us free.

346
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,040
I tried everything to open your eyes,

347
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,560
but you don't wanna see.

348
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,559
So I'm making the decision for us.

349
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,119
What are you talking about?

350
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,999
Seymour, put that down,
you'll burn it all...

351
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,880
All of what? There's nothing here.

352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,520
There never was, just a shallow
well in the middle of nowhere!

353
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,799
And after it's gone, we'll
still be left with the only thing

354
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,759
we ever had: Father's empty promises.

355
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,279
It's not an empty promise.

356
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,319
There's still hope
for us. For all of us!

357
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,279
In Elmdale, you can all have a roof
over your heads and an honest job.

358
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,319
You'll have someone looking out for you,

359
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,919
not busy painting targets on your backs.

360
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,760
I, Seymour Abel Ellis,

361
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,159
swear to protect you and guide you

362
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,120
until my last breath.

363
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,999
All that's required is
that you submit to the Lord

364
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,559
our father has denied for too long.

365
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,679
You'll live as free men, and women,

366
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,800
and be treated fairly, you have my word.

367
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,399
- Hey!
- Enough!

368
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,280
No one's getting shot tonight.

369
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,360
If this is what you want...

370
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,640
If this is what you think is right,

371
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,159
then do what you have to do.

372
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,280
Sarah.

373
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,240
But I was born with this
city and I will die with it.

374
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,840
So if it burns... I'll burn first.

375
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,560
You got any kids?

376
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,519
No, I don't.

377
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,479
Two things I learned about having kids.

378
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,679
First, you're terrified
for them all the time.

379
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,640
It starts the moment they enter the
world, then doesn't never let up.

380
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,719
What's the second?

381
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,600
When you lose a child, you realise
you weren't nearly terrified enough.

382
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,040
It doesn't make you a better
person, it makes you worse.

383
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,640
You learn things about yourself
you didn't really wanna know.

384
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
You know, since you showed up

385
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,920
I kinda feel like a part of
Andrew has come back home.

386
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,999
Fan out in groups of two.

387
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,920
They can't have got far.

388
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,560
You his captain?

389
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,039
We followed him and three
stragglers, a few days ago.

390
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,799
They had two prisoners in grey jackets,

391
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,959
they were escorting
them to Camp Hoffman.

392
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,079
Shots went off, we double backed.

393
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,880
Came back here and found that one
there and the other three up there.

394
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,440
You know who they were?

395
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
No.

396
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,840
Captain...

397
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,760
This will have been left
by one of the prisoners.
