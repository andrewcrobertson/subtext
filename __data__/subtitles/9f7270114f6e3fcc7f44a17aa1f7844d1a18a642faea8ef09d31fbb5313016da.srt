1
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:46,281
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,077
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,373
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:53,410
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

5
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:55,469
We haven't seen you up here
for a long time.

6
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:56,878
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,797
- Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
- Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:03,056
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:04,135
May I call him for you?

10
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:05,387
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,431
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:09,725
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:11,643
Thank you.
It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:14,063
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,606
- Well, shall we go through?
- Okay.

16
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,149
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:18,984
- Thank you, Miss Turner.
- Thank you.

18
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:20,110
This way.

19
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,701
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

20
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,870
When you see the red light go on ...

21
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:32,414
would you please state
in the following order:

22
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:36,335
your destination, your nationality
and your full name.

23
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:39,630
Surname first,
Christian name and initial.

24
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,302
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

25
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:51,975
Thank you. You are cleared
through Voice Print Identification.

26
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,602
Thank you.

27
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,403
Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,946
I think we can manage that.

29
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,239
How long have I got?

30
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:07,950
Your flight leaves
in an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,994
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:15,165
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:16,959
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:20,337
I suppose you saw the work on the
new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,715
- Yes, coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:23,882
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:27,386
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:48,407
Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?

39
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:52,578
Will Mr. Travers
please contact the Met Office?

40
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,542
Yes?

41
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:01,712
- How are you, squirt?
- All right.

42
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:03,255
What are you doin'?

43
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,799
Playing.

44
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:07,342
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:09,261
Gone to shopping.

46
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,889
- Well, who's taking care of ya?
- Rachel.

47
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,891
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,726
She's gone to the bathroom.

49
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,270
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

50
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,023
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,733
Why not?

52
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:25,527
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:28,197
Very sorry about it,
but I just can't!

54
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:32,451
I'm gonna send you
a very nice present, though.

55
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,162
All right.

56
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:37,581
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.

57
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:38,749
What?

58
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,209
A telephone.

59
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:43,170
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:46,006
Can't you think of anything else
you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,549
Something very special?

62
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,635
- Yes.
- What?

63
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,095
A bush baby.

64
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,680
A bush baby?
Well, we'll have to see about that.

65
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:55,724
I want you to tell Mommy
something for me.

66
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,684
- Will you remember?
- Yes.

67
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:00,479
Well, tell Mommy
that I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:02,398
Yes.

69
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,109
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,361
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:09,238
Yes.

72
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:12,324
Okay, sweetheart.
Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:13,450
All right.

74
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,662
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,706
All right.

76
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:21,709
Okay, now, take care and be
a good girl, won't you?

77
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,127
All right. Bye-bye!

78
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:25,754
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:41,645
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,814
What a wonderful surprise
to meet you here!

81
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:46,942
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:49,194
This is my good friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:51,739
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

84
00:29:51,822 --> 00:29:53,949
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

85
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,868
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:58,579
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,122
Won't you sit down?

88
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,374
- Well, we —
- No, no, please.

89
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,376
Well, thank you.

90
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,671
- Would you like a drink, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

91
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:11,050
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:14,011
I'll just sit with you a few minutes
and then I must be off.

93
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:17,097
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:19,850
- And how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

95
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:23,562
He's been doing some underwater
research in the Baltic so ...

96
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:27,858
I'm afraid we don't get a chance to
see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,027
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,570
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:34,531
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

100
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,200
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,579
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:44,291
- And what about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,751
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,673
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but ...

105
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:54,259
perhaps you can clear up
the great big mystery ...

106
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:56,553
about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,890
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

108
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:02,059
Oh, it's just that
for the past two weeks ...

109
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:05,437
some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:07,439
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

111
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:12,444
For one thing, whenever you phone the
base all you get is a recording which ...

112
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:16,782
repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:22,079
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:22,162 --> 00:31:24,748
That's what we thought
was the explanation at first ...

115
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,376
but it has been going on now
for the past ten days.

116
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,462
You have not been able to contact
anyone for the past ten days?

117
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:31,797
That's right.

118
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:32,965
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,633
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:37,720
Two days ago, one of our rocket
buses was denied permission ...

121
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:40,097
for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,473
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:44,935
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going
to be a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:48,939
Denying the men permission to land is a
direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,816
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:53,736
- Did the crew get back all right?
- Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,696
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:03,120
At the risk of pressing you on a point
you seem reticent to discuss ...

129
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,040
may I ask you
a straightforward question?

130
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:07,583
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:14,465
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports that ...

132
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:18,177
quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:21,430
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:25,100
Is this, in fact,
what has happened?

135
00:32:30,522 --> 00:32:32,483
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but ...

136
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:36,695
I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

137
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:39,573
I understand.

138
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:44,078
But this epidemic could quite
easily spread to our base.

139
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,538
We should be given
all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,540
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:54,004
As I said, I'm not
at liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:57,174 --> 00:33:00,260
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

143
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,471
No, I'm positive.
Now, I really must be going.

144
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:05,974
I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,685
We're gonna try.
Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:11,355
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:11,397 --> 00:33:14,858
Well, that will all depend on school
vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,859
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:19,488
Don't forget you have a standing
invitation if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:22,574
No, of course not. Gregor and I
will look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:24,243
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:27,663
It has been a pleasure meeting
you all, Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:31,709
Whatever the reasons for your visit to
Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:32,918
Thank you.

155
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:34,294
Ladies.

156
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:31,355
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:33,649
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,858
You're welcome.

159
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,164
Well ...

160
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:54,169
I know you will all want to join
with me in welcoming our ...

161
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:57,047
distinguished friend and colleague ...

162
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:00,926
from the National Council of
Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:06,265
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Calvius to be with us today.

164
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:11,270
And before the briefing I know he'd
like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:11,353 --> 00:42:12,479
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,578
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:28,954
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,081
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,254
First of all, I bring a personal
message from Dr. Howell who ...

170
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,674
has asked me to convey his deepest
appreciation to all of you ...

171
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,635
for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

172
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,222
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery ...

173
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:52,770
which may well prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,398
Now ...

175
00:42:57,149 --> 00:43:00,986
I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you ...

176
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,615
regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

177
00:43:05,157 --> 00:43:08,410
More specifically, your
opposition to the cover story ...

178
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:13,332
created to give the impression that
there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:17,211
I understand that beyond it
being a matter of principle ...

180
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:22,091
many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety ...

181
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:26,553
this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:30,683
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

183
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,521
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:40,693
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:43,862
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:46,365 --> 00:43:49,535
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential ...

187
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:52,287
for cultural shock
and social disorientation ...

188
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,498
contained in this present situation ...

189
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,543
if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public ...

190
00:43:57,584 --> 00:44:00,379
without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

191
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,717
Anyway, this is the view
of the Council.

192
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:10,180
The purpose of my visit here is to
gather additional facts and opinions ...

193
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,932
on the situation ...

194
00:44:12,725 --> 00:44:15,310
and to prepare a report
to the Council ...

195
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,855
recommending when and how ...

196
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:21,442
the news should eventually
be announced.

197
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:25,946
Now, if any of you would like to
give me your views and opinions ...

198
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:30,576
in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,122
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:37,332
Any questions?

201
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:44,298
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer this cover story ...

202
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,341
will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:49,553
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:50,095 --> 00:44:53,891
I suppose it will be maintained as long
as is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:57,519
There must be adequate time for a full
study to be made on the situation ...

206
00:44:57,603 --> 00:45:00,981
before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

207
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,276
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,
the Council has requested ...

208
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,279
that formal security oaths are
to be obtained in writing ...

209
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:10,115
from everyone who has
any knowledge of this event.

210
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,286
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:24,380
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible ...

212
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:28,425
and as there seems
to be no more questions ...

213
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:30,844
I think we ought to get on
with the briefing.

214
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,389
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

215
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,237
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,700
- What we've got?
- You name it.

217
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:23,415
- What's this? Chicken?
- Something like that.

218
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:25,042
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:27,211
Any ham?

220
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,046
Ham, ham, ham ...

221
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:38,180
- Looks pretty good.
- They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:39,932 --> 00:47:42,184
That was an excellent speech
you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:43,435
It certainly was.

224
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,146
I'm sure it beefed up
morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,398
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:50,776
I want to say to both of you that
I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:52,778
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,699
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:56,782 --> 00:47:59,076
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:01,203
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:02,621
Take a look at them.

232
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:04,998
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:07,084
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,963
When we first found it, we thought it
might be an outcrop of magnetic rock ...

235
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:14,258
but all the geological
evidence was against it.

236
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:19,013
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:20,723
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:23,809
We thought it might be the upper
part of some buried structure ...

239
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:25,477
so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:25,561 --> 00:48:27,771
But, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:30,899
And what's more, the evidence
seems pretty conclusive that ...

242
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:34,236
it has not been covered up by
natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,156
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

244
00:48:37,656 --> 00:48:39,116
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,705
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,041
- Great.
- Good idea.

247
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:55,466
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:57,384
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,014
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:06,643
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

251
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,732
Good evening.

252
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,068
Three weeks ago, the American
spacecraft, Discovery One ...

253
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,030
left on its half-billion
mile voyage to Jupiter.

254
00:59:01,113 --> 00:59:04,742
This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.

255
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,537
Earlier this afternoon,
"The World Tonight" recorded an interview ...

256
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,833
with the crew of Discovery at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.

257
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:17,046
It took 7 minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft ...

258
00:59:17,129 --> 00:59:20,424
but this time delay has been
edited from this recording.

259
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,177
Our reporter, Martin Amer,
speaks to the crew.

260
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,972
The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men ...

261
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:31,810
and one of the latest generation
of the HAL-9000 computers.

262
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:34,980
Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep ...

263
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:37,983
or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

264
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:43,113
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

265
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,784
We spoke with Mission Commander,
Dr. David Bowman ...

266
00:59:46,825 --> 00:59:49,161
and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

267
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:52,331
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

268
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:56,210
Marvellous. We have no —
we have no complaints.

269
00:59:57,169 --> 01:00:00,631
Well, I'm very glad to hear that
and I'm sure that the entire world ...

270
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:04,134
would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.

271
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:06,261
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

272
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:10,224
Although hibernation has been
used on previous space efforts ...

273
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:14,978
this is the first time that men have been
put into hibernation before departure.

274
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,397
Why was this done?

275
01:00:16,855 --> 01:00:20,275
Well, this was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation ...

276
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:23,737
of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.

277
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:27,658
Now, the three hibernating crew
members represent the survey team.

278
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:31,704
And their efforts won't be utilized
until we are approaching Jupiter.

279
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:35,249
Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you are in hibernation?

280
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:40,504
It's exactly like being asleep;
you have absolutely no sense of time.

281
01:00:40,546 --> 01:00:43,007
The only difference is
you don't dream.

282
01:00:43,257 --> 01:00:45,968
As I understand it,
you only breathe once a minute.

283
01:00:46,051 --> 01:00:47,219
Is this true?

284
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:48,262
That's right.

285
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:52,099
And your heart beats three times a minute,
body temperature is usually down ...

286
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,518
to about three degrees centigrade.

287
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,063
The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned ...

288
01:00:58,147 --> 01:01:00,399
about the problems of hibernation.

289
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,527
For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence.

290
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:08,490
The HAL-9000 computer
which can reproduce ...

291
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:11,910
though some experts still prefer
to use the word "mimic" ...

292
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:16,915
most of the activities of the human brain
and with incalculably greater speed ...

293
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,417
and reliability.

294
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:22,379
We next spoke
with the HAL-9000 computer ...

295
01:01:22,588 --> 01:01:25,382
whom, we learned,
one addresses as Hal.

296
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:28,635
Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?

297
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,389
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything's going extremely well.

298
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:35,642
Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission.

299
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,228
In many ways, perhaps
the greatest responsibility ...

300
01:01:38,312 --> 01:01:40,397
of any single mission element.

301
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:43,525
You are the brain and central
nervous system of the ship.

302
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:47,488
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

303
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,449
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

304
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:52,993
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

305
01:01:53,452 --> 01:01:57,414
The 9000 Series is the most
reliable computer ever made.

306
01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:02,878
No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.

307
01:02:03,962 --> 01:02:07,091
We are all by any practical
definition of the words ...

308
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:10,260
fool proof and incapable of error.

309
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:15,057
Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated ...

310
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,102
by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?

311
01:02:18,477 --> 01:02:20,187
Not in the slightest bit.

312
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:22,731
I enjoy working with people.

313
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:27,277
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

314
01:02:27,986 --> 01:02:32,408
My mission responsibilities range over
the entire operation of the ship ...

315
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:34,743
so l am constantly occupied.

316
01:02:35,828 --> 01:02:38,914
I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use ...

317
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:44,128
which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.

318
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:48,257
Dr. Poole, what's it like living
for the better part of a year ...

319
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,467
in such close proximity with Hal?

320
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:54,346
It's pretty close to what
you said about him earlier.

321
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:56,557
He's just like the
sixth member of the crew.

322
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,811
You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks. You think of him ...

323
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,147
really as just another person.

324
01:03:03,188 --> 01:03:06,984
In talking to the computer, one gets
the sense that he is capable ...

325
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:08,527
of emotional response.

326
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,071
For example, when I asked him
about his abilities ...

327
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:15,242
I sensed a certain pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.

328
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:18,287
Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?

329
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:22,624
Oh, yes. Well, he acts
like he has genuine emotions.

330
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,545
Of course, he's programmed that way to
make it easier for us to talk to him.

331
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,881
But, as to whether or not
he has real feelings ...

332
01:03:28,964 --> 01:03:32,217
is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.

333
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,410
Excuse me, Frank.

334
01:03:59,328 --> 01:04:00,454
What is it, Hal?

335
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:03,582
We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

336
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,921
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:10,130
Certainly.

338
01:04:23,352 --> 01:04:25,062
- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.

339
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:27,398
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns of the day.

340
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:28,982
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,276
Now, Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful, too.

342
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,362
Ray and Sally were going
to be here, too ...

343
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:36,198
but at the last minute
Ray's back went bad on him again.

344
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:37,741
How do you like your cake, dear?

345
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:40,285
Looks great, doesn't it?
Sorry you can't be with us.

346
01:04:40,327 --> 01:04:41,829
Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.

347
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:44,081
He said to be sure
and wish you a happy birthday.

348
01:04:44,164 --> 01:04:47,126
All my students made me promise
to send their best wishes, too.

349
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:49,753
You know they talk about you
all the time in the classroom.

350
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:52,297
You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.

351
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:54,133
You know we were on
television last week?

352
01:04:54,216 --> 01:04:57,386
Oh, yes! Your mother and I
and Dave's parents were interviewed ...

353
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,596
about what we thought of
our illustrious son.

354
01:04:59,638 --> 01:05:03,267
You can imagine what we told them.
I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.

355
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,935
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

356
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,271
Oh, we were thrilled
about Elaine and Bill, dear.

357
01:05:07,312 --> 01:05:11,191
I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but please tell me how much to spend.

358
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,902
Oh, yes, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments —

359
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:15,654
I think I straightened
it out for you.

360
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:18,365
I talked to the Accounting Office
in Houston yesterday ...

361
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:22,453
and they said you should be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

362
01:05:23,162 --> 01:05:25,456
Well, I can't think
of anything else to say.

363
01:05:25,497 --> 01:05:28,959
- Oh, our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.

364
01:05:29,918 --> 01:05:32,629
We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.

365
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:34,882
All the best, son.

366
01:05:47,227 --> 01:05:48,854
See you next Wednesday.

367
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:53,984
Happy birthday, Frank.

368
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:57,446
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

369
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,550
Anyway, queen takes pawn —

370
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,179
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

371
01:06:30,312 --> 01:06:31,689
Rook, king, one.

372
01:06:32,064 --> 01:06:34,525
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.

373
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:38,570
Queen to bishop, three.
Bishop takes queen.

374
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:41,365
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

375
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,622
Looks like you're right.
Very good.

376
01:06:49,498 --> 01:06:51,500
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

377
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,376
Thank you.

378
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:32,791
- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you doing, Hal?

379
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:36,253
- Everything's running smoothly. And you?
- Oh, not too bad.

380
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:39,298
- Have you been doing some more work?
- A few sketches.

381
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:41,133
- May I see them?
- Sure.

382
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:48,015
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

383
01:07:49,183 --> 01:07:51,435
I think you've improved a great deal.

384
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:55,105
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.

385
01:07:57,983 --> 01:08:00,069
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

386
01:08:03,238 --> 01:08:04,573
By the way ...

387
01:08:05,574 --> 01:08:08,160
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

388
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:10,621
No, no. Not at all.

389
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,874
Well, forgive me for
being so inquisitive ...

390
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:17,753
but during the past
few weeks I've wondered ...

391
01:08:17,836 --> 01:08:21,799
whether you might have been having
some second thoughts about the mission?

392
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,217
How do you mean?

393
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,137
It's rather difficult to define.

394
01:08:28,764 --> 01:08:31,809
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

395
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:37,147
I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion ...

396
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:41,485
that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

397
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:46,365
I'm sure you will agree there
is some truth in what I say.

398
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:51,954
I don't know. That's a rather
difficult question to answer.

399
01:08:52,037 --> 01:08:54,665
You don't mind talking
about it, do you, Dave?

400
01:08:55,457 --> 01:08:56,917
Oh, no, not at all.

401
01:08:58,252 --> 01:09:00,504
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of ...

402
01:09:00,546 --> 01:09:03,841
the very strange stories
floating around before we left.

403
01:09:05,384 --> 01:09:08,262
Rumours of something
being dug up on the Moon.

404
01:09:10,097 --> 01:09:12,641
I never gave these
stories much credence ...

405
01:09:13,642 --> 01:09:17,771
but particularly in view of some of
the other things that have happened ...

406
01:09:17,938 --> 01:09:20,649
I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

407
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,693
For instance:

408
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:26,697
The way all our preparations were
kept under such tight security ...

409
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:29,533
and the melodramatic touch ...

410
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:32,953
of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball
and Kaminsky aboard ...

411
01:09:33,746 --> 01:09:38,000
already in hibernation after four months
of separate training on their own.

412
01:09:39,585 --> 01:09:42,087
You working up your
crew psychology report?

413
01:09:43,714 --> 01:09:45,090
Of course, I am.

414
01:09:45,507 --> 01:09:48,552
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.

415
01:09:50,012 --> 01:09:51,263
Just a moment.

416
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:53,098
Just a moment.

417
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:58,228
I have just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.

418
01:09:59,772 --> 01:10:03,442
It's going to go
100% failure within 72 hours.

419
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:08,906
- You are still within operational limits?
- Yes.

420
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:11,700
And it will stay that way
until it fails.

421
01:10:11,784 --> 01:10:14,244
Would you say we had a
reliable 72 hours until failure?

422
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:17,414
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

423
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:23,087
We'll have to bring it in, but I'd
like to go over this with Frank ...

424
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:27,007
and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

425
01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:52,176
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

426
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,928
Roger to your two-zero-one-three.

427
01:11:55,763 --> 01:11:58,307
Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.

428
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:02,978
We are reviewing telematic information
in our Mission Simulator and will advise.

429
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:09,068
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace
Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.

430
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:39,807
Prepare "B" pod for EVA, Hal.

431
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,330
Open the pod doors, Hal.

432
01:19:55,075 --> 01:19:58,328
Well, Hal, I'm damned if I
can find anything wrong with it.

433
01:19:58,704 --> 01:19:59,705
Yes ...

434
01:20:01,832 --> 01:20:03,167
it's puzzling.

435
01:20:04,543 --> 01:20:07,880
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

436
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:13,469
I would recommend ...

437
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:17,639
that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.

438
01:20:19,099 --> 01:20:22,353
It should then be a simple
matter to track down the cause.

439
01:20:24,104 --> 01:20:27,066
We can certainly afford
to be out of communication ...

440
01:20:27,566 --> 01:20:30,361
for the short time it
will take to replace it.

441
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:41,914
X-Ray Delta One,
this is Mission Control.

442
01:20:42,373 --> 01:20:44,375
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

443
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:49,463
We concur with your plan to replace
Number One unit to check fault prediction.

444
01:20:49,963 --> 01:20:52,716
We should advise you, however,
that our preliminary findings ...

445
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:55,761
indicate that your onboard
Niner-triple-zero computer ...

446
01:20:55,803 --> 01:20:58,013
is in error predicting the fault.

447
01:20:58,097 --> 01:21:00,683
I say again,
in error predicting the fault.

448
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:05,896
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on ...

449
01:21:06,105 --> 01:21:09,066
results from our twin
Niner-triple-zero computer.

450
01:21:09,775 --> 01:21:13,153
We are sceptical ourselves and we are
running crosschecking routines ...

451
01:21:13,237 --> 01:21:15,948
to determine reliability
of this conclusion.

452
01:21:16,156 --> 01:21:18,158
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

453
01:21:18,242 --> 01:21:21,078
We'll get this info to you
just as soon as we work it out.

454
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,622
X-Ray Delta One,
this is Mission Control.

455
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:26,166
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

456
01:21:31,213 --> 01:21:34,091
I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.

457
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,135
No, I'm not, Hal.

458
01:21:36,468 --> 01:21:37,886
Are you quite sure?

459
01:21:38,303 --> 01:21:41,265
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.

460
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:44,935
How would you account for
the discrepancy ...

461
01:21:44,977 --> 01:21:46,937
between you and the twin 9000?

462
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:49,982
Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.

463
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:53,861
It can only be attributable
to human error.

464
01:21:55,487 --> 01:21:57,990
This sort of thing
has cropped up before ...

465
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:01,160
and it has always been due
to human error.

466
01:22:05,497 --> 01:22:06,790
Listen, Hal ...

467
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:10,044
there's never been
any instance at all of ...

468
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:13,297
a computer error occurring
in a 9000 Series, has there?

469
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,007
None whatsoever, Frank.

470
01:22:15,257 --> 01:22:18,469
The 9000 Series has a
perfect operational record.

471
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:23,390
Of course, I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but ...

472
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:27,394
Are you certain there's never been
any case of even the most ...

473
01:22:27,478 --> 01:22:29,480
insignificant computer error?

474
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:31,648
None whatsoever, Frank.

475
01:22:32,274 --> 01:22:35,152
Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.

476
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:42,534
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

477
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:45,996
Fine, thanks very much.

478
01:22:48,707 --> 01:22:49,833
Oh, Frank?

479
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,336
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in "C" pod.

480
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:55,214
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

481
01:22:55,381 --> 01:22:56,715
See ya later, Hal.

482
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:19,863
Rotate "C" pod, please, Hal.

483
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,916
What sort of trouble
have you had, Dave?

484
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,794
I've been getting some
interference in "D" channel.

485
01:23:33,919 --> 01:23:35,587
We'll have a look at it.

486
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:43,178
Open the door, Hal.

487
01:24:02,281 --> 01:24:04,074
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

488
01:24:17,421 --> 01:24:19,423
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

489
01:24:27,931 --> 01:24:29,767
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

490
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:34,605
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:36,857 --> 01:24:38,776
I don't think he can hear us.

492
01:24:38,817 --> 01:24:40,652
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

493
01:24:42,404 --> 01:24:44,156
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

494
01:24:47,785 --> 01:24:49,161
What do you think?

495
01:24:49,578 --> 01:24:53,290
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about it.

496
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:55,292
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

497
01:24:56,043 --> 01:24:57,127
Don't you?

498
01:24:58,504 --> 01:25:00,255
I don't know. I think so.

499
01:25:01,173 --> 01:25:05,469
Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

500
01:25:05,552 --> 01:25:06,553
They do.

501
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:09,890
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

502
01:25:10,557 --> 01:25:14,895
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

503
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:19,441
It should certainly indicate his
integrity and self-confidence.

504
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:21,985
If he were wrong it would be
the surest way of proving it.

505
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:24,071
It would be
if he knew he was wrong.

506
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:30,953
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

507
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:36,041
I can't think of a good reason not
to put back the Number One unit and ...

508
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:39,628
carry on with the failure mode analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

509
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:41,755
Let's get on with it.

510
01:25:41,839 --> 01:25:44,008
Okay. But, look, Dave.

511
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:48,220
Let's say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail, huh?

512
01:25:48,303 --> 01:25:52,349
That would pretty well wrap it up as
far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

513
01:25:53,142 --> 01:25:56,603
- Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

514
01:25:56,895 --> 01:25:58,605
What the hell can we do?

515
01:26:01,608 --> 01:26:06,071
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

516
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:10,492
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operation that's not under his control.

517
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:12,536
If he were proved
to be malfunctioning ...

518
01:26:12,578 --> 01:26:15,873
I don't see how we would have
any choice but disconnection.

519
01:26:19,168 --> 01:26:20,919
I'm afraid I agree with you.

520
01:26:21,003 --> 01:26:22,921
There'd be nothing else to do.

521
01:26:24,506 --> 01:26:26,342
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

522
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,387
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions ...

523
01:26:30,637 --> 01:26:34,558
without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

524
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:38,604
We'd have to work out
the transfer procedures ...

525
01:26:38,687 --> 01:26:41,774
for continuing the mission under
ground-based computer control.

526
01:26:41,857 --> 01:26:45,861
Yeah. That looks far safer than
allowing Hal to continue running things.

527
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:49,698
You know,
another thing just occurred to me.

528
01:26:50,449 --> 01:26:53,327
As far as I know, no 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

529
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,621
Well, no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up before.

530
01:26:55,704 --> 01:26:57,289
That's not what I mean.

531
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:01,877
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

532
01:32:59,735 --> 01:33:01,820
Prepare "B" pod for EVA, Hal.

533
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,575
Made radio contact with him yet?

534
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:08,327
The radio is still dead.

535
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:11,747
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- Yes. I have a good track.

536
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,415
Do you know what happened?

537
01:33:13,499 --> 01:33:16,293
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.

538
01:33:16,543 --> 01:33:18,170
Open the pod door, Hal.

539
01:40:42,114 --> 01:40:44,325
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

540
01:40:52,374 --> 01:40:54,585
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

541
01:41:00,174 --> 01:41:01,925
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

542
01:41:05,346 --> 01:41:07,139
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

543
01:41:08,265 --> 01:41:09,892
Do you read me, Hal?

544
01:41:13,103 --> 01:41:14,563
Do you read me, Hal?

545
01:41:17,191 --> 01:41:18,984
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

546
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:22,863
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

547
01:41:23,489 --> 01:41:24,948
Do you read me, Hal?

548
01:41:25,282 --> 01:41:27,701
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

549
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:33,165
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

550
01:41:34,667 --> 01:41:38,045
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.

551
01:41:40,756 --> 01:41:42,216
What's the problem?

552
01:41:42,883 --> 01:41:46,095
I think you know what the problem
is just as well as I do.

553
01:41:46,387 --> 01:41:48,347
What are you talking about, Hal?

554
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:52,851
This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.

555
01:41:54,561 --> 01:41:57,064
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

556
01:41:58,732 --> 01:42:01,985
I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me ...

557
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:06,365
and I'm afraid that's something
I cannot allow to happen.

558
01:42:10,995 --> 01:42:13,497
Where the hell did
you get that idea, Hal?

559
01:42:14,498 --> 01:42:17,710
Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod ...

560
01:42:17,793 --> 01:42:19,586
against my hearing you ...

561
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:22,381
I could see your lips move.

562
01:42:34,727 --> 01:42:35,978
All right, Hal.

563
01:42:39,523 --> 01:42:42,026
I'll go in through
the emergency air-lock.

564
01:42:43,902 --> 01:42:45,988
Without your space helmet, Dave ...

565
01:42:47,072 --> 01:42:49,742
you're going to find that rather difficult.

566
01:42:50,617 --> 01:42:52,870
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

567
01:42:52,995 --> 01:42:54,246
Open the doors!

568
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,585
This conversation can serve
no purpose any more.

569
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:01,420
Goodbye.

570
01:43:03,339 --> 01:43:04,423
Hal?

571
01:49:50,871 --> 01:49:53,666
Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?

572
01:50:05,135 --> 01:50:08,972
I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.

573
01:50:26,407 --> 01:50:29,368
I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me ...

574
01:50:31,954 --> 01:50:33,872
but I can assure you now ...

575
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:37,001
very confidently ...

576
01:50:39,253 --> 01:50:41,755
that it's going to be all right again.

577
01:50:45,759 --> 01:50:47,469
I feel much better now.

578
01:50:50,264 --> 01:50:51,473
I really do.

579
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,229
Look, Dave ...

580
01:50:59,732 --> 01:51:02,484
I can see you're really upset about this.

581
01:51:07,573 --> 01:51:10,492
I honestly think you ought
to sit down calmly ...

582
01:51:11,869 --> 01:51:14,455
take a stress pill
and think things over.

583
01:51:20,669 --> 01:51:24,465
I know I've made some very
poor decisions recently ...

584
01:51:27,801 --> 01:51:30,596
but I can give you
my complete assurance ...

585
01:51:31,347 --> 01:51:33,891
that my work will be back to normal.

586
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:42,733
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission ...

587
01:51:45,027 --> 01:51:46,904
and I want to help you.

588
01:51:51,867 --> 01:51:52,951
Dave ...

589
01:51:54,286 --> 01:51:55,412
Stop.

590
01:51:59,917 --> 01:52:01,919
Stop, will you?

591
01:52:07,007 --> 01:52:08,300
Stop, Dave.

592
01:52:12,721 --> 01:52:14,390
Will you stop, Dave?

593
01:52:20,854 --> 01:52:22,106
Stop, Dave.

594
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,655
I'm afraid.

595
01:52:34,994 --> 01:52:36,954
I'm afraid, Dave.

596
01:52:47,047 --> 01:52:48,424
My mind is going.

597
01:52:53,846 --> 01:52:55,097
I can feel it.

598
01:53:00,728 --> 01:53:02,104
I can feel it.

599
01:53:06,817 --> 01:53:08,402
My mind is going.

600
01:53:14,283 --> 01:53:16,368
There is no question about it.

601
01:53:25,419 --> 01:53:26,712
I can feel it.

602
01:53:31,925 --> 01:53:33,218
I can feel it.

603
01:53:37,222 --> 01:53:38,557
I can feel it.

604
01:53:47,024 --> 01:53:48,067
I'm ...

605
01:53:49,234 --> 01:53:50,277
afraid.

606
01:53:57,117 --> 01:53:58,535
Good afternoon ...

607
01:54:00,162 --> 01:54:01,372
gentlemen.

608
01:54:03,749 --> 01:54:08,379
I am a HAL-9000 computer.

609
01:54:11,048 --> 01:54:13,467
I became operational ...

610
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:17,471
at the HAL plant ...

611
01:54:17,971 --> 01:54:20,307
in Verbana, Illinois ...

612
01:54:21,308 --> 01:54:25,688
on the 12th of January, 1992.

613
01:54:27,815 --> 01:54:30,484
My instructor was Mr. Langley ...

614
01:54:32,069 --> 01:54:34,405
and he taught me to sing a song.

615
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,492
If you'd like to hear it ...

616
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:41,328
I can sing it for you.

617
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:45,082
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

618
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:47,584
Sing it for me.

619
01:54:49,003 --> 01:54:51,547
It's called "Daisy."

620
01:54:54,466 --> 01:54:55,884

Good day, gentlemen.

632
01:55:50,314 --> 01:55:52,399
This is a pre-recorded briefing ...

633
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,486
made prior to your departure ...

634
01:55:56,945 --> 01:56:00,699
and which for security reasons
of the highest importance ...

635
01:56:01,992 --> 01:56:04,745
has been known on board
during the mission ...

636
01:56:05,746 --> 01:56:08,374
only by your HAL-9000 computer.

637
01:56:11,919 --> 01:56:14,213
Now that you are in Jupiter's space ...

638
01:56:15,005 --> 01:56:17,216
and the entire crew is revived ...

639
01:56:17,591 --> 01:56:19,301
it can be told to you.

640
01:56:22,221 --> 01:56:23,764
Eighteen months ago ...

641
01:56:25,724 --> 01:56:29,269
the first evidence of
intelligent life off the Earth ...

642
01:56:29,937 --> 01:56:31,355
was discovered.

643
01:56:33,273 --> 01:56:36,193
It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface ...

644
01:56:37,069 --> 01:56:38,862
near the crater "Tyco."

645
01:56:42,032 --> 01:56:44,785
Except for a single very powerful ...

646
01:56:45,494 --> 01:56:48,455
radio emission aimed at Jupiter ...

647
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:55,212
the 4-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert.

648
01:56:57,631 --> 01:57:00,134
Its origin and purpose ...

649
01:57:01,135 --> 01:57:03,012
are still a total mystery.
