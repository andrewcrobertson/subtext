1
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,739
Another glass of...

2
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:23,009
rosé?

3
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:27,913
No. The hour is long past.

4
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,182
Check.

5
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,354
Check!

6
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,150
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,318
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,785
Do not advance!

9
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,288
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,457
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,892
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,062
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,141
Oh, God.

14
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,468
Go.

15
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,295
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,231
Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

17
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,498
Leave a message.

18
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,799
Hey, Jamie.

19
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,801
Are you there?

20
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,303
Just wondering,
are you and Sukie

21
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,372
- going to shot night tonight?
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,541
I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.

23
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:35,874
Maybe Carla's going.

24
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,244
Do you know if Carla's going?

25
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,345
Are you going?

26
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,448
Anyway, call me if you would.

27
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,948
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,317
Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.

29
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,186
Miss you, friend. It's Marian.

30
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,324
Hey. Marian.

31
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,059
Hi, Bart.

32
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,528
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,397
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,065
What?

35
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,833
Phish concert.

36
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,136
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,538
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:06,539
P-H.

39
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,841
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,477
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,280
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,482
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,484
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,884
That's fine.

45
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,853
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,855
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,823
- What expression?
- "Anyhoo."

48
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,093
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,894
What is it?

50
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,398
A word.

51
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,366
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,002
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,480
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,039
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,906
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,342
It's very good.

57
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,444
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,812
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,848
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,287
People don't usually call them
"engagements."

61
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:56,955
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,259
Yes.

63
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,194
The fact remains.

64
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,329
The engagement.

65
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,064
That's right.

66
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:27,554
Oh, my.

67
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:29,389
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,591
My God!

69
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,898
Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

70
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:42,335
Leave a message.

71
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,504
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,272
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,607
During sex?

74
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,477
- Hi, Sukie.
- Wow.

75
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,281
- Who? Here?
- Yes, there.

76
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,653
- I was just masturbating.
- Uh-huh.

78
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,021
Me... me time.

79
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,092
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:18,304
No.

81
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,972
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,008
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,510
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,646
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,946
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,216
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,419
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,154
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,988
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,390
Why else would you be here?

91
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:39,025
To socialize.

92
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,527
Hello, girls.

93
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,665
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,634
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,702
Why not 2K?

96
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,706
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:59,646
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,214
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,550
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,186
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,556
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:12,225
So, first lick...

103
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,662
Here.

104
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,265
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,734
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,603
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:27,040
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,108
Ooh! Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:31,744
Here.

111
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,582
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,351
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,119
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,621
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,523
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:44,757
Here.

117
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,127
She's a free spirit.

118
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,629
I admire her.

119
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,231
Free. Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,766
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,168
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:07:55,201 --> 00:08:00,273
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,743
Pull that out!

124
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,145
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,448
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,786
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,322
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,258
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,593
20th... soon-to-be 21st...
century lesbian.

130
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,529
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,198
-This right here is what it gets you.
-Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,066
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,368
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,812
move my shit out of Sukie's
tomorrow...

135
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:30,803
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,505
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,374
What problems?

138
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:35,775
Internal.

139
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,577
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,212
I don't know how else to put it.

141
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,414
Problems with what I feel
internally.

142
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,316
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,351
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:48,454
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:52,492
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,328
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:58,498
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,301
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,570
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,171
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:07,707
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,376
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,111
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,179
Where are you going?

155
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,847
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,883
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,651
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,520
Can't she move?

159
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,388
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,390
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,192
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,228
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:31,431
There's good birding.

164
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,132
Birding?

165
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,734
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,469
It's very pleasant.

167
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,238
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,374
I've been unhappy,

169
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,576
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,244
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,616
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,517
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,720
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,389
We get our shit together,
together.

176
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,224
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,660
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:01,928
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,930
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,665
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:07,233
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,777
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,403
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,505
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:15,241
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,543
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,546
I'll wear my great big old
straw hat,

188
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,516
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,385
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,220
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,555
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,190
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:32,258
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,793
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,228
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,863
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,465
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,534
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,269
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,271
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,440
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:49,942
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,944
You said she wouldn't be here.

204
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:55,481
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,716
That was a gift.

206
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,384
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:02,822
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,525
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,793
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,594
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,329
I never liked her.

212
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,298
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:14,434
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,835
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:19,906
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,009
It's your dildo, Susanne.

217
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,512
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:27,991
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,515
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,250
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

221
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,286
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,863
Yeah, you have something
to write this down?

223
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,457
- Yes, I'm writing it down.
- To 14 Tinywick Road.

224
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,825
- Right.
- Tallahassee.

225
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,293
- Sure.
- You got it?

226
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,694
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:44,330
And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.

228
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:45,998
- By tomorrow.
- No later.

229
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,734
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

230
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,669
- Okay.
- Over and out.

231
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:53,740
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,609
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:57,944
A reference?

234
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,013
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,981
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,750
His balls.

237
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,485
Can the reference be a woman?

238
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,620
We don't know a lot of men.

239
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,921
No kidding.

240
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,557
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

241
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,460
Tallahassee?

242
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,896
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

243
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,498
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

244
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,766
I think Curlie here...

245
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't call me Curlie.

246
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,337
Isn't your name Curlie?

247
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,438
My name is Curlie.

248
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,074
We just met. It's too familiar.

249
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,342
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

250
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,576
No, I got good sense.

251
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,412
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

252
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,848
Okay. Is that a good car?

253
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,550
Not really.

254
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,387
You sell those shirts?

255
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,060
There's also a place
here in Wilmington...

256
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,391
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

257
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,360
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

258
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,570
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

259
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:49,996
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

260
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,464
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

261
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:52,808
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

262
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,333
Down and across.

263
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,811
Right here's
the world's largest Dixie cup

264
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,070
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

265
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,838
Direct route, down and across.

266
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:01,574
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

267
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,410
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

268
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,712
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

269
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,116
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

270
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,650
The interstate is not life.

271
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,095
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

272
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,695
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.

273
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,554
That's nature.

274
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,422
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

275
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,900
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

276
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,425
He said it was a rush job.

277
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,736
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

278
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,828
Tomorrow can wait a day.

279
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,429
We could even go to Miami.

280
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:24,831
Bikinis and high heels.

281
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,634
A medical doctor?

282
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,802
Or a reverend?

283
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:34,107
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

284
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,409
No, not for medical doctors,
either.

285
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,111
Make up your mind...
which are you?

286
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,813
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

287
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:44,383
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

288
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,686
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

289
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,389
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

290
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,826
Well, we're here.

291
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,495
Okay. Who are you?

292
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,999
- The car.
- The car?

293
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,767
The Dodge Aries.

294
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:03,903
The Dodge Aries?

295
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:05,172
What are you, a mynah bird?

296
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,505
I'm Curlie.

297
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,407
I understand that.

298
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,976
You're not the Dodge.

299
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:14,014
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

300
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,523
What's the big deal?

301
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,193
The car isn't ours.

302
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,961
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

303
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:30,529
And once we get to Tallahassee,

304
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,041
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

305
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,010
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

306
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,701
- soap and water.
- It won't.

307
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,737
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

308
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,073
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

309
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,142
Marian, it's art.

310
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,576
Stop saying it's art.

311
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,145
That doesn't end all discussion.

312
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,646
We're gonna be driving through

313
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,514
some conservative towns...
the South.

314
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,183
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

315
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,185
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

316
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,953
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

317
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,189
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

318
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,724
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

319
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,228
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

320
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,595
My project.

321
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,630
What's your project?

322
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:08,434
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

323
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,736
How long's it been?

324
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,573
Weeks?

325
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,178
Months?

326
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,946
Oh, my God, Marian.

327
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,215
Don't tell me it's been years.

328
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,550
H-How many years? Who was it?

329
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,652
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

330
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,121
Donna.

331
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,755
Yeah, Donna.

332
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,894
Oh, my God.

333
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,463
Oh, my God. Donna?

334
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,999
She work for Al Gore now?

335
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,500
Nader.

336
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,004
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

337
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,573
Wait a minute.

338
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:50,977
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

339
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,247
Yes, I did.

340
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,683
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

341
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,252
and then these broads come in

342
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,654
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

343
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,723
You gave them the car.

344
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,524
You don't know who they were?

345
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,127
I told you their names.

346
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,627
Their names, yes, but...

347
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,297
This place is a dump.

348
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,765
They drive the car
instead of you.

349
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:13,733
Is that bad?

350
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,168
Bad if they find the goods.

351
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:17,737
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

352
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,239
I like clutter.

353
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,740
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

354
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:21,883
Sterile doesn't work for me.

355
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,642
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

356
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,112
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

357
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,279
I'm a dick-yank?

358
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,780
Don't antagonize.

359
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,192
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

360
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,260
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

361
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,918
And you would?

362
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,222
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

363
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,091
Not per se.

364
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,692
"Per se"?!

365
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,195
They left a local number.

366
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:45,165
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

367
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,966
Someone whose balls I can break.

368
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,539
Now you've gone and done it.

369
00:16:57,344 --> 00:17:01,281
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

370
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,952
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

371
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,688
Tomorrow.

372
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,627
This is great.

373
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,929
This is so slutty. I love this.

374
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:19,665
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

375
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,600
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

376
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:22,768
The Butter Churn awaits.

377
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:24,071
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

378
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:26,073
No. No, don't even.

379
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,307
You come with me.

380
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,109
I'll show you how this is done.

381
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,087
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

382
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,720
It's a dyke bar.

383
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,924
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

384
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,860
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

385
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,895
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

386
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,998
if there's a news stand
or a lesbian bookstore?

387
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:56,036
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

388
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,740
Hello?

389
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,881
Confidence.

390
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:11,717
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

391
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,853
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

392
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,821
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

393
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,424
Jamie, I have done this before.

394
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,126
It's just like this.

395
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,693
One message.

396
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,196
You dig the female body.

397
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,397
Your body.

398
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,665
You're like this.

399
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,270
Not like this.

400
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,072
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

401
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,406
I have done this before.

402
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,907
I am not a schoolmarm.

403
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,419
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

404
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:38,345
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

405
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,113
Three years.

406
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,982
And four months and 14 days.

407
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,187
♪ Peanut, peanut butter ♪

408
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,988
Okay.

409
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,799
♪ Yeah, it tasted real good,
but it stuck to my teeth... ♪

410
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:52,325

411
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,194
Very much so.

412
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:55,928
Okay.

413
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:58,864

414
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:02,102
♪ Peanut, peanut butter... ♪

415
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:04,371
They all look fine.

416
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:05,771
Fine?

417
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:07,040
Like, "You'll do"?

418
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:08,384
"Please, please come home
with me, baby.

419
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,043
"You seem totally okay.

420
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,953
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

421
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,779
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

422
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,048
I said they all looked fine.

423
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,883
Yeah, but not in the sense
of "super fine."

424
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,753
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

425
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,721
Why are you jousting with me?

426
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,990
I'm not jousting.

427
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,326
I'm asking which of these women

428
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,960
you want to throw up
against the wall

429
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:29,795
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

430
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,797
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

431
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,509
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

432
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,111
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

433
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:37,736
I'm just trying
to get you laid, sugar sweet.

434
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,772
They sense it,
whether you want to fuck them

435
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,341
or you think they're just fine.

436
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:42,875
I have to be me.

437
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,910
It has to be done
with authenticity.

438
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,955
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

439
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,482
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

440
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,251
You don't know
what our life was like.

441
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:52,528
You know nothing
about its worth.

442
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:54,154
Then why didn't
the two of you move

443
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,223
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

444
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,490
That didn't happen.

445
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:59,459
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

446
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,094
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

447
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,229
No, I'm not.

448
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,762
This is not me.

449
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,298
You're right. I can't do this.

450
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,200
No, Marian.

451
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:11,104
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

452
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,805
You can do this.

453
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,283
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

454
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:15,508
Your best self.

455
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,143
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

456
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,944
but this really isn't
right for me.

457
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:21,880
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

458
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:25,218

Right here. Look.

464
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:40,966
Hold it. Better.

465
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,136
Great. Turn.

466
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,306
Oh.

467
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,175
Hello.

468
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,777
Good evening.

469
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,115
I'm Amber.

470
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,017
Marian.

471
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,021
What you reading?

472
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:04,491
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

473
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:07,227
Wow. Thick one.

474
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,197
Hello, Marian.

475
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,899
Hello.

476
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:18,171
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

477
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:19,239
No.

478
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:21,174
No, no.

479
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:23,410
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

480
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:25,944
Rats.

481
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,116
Well...

482
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,019
I'll just...

483
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,007
How was it?

484
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:03,510
Bouncy.

485
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,182
How's your book?

486
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:11,418
Good.

487
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,386
It's about two free spirits

488
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,355
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

489
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:19,192
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

490
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:21,661
That is why we are going
the other way.

491
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,163
Although there was
this one chick

492
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,697
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

493
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,433
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

494
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,568
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

495
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,236
No, I'm not kidding.

496
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,172
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

497
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,740
in India supposedly
who can do that.

498
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:35,742
Black belts in cunnilingus.

499
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:38,311
They can even
cunniling themselves.

500
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:40,580
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

501
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,980
You got to ask the librarian.

502
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,716
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

503
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,485
Who wrote your book?

504
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,520
Henry James.

505
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,055
Henry James...

506
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,224
American writer.

507
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,393
Famous family. His brother, too.

508
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,494
Rick?

509
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,030
No, I'm kidding.

510
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,698
I know who Henry James is.

511
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,266
White and uptight.

512
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:04,571
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

513
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,473
Boy, that was a great read.

514
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:09,609
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

515
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:12,312
That's a very apt simile.

516
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:15,081
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

517
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,116
Put me off the whole book thing.

518
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:20,095
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

519
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,387
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

520
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:22,731
Uh-huh, yeah.
I don't think you should've

521
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,057
brought someone
back to the room.

522
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,759
Okay.

523
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,228
I knew this was coming.

524
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,762
How do you think I felt?

525
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,498
You told me to have
a night on the town.

526
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

527
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,735
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

528
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,370
We operate on a handshake basis.

529
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:39,272
- What does that mean?
- "Hiya. How you doing?"

530
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,773
"How much for that Cadillac car?

531
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,642
"How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

532
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:44,277
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

533
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,645
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

534
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:47,714
- Well, then why'd you ask?

I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

Uh-huh.

553
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,189
They're very committed lesbians,

554
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:31,634
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

555
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:33,326
which is practically on our way.

556
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,294

557
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,162
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

Should we look at the map,
see how long...

559
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,499
Forget the map.
After today's game,

560
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,701
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

561
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,202
And guess who's invited.

00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:44,537

00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:41,361
Well, real life
is not like that.

699
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:43,829

700

give-and-take, so forth.

00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,131
last night in Marietta, Georgia.

716
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,267
- Just north of Atlanta.
- On it.

717
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:23,003
Georgia.

718
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,118
Thank you.

719
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,885
For what?

720
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:42,022
Just picking me up.

721
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,057
Am I not gonna pick you up?

722
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,025
Hard not to.

723
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:46,602
"Ma'am, your friend here
is in the hoosegow.

724
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:47,993
Care to come get her?"

725
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:49,828
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

726
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,574
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

727
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:53,899
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

728
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:57,070
And so I say thank you.

729
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:05,045
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

730
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,547
and I've been careful
not to ask,

731
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,083
but damn, Marian,

732
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,553
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

733
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:15,555
I think it was jail, not prison.

734
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,157
Oh. I'm sorry.

735
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,459
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

736
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:21,328
It wasn't hell-raising.

737
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,330
Sorry to disappoint.

738
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,066
A policeman didn't like my tone.

739
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh.

740
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:29,868
You copped some attitude.

741
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:32,272
I don't have attitude.

742
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,908
Marian, if I may,

743
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,111
there are certain things in life

744
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:40,979
which you got to sense
and understand

745
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,083
in order to live life,

746
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:46,119
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

747
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:48,355
well, all these
funny little creatures

748
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:50,956
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

749
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,226
we call 'em human beings.

750
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,395
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

751
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:57,197
And your whole social situation,

752
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,265
you got to understand
what that is.

753
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,367
Uh-huh.

754
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,501
You know what that means?

755
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:02,968
"Social situation"?

756
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,903
I know what
"social situation" means.

757
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,139
Okay, good.

758
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,074
So, the whole thing
with a cop is...

759
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:10,243
and you should remember this
for future reference...

760
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:13,646
when you're in
a social situation with a cop,

761
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,914
there ain't no social situation.

762
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:18,184
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

763
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,919
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

764
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:22,665
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

765
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,224
for two years now, and...

766
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:25,991
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

767
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,461
Thank you. I understand.

768
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,597
But if authority
is being abused,

769
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,267
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

770
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,169
Florida.

771
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:42,142
Lesbian...

772
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:47,013
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

773
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,436
You okay?

774
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,404
Spare tire.

775
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:27,420
What?

776
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:32,225
Something burning?

777
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:50,243
Jamie, it's cold.

778
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,113
Don't touch it.

779
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,317
I saw this movie once where

780
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,019
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

781
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,387
and they opened the box,

782
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:05,258
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

783
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,375
Head!

784
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,653
No, I'm kidding.

785
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:36,389
It was a minor traffic accident.

786
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:37,790
Fast stop.

787
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:41,194
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

788
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:43,329
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

789
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,267
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

790
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,336
That's right.

791
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,239
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

792
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:55,542
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

793
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,777
Just drove off
with something we need.

794
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,445
Didn't even know they had it.

795
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:02,382
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

796
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,652
Just making out.

797
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:07,554
Oh, yeah?

798
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,289
With who?

799
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,426
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

800
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:18,565
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

801
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,333
sample case back.

802
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:23,202
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

803
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,847
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

804
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:27,407
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

805
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,676
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

806
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:35,815
No, no.

807
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,450
We should just call the cops.

808
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,718
We will, Jamie.

809
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:41,554
First, we should see
what's in here.

810
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,389
Why? I don't want to look.

811
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:45,425
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

812
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,827
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

813
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,429
This might tell us who they are,

814
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,397
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

815
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:53,700
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

816
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,468
Protect us?

817
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:57,813
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

818
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,106
What do we lose by looking?

819
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,308
Look.

820
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,445
I just want to know
what's going on.

821
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,448
This might tell us.

822
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:11,184
I bet it's locked.

823
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:37,477
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

824
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,578
That was awful.

825
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:40,546
You just said
not to call the cops.

826
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,248
In ignorance.

827
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:43,549
No, what you said was true.

828
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,385
The cops could think
you're involved.

829
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:46,853
You just spent
the night in jail.

830
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:48,354
For vagrancy.

831
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:50,690
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

832
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:51,958
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

833
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:53,359
Here's what we do.

834
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,395
First, we get to Tallahassee.

835
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:56,763
Bye!

836
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,300
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

837
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,745
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

838
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,737
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

839
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:06,472
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

840
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:07,850
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

841
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:09,308
the address
where they're headed?

842
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,477
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

843
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,413
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

844
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:15,448
Bye!

845
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:21,287
Welcome to El Conquistador.

846
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,723
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

847
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,292
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

848
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:28,761
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

849
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:30,296
You take the Rainbow Card?

850
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:31,731
Uh, I'm sure we do.

851
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,776
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

852
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,678
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

853
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,312
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

854
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:38,738
You do that, right?

855
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:40,582
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

856
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:42,009
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

857
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,710
for sensitive materials?

858
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:45,012
We do have in-room safes

859
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,512
for any valuables
that you may have.

860
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:48,848
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

861
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:50,717
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

862
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,618
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

863
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:53,853

That's one of them.

878
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:50,510
I was sittin' here listening

to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

00:45:51,944 --> 00:45:55,715
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

881
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:58,818
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

882
00:46:01,988 --> 00:46:03,923

But why would these people
just be waiting there

888
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,908
in the drive-away office?

889
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:23,110
Well, clearly, this was not

890
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:24,844
your garden-variety
decapitation.

891
00:46:24,877 --> 00:46:26,445
This was some kind of a...

892
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,381
Well, I don't know what it was,

893
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:30,950
but they know
we have their stuff.

894
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:32,385
Yeah?

895
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,854
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

896
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:37,590
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

897
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,559
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

898
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:42,528
But why would we get
in touch with them?

899
00:46:42,562 --> 00:46:44,564
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

900
00:46:44,597 --> 00:46:47,100
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

901
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,568
Jamie.

902
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,137
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

903
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,371
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

904
00:46:52,405 --> 00:46:53,673
She hates you.

905
00:46:53,706 --> 00:46:56,709
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

906
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,878
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

907
00:46:59,812 --> 00:47:02,381
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

908
00:47:02,415 --> 00:47:04,717
Attorney? Are you a college boy?

909
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,987
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

910
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:10,123
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

911
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:11,858
I'm running booking, jackass.

912
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:13,993
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

913
00:47:14,027 --> 00:47:15,661
and kick your number-running ass

914
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:17,864
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

915
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:20,733
Who's running booking?

916
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:22,169
- You are.
- Who is?

917
00:47:22,202 --> 00:47:24,470
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

918
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:26,006
- Shink!
- Yeah.

919
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,773
Telephone.

920
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:30,110
Sergeant Shinkleman.

921
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:32,079
Hey. It's me.

922
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:33,813
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

923
00:47:33,846 --> 00:47:36,083
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

924
00:47:36,116 --> 00:47:38,684
- Did the two creeps find you?
- What?

925
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:40,187
The two weirdos looking for you.

926
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,888
I tried to be helpful.

927
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:44,924
- Uh, but who were they?
- How should I know?

928
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:46,692
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

929
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:48,594
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

930
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:51,497
- George and Lennie.
- George and Lennie?

931
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:55,168
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

932
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:56,903
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

933
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:58,771
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

934
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:01,174
"Break a big murder case"?

935
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:04,044
Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.

936
00:48:04,077 --> 00:48:05,878
- Curlie's Drive-Away?
- Yeah.

937
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:08,681
And you ask Curlie about...

938
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:11,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

939
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:14,054
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

940
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,589
You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.

941
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:17,924
Jamie, that is about

942
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:20,793
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

943
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,938
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

944
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:24,463
I guarantee you someone's there.

945
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:26,933
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

946
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,468
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

947
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:31,171
I'll take Alice.

948
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:32,838
Really? Swear?

949
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:35,208
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

950
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:37,843
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

951
00:48:38,744 --> 00:48:40,913
A juke joint where?

952
00:48:40,947 --> 00:48:42,949
Wetumpka, Alabama.

953
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:44,684
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

954
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:45,851
They hadn't been there,

955
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:49,222
but a very personable
music lover

956
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,091
told us of another juke joint

957
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:52,892
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

958
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:54,027
Stop!

959
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:55,895
Called Ike's.

960
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,898
Maybe he said "Mike's."

961
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:00,533
Maybe he said "Mike."

962
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,668
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

963
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:04,570
I think the soccer team
was just confused

964
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,572
about which joint
these girls were going to,

965
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:08,041
so we're gonna drive...

966
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,776
Stop saying words.

967
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,512
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

968
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:14,981
They arrived in Tallahassee

969
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:18,651
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

970
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:20,686
Tallahassee.

971
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,255
I want you to get
your asses over there

972
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:24,590
and take care of it right away.

973
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:26,126
Not a juke joint.

974
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,660
You should arrive
by early morning.

975
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:28,761
I'll meet you there.

976
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:30,997
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

977
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,965
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

978
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,068
We have not slept
since the night before last,

979
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,004
and we...

980
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:38,704
Hello?

981
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:42,042
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

982
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,610
Certainly.

983
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:46,555
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

984
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:47,880
or right here at the hotel,

985
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:50,549
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

986
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,019
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

987
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:55,088
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

988
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:57,623
Maybe we should stay here.

989
00:49:57,656 --> 00:49:59,092
Replenish the ice.

990
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,731
This is great, but how...

991
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:08,101
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

992
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:11,804
Rainbow.

993
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:12,705
Yes.

994
00:50:12,738 --> 00:50:15,275
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

995
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:17,044
Like, a really, really good one?

996
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:18,145
Of course.

997
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:22,182
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

998
00:50:22,215 --> 00:50:23,849
Theoretically.

999
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,626
So...

1000
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:38,831
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1001
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,669
finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1002
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:47,074
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1003
00:50:47,973 --> 00:50:49,975
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1004
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,978
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1005
00:50:53,013 --> 00:50:55,115
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1006
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:58,018
but I usually have stuff to do.

1007
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:00,653
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1008
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:03,190
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1009
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:07,693
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1010
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:09,728
Something I decided

1011
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:11,107
last night
while I was lying in bed

1012
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:14,101
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1013
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:18,338
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1014
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,905
Especially since, with you,

1015
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:21,974
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1016
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:23,143
Am I right?

1017
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:26,645
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1018
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:29,915
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

1019
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,118
Yes, please.

1020
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,253
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1021
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:34,920
I mean, we're good friends,

1022
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:36,922
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1023
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:38,391
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1024
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:41,961
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1025
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:44,930
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1026
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:47,134
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1027
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:49,069
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1028
00:51:49,102 --> 00:51:51,770
She was always saying
that this or that

1029
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:53,440
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1030
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:57,110
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1031
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,811
the sex was great.

1032
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,779
Ladies, have we decided?

1033
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,085
Don't rush us, buddy.

1034
00:52:06,052 --> 00:52:09,055
First, we'll dance.

1035
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,070
Maybe I do overthink things.

1036
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:26,906
Yeah.

1037
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:30,943
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1038
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:38,084
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1039
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:39,985
Ah, you know Debbie.

1040
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,055
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1041
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:44,057
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1042
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,992
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1043
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:49,029
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1044
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:51,730
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington mother fuck...

1045
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:56,936
♪ Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle ♪

1046
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,242
♪ Just remember, darling ♪

1047
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,910
♪ All the while ♪

1048
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:11,717
♪ You belong to me... ♪

1049
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,238
One accomplishment.

1050
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,973
Huh? Name me one.

1051
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,510
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1052
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,379
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1053
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,316
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1054
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:57,983
on a creaky porch swing

1055
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:59,695
on a warm summer evening...
crickets, so forth?

1056
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:02,988
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1057
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:04,657
trousers around your ankles,

1058
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:07,193
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1059
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:09,995
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1060
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,997
Yes, people might stroll by

1061
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,466
and see you looking foolish
up there

1062
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,000
slapping ham on the veranda,

1063
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:18,004
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1064
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:20,607
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1065
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,143
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1066
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:26,179
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1067
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,680
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1068
00:56:27,714 --> 00:56:29,982
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1069
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:31,684
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1070
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,453
that I've been carrying
on my back

1071
00:56:33,486 --> 00:56:35,921
all the way from Philadelphia!

1072
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,542
Help.

1073
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:06,119
"Big case."

1074
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:08,455
That woman.

1075
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:14,694
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1076
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,484
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1077
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:39,252
Yes, sir.

1078
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:03,169
Honey, we eating soon?

1079
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:05,104
Okay.

1080
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,275
Oh. All right.

1081
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,875
Jamie?

1082
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:48,114
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1083
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,118
Jamie, no!

1084
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:01,661
Jamie, why?

1085
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,369
Oh, my God.

1086
01:00:09,402 --> 01:00:10,703
Marian.

1087
01:00:11,771 --> 01:00:13,573
Sir?

1088
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:15,274
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1089
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:18,277
Tallahassee, sir.

1090
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:20,880
Where to, exactly?

1091
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:23,282
Yes, um...

1092
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,184
The track.

1093
01:00:25,218 --> 01:00:27,253
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1094
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:28,888
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1095
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,456
Oh, come on now.

1096
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,326
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1097
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,261
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1098
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:37,563
No. I like this one.

1099
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,933
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1100
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:42,402
Last night was beautiful,

1101
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:44,370
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1102
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:46,281
on the water slide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1103
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:47,940
Okay!
-All right!

1104
01:00:47,974 --> 01:00:50,643
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1105
01:00:50,677 --> 01:00:52,412
We're here for two things.

1106
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:55,224
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1107
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:56,482
Screw you!

1108
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:58,951
We're here for two items.

1109
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:00,453
Whoa. She's naked.

1110
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:02,689
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1111
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:04,323
We're here for two items.

1112
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,392
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1113
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:08,494
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1114
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:10,496
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1115
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,408
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1116
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:14,400
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1117
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:16,936
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1118
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,305
Let's get this show on the road.

1119
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:23,242
Yeah, baby.

1120
01:01:23,276 --> 01:01:27,780
You're such a big, bouncy,

1121
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:31,484
beautiful baby.

1122
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:34,587
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1123
01:01:35,888 --> 01:01:37,690
Whoa.

1124
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:40,293
This is so groovy.

1125
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:42,995
Now I can love you forever.

1126
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,731
Whoa.

1127
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:46,933
And ever

1128
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:50,737
and ever and ever

1129
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:55,808
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1130
01:01:55,842 --> 01:02:00,379
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1131
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:04,484
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1132
01:02:04,517 --> 01:02:09,022
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1133
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:13,426
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1134
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:17,030
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1135
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:20,767
Never to wilt...

1136
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:26,006
Took 'em straight here.

1137
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:27,473
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1138
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:29,575
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1139
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:34,781
This is all they had?

1140
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:36,582
What's all they had?

1141
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:42,089
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1142
01:02:42,122 --> 01:02:44,357
What are you talking about?

1143
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,526
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1144
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,928
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1145
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:50,830
Come on, girls.

1146
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:52,465
Where's the last phallus?

1147
01:02:55,635 --> 01:02:57,837
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1148
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,539
I-I...

1149
01:02:59,572 --> 01:03:01,517
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1150
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,409
What have you done, jerk-off?

1151
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:05,344
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1152
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:06,679
They gave you the combination,

1153
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:08,681
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1154
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:10,449
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1155
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:12,351
past the first number.

1156
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:28,634
The senator is a good man.

1157
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,438
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1158
01:03:32,471 --> 01:03:33,739
Many of us did.

1159
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:36,109
It was a different time.

1160
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:39,412
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1161
01:03:39,445 --> 01:03:41,881
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1162
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:49,156
Housekeeping.

1163
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:55,628
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1164
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,664
thing.

1165
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:03,870
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1166
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,009
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1167
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:12,411
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1168
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:14,914
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1169
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,118
He was just a kid.

1170
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:25,591
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1171
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,660
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1172
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:30,596
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1173
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,966
You saw him, sort of.

1174
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:52,085
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1175
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,820
Think of it: eBay,

1176
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:59,059
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1177
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,627
Comments, reviews.

1178
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:04,097
Think of what
it would do to him.

1179
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:08,501
His children, his family,
his career.

1180
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:14,207
We're not unreasonable.

1181
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,943
We'll gladly pay for it.

1182
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:18,211
We just...

1183
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:20,180
Will you please shut up!

1184
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:21,514
That wasn't my idea!

1185
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:23,050
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1186
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,117
I was experimenting.

1187
01:05:24,151 --> 01:05:25,551
But you liked it.

1188
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:26,852
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1189
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,554
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1190
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:29,855
Drunk on cock.

1191
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:31,524
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1192
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:33,260
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1193
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:35,195
- To understand life.
- No!

1194
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:37,863
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1195
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:43,502
God, man, what are you doing?!

1196
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:17,937
Mommy.

1197
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:41,627
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1198
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,030
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1199
01:06:43,063 --> 01:06:44,630
Then we switch hotels.

1200
01:06:44,663 --> 01:06:46,342
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1201
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:47,867
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1202
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,170
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1203
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,638
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1204
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,847
Next customer, please.

1205
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:04,884
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1206
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,286
Don't ask me why.

1207
01:07:09,356 --> 01:07:10,923
Committee to Reelect.

1208
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,825
I need to speak to the senator.

1209
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:16,263
Well, who should I say
is calling?

1210
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:18,798
Someone who has his...

1211
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,568
personal effects.

1212
01:07:53,433 --> 01:07:55,901
Who is this?

1213
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:57,170
Senator?

1214
01:07:57,204 --> 01:07:59,705
Yes. Who is this?

1215
01:07:59,738 --> 01:08:02,775
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1216
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:06,113
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1217
01:08:06,146 --> 01:08:07,813
Everybody's things.

1218
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:10,417
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1219
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,651
If you're not alone,

1220
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,687
believe me, I'll know it.

1221
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:25,432
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1222
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:27,367
made a phone call
from here last night.

1223
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,801
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1224
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:32,139
Well, this is for her.

1225
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:33,273
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1226
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:34,874
You've missed them.

1227
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,776
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1228
01:08:57,464 --> 01:08:59,199
Done.

1229
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,302
With what?

1230
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,703
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1231
01:09:05,372 --> 01:09:07,174
Want to join me?

1232
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:38,038
Jamie.

1233
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:41,941
I want...

1234
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:43,276
Uh-huh?

1235
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,346
I... I-I want...

1236
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:48,981
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1237
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,386
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

and this morning,

1291
01:14:01,067 --> 01:14:02,707
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1292
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:04,375
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1293
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:06,272
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1294
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:08,107
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1295
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:11,377
Well, you've had a full day.

1296

01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:45,371
You know, hers and hers.

1321
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:50,410

1322

- Uh-huh.

1324
01:15:54,747 --> 01:15:56,182
Uncle John met her in church.

1325
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:57,850

She's very religious.

we're off to Massachusetts.

1336
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:20,506
