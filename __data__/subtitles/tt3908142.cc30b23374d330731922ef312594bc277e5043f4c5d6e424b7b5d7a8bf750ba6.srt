00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:17,592
Re-sync for BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG] by Dandysubs.

3
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,400
- I'm starting a new life.

4
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,720
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

5
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,560
And almost no one knows me.

6
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,010
Poor Jerry.

7
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,520
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

8
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,110
They say I'm cured now.

9
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,990
But I still have intrusive
thoughts.

10
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,040
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,090
People are abused all over the
world

12
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,130
every day

13
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,880
much worse than me

14
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,380
and they do fine.

15
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,180
- Your tail light's out, Miss.

16
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,190
- Oh, thank you for letting me
know.

17
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,770
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

18
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,940
- I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

19
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,070
- Thank you, Officer.

20
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,160
- You drive safely.

21
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,640
- When Jerry left me,
I devoured everything

22
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,900
I could about how to get your
man back.

23
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,360
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

24
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,990
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

25
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,290
You have to be very tricky.

26
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,130
- Elaine?

27
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,300
Hi, I'm Trish.

28
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,130
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet
you.

29
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,050
- Oh, you're so pretty.

30
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,090
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

31
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm married and everything.

32
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,140
- No, I didn't think anything.

33
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,390
- Well, let me help you with
your bags.

34
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,980
Is this all you've got?

35
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,980
- For now.

36
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,150
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

37
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,360
- So you're an artist?

38
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
- Yes, I am.

39
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,570
- I'm an interior decorator.

40
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,650
- Oh, really?

41
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
- Yes.

42
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,290
That's how I met Barbara.

43
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,540
I decorated this apartment.

44
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,830
It was lucky I still had the
keys.

45
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,750
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

46
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,890
How do you know Barbara?

47
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,150
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

48
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,230
- Oh, really?

49
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,610
Well, I hope you like the
apartment.

50
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,580
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

51
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,620
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth Tarot deck

52
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,960
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,210
for me to hang.

54
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,250
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

55
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,130
Well, this is it.

56
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,310
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

57
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,350
It's just beautiful.

58
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,390
- Really?

59
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,980
Oh, I'm so glad.

60
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,400
I thought I may have overdone
it.

61
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,980
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

62
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,730
- You must be exhausted.

63
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm sure you want to lie down.

64
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,740
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

65
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,820
Do you know of a place around
here?

66
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,410
- There's the Victorian Tea
Room.

67
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,040
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,710
- Oh, how fantastic.

69
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,750
Where can I freshen up?

70
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,540
- The bedroom is through there.

71
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,540
- I'll only be a moment.

72
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,410
- What a lovely room.

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,210
- Yes, isn't it?

74
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,920
I love Victoriana.

75
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,090
- Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

76
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,840
- Do you have fairy
princess fantasies, Elaine?

77
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
- Of course.

78
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,010
We may be grown women, but
underneath

79
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,180
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

80
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,600
by a prince on a white horse.

81
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,890
- Yes, I suppose so.

82
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,060
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

83
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,780
- I don't think I've found
my Prince Charming yet,

84
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,070
but I think I found the formula.

85
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,550
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

86
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,700
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

87
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,250
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

88
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,380
Then Jerry would have never left
me.

89
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,550
- Who's Jerry?

90
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,340
- My ex-husband.

91
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,470
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

92
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,650
But then I was reborn as a
witch.

93
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,530
Barbara and Gahan brought me
back to life.

94
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,700
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

95
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,780
Men are like children.

96
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,410
They're very easy to please

97
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,120
as long as we give them what
they want.

98
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
♫ Tra la la la

99
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,460
♫ Tra la la la la di da

100
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,630
♫ I dreamed of a fairy
lady in a strange land

101
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,350
♫ She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men

102
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,860
♫ She wore a gown

103
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,940
♫ Of pink and purple roses

104
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,950
♫ It was so tra la la and so la
di da ♫

105
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,580
- Where were we?

106
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,830
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

107
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,750
Well, what do men want?

108
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,260
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

109
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,050
and to make them feel like a man

110
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,240
and to give them total freedom

111
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,890
in whatever they wanna do or be.

112
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,600
- But what about what we want?

113
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,230
How are we going to be equals
with men

114
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,770
if we keep catering to all of
their needs?

115
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,150
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

116
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,320
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

117
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,950
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

118
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,120
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

119
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,290
I'll admit, I used sex to get
this,

120
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,880
but I'm not proud of it.

121
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

122
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,180
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

123
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,430
I'd be a wreck.

124
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,010
- Poor Richard.

125
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,100
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

126
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,520
You have to give a man his
fantasy.

127
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
- His fantasy?

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,940
- Yes, his fantasy.

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,280
But what I'm really interested
in

130
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
is love.

131
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,540
You might say I'm addicted to
love.

132
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,830
I wonder if all women feel that
way?

133
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,380
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

134
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,250
A husband isn't a prince,
Elaine,

135
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,630
and life isn't a fairy tale.

136
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,680
We have to face that fact.

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
- Why?

138
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,530
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

139
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,640
if you pleased your husband
more.

140
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,390
- I don't
need to please Richard.

141
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,520
Richard loves me for myself.

142
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
- Of course.

143
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,730
Perhaps you did find your Prince
Charming.

144
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,070
- Perhaps I did.

145
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,330
- Guess who.

146
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,920
- Richard, what are you doing
here?

147
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,420
This tea room is for ladies
only.

148
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,710
- Oh, I went to visit you at
work

149
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,970
and Julie said you were here.

150
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,550
I thought we could have lunch
together.

151
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,760
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

152
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

153
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,640
Elaine, this is my husband,
Richard.

154
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,480
- I've heard so much about you,
Richard.

155
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,110
- Nothing too horrible, I hope.

156
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,400
- On the contrary.

157
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,160
- Goddess, please,

158
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,380
send me a beautiful, sweet man

159
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,380
to love me as I love him.

160
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,760
To love me, love me,

161
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
love me,

162
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,770
love me,

163
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
love me,

164
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,610
love me,

165
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
love me,

166
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
love me.

167
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,100
Hi, are you Wendy?

168
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,020
- Yes, what can I do for you?

169
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
- I'm Elaine.

170
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,100
We spoke on the phone.

171
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,940
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

172
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,360
- Elaine, right.

173
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,110
Thanks for coming by.

174
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,820
Mind if I have a look?

175
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
- Please do.

176
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,740
- These are nice.

177
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,750
Really nice.

178
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,500
I think these will do well in
the store.

179
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,090
- Then you'll take them?

180
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,840
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

181
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,310
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

182
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,350
Sound good?

183
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,980
- Yes, fantastic.

184
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,770
Thank you, Wendy.

185
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,020
- Sure, Elaine.

186
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,690
Bright blessings.

187
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,190
- People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

188
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,320
I tell them it's because I
want to have magical powers.

189
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,410
But it's not like it sounds.

190
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,580
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

191
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
- Hi.

192
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
- Hi.

193
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,950
- It's a beautiful day.

194
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,040
- Yes, it is.

195
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,830
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

196
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,670
- Oh, you like nature?

197
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,090
- Very much.

198
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,710
You seem like a nature type too.

199
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,640
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

200
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,970
- That's right.

201
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,430
How'd you know?

202
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,970
- I can just tell.

203
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,680
Nature is where your heart is.

204
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,690
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

205
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,860
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

206
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,650
- I'm talented that way.

207
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,620
- Well, you're right about the
city.

208
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,490
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods

209
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,500
about an hour from here.

210
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

211
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,710
just think and read.

212
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,460
- Do you take your wife up
there?

213
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,220
- No.

214
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm not married.

215
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,780
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

216
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,140
once in a while.

217
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,890
- I do.

218
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,730
I do, once in a while.

219
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,730
- You wanna take a girl up there
now?

220
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,400
What do you mean?

221
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,860
- Well, I'm new in town

222
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,450
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

223
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,790
I'll make you a nice dinner.

224
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,500
- Yes, okay, sure.

225
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,380
Uh, my car is right over there.

226
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
- Okay.

227
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Let's go.

228
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,770
You know what I'd like to do
right now?

229
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,940
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

230
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,860
just like we were kids.

231
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,160
- Wait, wait.

232
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,580
You want some?

233
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,580
- What is it?

234
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,870
- Something I made.

235
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
- Mm.

236
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,510
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

237
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
- Finish it.

238
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,240
- Oh.

239
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,410
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

240
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,370
Not here.

241
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,120
Let's go inside.

242
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,430
This is beautiful.

243
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
I'll start the dinner.

244
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
- Wow.

245
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,740
This looks delicious.

246
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
- To nature.

247
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,390
- This is really nice, isn't it?

248
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,930
I like to come up here a lot

249
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,560
at the end of the semester to
unwind.

250
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,940
- Are you a teacher?

251
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,650
- Yeah, I teach at the
university.

252
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,650
- Oh, what do you teach?

253
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,320
- English and French literature

254
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,070
with a focus on the 18th
century.

255
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,240
- So, you must be quite a
libertine.

256
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,410
- A libertine?

257
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,200
Why would you say that?

258
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,580
- Oh, you know.

259
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,130
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.

260
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,500
Not to mention Casanova.

261
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,130
- Well, there
were a lot of books written

262
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,800
in the 18th century.

263
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,380
- Well, is it true?

264
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,510
Are you a libertine?

265
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
- Yes I am.

266
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,850
I love women.

267
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,350
Does that bother you?

268
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,850
- On the contrary.

269
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,770
Oh, hmm,

270
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,820
I feel strange, dizzy.

271
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,330
What was in that drink you gave
me?

272
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,250
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

273
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,670
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

274
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,050
Oh, baby.

275
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,130
You are really wild.

276
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,690
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

277
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,770
- Not at all.

278
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,920
♫ La ♫

279
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,960
- What the hell?

280
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Your coat.

281
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,220
It's so bright.

282
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,550
♫ La ♫

283
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,310
- I always line my clothing.

284
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,770
- You have two selves.

285
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,400
Dark and quiet that you show the
world.

286
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,610
Who do you give that to?

287
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
The rainbow?

288
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,280
- I give the rainbow to you.

289
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,870
Right now.

290
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,210
♫ La ♫

291
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,600
♫ La la la ♫

292
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,350
- Oh.

293
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,320
- Oh.

294
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,570
♫ La la ♫

295
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
- Huh!

296
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Oh God.

297
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Oh, Elaine.

298
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,710
Look at you.

299
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,800
- You can make love to me now.

300
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,970
♫ La la la la ♫

301
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,990
- Aw, okay.

302
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,410
- What is it, Wayne?

303
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,450
What is it, baby?

304
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,790
- Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.

305
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,670
- It's all right, you're with
me, shhh.

306
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,550
- Elaine.

307
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,060
No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

308
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,890
- Life has been tough, huh?

309
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,650
- Yeah, in a way.

310
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,990
You're not like any other woman
I've met.

311
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,740
No games, no agendas.

312
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,080
You just seem to take life as it
is.

313
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,540
- Is there any other way to take
life?

314
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,290
- Well, the women I've been
with,

315
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,730
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

316
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,220
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

317
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,260
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

318
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
It's crazy.

319
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,260
- I know, baby.

320
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I know.

321
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,400
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

322
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,900
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

323
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,280
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

324
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,870
they're never bright enough.

325
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,500
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

326
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,330
- That seems like quite a
problem.

327
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,960
- It is.

328
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,380
I feel my whole life as a loner,

329
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,340
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

330
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,310
But now I'm not so sure.

331
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,270
Oh, Elaine,

332
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,690
I have never felt real
love like this before.

333
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,530
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

334
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,110
- Oh.

335
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,200
Elaine, I'm scared.

336
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,830
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

337
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,420
I can't take it, I can't take
it.

338
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh.

339
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,840
Elaine, I'm sick.

340
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,590
I'm sick.

341
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,010
- Hey, it's all right.

342
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,680
I've got you.

343
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,430
I love you.

344
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,650
And I'll always be here for you.

345
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,610
Try to get some sleep.

346
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,790
- Elaine.

347
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,250
Elaine, where are you?

348
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,750
Elaine, where are you?

349
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,050
- What a pussy.

350
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,930
What a baby.

351
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,260
I thought I'd found a real man,

352
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,230
but he's just like a little
girl.

353
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,980
- Elaine!

354
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,290
- No one was ever there for me

355
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,480
when I was crying my heart out.

356
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,070
No one ever comforted me.

357
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
No one.

358
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,650
- Good morning, Wayne.

359
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,610
- Hi, Elaine.

360
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,740
- Here, drink this.

361
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,710
- I had such horrible dreams
last night.

362
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,760
- What did you dream about,
baby.

363
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,430
- I dreamt that I was calling
your name

364
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,340
and you didn't answer.

365
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,510
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

366
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,560
Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't
you?

367
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,190
- Of course, I love you.

368
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,360
- Oh God, oh God, Elaine.

369
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,200
- Are you hungry?

370
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,290
- I don't know what I am.

371
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,130
- Well, try to get some sleep.

372
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
- Elaine.

373
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,630
Don't leave me.

374
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,880
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

375
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,470
I'll be right here.

376
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,870
Wayne, wake up.

377
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,410
It's late.

378
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Wayne.

379
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,670
Wayne, baby, wake up.

380
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Wake up.

381
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Wayne.

382
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,880
- Tampons aren't gross.

383
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,300
Women bleed and that's a
beautiful thing.

384
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,510
Do you know that most men have
never even seen a used tampon?

385
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,650
Part of me can be with Wayne
now.

386
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Always.

387
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,450
I don't really mind death.

388
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,620
I've buried people before.

389
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,620
People I really cared about.

390
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,420
In the end we're all just
compost anyway.

391
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,920
Everything regenerates.

392
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,010
I'd like to come back as a cat.

393
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,390
I've been so depressed since my
cat died.

394
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,810
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

395
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,900
He was my best friend.

396
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,300
- I give the rainbow to you.

397
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Right now.

398
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,980
Just a minute.

399
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Oh hi Trish.

400
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Come on in.

401
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,540
- Hey, Elaine.

402
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,120
You look gorgeous.

403
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,830
I love what you've done with
your hair.

404
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,870
- Thank you.

405
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,000
What's up, honey?

406
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,350
- Well, I haven't been able to
reach you,

407
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,340
so I thought I'd come over

408
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,460
to see if everything was all
right.

409
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,510
- I'm fine.

410
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,010
Really.

411
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,050
Can I offer you something?

412
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,640
I just made some tea and cake.

413
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,470
- Just tea, thank you.

414
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,610
- Cream and sugar?

415
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,780
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

416
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,430
So, what have you been so busy
with?

417
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,590
A man, I hope.

418
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,640
- Yes, it was a man.

419
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,020
But, it didn't work out.

420
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,560
- I'm Sorry.

421
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,150
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

422
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,690
I thought that he was the one.

423
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,690
- Well, maybe next time.

424
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,700
- Are you sure you won't have
some cake?

425
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,370
- Oh, no, thank you.

426
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,120
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

427
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
- Good bye?

428
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,170
Why, where are you going?

429
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:53,170
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

430
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,760
- Is Richard going with you?

431
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,470
- No, it's just a business trip.

432
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,550
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

433
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,630
- Sam, give me two whiskeys on
the rocks.

434
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,180
- Sure thing, Jane.

435
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,470
Did you see the papers today?

436
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,510
- No, why?

437
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,520
- They found a body in the Eel
River.

438
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
- A murder?

439
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,190
- Maybe.

440
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,480
They found a symbol carved in
his chest.

441
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,070
Here.

442
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,030
- It's a pentagram.

443
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,200
- It's them witches again.

444
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,830
- That's what I was thinking
too, Lyle.

445
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,000
- So yeah, Barbara, that's
everything.

446
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,010
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

447
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,170
They couldn't prove anything.

448
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,140
They actually thought that I
killed him.

449
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,720
Can you believe it?

450
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,890
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

451
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,140
after you left.

452
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,480
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

453
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,480
- Well, it was perfect timing.

454
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,860
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to
greet you.

455
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,070
That's all right.

456
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,910
Trish has been lovely.

457
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,950
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

458
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,290
But I had this experience last
weekend

459
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,290
that really shook me up.

460
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,120
- Why, what happened?

461
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,210
- Well, I met this great-looking
guy.

462
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,590
And I used love magic on him.

463
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,170
Then he got really weird on me.

464
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,970
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

465
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,270
Then he got really

466
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
sick.

467
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,900
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

468
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,770
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

469
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,980
It was probably just too much
for him.

470
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,910
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

471
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,320
- I guess that's what it was.

472
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,410
But, I don't know.

473
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,700
- Honey, you have to be more
careful.

474
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,180
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

475
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,580
in the first place, you know.

476
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,460
- Merry Meet, Elaine.

477
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,590
- Bright blessings Gahan.

478
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,360
- I heard you discussing love
spells.

479
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,280
You do have to be careful,
Elaine.

480
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,120
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

481
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,660
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

482
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,960
What's it been now, a year?

483
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,840
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

484
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,170
Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,

485
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,800
for the blessings that we share.

486
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,050
- Blessed be, Hurrahya!

487
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,020
- Go home, witches.

488
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Go home.

489
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,020
- Just ignore them.

490
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,730
They're always giving us
trouble.

491
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,480
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

492
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,780
- Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

493
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,240
But it's not bad for a small
town.

494
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,030
Not all of them embrace our
methods

495
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,910
of practicing witchcraft.

496
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,750
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

497
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,080
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

498
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:02,340
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

499
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,880
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

500
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,800
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

501
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,970
And it was fun.

502
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,140
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

503
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,070
- What have you been teaching?

504
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,400
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on sigil magic

505
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,950
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

506
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,280
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

507
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,120
energy grounding,
Earth-based spirituality,

508
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,950
pagan arts and crafts,

509
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,120
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

510
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,050
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

511
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,510
- Oh, are you still teaching
that?

512
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,720
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

513
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,720
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

514
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,560
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

515
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,900
- Are you still dancing?

516
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,820
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on Amateur Night.

517
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,150
You should come.

518
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,650
- Hi, Barbara.

519
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Hi, Gahan.

520
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,200
Sorry we're late.

521
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,330
- Hello lovely ladies, please
have a seat.

522
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,620
Elaine, this is Star and her
sister Moon.

523
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,670
They're our students for
tonight.

524
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,170
Girls, this is our dear friend
Elaine.

525
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,210
- Hi.

526
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
- Hi.

527
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,130
- I was just pointing out that
dancing

528
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,050
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

529
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,600
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

530
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,100
so you could learn about that.

531
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,270
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

532
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,480
These men would do anything for
her.

533
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,490
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

534
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,740
Then let us begin.

535
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,450
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

536
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,500
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

537
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,330
lies in her sexuality.

538
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,300
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

539
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,970
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

540
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,470
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

541
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,520
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

542
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,350
with the fear of female
sexuality.

543
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,570
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

544
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,860
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

545
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,200
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

546
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,370
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

547
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,370
never asking us what we wanted.

548
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,880
- They teach us that a
normative human being

549
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,710
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

550
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,670
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

551
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,510
that need to be cured.

552
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,140
And we believe that men
and women are different

553
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,230
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

554
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,230
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

555
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,020
our primal power as goddesses.

556
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,900
We need to teach men how to love
us

557
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,700
using ways they can understand.

558
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,820
So goddesses, use perfume,

559
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,080
wear high heels and makeup,

560
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,370
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

561
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,460
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

562
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,420
Be a mother and a lover.

563
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,720
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

564
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,810
- Use sex magic to destroy his
fear of you

565
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,390
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

566
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,110
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

567
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,650
with all of your inner beauty.

568
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,070
Then, when his heart is open to
love,

569
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,070
you may do with him what you
will.

570
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,720
- I love you, Elaine.

571
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,100
You know that, don't you?

572
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,190
I love you very much.

573
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,110
But you need to be more careful.

574
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,820
Dinner was late three times this
week.

575
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,080
And that house is a total
pigsty.

576
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,330
Do you know that I found an old
hot dog

577
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,620
under the bed this morning?

578
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,210
And why don't you ever brush
your hair?

579
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,380
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

580
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,510
I'm embarrassed to have people
over.

581
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,180
I've been really patient up
until now,

582
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,020
but you need to step up your
game.

583
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,440
- I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

584
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,190
What?

585
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,860
You're not crazy?

586
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,910
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

587
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:23,740
Which is it?

588
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,290
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

589
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,540
And you could lose a few pounds.

590
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,040
You're looking a little fatty.

591
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,170
- Oh my God, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

592
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,840
You have such a hot body now.

593
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,140
Do you like it when I touch you
like this?

594
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,220
Or like this?

595
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,230
I wanna make you come.

596
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,730
- Don't be frightened, Elaine.

597
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,650
I would never hurt you.

598
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,240
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

599
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,910
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

600
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,120
- Hast thou the courage to make
the essay?

601
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,290
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

602
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,190
- Assist me to erect the ancient
altar

603
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,520
at which in days past all
worshiped.

604
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,990
For in the old times, a woman
was the altar.

605
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,450
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

606
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,780
of the circle, the origin of all
things.

607
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,710
Therefore, should we adore it.

608
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,450
- Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

609
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,580
Congratulations on your
promotion.

610
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,990
- Thanks, Connie.

611
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,290
Is there any coffee.

612
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,960
- Yeah, I just made some.

613
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,880
I made it just the way you like
it.

614
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,130
- Is there anything you don't do
well?

615
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,880
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

616
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,930
- How's the coffee, Steve?

617
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,350
- Uh, too strong.

618
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,230
- Well, I like it strong.

619
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,070
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

620
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,490
- Why, have you been keeping
late nights?

621
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,530
- Maybe so.

622
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,370
- But, now that you've been
promoted,

623
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,410
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

624
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,910
- Me, you kidding?

625
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,090
- Sergeant Meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

626
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,840
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

627
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,010
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

628
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,770
- Yes, of course.

629
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,310
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

630
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,980
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

631
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,360
- Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

632
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,160
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

633
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,160
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

634
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,620
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

635
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,630
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

636
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,040
- Wayne used to spend weekends

637
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,880
up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

638
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,510
He used to take dates there.

639
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,380
- Oh, Jesus.

640
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,180
♫ La ♫

641
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,110
- Hey Griff, look.

642
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:50,530
- Good lord.

643
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,860
♫ La ♫

644
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,290
- What the hell is this?

645
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,250
♫ La ♫

646
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,500
- I don't know.

647
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,920
We're going to have to dig,
Steve.

648
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:14,970
- I know.

649
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,100
♫ La ♫

650
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,480
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

651
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,740
♫ La ♫

652
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
- Mmm, mmm,

653
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,590
this cake is absolutely
fantastic.

654
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,640
And what a great dinner.

655
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,680
- Thank you.

656
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,640
I enjoy cooking.

657
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,770
Hope you don't mind my calling
you.

658
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,770
Sometimes it's so hard to be
alone.

659
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,860
- Not at all.

660
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,530
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trish is out of town.

661
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,710
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

662
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,920
- 10 years this September.

663
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,960
- 10 years!

664
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,460
It's really amazing.

665
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:39,640
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

666
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,020
- What about your husband?

667
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,650
- My husband never loved me.

668
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,730
He couldn't wait to get away
from me.

669
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,570
- I'm sorry.

670
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,290
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

671
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,170
- Poor baby.

672
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,920
Poor, poor baby.

673
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,040
So, tell me, what turns you on?

674
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:53,750
- What turns me on?

675
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,250
Wow, no one's ever asked me that
before.

676
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,340
Let me think.

677
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,430
You know what really turns me
on?

678
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
Flying.

679
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,430
- Flying?

680
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,600
- Yeah, flying a plane.

681
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,560
You don't know what kinda high
it is.

682
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,520
You're soarin' up there above
everything.

683
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,230
You're in control.

684
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,900
- Oh, how fantastic.

685
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,490
- It really is.

686
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,700
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

687
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,870
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

688
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,130
I feel like my life is slipping
away

689
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,590
and there's so many things I
haven't done.

690
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,630
- Like what?

691
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,470
- I've never had any sordid love
affairs

692
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,800
or gotten into any mischief.

693
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,470
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

694
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,720
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

695
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,370
and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those

696
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,520
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

697
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:01,740
Or those Westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

698
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,280
and then go visit the local
prostitutes.

699
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,320
It's sounds stupid, I know.

700
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,700
- No, it doesn't.

701
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:12,200
It's very sweet.

702
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,250
- Really?

703
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,130
Trish doesn't think so.

704
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:23,010
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

705
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,680
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

706
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,220
I understand you perfectly.

707
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,310
- You do?

708
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,470
- Of course.

709
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,270
You wanna have a sordid love
affair.

710
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,900
You wanna get into some
mischief.

711
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,500
- Uh.

712
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,310
- Ho!

713
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Who are you?

714
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,760
What are you doing to me?

715
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,010
- I'm the love witch.

716
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,970
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

717
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,430
- That's right.

718
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,640
That's right.

719
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,820
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

720
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,860
- Who?

721
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,320
- Professor King.

722
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,080
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

723
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,910
He might be able to help me

724
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,740
identify some of the items we
found.

725
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,000
- It's great.

726
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,710
Did you get the lab report?

727
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,380
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like
heart failure.

728
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,630
But the toxicology report
showed traces of Jimson weed

729
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,800
also known as Devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

730
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,050
- It's unbelievable.

731
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,010
You want me to come with you?

732
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,720
- No, this will only take a few
minutes.

733
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,350
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

734
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,690
- Mustard, mayo?

735
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,980
- Yeah and cole slaw.

736
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:26,400
Thanks.

737
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,440
- Done.

738
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,540
- Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

739
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,040
- Glad to meet you, Professor.

740
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,750
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

741
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:51,920
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

742
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,510
- Interesting, yes.

743
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,890
Just as I thought.

744
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,810
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

745
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,020
- A witch bottle?

746
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,200
- Yes, witches used to make them

747
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,850
for protection against curses.

748
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,360
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

749
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,230
along with herbs and something
sharp

750
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,450
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

751
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,510
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearths

752
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,160
of very old houses.

753
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,870
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

754
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,910
was a witch?

755
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,910
- It's very likely.

756
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,210
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

757
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,630
has taken root again in cities.

758
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,630
There have several rituals per
year.

759
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:34,880
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

760
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:38,720
Other rituals celebrate
Summer Solstice, Litha,

761
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,560
or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

762
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:48,610
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

763
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,440
in a mockery of Christian
rituals.

764
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,610
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices
a child.

765
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,490
- Does this stuff really go on
today?

766
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,660
- Yes, indeed.

767
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:04,580
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

768
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,580
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

769
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,960
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

770
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,300
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

771
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,420
but they've been unsuccessful.

772
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,590
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

773
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,050
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

774
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,220
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

775
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,430
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

776
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,940
of both black and white witches

777
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,520
who practice the ancient rites.

778
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:04,640
- I invoke and call upon
thee, Mighty Mother of us all.

779
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,480
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

780
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,150
and priestess.

781
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,690
- Of the Mother Darksome and
Divine

782
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,280
here I charge you in this sign.

783
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,450
- Listen to the words of the
Great Mother.

784
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:32,130
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

785
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,880
Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
Isis,

786
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,800
and by many other names.

787
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,850
- Whenever ye have need of
anything,

788
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:50,020
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

789
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,310
who am Queen of all witches.

790
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:58,030
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

791
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,070
all sorcery.

792
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:04,700
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

793
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,620
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

794
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:12,790
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

795
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,550
Bagabi lacha bachabe.

796
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:26,010
Lamac cahi achababe.

797
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,270
Hurrahya! Hurrahya!

798
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
- Arise.

799
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,360
Eko, Eko, Azarak

800
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,700
Eko, Eko, Zomelak

801
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,410
Eko, Eko, Cernunnos

802
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,080
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

803
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:20,110
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

804
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,610
What's the matter?

805
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,990
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

806
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,410
- Well, have a drink and relax.

807
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,910
Nothing's that dire, at least
not for you.

808
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,290
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

809
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,170
- What victims?

810
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,920
- There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

811
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,970
- Please, don't touch me.

812
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,310
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

813
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,730
- Merry meet, Elaine.

814
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,940
How's it going?

815
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,940
- I'm back in the dating pool
again.

816
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,270
- What happened?

817
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,290
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

818
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,610
the married man.

819
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,700
- No, I broke it off.

820
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:09,410
He just became really obsessive,
morose,

821
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,160
and his aura became really
murky.

822
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,330
He didn't even wanna make love
anymore.

823
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,500
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

824
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,880
There was no polarity.

825
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,420
But, I should have known.

826
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,590
He's a Pisces.

827
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,040
- Richard?

828
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,440
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

829
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,840
when I'm working.

830
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,090
What do you want?

831
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,320
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

832
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,100
and I'm taking a pill.

833
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,490
Are you coming to bed?

834
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,780
- No.

835
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:43,000
I have some more work to do.

836
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:49,050
- All right, see you tomorrow,
then.

837
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:40,180
♫ La ♫

838
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:51,490
♫ La ♫

839
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:03,500
♫ La la la la ♫

840
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,150
- Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

841
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,190
I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

842
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:29,230
- Okay.

843
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,910
- Does this look familiar to
you?

844
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,790
- It's a witch bottle.

845
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,090
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

846
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,500
- No, no I don't.

847
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,640
- Ever seen any of these in here
before?

848
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,760
- Yeah, we have some witch
bottles.

849
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,260
I'll show you one.

850
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,480
Here's one.

851
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,070
- How common are these bottles?

852
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,460
- I've never seen 'em in here
before until

853
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:19,370
a girl started supplying 'em to
us.

854
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,200
- Who is this girl?

855
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,460
- Her name is Elaine, Elaine
Parks.

856
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:54,650
- Who is it?

857
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,450
- Sergeant Meadows, Police
Department.

858
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,850
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

859
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,920
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

860
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,000
- About what?

861
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,210
- Well, it's a potential
homicide case.

862
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,960
Just a routine check.

863
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:19,470
I thought you might be able to
help us.

864
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,930
- Of course.

865
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:25,060
Please come in, Sergeant.

866
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,730
So you say there was a homicide.

867
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,190
How horrible.

868
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,820
Who was killed?

869
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,070
- A man named Wayne Peters.

870
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,370
Did you know Wayne Peters?

871
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:44,410
- No.

872
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,080
- Here's a picture of him.

873
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,620
Ever seen him before?

874
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,670
- No.

875
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,250
I guess I can't help you,
Sergeant.

876
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,130
Good bye.

877
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,630
- Ms. Parks, wait.

878
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:07,180
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

879
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,390
- It's a Magic Bottle.

880
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:10,810
I made it myself.

881
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,940
- Have you ever seen one
containing urine?

882
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:15,980
- Urine?

883
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,190
No.

884
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:32,960
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

885
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:36,590
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

886
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,550
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, Sergeant?

887
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,430
- Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

888
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,810
- Yes, I am.

889
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,480
Is there a law against that?

890
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,320
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

891
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,610
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

892
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,530
capable of murder even?

893
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,120
- No, I wasn't trying to
imply...

894
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,330
- Sergeant Meadows, do
you know what it's like

895
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,750
to really suffer?

896
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,750
You have to fight and fight

897
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,880
until you're too exhausted to go
on.

898
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,880
Witchcraft is my religion,
Sergeant.

899
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:24,680
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

900
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,840
saved my life.

901
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:44,200
- Ms. Parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

902
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:47,950
I didn't realize.

903
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,500
- That's all right, Sergeant
Meadows.

904
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,920
- You can call me Griff.

905
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,260
- Griff?

906
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:09,720
I know I've seen you before.

907
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:13,430
I just don't know where.

908
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,770
- I have that same feeling.

909
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,480
- I know.

910
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,030
You're the man in the cards.

911
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,610
You're my fate.

912
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,740
- What do you mean, I'm your
fate?

913
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,830
- I did a Celtic Cross reading.

914
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:38,250
For my future card I got Knight
of Wands.

915
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,590
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

916
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:48,130
I would soon meet the man
that I'm going to marry.

917
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:51,970
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

918
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,220
Do you like animals, Griff?

919
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,850
- Why yes, I love animals.

920
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,810
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

921
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,440
I'm very fond of.

922
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,110
You know, tomorrow is my day off

923
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,780
and it's supposed to be quite
nice out.

924
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:11,820
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

925
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:14,160
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

926
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:43,730
Whoa.

927
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,130
- Oh Patchouli, you're such a
sweetheart.

928
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,110
- How's my girl?

929
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,320
- Am I your girl?

930
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,530
- For today you are.

931
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,250
You're my girl and there's
nobody around

932
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,990
to tell me otherwise.

933
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,910
- Except me.

934
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,830
- And what's that supposed to
mean?

935
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:42,080
- Nothing.

936
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,880
Kiss me.

937
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,140
- What's that sound?

938
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,890
- I don't know.

939
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,520
Let's go see.

940
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:27,270
- Now is the time of the Summer
Solstice.

941
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,400
The strength of the Oak King is
waning.

942
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,570
And the Holly King stands
ready to challenge him

943
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,320
for the hand of the Green
Maiden.

944
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,160
- Let the battle begin.

945
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,160
- Your season is over old man.

946
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,040
- Oh never.

947
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,550
- I will have her.

948
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,650
- Never have her.

949
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,510
- Never.

950
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:07,270
- Holly King, I name you the
victor.

951
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:09,310
The Green Maiden is yours.

952
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:10,350
- M'lady.

953
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,900
Come on.

954
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,320
- Elaine.

955
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,660
- You know these people?

956
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,450
- Well yes, in a way.

957
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,700
- All hail, fair Lord and Lady.

958
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,710
Welcome to our little gathering.

959
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,750
- All hail.

960
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,520
- We are the good people
of the Renaissance

961
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:36,670
and Medieval players and we
are celebrating the Midsummer.

962
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,170
Won't you join us?

963
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,760
- To be sure, fair consorts.

964
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,140
- They are charming, are they
not?

965
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,980
- Yes, quite charming.

966
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,940
- I see two people in love.

967
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:57,190
This calls for a wedding.

968
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,190
- A wedding?

969
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,450
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you
will.

970
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,610
To honor the gods of love.

971
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:14,170
♫ Love is a magical thing

972
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:18,800
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

973
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,390
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

974
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:27,560
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

975
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:34,190
♫ Love is a magical thing

976
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:38,780
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

977
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:43,030
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

978
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:47,030
♫ But pretending is also real

979
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,290
♫ There's a lady in a castle

980
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:56,630
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

981
01:24:56,670 --> 01:25:00,510
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

982
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,720
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

983
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,600
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

984
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,220
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

985
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:13,520
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

986
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,110
♫ Just to have you near me

987
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:22,240
♫ Love is a magical thing

988
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,410
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

989
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:31,910
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

990
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:36,080
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫

991
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,110
- Okay.

992
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,490
- Now, ye are wed.

993
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,960
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

994
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:14,660
- I'm not in love.

995
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,540
It's not that I don't have
sentiment,

996
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,450
it's just that love is soft.

997
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,540
You need guts in this business.

998
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,850
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

999
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,500
and got soft inside.

1000
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,800
I want an heir some day

1001
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,420
and then I would need to have a
wife,

1002
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,630
but love is something else.

1003
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:33,470
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

1004
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,050
It's like he's not even a man
anymore.

1005
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:38,310
I never wanna get like that.

1006
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,100
- When you really love him,

1007
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,810
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

1008
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:48,730
You love all the little quirks
about him.

1009
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,150
The way he slurps his cereal.

1010
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:54,490
The way his mouth is a little
crooked.

1011
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:58,620
Those details about him
become your whole life.

1012
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:02,210
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

1013
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:06,250
and you realize that you
have more love to give

1014
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:09,170
than you ever thought was
possible.

1015
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,300
'Cause the more you know him,

1016
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,340
the more you love him.

1017
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,320
- The more
you get to know a woman,

1018
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,930
the less you can feel about her.

1019
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:23,520
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

1020
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,860
who fulfills all you're wildest
fantasies.

1021
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,900
Then she starts to reveal little
flaws

1022
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,820
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

1023
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:37,410
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

1024
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,290
No woman could ever fulfill it.

1025
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:44,460
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

1026
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:48,460
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

1027
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,510
drowning in estrogen.

1028
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,800
The most awful feeling.

1029
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,270
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

1030
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:07,600
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

1031
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,860
Some other time.

1032
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,220
- Hey Griff, I got more
information

1033
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,830
on that Elaine Parks girl.

1034
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,120
- You leave it on my desk.

1035
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,370
- Don't you wanna hear it?

1036
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:26,790
- Steve, Captain wants
us to lay off the case.

1037
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,210
- Are you serious?

1038
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,880
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1039
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,300
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1040
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,130
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

1041
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,970
- Even if they murder?

1042
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,660
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

1043
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,220
was a heart attack.

1044
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,020
I think so too.

1045
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:50,310
- Has everyone gone crazy around
here?

1046
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,480
Let me at least tell you what I
found.

1047
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:01,200
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1048
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,200
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1049
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,950
Two years later they were
divorced

1050
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,540
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1051
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,710
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1052
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,170
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1053
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,800
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1054
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:24,470
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1055
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:28,640
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1056
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,020
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1057
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,610
The police questioned Elaine

1058
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,400
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1059
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,200
- Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1060
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,160
what happened there is
none of our business.

1061
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,870
- Are you serious?

1062
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:46,330
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1063
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,410
and you better watch her.

1064
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,080
- You mean because she's a
witch?

1065
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,960
That doesn't mean anything.

1066
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,010
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1067
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:58,440
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters

1068
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,180
got the Devil's weed?

1069
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,470
- I questioned Ms. Curtis about
that.

1070
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:06,430
There was Devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1071
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:09,140
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1072
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:11,270
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1073
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,650
We have a possible murder here

1074
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,320
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1075
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,690
- I told you, we're laying off
her.

1076
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:20,450
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1077
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:21,860
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1078
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,240
Get the hell off my back.

1079
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:32,330
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1080
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,330
- Richard.

1081
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,870
Richard!

1082
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,420
Richard!

1083
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:15,830
Richard!

1084
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:05,090
- Thank you for meeting me,
Elaine.

1085
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,010
It's not good for me to be alone
too much.

1086
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:09,600
I know you're busy.

1087
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,640
- Of course.

1088
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,600
I wanted to come.

1089
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:18,560
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1090
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,820
- You can't blame yourself.

1091
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,820
You were a good wife to Richard.

1092
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,740
- I tried to be.

1093
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,410
I tried so hard to please him,

1094
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,750
but I should have tried harder.

1095
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:38,920
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1096
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,250
Maybe you were right.

1097
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,130
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1098
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,680
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1099
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,140
Maybe I was being naive,

1100
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,980
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1101
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,230
But now, now I wish...

1102
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:10,120
- You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1103
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,990
You have to let go.

1104
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,660
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1105
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:20,170
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1106
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,170
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1107
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,920
I hated him so much for that.

1108
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,090
I wanted to kill them both.

1109
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,930
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1110
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,980
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1111
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,690
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1112
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,230
- Hey,

1113
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,190
hey.

1114
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:51,910
- Enough about me.

1115
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,700
What's going on with you?

1116
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,450
- Trish, I'm in love.

1117
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,080
- Who is he?

1118
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,550
- He's a detective and he's
everything

1119
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,760
a woman could ever want.

1120
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,260
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1121
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:17,390
I just know that he's the one.

1122
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,600
He even gave me this ring.

1123
01:36:20,890 --> 01:36:22,850
I call it my magic ring.

1124
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,860
It's not an engagement ring

1125
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:29,030
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1126
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,710
- When we first came here

1127
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:49,210
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1128
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:53,130
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1129
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,550
It's too painful.

1130
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:59,930
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1131
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:03,390
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1132
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,150
The first day we met,

1133
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,320
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1134
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,240
and you were all alone.

1135
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,910
Now it's the reverse.

1136
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,700
Life is funny, isn't it?

1137
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:23,160
- Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta
go.

1138
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:26,080
Would you like to walk out with
me?

1139
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:29,840
- No, I'd like to stay and
finish my tea.

1140
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:30,880
- All right.

1141
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,180
Take care, love.

1142
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,390
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1143
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,890
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1144
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:23,350
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1145
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:25,020
See you in a minute.

1146
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,810
♫ La

1147
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,150
♫ la la la la la

1148
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:03,660
♫ La la la la la ♫

1149
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:49,550
- You bitch.

1150
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:53,220
You killed my husband.

1151
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,890
Bitch, skank, whore.

1152
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,330
You'll burn for this.

1153
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,460
- Crash, crash, crash.

1154
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:33,220
Die, die, die.

1155
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,140
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1156
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:41,020
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1157
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:44,730
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

1158
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:48,820
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1159
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:52,820
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1160
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:24,060
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1161
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:27,320
with a heady lovers' brew.

1162
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:30,820
Even should they strive to flee

1163
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:33,400
they'll cling for all eternity.

1164
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:46,250
- Scotch.

1165
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:04,980
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1166
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:13,780
Who are those new girls?

1167
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,410
They can't dance at all.

1168
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,910
And they're weird.

1169
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:27,080
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1170
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:29,210
- They're friends of the
witches.

1171
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,460
I seen them come in together
before.

1172
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,130
- Yeah, the witches.

1173
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,130
They're everywhere.

1174
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:38,300
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1175
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,470
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1176
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:42,100
- Did you read about the teacher

1177
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,640
buried in the back yard of his
cabin?

1178
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,940
They said it was done by the
witches.

1179
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:48,440
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1180
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,610
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1181
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:53,900
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1182
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,940
Creepy.

1183
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,340
- Sit down, Elaine.

1184
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,140
Elaine, the DNA came back from
the lab.

1185
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,270
It connects you with Wayne
Peters.

1186
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,570
Patricia Manning came by the
station.

1187
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:37,320
With some things of yours.

1188
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,410
Including this.

1189
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:46,080
She said you drove her husband
to suicide.

1190
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:51,420
- So, I was a bad girl.

1191
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:54,340
Are you going to punish me?

1192
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:59,260
- What sort of person are you,
Elaine?

1193
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:02,930
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1194
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:05,470
- Why are you so negative?

1195
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:07,220
I didn't kill anyone.

1196
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:10,140
Wayne died of heart failure

1197
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,770
after a beautiful night of
lovemaking.

1198
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:18,320
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1199
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,030
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1200
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:23,410
that they were experiencing with
me.

1201
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:26,040
- Are you saying these men died
of love?

1202
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,200
That's insane.

1203
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:31,080
What about the spells and the
drugs?

1204
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,630
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1205
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:37,590
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1206
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:40,630
It can only work with
what's already there.

1207
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:44,300
I just use sex magic to create
love magic.

1208
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:47,930
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1209
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:51,060
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1210
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,100
- Love?

1211
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:55,610
What do you know about love?

1212
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:00,110
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1213
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:02,030
or worse.

1214
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,410
- Don't diagnose me.

1215
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:08,700
Maybe you're a narcissist who
can't love.

1216
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,540
You think that I'm sick

1217
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:14,750
because you've never loved like
I have.

1218
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,090
Well, I would do anything for
love.

1219
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:23,880
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1220
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:28,060
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1221
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,970
it's not enough for you.

1222
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:32,060
You're like a bottomless hole.

1223
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:36,230
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford Wife thing

1224
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:40,360
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1225
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,490
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1226
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,530
I don't love you.

1227
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,790
- How can you stand there and
boast

1228
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,040
about being immune to love?

1229
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:03,800
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1230
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:07,760
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1231
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,720
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1232
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:14,390
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1233
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:19,520
If you would just love us for
ourselves,

1234
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:23,360
but you won't.

1235
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:28,030
My ex-husband was just like you.

1236
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:33,080
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1237
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,080
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1238
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,210
except when men wanted to use my
body.

1239
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,670
So, I decided to find my own
power.

1240
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:50,010
And I found that power through
witchcraft.

1241
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:53,850
That means that I take
what I need from men

1242
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,270
and not the other way around.

1243
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:00,810
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1244
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,400
It won't work this time.

1245
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:09,370
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1246
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:10,410
- What for?

1247
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:15,250
Marrying a lover according to my
religion?

1248
01:51:15,290 --> 01:51:17,160
Seducing a married man?

1249
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,170
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned

1250
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:23,250
for a thing like that, but not
today.

1251
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:27,970
- No, not burned,

1252
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:34,970
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1253
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,850
and we'll find out more.

1254
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:43,110
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1255
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:47,650
- Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live.

1256
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,700
- Burn the witch.

1257
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:55,910
- Burn the witch.

1258
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:58,080
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1259
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:04,880
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1260
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:11,510
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1261
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:16,270
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1262
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:21,560
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1263
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:27,480
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1264
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:33,870
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1265
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:36,160
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1266
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:39,460
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1267
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,460
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1268
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:46,380
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1269
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,300
- Burn!

1270
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:49,130
- Burn her.

1271
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:49,970
- Burn.

1272
01:52:50,010 --> 01:52:51,010
Burn.

1273
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,490
- Poor baby.

1274
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,870
Poor, poor baby.

1275
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,880
Don't worry, everything will be
okay

1276
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,380
because I love you so much.
