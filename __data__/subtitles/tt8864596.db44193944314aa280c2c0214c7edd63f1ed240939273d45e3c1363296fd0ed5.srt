1
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,089
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

2
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,024
Seen it. Seen it.

3
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,258
Huh. What's this about?

4
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>At the dawn...</i>
<i>dawn... dawn...</i>

5
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

6
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,477
Ah. Here we go.

7
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,979
<i>At the dawn of time,</i>

8
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>there was our gracious</i>
<i>and powerful creator,</i>

9
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>Primus.</i>

10
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,556
<i>To protect our universe,</i>
<i>he sacrificed his life force,</i>

11
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,727
<i>transforming himself</i>
<i>into our planet,</i>

12
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,229
<i>Cybertron.</i>

13
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,832
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

14
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:48,703
<i>Primus birthed</i>
<i>the first Transformers</i>

15
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,739
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

16
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,808
<i>the most powerful</i>
<i>Transformers,</i>

17
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,712
<i>appointed to lead and protect</i>
<i>future generations.</i>

18
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:02,482
<i>To assist them, Primus created</i>
<i>an entity of great power,</i>

19
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,686
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

20
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,655
The Matrix, there it is. Okay.
Good. Come on. Keep going.

21
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>With the Matrix</i>
<i>in the Primes' possession,</i>

22
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:16,798
<i>Cybertron's natural</i>
<i>power source, Energon,</i>
<i>flowed in abundance,</i>

23
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,601
<i>sustaining life</i>
<i>across the planet.</i>

24
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:27,008
<i>Attention!
</i> <i>Unauthorized movement</i> <i>detected in archival vault.</i>

25
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,241
<i>Sector J-3.</i>

26
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,310
KDQ-12 to KDK-1.

27
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,979
Breaching archives
in ten seconds.

28
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:36,851
<i>For generations,</i>
<i>there was peace and prosperity,</i>

29
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,387
<i>until the Matrix</i>
<i>of Leadership was lost,</i>

30
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,958
<i>causing Energon</i>
<i>to no longer flow.</i>

31
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:48,295
Why does every legend
about the Matrix
end right there?

32
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,497
One of these
has to say what happened.

33
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,734
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

34
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,036
Oh, hey there.
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>
<i>Prepare to--</i>

35
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,805
Uh-oh.

36
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,609
Freeze!
Get down!

37
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,244
Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

38
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,580
Which way is the exit?

39
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,215
I must've taken a wrong turn.

40
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,084
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

41
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:11,485
Orion Pax.
Who cares?

42
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,487
We told you
to never come back here!

43
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,456
Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

44
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,993
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

45
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,697
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

46
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,732
Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

47
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,602
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

48
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,705
Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

49
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,471
Oh, yeah?

50
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,473
Well, watch this.

51
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,913
Get him!

52
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,217
I-- I-- Uh...

53
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,819
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

54
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,486
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

55
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>
<i>Prepare to be detained!</i>

56
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,957
<i>Halt, criminal!</i>

57
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,272
Come on! Start! Come on!

58
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,307
Whoa!

59
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,615
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

60
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,119
There he is!

61
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,892
Ha-ha! So long, suck--

62
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,029
Ooh, Energon.

63
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,964
Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

64
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,806
Hey!

65
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,179
Whoa!

66
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:48,348
Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?

67
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,597
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

68
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,931
You want to give me
another one?

69
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,466
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

70
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,336
Hey!
Watch where you're going!

71
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,204
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

72
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,639
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

73
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,541
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

74
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,142
What? Where'd he go?

75
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,510
The filthy
red and blue bot?

76
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,512
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

77
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,248
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,816
Where is he?
He went that way.

79
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,451
When I get
my hands on that bot...

80
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,762
All right, all clear.

81
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,464
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

82
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,000
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

83
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,102
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

84
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,371
Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

85
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,006
Almost died.
It was wild.

86
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,407
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

87
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,676
Yes, it is.

88
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,077
I need a new best friend.

89
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,979
If there are clues
in our recorded history

90
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,282
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,583
they're in the archives.

92
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,920
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

93
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,955
is up on the surface
right now,

94
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,158
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

95
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,427
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

96
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,896
Yeah, okay.

97
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,698
The sooner Energon
flows again,

98
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,833
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

99
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,102
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

100
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,838
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

101
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:22,442
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

102
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,477
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

103
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,113
you could transform
without a cog?

104
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,949
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

105
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,483
Took me three days
to pry you open.

106
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,786
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

107
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,020
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,723
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

109
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,960
Hey, if we did have cogs--

110
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,162
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

111
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,130
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

112
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,033
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

113
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,269
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

114
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,439
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

115
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,140
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

116
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:56,577
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

117
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,045
What?

118
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,947
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

119
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,615
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

120
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,251
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

121
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,656
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

122
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,591
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

123
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,993
I know, buddy.

124
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:16,630
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

125
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,534
Thanks.
Always got your back.

126
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,837
No matter what.

127
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,676
<i>Approaching sublevel station.</i>
<i>Stand clear of doors.</i>

128
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,945
<i>Mining teams,</i>
<i>prepare to unload.</i>

129
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,034
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

130
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,603
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

131
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,871
So much, Elita-1!

132
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,873
And how perfect
is my mining record?

133
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,474
So perfect, Elita-1!

134
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,777
We are a mere
30 units of Energon away

135
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,812
from my promotion to supervisor.

136
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,447
Are you happy for me?

137
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,082
So happy, Elita-1!

138
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,384
Elita-- I mean Captain,

139
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,154
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

140
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,156
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

141
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,191
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

142
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,559
Apology accepted.

143
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,161
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

144
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,862
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

145
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,564
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

146
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,499
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

147
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,034
You don't have
the touch or the power.

148
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,203
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

149
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,338
She's in a good mood today.
Mm-hmm.

150
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,140
You ready?
Always ready.

151
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,442
Let's punch in.

152
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,410
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

153
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:37,978
Brace it up!

154
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:40,614
Here we go! Bridge!

155
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,116
Brace up!

156
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,586
Lower channel is open.

157
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,093
Drill power on max!

158
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,294
Low bridge!

159
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,101
Drill it out!

160
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,304
I tapped a vein!

161
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,277
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

162
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,220
Evacuate!

163
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,690
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

164
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,425
The tunnel is closing.

165
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,228
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

166
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,865
- You with me, D?
- On your six! Keep going!

167
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:32,534
Look out!

168
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,838
Jazz is stuck!

169
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,973
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

170
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,674
I'm falling back to assist.

171
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,676
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Do not break protocol.</i>
<i>Evacuate!</i>

172
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,778
We're gonna need more lift.

173
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,281
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

174
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,482
Yeah. Good idea.

175
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:51,051
What? No, I didn't mean it!

176
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,456
Pull him clear!

177
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,095
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

178
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,864
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

179
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,332
It's all good.

180
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,802
Oh, that's not good.

181
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,272
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

182
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,542
<i>Elita, it's about</i>
<i>to get messy out there!</i>

183
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,981
Go, go, go!

184
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,520
Run! Run!

185
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,388
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

186
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,757
Come on! Go, go, go!

187
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,165
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

188
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,834
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

189
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:43,103
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

190
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,139
Elita-1, you're fired.

191
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,209
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

192
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,344
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

193
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,879
No one asked you!

194
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,114
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

195
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,184
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

196
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,920
Report to waste management
immediately.

197
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,455
Waste management?

198
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,658
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

199
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,292
before you ruin someone's life?

200
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:06,427
I'm sorry!

201
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,531
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

202
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,900
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

203
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,869
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

204
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,574
Excuse me, sir.

205
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,275
Allow me.

206
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,844
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

207
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,780
Why?

208
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,162
That really hurt.

209
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,797
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

210
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,332
You know you were
out of line,

211
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,736
talking back
to a superior like that.

212
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,070
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

213
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,408
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

214
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,979
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

215
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,551
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

216
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,353
I'm glad
you were there with me

217
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,022
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

218
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,190
Anytime, buddy.

219
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,126
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

220
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,229
<i>Stand by for</i>
<i>a live transmission</i>
<i>from Sentinel Prime.</i>

221
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,165
He's back?
He's back already?
Maybe he found the Matrix.

222
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,805
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

223
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,675
<i>Hello, my friends.</i>

224
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,142
<i>Hello, Iacon City!</i>

225
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,645
<i>Hello to our saviors,</i>
<i>the industrious miners</i>

226
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,847
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain</i>
<i>our Energon reserves.</i>

227
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,817
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

228
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,087
Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

229
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,089
Ah! Nobody does it better!

230
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,892
<i>Once again, I have narrowly</i>
<i>returned with my fleet</i>

231
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,427
<i>after another</i>
<i>treacherous expedition</i>

232
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,731
<i>across the desolate, dangerous</i>
<i>surface of our planet.</i>

233
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,366
<i>I departed with hopes</i>
<i>of finding</i>
<i>the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

234
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,703
<i>the key to bringing balance</i>
<i>to Cybertron.</i>

235
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,738
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

236
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,072
<i>that we've</i>
<i>returned empty-handed.</i>

237
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,577
<i>This is a setback,</i>
<i>but not a failure.</i>

238
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,814
<i>Rest assured, I will find</i>
<i>the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

239
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,182
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

240
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,818
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

241
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,253
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>I think we all</i>
<i>deserve a little fun!</i>

242
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,889
<i>Tomorrow,</i>
<i>there will be no work.</i>
<i>All shifts off</i>

243
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,661
<i>because tomorrow</i>
<i>is the Iacon 5000!</i>

244
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,930
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

245
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,331
<i>My favorite event.</i>

246
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:27,167
<i>A high-octane race</i>
<i>all across Iacon City.</i>

247
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,773
<i>Let's all see which competitor</i>
<i>can prove they are truly</i>
<i>more than meets the eye.</i>

248
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:41,616
D.

249
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,418
Psst! Hey, D.

250
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,028
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

251
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,965
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

252
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,734
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

253
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,803
All right, what if...
what if...

254
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,204
what if tomorrow

255
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:08,375
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

256
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,044
What if kill you
for waking me up?

257
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,847
No, no, no, hear me out.

258
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,214
We don't even have to win!

259
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,517
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

260
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,887
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

261
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,889
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

262
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,990
Not only would we
go down in history,

263
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,260
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

264
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,162
but we would show everyone
that we're--

265
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,197
we're capable
of so much more!

266
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,465
Or we get
publicly humiliated

267
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,267
and then busted
back to tier one.

268
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,203
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

269
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,138
Pax...
Come on, D.

270
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,306
Pax.

271
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,209
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

272
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,580
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

273
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,848
we can't race.

274
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,916
Come on, let's go.

275
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:50,919
All right, fine.

276
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,020
Yeah, maybe you're right.

277
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,059
Maybe.

278
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,230
The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

279
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,666
I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

280
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,034
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

281
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,770
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

282
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,839
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

283
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,774
I wanted good seats.

284
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,844
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

285
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,978
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,514
Hold up!

287
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:26,320
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

288
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,988
Okay,
where are you taking me?

289
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,292
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

290
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,561
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

291
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,329
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

292
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,798
like, we're joking around,

293
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,466
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

294
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:43,437
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

295
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,744
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000.</i>
<i>There they are.</i>

296
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:55,182
<i>Put your hands together</i>
<i>as today's competitors</i>
<i>are taking the field.</i>

297
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,151
Look! There's
Thunderglide and Behemoth!

298
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:02,222
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

299
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,728
You did this for me?

300
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:07,795
No.

301
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,097
I did this for us.

302
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,237
<i>And now the moment</i>
<i>you've all been waiting for.</i>

303
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,339
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i>

304
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,142
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

305
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:25,613
<i>Quintessons fear him,</i>
<i>but we love him!</i>

306
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,950
<i>Our leader,</i>
<i>the one and only...</i>

307
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,585
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

308
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,352
I love you, Sentinel!

309
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:38,793
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

310
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,432
My friends.
My Cybertronian family.

311
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,536
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

312
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,171
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

313
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:54,809
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

314
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,311
and our Energon supply
dried up.

315
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:01,348
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

316
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,350
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

317
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,354
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

318
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,593
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

319
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,165
Racers, on your marks!

320
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,673
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

321
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:28,308
The best seats
in the house!

322
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,376
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

323
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,979
<i>Get set!</i>

324
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,015
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

325
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,650
Oh, no.

326
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,586
<i>And they're off!</i>

327
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:47,729
Are you crazy?
Sure feels like it.

328
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,734
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i>

329
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,337
I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

330
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,473
Miners!
Those are miners,
like us!

331
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,610
<i>I can't believe</i> <i>what I'm seeing here!
</i> <i>Miners trying to run</i>

332
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,378
<i>in the Iacon 5000!</i>
You've got to be kidding me.

333
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,446
<i>This is insane!</i>

334
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:09,149
There are miners
in the race!
Miners?

335
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,350
No way!
They can't even transform!

336
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,520
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

337
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,559
<i>This is a first</i>
<i>in Iacon 5000 history.</i>

338
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,828
<i>How are they going to survive?</i>

339
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,733
If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!

340
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,401
I accept those terms.

00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,409

343
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,516
Hey, look out!

344
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,621
I owe you one.
More like a thousand.

345
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,658
I can't believe
we're not in last place!

346
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,328
Eat it, miner!

347
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,833
<i>- Darkwing delivers</i> <i>a devastating blow!
- </i> Gotcha!

348
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:07,975
We're not fast enough!
Improvise!

349
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,750
- Hey! Get off!
- Spinout! Big fan!

350
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,485
Hey!
Jetstorm, I'm so sorry.
Big fan!

351
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,888
Get off!

352
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,935
Time it just right!

353
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,937
And... now!

354
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,673
Move!

355
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:44,679
<i>And the miners</i>
<i>have fallen way behind.</i>

356
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,582

357
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:09,336
<i>I don't believe it!</i>
<i>The miners take down Darkwing!</i>

358
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,572
Oh, miners!

359
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,373
Great effort,
Darkwing!

360
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,042
That worked!
It actually worked!

361
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,377
Is this the dumbest thing
we've ever done?

362
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,312
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

363
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,054
No, no, no!

364
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:29,690
Whoa!

365
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,262
Wait!

366
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,763
Go, go, go!

367
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,667
<i>A four-bot pileup</i>
<i>in the magnetic tunnel</i>

368
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,904

369
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:46,373

370
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,612
Ah!

00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,914
D!

372
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:54,916
No. Go. Leave me!

373
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,951
No, we do this together.

374
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,220
<i>One miner is now</i>

375

<i>Paging Dr. Ratchet.</i>
<i>Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.</i>

383

Do not worry.
You will be fixed up
in no time.

384
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:33,888
Did I win?

385
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,388
You participated.

386
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:36,958
Yay!

387
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,328
So...

388
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,462
how long do you think
we'll be here?

389
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:43,965
I'm not talking to you.

390
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,838
You know what?
I can't believe
you made me do that.

391
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,207
We are so screwed!
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

392
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:56,510
Hey, look, I know
it's all a big joke to you.
But not me.

393
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,713
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

394
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,014
And now they're gonna
bust me down

395
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,582
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

396
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,416
I'm sorry, D.

397
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,019
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

398
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:07,121
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

399
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,789
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

400
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,692
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

401
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:14,762
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

402
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:16,998
But it doesn't matter.

403
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,499
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

404
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:22,570
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

405
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:25,106
This is so embarrassing.

406
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:39,854
It's clear.

407
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,192
Orion Pax.

408
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,460
D-16.

409
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:48,963
What you two did today

410
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,666
was one of the
craziest things
I've ever seen.

411
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,268
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

412
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,803
I loved it!

413
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:56,671
You did?

414
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,572
How could anyone
not love it?

415
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:01,375
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

416
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,911
So we're not
getting demoted?

417
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,046
Demoted?

418
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,152
Demoted.

419
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,155
What is happening?

420
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:18,592
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway
into the first shift

421
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:24,298
since the race ended
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

422
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,400
You inspired them
to work harder!

423
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,269
Sentinel Prime, sir,

424
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:32,707
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

425
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,642
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

426
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,912
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

427
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,714
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

428
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,149
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

429
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,051
Wow! Okay, great.

430
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:45,886
That sounds incredible.

431
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,022
I would love to--
Sir, it's time.

432
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,523
Ah, yes.

433
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,058
I'm sorry, friends.

434
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,127
We're preparing
our next travel
to the surface.

435
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,963
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

436
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:59,266
Hang tight.
Airachnid, have someone
escort these heroes

437
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,268
to my personal
service facilities.

438
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,171
Best care in Iacon.

439
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:06,140
Until next time, legends.

440
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:13,647
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

441
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,549
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

442
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:18,452
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

443
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,587
and we're gonna go--

444
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,757
Miners!

445
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,826
Hi, Darkwing.

446
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,263
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No!

447
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,433
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

448
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,036
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

449
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,472
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

450
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:39,874
I'll make sure of that.

451
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,309
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

452
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,745
I hate that guy!

453
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,860
You! How did you get down here?

454
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,662
There's no access to this level.

455
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,697
There is nobody
down here but me.

456
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,100
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

457
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,504
You're others!
You're not... me!

458
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:12,306
You're here,
and you're not me!

459
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,277
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

460
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,879
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

461
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:21,048
I just haven't had
a lot of company

462
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:23,117
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

463
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,555
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

464
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,089
That's what I thought!

465
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,058
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

466
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,860
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

467
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:34,395
How long have you
been down here?

468
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,930
How long have I been here?

469
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,100
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

470
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,870
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

471
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,772
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

472
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,808
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

473
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,176
But you can call me B.

474
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,911
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

475
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,481
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

476
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,485
- Which is actually pronounced...
- "Badassatron."

477
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,786
But if you have any critiques--

478
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,789
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

479
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:03,757
Great question. You don't.

480
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,226
We don't?
Nope.

481
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,461
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

482
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,732
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

483
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,768
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

484
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,203
Which is?
Oh!

485
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,373
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

486
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:21,008
onto the conveyor belt.

487
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,944
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

488
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,714
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

489
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,949
So you watch garbage burn.

490
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,151
Yes!

491
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,852
It is so great
that you're here now.

492
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,821
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

493
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,456
And then tell you
everything about me!

494
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,560
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

495
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,827
with one or two
new best friends.

496
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,996
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

497
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,532
Where are my manners?

498
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,567
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

499
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:47,868
Hey, guys, we've got company!

500
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,205
This is EP-508,

501
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:55,042
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

502
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,546
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

503
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,548
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

504
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,782
Um, they're not real.

505
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,285
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

506
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:05,853
It's just
you've been down here a--

507
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,522
No, I was talking to Steve.

508
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,024
Classic Steve.

509
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,859
What is that?
Look at this guy.

510
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:15,196
It's coming from inside.

511
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,298
Oh! Steve! No!

512
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:20,669
- I am so sorry.
- Steve, no!

513
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,037
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

514
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,474
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

515
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,078
<i>Calling the High Guard</i>
<i>for immediate support.</i>
<i>Immediate support!</i>

516
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,180
That's Alpha Trion.

517
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,616
One of the Primes?

518
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,884
<i>Repeat,</i>
<i>Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

519
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:39,554
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

520
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:43,290
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>

521
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,896
Holy Primus!

522
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,132
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

523
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:56,837
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

524
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,374
Which means
this is where we could find

525
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,443
the Matrix of Leadership.

526
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:06,080
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

527
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,582
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

528
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:10,417
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

529
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:13,254
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

530
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,788
You already tried
to "show everyone"

531
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,423
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

532
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:17,726
which got us
stuck down here

533
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:20,361
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

534
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,030
really cool guy.

535
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:25,199
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

536
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,234
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

537
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:28,637
It's dangerous!

538
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,338
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

539
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,840
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

540
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:36,076
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

541
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,612
Forever? This is great!

542
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:39,581
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

543
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,549
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

544
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:43,851
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

545
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,286
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

546
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,054
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

547
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,223
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

548
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:53,662
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

549
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,463
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

550
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:59,366
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

551
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,603
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

552
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,204
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

553
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,541
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

554
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,976
Easy. I know a way.

555
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,579
But it won't be easy.

556
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,248
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

557
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,751
Warn me next time, please.
 My mouth was open.

558
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,453
Only 49 sublevels to go!

559
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,289
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

560
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,425
that go all the way
to the surface.

561
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,994
Yeah, but they don't allow passengers.
 The trains are autonomous.

562
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,330
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

563
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:32,199
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

564
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,974
That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

565
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,083
Hold up! One more.

566
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,388
I'll lock it down.

567
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,332
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

568
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:08,636
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

569
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,672
Got her!

570
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,840
No, wait, I--

571
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,107
Elita! Stop!

572
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,942
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

573
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,443
Security! Sound the ala--

574
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,885
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

575
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,857
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

576
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,291
So am I. To ruin your life.

577
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:44,773
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

578
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,374
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

579
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,010
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

580
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,478
Well, she's gone.

581
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,394
Whoa!

582
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,532
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

583
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:11,965
Climb faster!

584
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,215
Gotcha!

585
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,217
Ah, the surface.

586
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,153
It's beautiful.

587
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:12,092
I am speechless.

588
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:15,195
Elita, listen to me.

589
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,397
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

590
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:19,433
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

591
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,971
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

592
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:25,372
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

593
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:27,174
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

594
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,744
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

595
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,078
What?
Look.

596
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,247
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

597
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,148
and then we found this message.

598
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,351
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

599
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:40,555
or scout
the locations ourselves.

600
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:42,089
Whichever comes first.

601
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:45,560
This was too important to wait.

602
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,328
It will change all of our lives.

603
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,665
No, no, no, no.

604
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,902
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

605
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,004
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the--

606
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,939
Hey, guys? Guys?

607
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:59,007
What is that?

608
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,812
Is it getting bigger?

609
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,682
Or closer?

610
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:17,759
No, no, no, no, no, no!

611
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,129
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

612
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,130
It's closed!

613
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,599
Oh, come on!

614
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:33,641
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

615
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,131
<i>Elita?</i>

616
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,603
Elita?

617
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:02,971
You okay?

618
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,207
Please stop
punching me in the face.

619
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,576
Can you help?

620
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,243
Iacon-- The train--

621
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:13,615
Where's the train?
Relax, okay? Here it comes.

622
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,449
And there it goes.

623
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,753
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

624
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:30,698
Okay, so I think
this is us,

625
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:33,333
and if we follow
the path to--
Now you listen to me,

626
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,803
Mr. "Zero Seconds
Since My Last Accident"!

627
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:38,873
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

628
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:42,777
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

629
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,647
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

630
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,781
back to Iacon City

631
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,517
and to the first
supervisor depot we see,

632
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,486
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

633
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,321
using words that reflect me

634
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:56,557
in a very positive light!
Got it?

635
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,960
Yeah, okay.
Deal. Great. All right.

636
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,228
Let's go!
She's joining us?

637
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,730
Fantastic!

638
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:06,266
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

639
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,468
Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

640
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:12,205
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

641
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,742
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

642
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,577
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

643
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,880
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

644
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:22,482
- Actually, it's pronounced...
- "Badassatron,"

645
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,553
in case you were wondering.

646
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,690
Badassatron.

647
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,490
You like that, right?

648
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,860
Badass--
I'm gonna need you
to talk less.

649
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,461
Sure! No-- Yeah, no problem.

650
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,030
What am I talking less about,
my nickname?

651
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:38,465
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

652
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,400
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

653
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,369
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

654
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,604
I can't help it.

655
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:45,840
D, we're really doing this.

656
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:49,409
So glad
I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

657
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,112
I'm just having a good time.

658
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,580
How much further
is the Matrix on the map?

659
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:53,981
Make an educated guesstimate.

660
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:56,150
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

661
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,919

Hey, look,
there's more of it over here.

666
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,063
What is it?
It's not metal.

667
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:12,834
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

668
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,168
So are they.

Um...

673
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,222
I think this is not right.
We should go.

674
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,923
Yeah, good idea.
Run!

675
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:38,458
What are we running from?

676
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,186
- What is that?
- Oh, no.

677
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,320
- It's a Quintesson ship.
- What?

678
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,091
What do we do?
What do we do?
Shh! Quiet.

679
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,303
It's scanning for life-forms.
Move, move!

680
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,077
Wait!

681
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,949
Go, go, go, go!

682
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,758
Come on!

683
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,860
They're not gonna make it.

684
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,070
Whoa.

685
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:14,689
What-- What were they
searching for?

686
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,557
Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

687
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,926
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

688
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,895
This way.
We're close.

689
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,764
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

690
00:39:23,898 --> 00:39:26,801
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

691
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:52,459
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

692
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,003
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

693
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:04,105
Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

694
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,173
Okay, yep, we're going in.

695
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:08,609
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

696
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,511
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

697
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,581
This is ridiculous.

698
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,873
I don't believe it.

699
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,975
The Primes.

700
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,778
We're here.

701
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:21,782
Megatronus Prime.

702
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:37,598
Zeta Prime.

703
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:41,869
The Matrix!

704
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:46,540
It's gone.

705
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,277
Let's keep looking.

706
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:18,672
Hey, guys!

707
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:38,392
It's Alpha Trion!

708
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,661
He's powered down.

709
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:44,198
But his spark is still lit.

710
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:04,418
Quintesson ambush!

711
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:06,187
Attack!

712
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:10,091
Message before--

713
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:12,760
Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

714
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,428
You're safe now.

715
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:16,197
The war is over.

716
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:40,221
I failed you, old friend.

717
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:44,892
You deserved
so much better than this end.

718
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,394
No, you didn't fail.

719
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:50,264
We heard your message.
We've come to find
the Matrix.

720
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:53,934
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

721
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,537
Who are you?

722
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,038
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

723
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,908
Miners? Why?

724
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,476
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

725
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:04,579
ever since
it stopped flowing.

726
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:05,813
Impossible.

727
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:08,015
That's why we came.
To fix things.

728
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:10,050
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

729
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:11,852
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

730
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:15,624
Sentinel is no Prime.

731
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,959
What?
He's broken.
Fantastic.

732
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:20,828
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

733
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,564
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

734
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:24,865
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

735
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,836
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

736
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,839
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

737
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:35,142
Come. I will show you.

738
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:44,553
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

739
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,922
had been a brutal conflict.

740
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:55,796
<i>Until Sentinel,</i>
<i>the principal aide</i>
<i>to the Primes,</i>

741
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,600
<i>intercepted</i>
<i>an enemy transmission.</i>

742
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:03,704
<i>There was going to be</i>
<i>a secret gathering</i>
<i>of Quintesson commanders.</i>

743
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,340
<i>Their elimination</i>
<i>could end the war.</i>

744
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:12,479
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

745
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:16,884
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

746
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:19,588
here in this cave.

747
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,422
But we were not alone.

748
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,092
- Quintessons!
- They're here!

749
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:26,695
It's a trap!
Battle positions!

750
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,263
- Hold the line!
- Primus be with us!

751
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,468
For Cybertron!

752
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,210
<i>We were outnumbered,</i>
<i>but stood as one.</i>

753
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,414
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

754
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,987
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

755
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,080
Sentinel, why?

756
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:23,017
For all the power
of Cybertron.

757
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:32,192
<i>But Sentinel never</i>
<i>understood the true power</i>
<i>of what he desired.</i>

758
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:36,230
<i>The Matrix of Leadership</i>
<i>can only be wielded</i>

759
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:41,536
<i>by one that Primus himself</i>
<i>deems worthy.</i>

760
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:47,174
<i>And Sentinel</i>
<i>most certainly was not.</i>

761
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,343
No!

762
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:58,485
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

763
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,020
No.

764
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:02,557
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

765
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:04,425
Why would Sentinel
do that?

766
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:05,926
To make a bargain.

767
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,861
A bargain? With who?

768
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:14,368
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

769
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,041
The Quintessons.

770
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,544
There are so many.

771
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:45,999
He's here.

772
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,203
Sentinel Prime is here.

773
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,305
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

774
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:07,481
I load those crates.

775
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:10,017
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

776
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,586
I don't understand.

777
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:14,589
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

778
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,061
Our Energon.

779
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:29,236
Traitor!
D, no.

780
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:44,084
I know what
I promised you

781
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:47,187
but our mines,
they're running out!

782
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,557
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

783
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,495
I swear I will
get you the rest.

784
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,636
Triple-time
every mining shift.

785
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,606
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

786
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,440
All of it! Let's go.

787
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:26,326
Now you have seen the truth.

788
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,265
Every day...

789
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,639
Every single day
of my life

790
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:40,407
has been a lie.

791
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:42,510
My God, I knew it!

792
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:45,613
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

793
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:47,815
He deceived everyone.

794
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:53,153
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

795
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:54,956
I can't believe it.

796
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:56,390
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

797
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,258
I just saw it,
but I still...

798
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,494
I can't believe it.

799
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:03,297
Sentinel lied

800
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,399
- to my face.
- It was all a sham.

801
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:08,268
How could we
have been so gullible?

802
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,973
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

803
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,279
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

804
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,248
Me? What did I do?

805
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,116
You just had
to go to the surface,

806
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,152
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

807
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,822
You just had to break protocol!

808
00:51:27,956 --> 00:51:30,324
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

809
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,960
I care!

810
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,862
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

811
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:36,263
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

812
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,365
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

813
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:42,135
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

814
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,339
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

815
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:47,407
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

816
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,142
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

817
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,778
That's the whole thing!

818
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,081
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

819
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:57,552
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

820
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,053
Don't you want
to stop him?

821
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,288
No, I want to kill him!

822
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,925
I want to put Sentinel in chains

823
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:05,459
and march him
through the mines

824
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:08,896
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

825
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,333
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

826
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,803
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

827
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:17,304
what I want, right, Pax?

828
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:21,109
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

829
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:27,982
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

830
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:33,888
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

831
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:37,025
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

832
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,028
and this slot's
always been empty.

833
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,829
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

834
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:45,533
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

835
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:49,871
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

836
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:55,242
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

837
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,210
He took them from us.

838
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,414
What defines a Transformer...

839
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,784
...is not the cog
in his chest

840
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:07,822
but the spark
that resides in their core.

841
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:13,594
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

842
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:17,699
My fellow Primes had that spark.

843
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:22,235
And I see their strength
in you.

844
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:30,277
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

845
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:32,412
Prima.

846
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:34,816
Onyx.

847
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,951
Alchemist.

848
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:38,786
Micronus.

849
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,659
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

850
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:48,963
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

851
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:20,094
They were one. You are one.

852
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:23,296
All are one!

853
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:39,514
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

854
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,917
The ability
to change your world.

855
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:48,556
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

856
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:54,461
They've found us.

857
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,031
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

858
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,434
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

859
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:07,542
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

860
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,410
Use it to reveal the truth.

861
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:12,412
We will.

862
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:14,515
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

863
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:17,417
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

864
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:19,020
We're out of time.

865
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,521
We got to move!

866
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:23,356
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

867
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,793
Your fight will come,
my friend.

868
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:29,297
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

869
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,232
But this fight...

870
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,167
This fight is mine.

871
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,870
Now go!

872
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,082
Stand down, old timer.

873
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:51,085
Ah. Old, you say?

874
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,050
Not too old for you.

875
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:29,757
We need to hurry!

876
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:31,525
I still think
we have better odds

877
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,327
fighting than outrunning them.

878
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,163
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

879
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:39,333
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

880
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,068
On three. One--

881
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:50,745
Ah!

882
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,718
How do we use these things?

883
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,887
I don't know. Just try.

884
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:04,625
It's working. Ha! It's working!

885
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,193
My head! My head!

886
00:57:06,327 --> 00:57:07,261
Whoa!

887
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:09,429
Help! Help!

888
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:16,604
This is not faster!

889
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,208
Oh, come on!

890
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:24,612
And transform!

891
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,649
Wheels! I need wheels!

892
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,193
Whoa.

893
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,616
Ha!

894
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:06,687
Oh, wow.

895
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,122
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

896
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,158
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

897
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,499
Yes!

898
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,005
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

899
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:27,942
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

900
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,077
We transform!

901
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:31,379
Oh, hey! I know.

902
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,647
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

903
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:34,815
Looks like the fastest way

904
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:36,617
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

905
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,019
Hey, what are you doing?

906
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:39,787
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

907
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,957
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

908
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:49,697
I... got... it.

909
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:52,900
Okay.

910
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,139
Follow me.

911
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:06,914
Alpha Trion!

912
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:10,084
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

913
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,920
You look horrible.

914
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:17,758
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

915
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,961
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

916
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:24,799
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

917
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:26,367
Anything to get
out of working for you

918
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,669
and that boring
council of elders.

919
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,838
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

920
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,740
spend half the day
losing a war

921
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:37,812
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

922
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,246
And now look at you.

923
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,917
Hear my words:
You will fall.

924
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,186
And a new Prime will rise--

925
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,587
There you go again.

926
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,558
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

927
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,393
There were others
in the cave with you.

928
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:53,461
Who are they?

929
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,565
They are to be your undoing.

930
00:59:56,697 --> 01:00:00,901
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

931
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:10,211
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

932
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:11,712
You heard me, right?

933
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:14,048
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

934
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,284
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

935
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,055
Okay. Hunt down the others.

936
01:00:21,188 --> 01:00:22,623
With pleasure.

937
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,307
Hey, buddy.

938
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,343
Oh. Hey.

939
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:46,881
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

940
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:51,152
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

941
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:54,822
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

942
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:59,193
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

943
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,263
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

944
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:04,465
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

945
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,467
They worship Sentinel.

946
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,502
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

947
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:11,472
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

948
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:13,874
I trusted Sentinel!

949
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,409
With everything.

950
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:22,016
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

951
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,953
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

952
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,033
All right,
wake them up.

953
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:05,326
Now, are you spies

954
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:09,263
or just incompetent lackeys?

955
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:12,132
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

956
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:16,403
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

957
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:21,041
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

958
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:25,680
Uh, why is he gagged?

959
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,248
He wouldn't stop talking.

960
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,882
Even when he was
unconscious?

961
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:31,252
Especially when
he was unconscious!

962
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:32,554
Enough!

963
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,723
Two options for you!

964
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:39,694
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

965
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:42,429
and really make sure
you feel it.

966
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:43,531
Or two:

967
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:45,165
In exchange
for a quick death,

968
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,736
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

969
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:49,537
access to the mines

970
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:53,508
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

971
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:54,908
Who exactly are you guys?

972
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,746
Ah!

973
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:00,781
The Cybertronian High Guard!

974
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:02,517
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

975
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:05,620
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

976
01:03:05,754 --> 01:03:08,422
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

977
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:11,992
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

978
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,794
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

979
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:16,531
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

980
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:19,433
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

981
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,901
Silence!

982
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:23,203
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

983
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:24,004
Whoo!

984
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:25,674
We were once the High Guard.

985
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:29,476
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

986
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:32,379
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

987
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:35,182
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

988
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,950
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

989
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:40,722
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

990
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:43,123
I'm just saying we're allies.

991
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:45,025
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

992
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:49,229
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

993
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:53,367
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

994
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,439
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

995
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:03,344
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

996
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:05,312
Yeah. Just a little.

997
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:06,581
Hey!

998
01:04:06,715 --> 01:04:08,349
What are you doing?

999
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:13,253
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1000
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:17,191
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1001
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:19,360
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1002
01:04:19,493 --> 01:04:22,129
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1003
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:24,365
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1004
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:26,568
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1005
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:27,968
Today!

1006
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:31,639
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1007
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:35,677
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1008
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,512
Is that right?

1009
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,548
Well, how can you say so

1010
01:04:40,682 --> 01:04:42,517
with my head in your teeth?

1011
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,051
D!

1012
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,059
Whoa!

1013
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:58,399
Hit me!

1014
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:01,803
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

1015
01:05:01,935 --> 01:05:05,540
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1016
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:12,379
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1017
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:14,649
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1018
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:17,484
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1019
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,070
Please! I beg you!

1020
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:40,240
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1021
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,311
Bear witness!

1022
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:47,147
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1023
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,684
Decide right now:

1024
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:54,388
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

1025
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:57,859
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1026
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:01,529
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1027
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:08,570
D-16! D-16! D-16!

1028
01:06:35,597 --> 01:06:36,764
B, come on!

1029
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:04,626
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1030
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,357
Elita, get down!

1031
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:02,249
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1032
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,686
Where are the others?

1033
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:08,723
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1034
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:10,558
They got D-16 and B.

1035
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,292
Oh, no.

1036
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,228
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1037
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:18,700
Our proof.

1038
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,367
It's gone.

1039
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,170
So, what do we do now?

1040
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,839
D was right.

1041
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:27,341
About what?
Everything.

1042
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:31,345
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1043
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:32,647
It's all my fault.

1044
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,882
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1045
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:44,324
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1046
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,693
Are you listening?

1047
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,697
I'm better than you.

1048
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:52,399
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1049
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,802
I'm better than you
in every way,

1050
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:57,005
except you have hope.

1051
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:00,775
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1052
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:04,746
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1053
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,814
Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1054
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,415
My point is,

1055
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:12,654
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1056
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:15,723
This blind optimism
that you have

1057
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:20,528
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1058
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:23,131
that are also extremely stupid.

1059
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:25,767
First time
giving a pep talk?

1060
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,401
You're inspiring.

1061
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:31,005
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1062
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,776
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1063
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:39,312
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1064
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,516
Listen to me.

1065
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:43,584
We can do this.

1066
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:49,023
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

1067
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:51,592
If we intercepted one--

1068
01:09:51,726 --> 01:09:54,762
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1069
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:59,867
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1070
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:03,838
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1071
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:07,508
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1072
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:10,745
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1073
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,181
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1074
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:16,517
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1075
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:20,220
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1076
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,591
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1077
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,126
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1078
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,162
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1079
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:33,333
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1080
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:36,470
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1081
01:10:36,604 --> 01:10:38,472
Why should we follow you?

1082
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,842
We will follow you.

1083
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:44,244
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1084
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,246
What is our first move?

1085
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:47,715
We roll out.

1086
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,084
What?

1087
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:51,418
Louder.

1088
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:54,287
Transform and roll out!

1089
01:11:03,798 --> 01:11:07,400
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1090
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:10,905
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1091
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:12,807
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1092
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,476
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1093
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:19,113
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1094
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:20,380
Oh-ho-ho!

1095
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:23,117
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

1096
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,485
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

1097
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,088
so that your death
is painful!

1098
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:28,321
You'll regret
the day you were--

1099
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,290
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1100
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,161
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1101
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:37,265
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1102
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,332
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1103
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:41,936
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1104
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:45,506
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1105
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,242
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1106
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,476
None of that is true!

1107
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,978
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1108
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:53,915
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1109
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:57,985
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1110
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:09,197
Well, well.
What's this about?

1111
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:12,567
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1112
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,535
Feeling confident, are we?

1113
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:17,939
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1114
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,106
Please.

1115
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:23,211
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1116
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,646
You took it all.

1117
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:28,115
I sure did.

1118
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,821
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1119
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:37,892
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

1120
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:41,095
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1121
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,699
That's why,
after I killed him,

1122
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:47,602
I took his cog for myself.

1123
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:50,204
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1124
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:52,240
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1125
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:55,343
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1126
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:56,711
Here.

1127
01:12:57,678 --> 01:13:00,982
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1128
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,203
Okay.

1129
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:24,972
I can do this.

1130
01:13:38,286 --> 01:13:41,789
You can't be serious.
 We just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1131
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,557
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1132
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,826
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1133
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,363
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

1134
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:57,104
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

1135
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:58,272
That can't be him.

1136
01:13:58,406 --> 01:13:59,640
Is that...

1137
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,109
It can't be.

1138
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:04,545
Orion?
Jazz.

1139
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:05,880
Is it really you?

1140
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,416
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1141
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:09,884
"Little"?

1142
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:11,752
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1143
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:13,654
Uh, how is this possible?

1144
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:16,824
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1145
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,527
Sentinel is a liar.

1146
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,529
What?
Huh?

1147
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,664
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1148
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:27,068
I was never
the most focused miner.

1149
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,637
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1150
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:42,016
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1151
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:44,819
My friends,

1152
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:49,223
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1153
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:53,094
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1154
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:56,597
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1155
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:59,033
He stole our freedom.

1156
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:08,242
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1157
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:12,847
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1158
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:17,284
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1159
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:19,520
Right now.

1160
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:23,524
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

1161
01:15:25,393 --> 01:15:29,430
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1162
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:32,199
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1163
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:36,337
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1164
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,241
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

1165
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,777
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1166
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:46,580
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1167
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,649
We are not alone in this.

1168
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:51,485
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1169
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,020
we will have to
fight for it.

1170
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:56,525
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1171
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:58,527
...for ourselves.

1172
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,730
Stand up for this injustice.

1173
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:08,969
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1174
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,205
Follow me.

1175
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:14,108
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1176
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:17,745
Together as one.

1177
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:22,349
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1178
01:16:22,483 --> 01:16:24,952
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1179
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:26,020
You got it.

1180
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:28,756
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1181
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:43,270
Not a good idea.

1182
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:47,741
D, stay down.

1183
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:00,955
Well, that's a shame.

1184
01:17:01,088 --> 01:17:03,224
You really were
a great miner.

1185
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:10,197
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

1186
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:22,042
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1187
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:24,445
High Guard, eject.

1188
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:26,515
Come on! Move out!

1189
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:43,731
There's too many.
We have to abort!

1190
01:17:49,069 --> 01:17:50,204
We're not gonna make it.

1191
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:53,874
Whoo-hoo!

1192
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,544
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1193
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,178
Let's break some protocol!

1194
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:59,280
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1195
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,925
Whoa! That's intense.

1196
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:15,996
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1197
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:18,399
That's right, you do.

1198
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:21,702
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1199
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:36,217
What's going on?

1200
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,722
Hey!

1201
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:48,429
What has he done to you?

1202
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:51,633
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1203
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,703
Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1204
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,710
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1205
01:19:01,842 --> 01:19:03,811
I'm doing this my way.
D!

1206
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,984
Yes!

1207
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,218
Whoa!

1208
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:12,654
Whoa-ho-ho!

1209
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:14,255
I got a battle mask!

1210
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,692
Elita! Battle mask!

1211
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:20,662
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

1212
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,997
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

1213
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:27,067
What the--?

1214
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,905
Badassatron.

1215
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,079
Where's Sentinel?

1216
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,417
You pathetic little twits.

1217
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:47,689
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

1218
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:51,559
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
What truth?

1219
01:19:51,693 --> 01:19:54,361
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1220
01:19:54,495 --> 01:19:56,665
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

1221
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:57,965
and live like a king?

1222
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,968
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1223
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:05,272
...is what I make it.

1224
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:08,375
Incoming!

1225
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:11,513
Whoa!

1226
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:16,718
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

1227
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,886
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

1228
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:21,288
We need her memory.
Where is she?

1229
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:23,090
Found her!

1230
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:25,492
Elita!

1231
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:27,428
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1232
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:28,862
<i>Bring her</i>
<i>to the broadcast station.</i>

1233
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,064
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1234
01:20:30,197 --> 01:20:32,232
Easier said than done.

1235
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:52,286
<i>I said,</i>
<i>don't break her!</i>

1236
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:55,623
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1237
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:02,664
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1238
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:04,131
I can see that.

1239
01:21:04,264 --> 01:21:06,300
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1240
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:08,502
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

1241
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:13,006
Yeah!

1242
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:34,428
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

1243
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,070
B!

1244
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:45,939
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

1245
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,643
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

1246
01:21:48,777 --> 01:21:50,177
It was already like that.
Right?

1247
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,445
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

1248
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:54,014
Yeah, it was already like--
Yes. Mm-hmm.

1249
01:21:58,352 --> 01:21:59,953
<i>Attention, Iacon City.</i>

1250
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:03,957
<i>Stand by for</i>
<i>a live transmission</i>
<i>from Sentinel Prime.</i>

1251
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,265
What's wrong, D-16?

1252
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:13,333
Rise up!

1253
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,540
<i>That's why after I killed him--</i>

1254
01:22:18,673 --> 01:22:22,844
<i>That's why after I killed him,</i>
<i>I took his cog for myself.</i>

1255
01:22:22,976 --> 01:22:24,913
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

1256
01:22:25,045 --> 01:22:28,982
<i>What truth?</i>
<i>That I plucked the cogs</i>
<i>from your newborn chests?</i>

1257
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,552
<i>Forced you to mine</i>
<i>so that I could pay off</i>

1258
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:32,654
<i>the Quintessons</i>
<i>and live like a king?</i>

1259
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:34,221
<i>What truth?</i>

1260
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:36,156
<i>That I plucked the cogs</i>
<i>from your newborn chests?</i>

1261
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,926
<i>Forced you to mine</i>
<i>so that I could pay off</i>

1262
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:40,093
<i>the Quintessons</i>
<i>and live like a king?</i>

1263
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:41,930
<i>I'm working my miners</i>
<i>as hard as I can.</i>

1264
01:22:42,062 --> 01:22:44,699
<i>I swear I will</i>
<i>get you the rest!</i>

1265
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:46,835
<i>I'm working my miners</i>
<i>as hard as I can.</i>

1266
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:49,671
<i>I swear I will</i>
<i>get you the rest!</i>

1267
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:52,372
<i>I'm working my miners</i>
<i>as hard as I can, I swear--</i>

1268
01:22:52,507 --> 01:22:53,875
Liar!

1269
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,713
We trusted you!

1270
01:22:59,446 --> 01:23:00,380
Traitor!

1271
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:02,550
Pax, we did it.

1272
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,362
D!

1273
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,324
D-16.

1274
01:23:44,993 --> 01:23:47,461
We can lead Cybertron together!

1275
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:48,763
Don't do this!

1276
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:56,103
What are you doing?

1277
01:23:56,236 --> 01:23:57,805
It's over, D.

1278
01:23:57,939 --> 01:23:59,941
Everyone in Iacon
knows the truth.

1279
01:24:00,073 --> 01:24:01,475
So do I!

1280
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:04,812
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

1281
01:24:04,946 --> 01:24:06,346
No, you don't.

1282
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,117
Rebuilding Iacon
cannot begin
with an execution.

1283
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,554
He deserves to die!
Can't you see that?

1284
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:16,056
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

1285
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:19,293
Pax,

1286
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:23,330
you need to move
out of my way
before I move you myself.

1287
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:25,800
D, listen--

1288
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:35,009
Stop!

1289
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:47,989
No!

1290
01:24:48,121 --> 01:24:50,357
No, no, no, no. Why?

1291
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:53,595
Why did you do that? Why?

1292
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:05,807
D, no.

1293
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,447
I'm done saving you.

1294
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:56,084
The Age of Primes has ended!

1295
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,385
No more false prophets!

1296
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:02,924
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

1297
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:06,094
Rise up!

1298
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:08,129
Rise up! Rise up!

1299
01:27:08,261 --> 01:27:11,298
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

1300
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:13,601
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

1301
01:27:13,735 --> 01:27:16,704
<i>your noble sacrifice</i>
<i>for the greater good</i>

1302
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:21,241
<i>has proven you worthy</i>
<i>in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1303
01:27:21,876 --> 01:27:24,145
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1304
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:27,081
the future of Cybertron

1305
01:27:27,215 --> 01:27:32,787
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1306
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,592
I will lead us all
into the future!

1307
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:55,643
I...

1308
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,512
am...

1309
01:27:58,212 --> 01:28:00,081
Megatron!

1310
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,784
<i>Arise...</i>

1311
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,887
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1312
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,792
Burn it down!

1313
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:12,794
All of it!

1314
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:21,468
All hail Megatron!

1315
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,773
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

1316
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:28,643
Stop! It's over.

1317
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:32,780
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1318
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:07,715
Impossible.

1319
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:13,855
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1320
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:16,224
We could've built
the future together.

1321
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:18,226
I'll build it myself.

1322
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:22,029
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1323
01:30:03,503 --> 01:30:04,739
Ah!

1324
01:31:06,634 --> 01:31:09,704
We were given the power
to change our world

1325
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,306
and you chose to destroy it.

1326
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,674
Just like Sentinel.

1327
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:17,878
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1328
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:22,249
And you betrayed me.

1329
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,362
Go.

1330
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,999
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1331
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,870
You are banished from Iacon.

1332
01:31:47,575 --> 01:31:50,044
It didn't have to end
this way.

1333
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:55,883
This isn't over, Prime.

1334
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:05,826
High Guard, follow me!

1335
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:21,642
<i>The line</i>
<i>between friend and enemy</i>

1336
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:24,779
<i>is not as clear</i>
<i>as I once believed.</i>

1337
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:28,716
<i>Once it's crossed,</i>
<i>there's no going back.</i>

1338
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:32,753
<i>Because some transformations</i>
<i>are permanent.</i>

1339
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:34,655
Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1340
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:36,791
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1341
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:38,659
The greatest Prime
to ever live.

1342
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:43,264
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

1343
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:45,566
You ever mine Energon before?

1344
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:46,901
No. You?

1345
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:49,370
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1346
01:32:49,937 --> 01:32:51,138
Well, I'll tell you what.

1347
01:32:51,272 --> 01:32:53,974
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1348
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:55,242
All right.

1349
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:58,112
Thanks, Pax.

1350
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,294
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1351
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,362
And a new leader.

1352
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:17,164
Yes, about that.

1353
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:22,369
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1354
01:33:22,503 --> 01:33:24,138
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1355
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:26,674
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1356
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:29,677
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1357
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:32,480
How's Major Elita sound?

1358
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:35,149
How about Commander?

1359
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:36,717
Even better.

1360
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:40,888
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1361
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:42,756
I may be a Prime now,

1362
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,358
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1363
01:33:44,492 --> 01:33:47,962
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

1364
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:50,131
I get to work
for the government.

1365
01:33:50,264 --> 01:33:53,834
Okay. So that's new.

1366
01:33:53,968 --> 01:33:55,870
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

1367
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:30,004
<i>And now we stand here</i>
<i>together as one...</i>

1368
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:35,142
<i>proving we all have</i>
<i>the power to transform,</i>

1369
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:38,345
<i>to become</i>
<i>who we were destined to be,</i>

1370
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:43,083
<i>to right wrongs,</i>
<i>to make our world better.</i>

1371
01:34:43,217 --> 01:34:46,220
<i>Because here,</i>
<i>freedom and autonomy</i>

1372
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:49,323
<i>are the rights</i>
<i>of all sentient beings.</i>

1373
01:34:50,224 --> 01:34:54,995
<i>Here,</i>
<i>all are truly Autobots.</i>

1374
01:34:56,197 --> 01:34:59,534
<i>This message is a warning</i>
<i>to all Quintessons.</i>

1375
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:05,272
<i>If you dare</i>
<i>return to Cybertron,</i>
<i>the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1376
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:08,008
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1377
01:35:08,142 --> 01:35:12,179
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1378
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:42,176
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1379
01:35:42,309 --> 01:35:44,411
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1380
01:35:44,546 --> 01:35:46,347
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1381
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,017
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1382
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,186
Watch this. Knife hands!

1383
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:55,122
No!

1384
01:43:19,701 --> 01:43:23,503
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1385
01:43:23,638 --> 01:43:27,307
<i>But his death has given life</i>
<i>to a new enemy.</i>

1386
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:29,476
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1387
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:31,879
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1388
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:37,018
<i>We will not be blinded</i>
<i>by his deception.</i>

1389
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:39,854
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1390
01:43:40,722 --> 01:43:42,623
Decepticons!

1391
01:43:42,757 --> 01:43:44,291
Rise up!

1392
01:43:44,424 --> 01:43:47,895
Rise up! Rise up!
