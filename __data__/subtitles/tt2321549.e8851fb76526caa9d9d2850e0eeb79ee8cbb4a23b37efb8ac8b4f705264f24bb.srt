1
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,665
Mum!

2
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,594
Mum!

3
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:46,069
Mummy!

4
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,781
Mum!

5
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,279
Mum!

6
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,535
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,332
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

8
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:12,750
"straight into
the huge black pot.

9
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:17,010
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:23,143
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

11
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,721
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,226
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,395
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,817
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,356
It's very late.

16
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,287
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:46,033
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact-

18
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:51,088
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,365
What have you done?

20
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,199
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,578
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,753
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:12,954
Please don't!

24
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,007
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,634
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,212
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,463
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,801
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,717
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,308
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

31
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,308
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

32
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:34,519
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

33
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:44,783
Mmm.

34
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,284
Don't do that!

35
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,464
Ready?

36
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,342
Come on.

37
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,468
Quick. You're late already.

38
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,261
What have you got in there?

39
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:07,763
See you later, alligator.

40
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,938
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

41
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,104
What?

42
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,063
One with your milk in it.

43
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,941
I don't want milk.

44
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,825
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

45
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:34,463
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

46
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,870
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

47
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:38,920
Do you want a cuppa?

48
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,957
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

49
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,041
Aw.

50
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,128
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

51
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:47,724
Right?

52
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:53,437
Amelia?

53
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,185
Your son's school
is on the phone.

54
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,811
Oh, my God.

55
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,229
Did he hurt anyone?

56
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,650
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

57
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,779
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

58
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,111
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

59
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,832
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

60
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:16,992
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

61
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,285
Monitor?

62
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,251
He'll be separated
from the other children.

63
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:23,089
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

64
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,465
Samuel won't cope with this.

65
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:25,925
He already feels so different.

66
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:28,802
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

67
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:29,922
Mrs Fanning,

68
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,391
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

69
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,261
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

70
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,515
What he needs
is some understanding.

71
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,225
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

72
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,730
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

73
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,360
I think I'll just find
another school.

74
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,856
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

75
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,909
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

76
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,693
that sees my son
as a human being

77
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,699
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

78
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,710
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

79
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:59,159
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

80
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,379
His name is Samuel.

81
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:11,511
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

82
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:13,676
You can play
on that swing you like

83
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:15,597
for <i>as</i> long as you like, OK?

84
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:18,636
Mrs Bruen hates me.

85
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,275
No, she doesn't.

86
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,736
Just need a break, that's all.

87
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,030
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

88
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,276
I'll tell her later.

89
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,416
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,915
Sam, don't bother the lady.

91
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,535
No, no, no. That's alright.

92
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:44,423
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

93
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,051
My dad's in the cemetery.

94
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,249
Oh. That's...

95
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,263
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

96
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,963
Samuel.

97
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,387
I'm sorry. He just...

98
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:57,259
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

99
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,392
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

100
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,180
We have to go.

101
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,400
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

102
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,481
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

103
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,150
Right in front of
his own installation.

104
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,148
Lost all these sales.

105
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,191
You're not listening.

106
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,943
I am. I am.

107
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:18,074
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

108
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,077
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

109
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,659
Mum! Mum!

110
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,508
I'm gonna <i>smash</i> its head!

111
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:30,845
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

112
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,180
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

113
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,353
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

114
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,646
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

115
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,774
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

116
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:51,062
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

117
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,653
She wants to have
a princess party.

118
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:54,899
Mum! Mum!

119
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
That's OK.

120
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,653
We don't have to come.

121
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,613
You can still come.

122
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:01,739
Mum!

123
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,959
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,038
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

125
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,382
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

126
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:14,465
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

127
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,754
this year, anyway.

128
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,089
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

129
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,843
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

130
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,848
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

131
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,054
and I end up feeling awful.

132
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,640
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

133
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,559
We'll be fine.

134
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,734
We'll be absolutely fine.

135
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,484
Mum! Look at me!

136
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,782
Mama!

137
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,161
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

138
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,163
You look tired, little one.

139
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,499
Have you been in the wars today?

140
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,916
A few wars.

141
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,585
He's had a big day, that's all.

142
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:58,213
He's just exhausted.

143
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,047
Poor little sweetheart.

144
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,465
Bugsy-

145
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,222
Come here, little girl. Hello.

146
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,844
You look tired too, love.

147
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,263
You OK?

148
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,473
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

149
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,397
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

150
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:15,146
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

151
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,737
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

152
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,736
You can choose one tonight.

153
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,251
Where did you get this?

154
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:08,747
On the shelf.

155
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:18,131
"if it's in a word
or it's in a look,

156
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,925
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

157
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:27,389
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

158
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,393
"then you can make friends
with a special one -

159
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,941
"a friend of you and me."

160
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,816
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

161
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:46,528
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,073
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

163
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,118
"That's when you'll know
he's around.

164
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,456
"You'll see him if you look.

165
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,086
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

166
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,051
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

167
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,933
But you said I could choose.

168
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,222
"This is what he wears on top.

169
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,393
"He's funny, don't you think?

170
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:20,732
"See him
in your room at night..."

171
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,945
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

172
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,361
Mum?

173
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:31,162
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

174
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,254
Mummy?

175
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:37,955
Mummy?!

176
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,296
"How sweetly they sung,

177
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,045
"telling of the happiness

00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,213
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

179
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,762
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

180
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:59,118
It's that time of
night again.

181
00:13:59,119 --> 00:13:59,796
Time...

182
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,252
if that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

183
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,632
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

184
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,145
Do you...

185
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,600
Mum!

186
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,438
- It's in my room!
- What is?

187
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,240
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

188
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,942
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

189
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:57,707
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

190
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,696
It's just a book.

191
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,074
It can't hurt you.

192
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,827
You've had a big day.

193
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,462
You're just exhausted.

194
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:12,219
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

195
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,923
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

196
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:20,474
I'm gonna protect you.

197
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,302
Mum, it's 9:00.

198
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,520
He's not running a fever
anymore.

199
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:50,890
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

200
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,730
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

201
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,979
Sorry. What was that?

202
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,526
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

203
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:02,408
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

204
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,784
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

205
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,048
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

206
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:21,421
88. Number 88.

207
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:23,340
Two fat ladies.

208
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,966
Good, Elaine!

209
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,601
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

210
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,432
Number 11.

211
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,184
Who has number 11?

212
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:36,268
Legs 11.

213
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,118
Hey? See what else we've got.

214
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,443
5 billion.

215
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,864
Anyone got 5 billion?

216
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,721
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

217
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,423
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

218
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,188
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

219
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,391
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

220
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:16,893
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

221
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,313
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

222
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,153
Why don't you go home?

223
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,736
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

224
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:27,662
I can cover for you.

225
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:30,289
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

226
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,993
I'll give you my Pay-

227
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,916
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,206
You've got a sick boy.

229
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:40,082
Life's too short.

230
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,960
You're so sweet, Robbie.

231
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:46,506
- You should go.
- Yeah.

232
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:49,721
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

233
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,898
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

234
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,147
Rung you a million times.

235
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,190
What happened?

236
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:48,277
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

237
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,451
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

238
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,699
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

239
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,740
I'm so sorry.

240
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:56,212
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

241
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,123
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

242
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,585
It's not rubbish. It's real!

243
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,714
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

244
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,132
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

245
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,044
You got them for me
on the internet.

246
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,547
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

247
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,683
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

248
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:18,305
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

249
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,140
Well, I'm not scared.

250
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:23,273
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

251
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:24,936
That's enough.

252
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:27,523
You will be
when it eats your insides.

253
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:28,363
I've decided

254
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,244
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

255
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,955
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

256
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:38,158
Samuel.

257
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:51,671
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

258
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:54,340
life is not always as it seems.

259
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:57,594
It can be a wondrous thing.

260
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:02,020
But it can also be
very treacherous.

261
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:13,402
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

262
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:16,415
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

263
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:22,535
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

264
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:24,624
Samuel.

265
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,841
I was just
putting something back.

266
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,262
All your father's things
are down there.

267
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:38,304
He's my father.

268
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:40,437
You don't own him!

269
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,393
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

270
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,194
Can I come in?

271
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:53,650
Hey, matey. This is for you.

272
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,451
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

273
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,951
I'm not sick.

274
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,908
Oh. I-l thought...

275
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,576
No, he's not, actually.

276
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,662
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

277
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:07,706
You said that's not true.

278
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,260
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

279
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,424
who still believe in monsters?

280
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:11,584
I hate you!

281
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,139
She won't let me have
a birthday party

282
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,177
and she won't let me have a dad!

283
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,996
Ohh.

284
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:31,046
Don't eat it.

285
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:45,974
The Babadook did it, Mum.

286
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:49,229
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

287
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,766
The Babadook did it!

288
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,570
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

289
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:55,229
Ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,314
girls and boys,

291
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:02,778
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

292
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,864
Life is not always as it seems.

293
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:09,994
It can be a wondrous thing.

294
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:14,040
But it can also be
very treacherous.

295
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,375
In this DVD,

296
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:21,005
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

297
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:26,641
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

298
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,790
Do you think this is funny?

299
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,093
Oh, no. No. No!

300
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,793
Give it to me!

301
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:04,018
Do you wanna die?

302
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:19,080
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

303
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,792
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

304
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:24,596
Don't let it in!

305
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,877
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

306
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:51,797
I've already got this doll, Mum.

307
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,132
Now she's got a twin.

308
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,384
They can go shopping together.

309
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:01,599
Off you go.

310
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,976
He's just really tired.

311
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,319
Go and play right now.

312
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,492
Claire tells me you're a writer.

313
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:23,204
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

314
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,706
What kind of writing did you do?

315
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:29,668
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

316
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:32,089
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

317
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,555
It must be difficult.

318
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:37,012
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

319
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:39,774
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

320
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:42,443
and they find it very hard.

321
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,981
How's Richard's merger going?

322
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:50,231
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

323
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:53,025
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

324
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,193
Tell me about it!

325
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,531
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

326
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:58,155
That's a real tragedy.

327
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:01,498
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

328
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,579
You must have so much
to talk about

329
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,250
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

330
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:20,386
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

331
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,858
I'm not hurting anybody.

332
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:26,230
Bye.

333
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:30,238
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

334
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:38,164
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

335
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:40,197
She never comes to our house.

336
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,702
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

337
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,582
'cause it's too depressing.

338
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:47,591
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

339
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,124
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

340
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:53,334
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

341
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:55,756
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

342
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:58,340
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

343
00:30:58,341 --> 00:30:59,812
Isn't it time you moved on?

344
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:01,343
I have moved on.

345
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:04,805
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

346
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,937
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

347
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:09,730
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

348
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:11,779
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

349
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,438
I do have a dad!

350
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,316
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

351
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:19,414
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

352
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:20,654
I do!

353
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:22,364
I want to know how you are.

354
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,085
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

355
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:26,293
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

356
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:28,912
I can't believe
you just said that.

357
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:31,460
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

358
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:33,960
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

359
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:35,460
That's not true!

360
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,672
And your mum doesn't want you.

361
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:39,008
No-one wants you.

362
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:51,309
What did you do?!

363
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,991
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

364
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:57,232
Is she alright?

365
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,864
Stay here
and look after the children

366
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:01,948
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

367
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:07,033
Mummy!
She wouldn't believe me!

368
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:09,535
Mummy! Mummy!

369
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,455
Mummy!

370
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:15,458
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

371
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:19,337
There is no Babadook!

372
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,344
Get out!

373
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,679
- Get out!
- Samuel?

374
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,932
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

375
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,810
Get out! Get out! Get out!

376
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,247
Please help me!

377
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,419
There's something wrong
with my son.

378
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:11,517
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

379
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,391
That's when the brain overheats.

380
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,733
It always looks worse
than it is.

381
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,609
I've never seen
anything like this.

382
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,690
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

383
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:20,492
All his other results
are normal.

384
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:24,652
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

385
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,407
Very committed to
the monster theory.

386
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,793
That's an understatement.

387
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,534
All children see monsters.

388
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:33,291
Not like this.

389
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,705
And it's getting worse.

390
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:39,417
He's becoming aggressive.

391
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,008
He could see a psychiatrist.

392
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,628
I can refer you.

393
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,219
Takes a few weeks to get in.

394
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,424
That'd be great.

395
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:50,678
But can you just give me
something for now,

396
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,147
just to make him sleep?

397
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,903
Um, just until...

398
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,356
...just until
we get an appointment.

399
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,732
Please?

400
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:07,528
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

401
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:08,950
and when we go home tonight,

402
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:10,952
this whole nightmare
will start up again

403
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,206
and I am really...

404
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,084
...I'm really not coping.

405
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,959
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

406
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,378
Just until the tests come back.

407
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:29,258
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

408
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:31,264
It's really bad.

409
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:43,063
These can make children
feel foggy.

410
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,315
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

411
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,527
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

412
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:52,122
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

413
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:56,618
Why don't people
like me?

414
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:58,703
Why do you say that?

415
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:02,632
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

416
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:07,839
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

417
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:15,512
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

418
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,901
and not worry.

419
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,183
I don't want you to die.

420
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:23,312
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

421
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:27,572
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

422
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,324
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

423
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:37,660
I've got the day off tomorrow.

424
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,712
Maybe we could do something,
hmm?

425
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:43,081
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

426
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,791
I think so

427
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,678
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

428
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,714
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

429
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,549
Then I won't mention it.

430
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,887
I promise to protect you.

431
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,608
Come on.

432
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,033
Come on.

433
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:20,034
Can you stay here with me?

434
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:21,954
Yes.

435
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:24,289
I love you, Mum.

436
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,093
Me too.

437
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,808
Her nose
is broken in two places.

438
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:31,652
She may need surgery.

439
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:33,018
I'll pay for everything.

440
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:34,775
You can't even pay
your own bills.

441
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:36,153
Look, I really have to go.

442
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:39,944
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

443
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,318
What?

444
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,371
A book turned up
at our place.

445
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:46,990
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

446
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,794
and put it on our doorstep.

447
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:52,204
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

448
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:55,165
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

449
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,420
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

450
00:39:57,422 --> 00:40:00,266
I have to go.

451
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,702
Claire!

452
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:23,957
Hello?

453
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:30,116
Mmm, Babadook...

454
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:34,211
...dook... dook.

455
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:43,547
Hi.

456
00:40:43,548 --> 00:40:47,509
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

457
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,851
Can you tell us what happened?

458
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:51,805
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

459
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,892
And?

460
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:59,062
And it contained violent
and graphic images

461
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:01,111
of my child and me
being murdered.

462
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:03,112
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

463
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,360
I burnt it.

464
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:08,071
You burnt it?

465
00:41:08,072 --> 00:41:09,197
Yes.

466
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,702
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

467
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:17,372
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

468
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,665
What's he been saying?

469
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:22,335
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

470
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,173
How do you know
it's the same person?

471
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,640
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

472
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:28,383
The book you burnt?

473
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:30,555
Yes.

474
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:48,029
OK.

475
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:51,618
Don't worry about it.

476
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,418
Did you get your things done?

477
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:05,587
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

478
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,387
That's why she shakes like this.

479
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:09,135
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

480
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:10,390
that goes through your head.

481
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:12,969
Oh, it's alright, love.

482
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,974
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

483
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:20,643
He sees things as they are,
that one.

484
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:22,353
Oskar was the same.

485
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:24,074
He always spoke his mind.

486
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,948
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

487
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:34,448
Hey, Bugsy-

488
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,494
Hey.

489
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,879
Hey!

490
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,726
Eugh!

491
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,941
Don't come in here.

492
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:02,786
I don't want to buy anything.

493
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:04,871
Are you Amelia Vanick?

494
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:05,915
Yes.

495
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,501
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

496
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,300
from the Department of
Community Services.

497
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:12,343
My son's only been
away for two days.

498
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:15,885
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

499
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,093
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

500
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:20,263
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

501
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:24,766
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

502
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,352
at the moment.

503
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:30,315
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

504
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:35,318
Hello, Samuel.

505
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,330
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

506
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:42,367
How are you?

507
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:46,079
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

508
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,166
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

509
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:52,044
He had a fit yesterday.

510
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:55,464
I'm really tired, actually.

511
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:57,185
That's no good.

512
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:02,224
May I have a glass of water,
please?

513
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:06,564
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

514
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,442
It's a real mess.

515
00:45:15,443 --> 00:45:17,863
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

516
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:19,410
I normally have
the house sprayed.

517
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,288
I did actually already
have it sprayed

518
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:24,129
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

519
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:25,791
and that's why I...

520
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:33,293
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

521
00:45:33,294 --> 00:45:35,795
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

522
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:38,095
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

523
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:40,262
We've caught you
at a bad time.

524
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,267
I'll leave you with this.

525
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:45,893
We're required
to come back in a week

526
00:45:45,894 --> 00:45:47,693
to talk through your options.

527
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,902
Here's my card.

528
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:55,866
Mum,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

529
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:17,925
What was
that noise I heard?

530
00:46:17,926 --> 00:46:20,803
I didn't hear any noise.

531
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:23,101
Wind howling,
doors slamming.

532
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:26,054
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

533
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:30,350
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

534
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:32,352
Are you sick?

535
00:46:32,353 --> 00:46:33,646
Oh, no, Granny.

536
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:37,356
It's only 6:00.

537
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,122
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

538
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:41,569
No.

539
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,619
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

540
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:51,790
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

541
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:08,763
Where's its mother,
Skip?

542
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:10,354
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

543
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:12,391
Are you off now, Dad?

544
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:14,108
Yep.
Soon as I fuel up.

545
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:16,062
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

546
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:18,399
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

547
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:22,115
"And the Prince
and the Princess

548
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:25,076
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

549
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:27,575
"for the rest of their days."

550
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:14,054
Babadook...

551
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:18,016
...dook... dook.

552
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:54,970
What are we doing?

553
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,810
We're going downstairs.

554
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:59,190
- Why?
- Because we are.

555
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:20,954
Iris, Iris, Iris.

556
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:22,789
No.

557
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:14,220
Glass and mirror attachment.

558
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:16,221
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

559
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:17,760
for a streak-free shine.

560
00:51:17,762 --> 00:51:19,150
As part of
your steaming special,

561
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:20,977
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

562
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:24,485
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

563
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:29,272
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

564
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:30,614
That's just what I need.

565
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:33,909
I can't help it if I'm sick.

566
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,326
What do you expect me to do?

567
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,120
You do that!

568
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:57,345
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

569
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:01,817
I need to eat something.

570
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:09,647
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

571
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,734
You said to have them with food.

572
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:18,696
I'm really hungry, Mum.

573
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:22,825
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

574
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:24,785
Don't you ever stop?

575
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:28,414
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

576
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:31,917
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

577
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:36,178
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

578
00:53:09,706 --> 00:53:11,373
I'm so sorry.

579
00:53:11,374 --> 00:53:14,553
I don't know why I said that.
it was terrible.

580
00:53:15,796 --> 00:53:19,424
I've had absolutely no sleep.

581
00:53:19,424 --> 00:53:21,809
I didn't know what I was saying.

582
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,565
I'll cook you something. Hey?

583
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,231
What would you like?

584
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:30,194
I'm not hungry anymore.

585
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:39,155
We really need to get
out of this house.

586
00:53:39,155 --> 00:53:41,620
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

587
00:53:46,451 --> 00:53:48,337
Do you want to go to Wally's?

588
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:52,004
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

589
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:55,711
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

590
00:53:58,088 --> 00:54:01,257
Give it back!

591
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:05,343
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

592
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:07,315
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

593
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:08,728
Sit down, please.

594
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:16,196
Where are we going?

595
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:19,286
I just want to drive
for a little while.

596
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:33,330
Aarggh!

597
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:35,332
Mummy! Mummy!

598
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,919
Babadook.

599
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:52,268
You ran straight into me!

600
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:56,657
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

601
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:00,524
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

602
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:02,484
You could've killed someone!

603
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:05,237
Hey!

604
00:55:05,238 --> 00:55:06,282
Hey, what are you doing?

605
00:55:06,282 --> 00:55:08,250
Hey! Crazy bitch!

606
00:55:14,997 --> 00:55:17,417
Hi, sweetheart.

607
00:55:25,508 --> 00:55:27,145
Mum?

608
00:55:28,594 --> 00:55:31,062
I can call Aunty Claire.

609
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:37,024
I can call
and she can come over.

610
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:41,898
Mum?

611
00:55:41,899 --> 00:55:46,490
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

612
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,245
Mum. Mum, look at me.

613
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:20,115
It's nice and warm in here.

614
00:56:23,649 --> 00:56:25,868
I don't want you to go away.

615
00:56:28,028 --> 00:56:30,247
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,049
Mum?

617
00:56:51,677 --> 00:56:55,936
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

618
00:56:57,266 --> 00:56:59,434
I can call Mrs Roach.

619
00:56:59,435 --> 00:57:03,278
I don't want you to call anyone.

620
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:08,741
I just need to sleep.

621
00:57:12,906 --> 00:57:15,041
- Mum...
- Leave it!

622
00:57:46,398 --> 00:57:48,450
There's something
in the house.

623
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:05,003
There's someone in the house!

624
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:02,061
Mrs Roach...

625
00:59:02,063 --> 00:59:04,144
...can we come and stay
the night?

626
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:15,569
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

627
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,990
Has someone
broken into the house?

628
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:21,081
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

629
00:59:21,082 --> 00:59:22,997
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

630
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:25,287
Oh, I was so worried.

631
00:59:25,288 --> 00:59:26,830
I told him not to call anyone.

632
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,752
He asked
if you could stay the night.

633
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:31,592
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

634
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:33,591
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

635
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:36,719
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

636
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,306
Yes. Talk soon.

637
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,854
No worries. Talk soon.

638
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,973
I told you not to call anyone

639
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:46,944
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

640
00:59:48,102 --> 00:59:50,317
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

641
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:52,527
An old lady who can hardly walk?

642
00:59:52,528 --> 00:59:54,076
Do you want to make her sick?

643
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:58,114
Get that bloody thing off!

644
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:07,370
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

645
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:08,878
in front of our neighbours?

646
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:15,176
Is this what I have to do?

647
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:27,974
I'm sorry, Mummy.

648
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:30,229
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

649
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,229
What'd you say?

650
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,896
I said the Babadook...

651
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,530
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

652
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,365
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

653
01:00:39,366 --> 01:00:41,912
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

654
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:45,617
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

655
01:00:45,618 --> 01:00:47,202
Alright, Samuel?

656
01:00:47,203 --> 01:00:49,746
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

657
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,301
Nothing!

658
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:30,954
I feel sick.

659
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:35,332
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

660
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:36,966
Mum, I don't think I need...

661
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:40,010
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

662
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,706
Good boy.

663
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,386
Ohh!

664
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:29,728
Mum!

665
01:02:46,905 --> 01:02:50,452
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

666
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,004
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

667
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:57,541
Hey.

668
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,262
Hey!

669
01:03:21,189 --> 01:03:22,909
Here we go.

670
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,951
There's more
where that came from.

671
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,841
Oh!

672
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,549
Aarggh!

673
01:03:49,551 --> 01:03:50,809
What's the secret?

674
01:03:53,388 --> 01:03:55,103
..letter of Max's, didn't you?

675
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:56,640
No, not for a minute.

676
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,525
Don't lie.
You called me a jezebel. Why?

677
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:00,737
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

678
01:04:00,738 --> 01:04:02,200
With fresh meat.

679
01:04:04,524 --> 01:04:07,443
Only five...

680
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,863
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

681
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:14,159
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

682
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,742
to stab her son.

683
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:17,913
His body was found
in their basement.

684
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:20,676
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

685
01:04:20,677 --> 01:04:24,918
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

686
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:26,884
Little is known about the tragedy

687
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:30,841
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

688
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:33,260
He had just turned seven.

689
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,240
Samuel?

690
01:04:53,531 --> 01:04:55,085
Wake up, Mummy.

691
01:04:58,035 --> 01:05:01,298
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

692
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,592
Don't go down there.

693
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,020
It's not safe.

694
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,059
Ohh... l thought you were dead.

695
01:05:56,176 --> 01:05:58,726
I thought you were dead.

696
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:15,245
We're gonna be together.

697
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:20,250
You just need to bring me
the boy.

698
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:45,140
You mean Samuel?

699
01:06:45,142 --> 01:06:47,443
You can bring me the boy.

700
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,695
You can bring me the boy.

701
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:55,363
You can bring me the boy.

702
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:56,783
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

703
01:06:56,785 --> 01:06:58,988
I think it's going to rain.

704
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:00,406
No.

705
01:08:32,332 --> 01:08:35,464
it isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

706
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:49,848
Oh, no.

707
01:08:55,355 --> 01:08:57,194
No! No!

708
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:06,739
Bugsy!

709
01:10:58,519 --> 01:11:00,270
Samuel!

710
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:07,205
Samuel.

711
01:11:08,987 --> 01:11:13,210
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

712
01:11:15,786 --> 01:11:18,254
You don't want him to die,
do you?

713
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:24,043
Samuel.

714
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:27,093
Are you listening to me?

715
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:33,469
Let me in, you little shit!

716
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:35,930
Let me in!

717
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:37,223
Let me in!

718
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:38,766
Let me in!

719
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:41,732
Let me in!

720
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:06,293
You little pig!

721
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:10,130
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

722
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:12,300
You don't know how many times

723
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,220
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

724
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:17,977
I just want you to be happy.

725
01:12:17,978 --> 01:12:21,105
"I just
want you to be happy."

726
01:12:24,437 --> 01:12:25,979
Sometimes...

727
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:29,817
...I just wanna <i>smash</i>
your head against a brick wall

728
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:33,070
until your fucking brains
pop out.

729
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:35,155
You're not my mother.

730
01:12:35,156 --> 01:12:36,740
What did you say?

731
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:39,375
I said
you're not my mother!

732
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:42,913
I am your mother!

733
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:48,544
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

734
01:12:51,923 --> 01:12:53,298
Get away!

735
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:55,221
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

736
01:13:00,432 --> 01:13:02,235
- Argh!
- Argh!

737
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:47,227
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

738
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:49,399
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

739
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,399
I'm OK.

740
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,322
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

741
01:13:58,322 --> 01:14:02,617
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

742
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:04,744
But I just wanted you to know

743
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:07,830
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

744
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:09,884
I love you both.

745
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,926
Samuel.

746
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,472
I'm sorry.

747
01:14:22,388 --> 01:14:24,306
I understand you're scared.

748
01:14:24,307 --> 01:14:28,310
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

749
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:31,408
I haven't been good at all.

750
01:14:34,191 --> 01:14:37,703
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

751
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:44,713
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

752
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,081
We're going to
stay there tonight.

753
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:53,012
Do you want that?

754
01:14:57,465 --> 01:15:00,562
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

755
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:13,739
I want you to meet your dad.

756
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:18,074
It's beautiful there.

757
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:22,281
You'll be happy-

758
01:15:28,912 --> 01:15:30,584
Sorry, Mummy!

759
01:16:19,046 --> 01:16:21,172
Mum!

760
01:16:21,173 --> 01:16:23,841
Mum!

761
01:16:23,842 --> 01:16:26,061
I'm not leaving you.

762
01:16:28,972 --> 01:16:31,902
Mum? Mum?

763
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:41,780
You said
we'd protect each other.

764
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:49,911
I know you don't love me.

765
01:16:51,328 --> 01:16:53,579
The Babadook won't let you.

766
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,917
But I love you, Mum.

767
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:59,719
And I always will.

768
01:17:09,221 --> 01:17:13,397
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

769
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:20,314
I don't want you to go away.

770
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:21,899
No! No! No!

771
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,071
Mummy!

772
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,660
Mummy!

773
01:18:15,662 --> 01:18:17,746
Mummy!

774
01:18:17,747 --> 01:18:19,706
Mummy!

775
01:18:19,707 --> 01:18:22,167
Mummy! Mummy!

776
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:24,336
Mummy!

777
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:25,921
Mummy!

778
01:19:03,793 --> 01:19:05,210
What is it?

779
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:07,050
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

780
01:19:25,231 --> 01:19:26,274
Ooh!

781
01:19:37,576 --> 01:19:38,787
What do you want?

782
01:19:42,373 --> 01:19:44,129
What do you want?

783
01:20:21,995 --> 01:20:23,746
No.

784
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:26,760
Keep breathing.

785
01:20:30,003 --> 01:20:33,182
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

786
01:20:37,553 --> 01:20:39,605
No.

787
01:20:44,393 --> 01:20:45,816
I think it's gonna rain.

788
01:20:45,817 --> 01:20:47,812
Stop!

789
01:21:36,027 --> 01:21:38,278
You are nothing.

790
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,000
You're nothing!

791
01:22:01,428 --> 01:22:03,971
This is my house!

792
01:22:08,018 --> 01:22:11,479
You are trespassing in my house!

793
01:22:21,114 --> 01:22:25,951
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

794
01:22:34,711 --> 01:22:36,882
No!

795
01:23:20,673 --> 01:23:21,884
Mummy, don't!

796
01:23:28,055 --> 01:23:30,139
Don't!

797
01:23:57,376 --> 01:24:03,343
Aaaargh!

798
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:18,831
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

799
01:25:18,832 --> 01:25:20,837
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

800
01:25:20,838 --> 01:25:22,668
What time's the party?

801
01:25:22,669 --> 01:25:24,007
Any time after three is fine.

802
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:25,926
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

803
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:27,507
Bye.

804
01:25:27,508 --> 01:25:29,300
Bye, Sam.

805
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:31,683
That school's
a good choice.

806
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:33,849
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

807
01:25:33,849 --> 01:25:35,556
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

808
01:25:35,557 --> 01:25:37,277
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

809
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:39,310
It's time to get back.

810
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:42,730
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

811
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:44,065
Mmm.

812
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:45,900
Are you having a party'?

813
01:25:45,901 --> 01:25:47,657
It's Sam's birthday today.

814
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:50,988
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

815
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:52,489
That's not true.

816
01:25:52,491 --> 01:25:55,125
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

817
01:25:55,126 --> 01:25:57,420
That's unusual.

818
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:03,250
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

819
01:26:03,251 --> 01:26:06,514
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

820
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:10,716
Sam's just like his dad was.

821
01:26:10,717 --> 01:26:12,843
Always speaks his mind.

822
01:26:12,844 --> 01:26:17,181
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

823
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:21,977
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

824
01:26:24,356 --> 01:26:26,361
I'll take that for you.

825
01:26:45,877 --> 01:26:47,252
Good shot.

826
01:26:47,253 --> 01:26:49,546
Look, there's another one!

827
01:26:49,547 --> 01:26:51,634
Where's your bowl?

828
01:26:54,594 --> 01:26:57,809
Wow. You've got a lot today.

829
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:01,475
Am I ever gonna see it'?

830
01:27:01,476 --> 01:27:04,904
One day, when you're bigger.

831
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:14,751
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

832
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:54,243
Argh!

833
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:59,365
Argh!

834
01:27:59,367 --> 01:28:01,576
It's alright.

835
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:03,286
It's alright.

836
01:28:03,287 --> 01:28:05,330
It's alright.

837
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:06,885
Shhh...

838
01:28:08,376 --> 01:28:09,966
Shhh...

839
01:28:11,212 --> 01:28:13,015
Shhh...

840
01:28:14,173 --> 01:28:15,893
Shhh...

841
01:28:16,968 --> 01:28:19,388
Shhh...

842
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,491
How was it?

843
01:28:41,492 --> 01:28:43,996
It was pretty quiet today.

844
01:28:46,038 --> 01:28:47,628
Come here.

845
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:54,214
It's getting much better, Mum.

846
01:28:58,092 --> 01:28:59,467
Wait!

847
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:01,603
I have a new trick.

848
01:29:05,057 --> 01:29:08,059
Life is not always as it seems.

849
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,025
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

850
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:19,076
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

851
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:31,796
Abracadabra!

852
01:29:34,295 --> 01:29:36,087
How did you do that?

853
01:29:41,385 --> 01:29:43,177
Come here, you.

854
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:44,389
Come here.

855
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:57,443
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
