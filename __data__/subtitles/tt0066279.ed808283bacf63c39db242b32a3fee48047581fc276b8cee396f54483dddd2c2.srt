1
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,676
<i>We were not
the Railway Children to begin with.</i>

2
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:36,387
<i>I don't suppose we even thought
about railways</i>

3
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:40,225
<i>except as a means of getting
to the theatre and the zoo.</i>

4
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,727
<i>We were just ordinary
suburban children</i>

5
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:45,271
<i>and we lived
with Father and Mother</i>

6
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,857
<i>in an ordinary
red brick fronted villa</i>

7
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:49,943
<i>with coloured glass
in the front door...</i>

8
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,110
Come on.

9
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,821
<i>... a tiled passage
that was called a hall</i>

10
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:57,242
<i>and big fires
in big fireplaces.</i>

11
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,912
<i>We even had a gas fire
in the breakfast room</i>

12
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,581
<i>and a servant's bell board.</i>

13
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,295
<i>In fact,
every modern convenience.</i>

14
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,048
Chins up!

15
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,553
<i>There we three of us.</i>

16
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,263
Now let's arrange your pretty hair.

17
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:19,931
<i>That's me, I'm Roberta.</i>

18
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,725
<i>They call me Bobbie,
sometimes Lanky.</i>

19
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,186
<i>I'm the eldest, worst luck.</i>

20
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:29,357
<i>That's Phyllis, who means well.</i>

21
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,529
<i>And that's Peter,
who wants to be an engineer.</i>

22
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:38,032
And don't forget
to watch the dickey bird.

23
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,452
Watch the birdie.

24
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:58,094
<i>Mother did not spend all her time
paying dull calls to dull ladies</i>

25
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:02,223
<i>and sitting dully at home waiting
for dull ladies to pay calls on her.</i>

26
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,393
<i>She was always there,
with us.</i>

27
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,444
<i>We had a father
who was just perfect.</i>

28
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:20,533
Her light's growing dim
and if it goes out, then she's dead.

29
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,411
She says she would be get well again
if children believed in fairies.

30
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:26,247
- Do you believe in fairies?
- Yes.

31
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:29,167
That's not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

32
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,627
Yes!

33
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:33,296
It's still not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

34
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,756
YES!

35
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:36,382
Yes, I certainly do!

36
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,849
Mmm, it smells gorgeous.

37
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,852
It's fabulous,
absolutely fabulous.

38
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,569
Now altogether... one, two, three.

39
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:00,532
Well done!

40
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,828
Happy Christmas!

41
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,748
I love you.

42
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,169
<i>You will think that we ought
to have been very happy</i>

43
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:16,089
<i>and we were but we did not know
how happy</i>

44
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:19,425
<i>till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa
was over and done with</i>

45
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,804
<i>and we had to live
a very different life indeed.</i>

46
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,139
Peter my boy, come here.

47
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:38,152
Dad... it's perfect.

48
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:42,031
It's more perfect
than any one could ever dream of.

49
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,286
Thank you, Dad.

50
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:50,665
<i>The dreadful change
came quite suddenly.</i>

51
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,516
You heaving brute!

52
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:12,770
<i>And that was the last we saw
of poor Potts.</i>

53
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:16,065
What a wreck!

54
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,775
- Is there any hope?
- Hope?

55
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:21,571
Of course, it'll want hope yes,
and a new valve.

56
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,032
I'll tell you what, I'll give up
Saturday afternoon to it.

57
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:25,617
Yes, and you can help me.

58
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,954
I hate doing a job like this
especially at Christmas.

59
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,581
Who on earth is that?

60
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:35,502
An Englishman's house is his castle, but
I wish they had moats and drawbridges!

61
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,254
Come in.

62
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,798
Yes?

63
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:43,426
Please, sir. There are two gentlemen
wish to see you.

64
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:47,055
I've shown them into the study, sir,
I hope that was all right?

65
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,308
Excuse me.

66
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:07,325
I wish we did have
a moat and drawbridge.

67
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,993
Then if we didn't want anyone to...

68
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:12,539
I've never heard anything
so preposterous. When? Who?

69
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:14,707
- Why's Daddy shouting?
- I don't know, dear.

70
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,167
Come in.

71
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,003
Yes, Ruth?

72
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,007
What is it?

73
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:27,637
Please, ma'am, the Master wants you
to just step into the study.

74
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:48,366
Look, I'm not going to say a thing!

75
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:51,911
Come in.

76
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,538
I will not!

77
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,029
All right, cabby,
Scotland Yard.

78
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,514
It's bed-time.

79
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,516
Ruth will put you to bed.

80
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:40,186
But you promised we could stay up late.
Daddy was going to play with us.

81
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:43,690
Father's been
called away... on business.

82
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,275
Go up at once darlings, please.

83
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,955
It wasn't bad news,
was it, Mummy?

84
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,666
Is anyone dead or...

85
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,294
Oh, no, nobody's dead.

86
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,046
I can't tell you anything about it tonight.
Up you go.

87
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:29,444
96... 97... 98... 99... 100.

88
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:41,122
Well, good night then.

89
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:49,130
Ruth!

90
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:50,715
What's up?

91
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,510
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

92
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,094
You'll know soon enough.

93
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,877
- Phyl?
- Yes.

94
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:32,298
If Mother doesn't want us to know
she's been crying then we won't know.

95
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:35,343
- That's all.
- All right.

96
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,521
She's gone into London,
that's all I know.

97
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,190
Now just you eat up.

98
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:55,572
Some dire calamity's happening,
I just know it.

99
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,758
Good evening, Mrs Waterbury.

100
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,020
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Sally.

101
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:31,482
Oh, it's so cold!
Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.

102
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,361
My darlings, those men last night
did bring very bad news

103
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,113
and Father will be away
for some time

104
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:39,365
Is it something to do
with the Government, Mummy?

105
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,700
Yes... yes, it is.

106
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,954
Now it's bed time, my darlings.

107
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:53,379
And don't worry.
It will all come right in the end.

108
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:57,509
Don't you worry either
because we'll be as good as gold.

109
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,062
Oh, we used to say life was so dull...
Nothing ever happened like in books.

110
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:10,605
Now something has happened.

111
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,901
Yes, it has
and it's made Mother unhappy.

112
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,738
Everything's horrid...

113
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:20,323
...just horrid.

114
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,243
Stairs... stairs... stairs...

115
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,621
<i>Everything continued to be
perfectly horrid for some weeks.</i>

116
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:28,248
<i>Mother was nearly always out,</i>

117
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,501
<i>the between maid was sent away...</i>

118
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,177
<i>... and Aunt Emma
came on a visit.</i>

119
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,239
- Good afternoon, children.
- Good afternoon, Aunt Emma.

120
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:04,242
Your mother has sent for me
in her distress,

121
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:07,078
and I'm here for a while
but not for long.

122
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm off to India as a governess

123
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:12,000
and as I shall be busy preparing
for my arduous journey,

124
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:16,087
I shall require you to be seen
and not heard.

125
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,339
Preferably to be not seen
and not heard.

126
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,634
Children should be kept
in their proper places.

127
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,095
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Aunt Emma.

128
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,432
- Yes, Aunt Emma.
- Excellent.

129
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:29,434
You may kiss me
if you wish.

130
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,776
# You can hear them sigh
and wish to die

131
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,695
# You can see them wink
the other eye

132
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,324
# At the man who broke
the Bank at Monte Carlo

133
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,408
Altogether now

134
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:49,370
# As I walked along the Bois Boulogne
with an inde... #

135
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:53,082
I have asked you not to use them utensils
in that manner.

136
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,126
I was up at four this morning
cleaning them

137
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,837
as if I haven't got enough to do
what with the between maid leaving

138
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:01,174
and now your aunt asking me
to heave bloomin' great boxes about

139
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,634
like I was a navvy or something.

140
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,802
- Ruth.
- Yes?

141
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:08,973
There's no need to be so rude.
Cook was just trying to cheer us up.

142
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,100
Come on, you two.

143
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:17,232
Well...

144
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:22,487
I'm very surprised at you, Cook.
Where's your dignity?

145
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,155
And take that silly hat off.

146
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,823
Get yourself dressed properly.

147
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,951
I don't know I seem to do
all the work round here.

148
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,039
We shouldn't really Peter,
she'll get soaked.

149
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:35,083
It's too late, she's coming.

150
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,961
Stairs... stairs... stairs...

151
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,004
I'll have fallen arches
before me holiday.

152
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,173
I hope you're undressed and ready,
master Peter.

153
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,675
I haven't got all night, you know.

154
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,261
- Yes, Ruth.
- Good...

155
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,934
You...!

156
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,503
- Oh! Stop it!
- You nasty little limb, you!

157
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:23,089
If you don't mend your ways

158
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:27,510
you'll go where your precious
father's gone, so I tell you straight.

159
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,888
Ruth!

160
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,187
Huh!

161
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,333
We're going to have to play
at being poor for a while.

162
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,920
We're moving to a darling little house
in the country, up in Yorkshire.

163
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,672
- What?
- I know you'll love it

164
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:09,594
- Is Aunt Emma coming?
- No, Peter, unfortunately not.

165
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,351
- Don't you want a 1st Class, madam?
- No, Second. Thank you.

166
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,269
Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me.

167
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,438
- Are we on the right train for Yorkshire?
- Yes.

168
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:21,523
Thank you.

169
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,940
Ooh... careful.
Give that to me.

170
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,242
- I'll take that bag.
- Thank you so much.

171
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:15,869
- Goodbye.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

172
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,371
Excuse me.

173
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,334
We want to go to the house on the hill.
The Three Chimneys.

174
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,588
- Er, do you know the way?
- I daresay.

175
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:30,675
- Well, will you show us?
- I dare say.

176
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:42,145
- Phyllis, are you all right?
- Yes.

177
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,314
Can't we put just one box
on your cart?

178
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:48,776
You asked me to show you the way,
nothing was said about boxes.

179
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:51,112
Never mind, darlings.
It's only a few more yards.

180
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,003
I wonder why she didn't leave
the lights on.

181
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,463
Who is she?

182
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,758
Mrs Viney, The woman I engaged
to clean the place and to get the supper.

183
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,177
I expect Mrs Viney's gone home.

184
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:16,721
Your train was late, see.

185
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,182
But she's got the key.
What do we do?

186
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,643
She'll have left that
under the doorstep.

187
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:25,730
- We all do hereabouts.
- Well you might have said so.

188
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:27,315
You never asked, did you?

189
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,567
Nothing was said
about a door key.

190
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:33,404
- May I borrow your lamp, please?
- I daresay.

191
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:39,160
If you say "I daresay" once more,
I shall have hysterics, I daresay

192
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,665
Oh... there we are.

193
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:00,056
What's that?

194
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:06,229
It's only the rats.

195
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:23,830
God works in mysterious ways
his wonders to perform.

196
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:34,132
Ow!
Rats!

197
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:38,052
I wish we hadn't come.
Don't you worry, darlings.

198
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:43,016
I saw a paraffin lamp on the table,
we'll soon have some light.

199
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,936
Oh, those poor little mice,
they were so frightened.

200
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:50,064
I don't believe they were rats at all.

201
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:54,485
You've often said you wanted
something to happen, well now it has.

202
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,863
It's quite exciting, isn't it?

203
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,199
I told Mrs Viney to get
some meat and bread

204
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:02,660
and have some supper ready.
I wonder where...

205
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,746
Oh, I suppose she's laid it
in the dining room.

206
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,707
Come along darlings, up here.
Let's go and see.

207
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,210
Come along.

208
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:17,926
Oh darlings, mind the steps.
Mind how you go, Peter.

209
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,605
Oh, that beastly woman!

210
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,732
She's taken the money
and not left us any food.

211
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,944
Aren't we going to have
any supper tonight? I'm starving!

212
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,404
I know! There's some food
in the cases in the cellar.

213
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,367
Aunt Emma sent them on
ahead of us. Come along.

214
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,661
Mind the step.

215
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,169
Come along, Bobbie,
it's a real feast.

216
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:55,338
Sardines, biscuits, ginger.

217
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,881
Raisins...

218
00:21:57,006 --> 00:22:00,218
No Phyl, no! You do not put
the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.

219
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:02,053
Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.

220
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:04,722
Tell you what,
let's drink Aunt Emma's health.

221
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,433
- Good idea.
- Here's to Aunt Emma.

222
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,352
- To Aunt Emma.
- Aunt Emma.

223
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:11,688
And all who sail in her.

224
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:21,656
- Oh! What's that, Mummy?
- Pie.

225
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:24,450
- Pie?
- Apple Pie.

226
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,203
Apple pie for breakfast?
Then we're not poor after all.

227
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,997
This is the supper
we should have had.

228
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:31,749
I found it in that little room
that we thought was a cupboard,

229
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,878
so Mrs Viney wasn't so bad
after all.

230
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,724
- Good morning, can I help you?
- I expect so. Viney's the name.

231
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,059
Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.

232
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,313
Do come in.
We're just been talking about you.

233
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,983
Oh, I see you found your supper then.
Funny time to have it though.

234
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,735
It was like a great dragon
tearing by.

235
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,821
A dragon's house
looks like that tunnel.

236
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,074
I never thought we'd ever get so near
to a train as this.

237
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,369
- It's better than toy engines, isn't it?
- I don't know, it's different.

238
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,872
It seems so odd to see all of a train.
It's so tall.

239
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:55,333
I've always seen them cut
in half by platforms

240
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,419
I wonder if that train's going to London?
London is where Daddy is.

241
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:00,880
- We don't know that, Phyl.
- He might be.

242
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,331
How do you do?

243
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,457
- How do you do?
- Yes.

244
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,210
- Could I ask you two questions?
- Yes, well it depends what they are.

245
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,545
I can't spend all day conversationalising
with the junior public.

246
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,047
Now what are they?

247
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,341
What's the white mark
on the coal heap for?

248
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,052
That's to tell you how much coal there is
you see, in case anybody nicks it.

249
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,178
Second question, please.

250
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,138
Do you know anything
about engines?

251
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:34,015
Do I know anything about engines?
Why?

252
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,643
- Because I've got one.
- Er, what gauge?

253
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,146
I don't know anything about gauges,
but it's about this big.

254
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,272
Yes?

255
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:43,858
- It's brass and it blew up.
- It blew up.

256
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,985
Well just excuse me young man,
I've got a lot to do

257
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:48,446
cos the Station Master's
having his hair cut in Leeds, you see

258
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:49,948
and Perks must be about it.

259
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:54,118
- Perks? Who's Perks?
- Me, sir. I'm Perks.

260
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:11,970
Right on time.

261
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:16,850
- What is?
- This ere's the Scots Flyer.

262
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:31,072
Why is it going so slowly,
Mr Perks?

263
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:37,078
Why... well it's all up hill
to Scotland, isn't it?

264
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,624
That train's going to Scotland.

265
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:43,710
If Daddy's not in London,
he's in Scotland

266
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,253
and that train is going to Scotland.

267
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:49,257
Perhaps, Phyl.

268
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,973
I don't think we're going to enjoy
being poor, you know,

269
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,350
being cold and all that.

270
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,230
Phyllis, try to imagine it
as an adventure.

271
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:07,442
All sorts of things might happen.

272
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,485
Mother could write about it.

273
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:12,989
Write a book.
You never know.

274
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,326
We won't always be poor, Phyllis,
I'm sure.

275
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:18,745
All right. Good night.

276
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,207
Good night.

277
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:27,212
I'm still cold though.

278
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,089
...lightly on the-cheek.

279
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,095
...one of the men, in a bowler hat,
opened the door...

280
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,600
Father did not turn,
but left without a word.

281
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,659
Why don't we ask the next train
to take our love to Daddy?

282
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:00,578
Trains don't carry people's love,
they'd be above that.

283
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:02,288
Yes, they do if you tame them first.

284
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,249
I wonder why Daddy
hasn't written to us.

285
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:07,168
Mummy says he's too busy.
he'll write soon, she says.

286
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:11,130
Well, why don't we wave anyway?
Three waves won't matter.

287
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:13,091
We won't miss them.

288
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,074
Charming...

289
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,076
Charming!

290
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,667
About time they had it seen to.

291
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:35,548
The coal in the little shed
has held out well, Bobbie.

292
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,134
There was hardly any there yesterday
when I looked.

293
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,594
Well, we've only had one fire.

294
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:44,182
I know but I could swear there's more
than when we first came.

295
00:29:44,265 --> 00:30:09,457
- That's silly.
- Course it's silly.

296
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:12,710
So it's you, Pete.

297
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:15,672
- It's you.
- It's me what?

298
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:18,174
It's you that's been putting
the coal in the shed.

299
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,093
But where from Pete,
for heaven's sake?

300
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,846
From the coal heap of course,
they've got stacks of it there.

301
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:26,808
But that's stealing!
Don't you remember your catechism?

302
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,726
"Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"

303
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,104
It wasn't stealing.
It was mining.

304
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,815
I took from the top.
That's mining, not stealing.

305
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,942
If it was, all the miners in the world
would be in jug.

306
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,611
Oh, Pete... Pete!

307
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,905
Oh Pete, Pete.

308
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,740
We'll have to take it all back.

309
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,701
- What?
- All of it.

310
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,452
- All of it.
- All of it!

311
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,037
All of it.

312
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:52,333
There can't be anything wrong in trying
to keep your own mother warm.

313
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,960
That can't be wrong.

314
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,337
It's all right Pete,
at least we can burn the evidence.

315
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,808
Mrs Viney, here we are.
I've got the buns for tea.

316
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,811
- Buns?
- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...

317
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,479
Mrs Viney, what's the matter?

318
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,275
It's your dear ma, master Peter,
she's... she's very poorly.

319
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,652
You'd better go back to the village
and get Dr Forrest.

320
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,613
Right.

321
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,615
Don't let her die, Mrs Viney.

322
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,085
Doctor Forrest!

323
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,801
Mother's very ill,
please come quickly,

324
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,762
Stay there, my boy.

325
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,710
Influenza.

326
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:20,171
But not serious.

327
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,677
Now my Lady Grave-airs,
I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?

328
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,512
- Of course, Doctor.
- Right.

329
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:30,139
Now we'll send down some medicine.
Keep a good fire going

330
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:32,058
and have some strong beef tea
ready to give her

331
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,102
the moment the fever goes down...

332
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:36,229
She can have the grapes now
and the soda water.

333
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,565
Oh, and you'd better get
a bottle of brandy.

334
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,692
You can go in now...

335
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,570
May I have the list?

336
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,908
Don't worry, funny face.

337
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:52,120
She's head nurse
but you can be Matron.

338
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,955
Oh, thank you.

339
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,458
Oh, what utter nonsense,
I can't afford all that.

340
00:32:57,584 --> 00:33:01,254
I haven't an idea in my head
for a story

341
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,883
so there won't even be buns
for tea for some time.

342
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:10,096
Tell Mrs Viney to boil some scrag-end
of neck for your dinner tomorrow

343
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,390
then I'll have some of the broth.

344
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:16,102
But even if we never have
anything to eat at all

345
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,271
you can't afford all those other things.

346
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,525
Right. So we've got to think
of some other way.

347
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,028
Now everybody, think.

348
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,030
Just as hard as ever you can,

349
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,615
think!

350
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,701
- I, O, N.
- You sure?

351
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,286
Yes.

352
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,080
I...

353
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,291
O...

354
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:44,380
N.
There. Brilliant.

355
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,090
"Look out at the station. "

356
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:48,760
Definitely one of your best works,
Michael Angelo.

357
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:23,294
Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

358
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,422
Oakworth!

359
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:31,094
Oakworth Station.

360
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:37,141
Oh, I thought I'd missed you.

361
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,977
You are the man who waves to us,
aren't you?

362
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:40,562
- Mind the doors, please.
- Aren't you?

363
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,814
- Yes my dear, I wave...
- Oh, will you take this, please.

364
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,941
We chose you because we thought
you had such a kind face.

365
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,944
Er, mind the doors please, Miss.
Sir. On the way, Mr, Mitchell.

366
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:49,571
Thank you, Mr Perks.

367
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,644
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

368
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,728
Good evening.

369
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:08,066
Oh dear!
Oh! Good evening.

370
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,527
The name's Perks.
I believe we've met.

371
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,446
Yes, you were busy�cause of
the Station Master being in Leeds.

372
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,241
Yes, even busier now
'cause he had a drop too much

373
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:20,662
down at the Britannia Arms and fell over
and broke his daft leg playing billiards.

374
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,455
- Of course it was his own fault.
- Why?

375
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,123
He should've used the rest.

376
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,084
He will do that
over the edge, you see.

377
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:28,503
The old gent asked me
to fetch this up straight away.

378
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:29,754
Thank you very much, Mr Perks.

379
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:32,757
I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence
to give you like Father does, but...

380
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:37,262
Hey! Just stop that, please.
I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.

381
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:40,682
I just came to say I was sorry
to hear your mama wasn't so well

382
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,642
and to ask how she finds herself
this evening.

383
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:47,188
Oh and I've er, I brought her
a bit of sweet briar.

384
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:49,232
It's very sweet to smell that is.

385
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,025
Tuppence indeed.

386
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,695
Thank you very much and I beg
your pardon about the twopence.

387
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,363
No offences, I'm sure.
No offence.

388
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:57,866
And just to show I'll er,
I'll have a look

389
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,201
at that blown up brass engine
of yourn, shall I?

390
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:02,120
- What?
- Yes.

391
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:07,208
Oh, can you manage?
Bit heavy... Here you are.

392
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,712
Oh. Is that it?

393
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:17,635
Bit of a mess, isn't it?
Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.

394
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,721
- Good evening.
- Thank you, Mr Perks. Good night.

395
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:33,568
- Oh!
- Oh, look at that!

396
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:36,821
Oh, everything...

397
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,034
"Dear Roberta, Phyllis
and Peter,

398
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,203
"here are the things you want.

399
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,497
"Your mother will want to know
where they came from

400
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:47,207
"so please ask her to forgive me

401
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,418
"for taking the liberty
of allowing myself the great pleasure.

402
00:37:50,543 --> 00:37:54,756
"Yours sincerely, G. P... Something. "
I can't read it.

403
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,425
I think we were right to ask him.

404
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,010
Right? Of course we're right.

405
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:02,096
I don't fancy telling Mother
the whole truth about this.

406
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:04,516
We shouldn't do that
until she's completely well.

407
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,018
And when she is, we'll be so happy
we shan't mind the fuss.

408
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:09,312
Oh, look at those roses!

409
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,814
I'll take them up to her.

410
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:18,196
- And the sweetbriar.
- Oh, thank you.

411
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:20,323
Cor, look!
I wonder what's in there.

412
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,554
So that's an end to it! Now listen.
It's true, we're poor,

413
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:46,349
but we shall have enough to live on
as long as I have ideas for stories.

414
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:51,604
But you mustn't go about telling people
of our affairs. It isn't right!

415
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:56,359
And you must never, never, never
ask strangers to give you things.

416
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:57,485
Always remember that.

417
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,362
- Yes, Mother.
- I shall write to your old gentleman

418
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,322
and I shall tell him
that I didn't approve.

419
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,575
I shall thank him too,
of course, for his kindness,

420
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,078
but it you that I don't approve of,
not the old gentleman.

421
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:09,664
He's been extremely kind.

422
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:13,751
You can give my letter to your Mr Perks
to give to him.

423
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:18,339
And we won't say any more about it.

424
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:22,260
Isn't she marvellous
when she's angry?

425
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:43,698
Hello, head-nurse.

426
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:47,994
That's funny, I was thinking about you.
I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.

427
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,207
- Your mother's not worse I hope?
- No, but...

428
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:54,876
Come on, we'll go for a ride.

429
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,360
This is great fun.

430
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,029
Come on, out with it, head-nurse.
What's the trouble?

431
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:27,242
It's rather hard, you see, to�out with it'
because of what Mother said.

432
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:28,868
What did Mother say?

433
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:32,038
She said I wasn't to go telling everyone
that we're poor.

434
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:36,543
- But you aren't everyone, are you?
- Not at all. Well?

435
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,920
Well, I know doctors
are very expensive

436
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:42,549
and Mrs Viney told me that her doctor
only cost her twopence a week

437
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,510
- because she belonged to a club.
- Yes.

438
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:47,595
Well, could we join
your club too, please?

439
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,764
The same as Mr Viney.

440
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,432
You aren't cross with me, are you?

441
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:54,936
Cross? How could I be?
You're a very sensible little woman.

442
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,647
Now don't you worry.
I'll make it all right with your mother,

443
00:40:57,772 --> 00:41:00,441
even if I have to make
a special brand-new club just for her.

444
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:05,905
Thank you.

445
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,415
Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up
in here.

446
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,083
Here's a new ribbon for you.

447
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:20,044
There, the surprise is ready.

448
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,338
When the bell rings again
you can come into the dining room.

449
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,965
Come on, Pete.

450
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,222
Of course.

451
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,801
Happy birthday.

452
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,919
Happy birthday, head-nurse.

453
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:54,806
Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.

454
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,857
My darling.

455
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,869
I helped to make it.

456
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:24,085
Happy birthday, Lanky.

457
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:28,590
# She was beautiful as a butterfly

458
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:31,050
# Proud as a queen

459
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:34,220
# Was pretty little Polly Perkins

460
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,931
# Of Paddington Green #

461
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:40,810
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.

462
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,105
Lanky indeed!

463
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,691
Fatty.

464
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:49,736
- Hope you enjoy the cake.
- It's lovely. Thank you very much.

465
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:53,406
- Have a lovely party, my dear.
- Thank you for coming.

466
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:56,075
Thank you.

467
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:03,291
Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?

468
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,719
Thank you very much,
Mrs Waterbury.

469
00:44:14,844 --> 00:44:18,306
Good night, good night.

470
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:22,685
Happy birthday!
Hey, happy birthday!

471
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:17,657
I hope Mother doesn't get too wet
in Wakefield.

472
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,576
We don't want her ill again.

473
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:21,202
It's like being in a besieged castle,

474
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:25,206
the arrows of the foe striking
against the battlements.

475
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,209
No, it's more
like a great big garden-squirt.

476
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:30,503
- You're a great big garden squirt
- Thank you.

477
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:32,755
Stop it you two!
There's a train coming.

478
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:55,153
Oakworth! Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

479
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:56,696
Oakworth Station!

480
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,948
Come on. Don't mind the rain,
it's only a shower.

481
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:00,074
That's it, thank you.

482
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:03,912
Mind the doors, please.
Mind the doors now.

483
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:05,997
Mind the doors, come on.

484
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:08,500
Right away, Mr Mainprice

485
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:13,379
Mother should be on the next train
in about fifteen minutes.

486
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,840
That one was from London, I think.

487
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:18,218
Hey, there's something going
at the end of the station.

488
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,844
Yes, something's happened,
come on.

489
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,514
If you ask me this is a case
for the police courts.

490
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:24,641
No, the infirmary more like.

491
00:46:24,766 --> 00:46:27,435
Let me pass please, will you?
I'll deal with this if you please.

492
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:33,233
- What's he say?
- Sounds like French to me.

493
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:34,984
I was in Calais once for a day.

494
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:39,113
- That's not French.
- Well what is it then if it's not French?

495
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,658
I don't know.
It's not French, I know that.

496
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:47,413
No, that's not French.
Nothing like it.

497
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:51,125
Try him with French if you know
so much then, clever dick.

498
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:54,462
Parlez vous fran�ais, Monsieur?

499
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:58,132
Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!
Enfin un amis.

500
00:46:58,258 --> 00:47:01,636
Mon petit vous ne soures jamais
combien je suis content.

501
00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:04,305
- Now that's French.
- What's he say?

502
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,473
I don't know...

503
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:07,100
Yes, well all right everybody.

504
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,644
Keep moving along, please.
I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.

505
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,148
All right now, now, now...
Go on.

506
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:15,150
Take him into the waiting room.
Mother can talk French.

507
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:16,442
She's on the next train
from Wakefield.

508
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:18,611
Right. Come on.

509
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,826
He thinks you're a policeman.
He thinks you're going to shut him up.

510
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:27,287
I know he does.
Look at his eyes.

511
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,540
They're like a fox's eyes
when the beast is in a trap.

512
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,212
Vous attendre.
Ma mere parlez fran�ais.

513
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:38,339
Nous...

514
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:43,261
- What's "being kind"?
- Er, "bon" is good.

515
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:46,389
Nous sommes bon
pour vous, Monsieur.

516
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:57,775
Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at
the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.

517
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:03,198
C'est bon.
Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.

518
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:04,532
Je vous aide.

519
00:48:04,657 --> 00:48:06,618
Look I'm not sure
we oughtn't to send for police.

520
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:08,536
- Don't!
- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.

521
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:10,622
She speaks French beautifully.
You'd love to hear her.

522
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:13,249
I'm sure he hasn't done anything
like you're sent to prison for.

523
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:16,711
Yes, well he looks
without visible means to me.

524
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:19,380
Still I don't mind waiting
till your mama comes.

525
00:48:19,506 --> 00:48:22,300
I'd like to know what country
has got the credit of him.

526
00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:24,677
Look, I've got an idea.
Foreign stamps.

527
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:26,221
We'll show them these.

528
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:31,476
Regardes les stamps.
Quelle patrie?

529
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,395
Ah... Ruskie...

530
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:37,690
- Ruskie.
- My lord, he's Russian.

531
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:39,901
Yeah, I-I thought he was.

532
00:48:47,116 --> 00:48:48,535
I'll wait here
till you bring Mummy in.

533
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,203
Not afraid?

534
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,663
No.

535
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:58,461
Oakworth Station! Mrs Waterbury,
I have something to tell you.

536
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:01,130
- Mummy, we found a Russian.
- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.

537
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,174
Close the doors.
Right away, Guard!

538
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:05,093
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

539
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:12,433
Hello, Bobbie.
Qui est vous?

540
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,854
Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.

541
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:20,066
Oh, it's all right.
Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.

542
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,443
- We'll take him home with us, Mr Perks.
- Thank you, Madam.

543
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:25,822
Come on, help him on the other side.
Don't worry.

544
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:29,784
Don't worry, she'll look after you.

545
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:31,286
I knew he was a Russian.

546
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:35,707
Doctor.

547
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:40,211
I need to tell you.
Mother's got a very shabby Russian.

548
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:41,796
Your mother's got
a very shabby what?

549
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:45,008
He'll have to join your club.
I'm certain he hasn't any money.

550
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:47,427
We found him at the station.

551
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,679
- Found him? Was he lost then?
- Yes, that's what he was.

552
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:52,265
He's been telling Mother
life story in French.

553
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,350
She said would you please
come directly.

554
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:56,060
He's got a nasty cough

555
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:57,604
and he's been crying.

556
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:00,440
Oh, don't smile.

557
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,317
Please don't.

558
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:05,153
You wouldn't if you'd seen him.

559
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:07,280
I've never seen a man cry before.

560
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:10,658
Haven't you?
I do it all the time.

561
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:03,086
Bobbie!

562
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,173
I know you said
we weren't to ask any questions

563
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:10,051
but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?

564
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:13,721
Oh, my darling, no.

565
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:16,224
Bobbie, look at me.

566
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:20,061
Daddy was quite, quite well
when I heard from him last

567
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:22,313
and he'll come back to us
some day.

568
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,573
Do tell us about the Russian.

569
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:36,077
That can't make a long story, my darling,
because I'm very tired.

570
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:39,831
He's a very clever writer,
but in Russia one dare not say

571
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:42,500
anything about the rich people
doing wrong

572
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:44,377
or what ought to be done
for the poor.

573
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:46,337
If one does, one is sent to prison.

574
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:49,507
Well he wrote a book about it all

575
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:52,260
and he was three years in a dungeon.

576
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:55,597
No light, damp and dreadful.

577
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,057
Then they took him out
and they sent him to Siberia

578
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:00,518
and he was condemned
to stay there for life.

579
00:52:00,602 --> 00:52:04,063
- For life? For writing a book?
- That's stupid.

580
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:06,483
Go on, Mama.

581
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:09,611
While he was at the mines,
some friends got a message to him

582
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:13,239
to say that his wife and children
had escaped to England.

583
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:17,869
So after many adventures he too escaped
and came here to look for them.

584
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:21,748
- Do you think he will find them?
- Oh, I do hope so.

585
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:24,959
I think my darlings, in your prayers
you might ask God

586
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:28,796
to show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives.

587
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:32,884
To show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives?

588
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:37,639
Yes, darling.
Upon all the prisoners and captives.

589
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:51,486
Merci.

590
00:52:57,408 --> 00:53:00,286
He seemed pleased. I wish we could think
of other things to give him.

591
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,996
What about strawberries?

592
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:05,583
Perks promised me some
from his own garden ages ago.

593
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:32,110
Look at that tree over there!

594
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:38,199
Lor, it's moving!

595
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:41,786
So are the others...

596
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:47,959
It's magic.

597
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:53,464
What is it?

598
00:53:57,385 --> 00:54:01,472
It's much too magic for me.
I don't like it, I'm going home.

599
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,460
Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.

600
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:53,024
Hey! The 11:29 down
hasn't gone by yet.

601
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:55,276
We must let them know at the station,
there'll be an accident.

602
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:56,653
- Let's run!
- No, come back.

603
00:54:56,778 --> 00:54:58,613
It's too late, it's two miles away.

604
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:02,283
- We do something to the telegraph wires.
- But we don't know how.

605
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,999
If we only had something red, we could
go down on to the line and wave it.

606
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:12,752
But the train wouldn't see us till it came
round the corner. That's too late.

607
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:14,671
We could go round
and wave to the train.

608
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:16,339
We might wave anyway.

609
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:19,759
No. They'd only think it was us as usual,
we've waved so often before.

610
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:21,845
- Flannel petticoats!
- I beg your pardon?

611
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,139
- Flannel petticoats.
- Of course! Take them off.

612
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:40,405
- Now.
- You're not going to tear them, Pete?

613
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,408
- Oh, shut up
- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.

614
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:47,412
If we can't stop the train,
there'll be an accident with people killed.

615
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:49,330
Now sticks, come on.

616
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,106
- I'll have two. It was my idea.
- They're our petticoats!

617
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:18,693
What's it matter who waves what
if we can only stop the train.

618
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:24,949
Stand firm and wave like mad.

619
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:29,871
Keep off the line, Bobbie.

620
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,460
They won't see us.
It's all no good.

621
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:40,173
- Stand off the line, Bobbie.
- It's all no good.

622
00:56:40,298 --> 00:56:45,136
- Stand back!
- Not yet. Not yet!

623
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,058
- Stop!
- Stop!

624
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:52,894
Stop!

625
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:06,783
- Stand back.
- Stop!

626
00:57:06,908 --> 00:57:08,868
Stop!

627
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:10,912
- Stop!
- Stop!

628
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,415
Stop.

629
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:18,461
Stop...

630
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:21,005
Stop.

631
00:57:25,593 --> 00:57:29,180
Stop. There's been an earthquake.
Don't move you'll all be killed.

632
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:34,227
The trees are walking down the bank
and there's a mountain of great stones.

633
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:52,954
We'll have a look at this earthquake
then get back to the train.

634
00:57:55,665 --> 00:57:58,001
Bobbie.

635
00:57:58,126 --> 00:58:01,546
Ladies and gentlemen, I think
you'll agree with me that we have three

636
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:07,510
charming children here
who are indeed an example to us all.

637
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:13,224
All right chaps, this is it.

638
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:15,477
One, two, three.

639
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:27,614
...I have learned
in the short time I have seen them

640
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:30,033
to look forward to knowing them better.

641
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:32,577
If I had to rename the Waterbury children,

642
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:37,248
I would call them
the Three Saviours of the Steel Road

643
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:38,791
or perhaps the Railway Children.

644
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:43,338
And now my dears, from the directors
of the Northern and Southern Railway

645
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:48,510
in grateful recognition
of a courageous and brave action

646
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:50,762
which averted an accident

647
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:54,516
on August 15th, 1905.

648
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:56,684
Oh, thank you.

649
00:59:15,787 --> 00:59:18,331
It's your turn now.
Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".

650
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:21,918
- Oh, lor!
- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".

651
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:24,087
Ladies and gentlemen...

652
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,756
Ladies and gentlemen,

653
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,802
we shall treasure these watches
for the rest of our lives.

654
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:33,930
What I mean to say is,
thank you all very much indeed.

655
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,311
One, two.

656
00:59:55,827 --> 00:59:58,371
You must be very proud,
Mrs Waterbury.

657
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:01,040
And er, this is from me.

658
01:00:47,545 --> 01:00:51,299
It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?
The kind that very seldom happens.

659
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:54,969
But I did so want to talk to
the old gentleman about something else.

660
01:00:55,094 --> 01:00:56,679
What did you want
to say to him?

661
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:59,599
I'll tell you,
I've written him a letter.

662
01:01:02,185 --> 01:01:05,647
"My dearest old gentleman,
I want to ask you something, please.

663
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:08,858
"If you get out of the train
and go by the next it would do.

664
01:01:08,983 --> 01:01:12,695
"I do not want you to give me anything -
Mother says we ought not to.

665
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:17,659
"Besides, we only want to talk to you
about a prisoner and captive.

666
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:19,202
"Your loving friend, Bobbie. "

667
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:22,288
Very good.
Yes, it is.

668
01:01:34,384 --> 01:01:39,222
My heart's thumping like a steam engine,
right under my sash, too.

669
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:41,307
People's hearts
aren't under their sashes.

670
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:42,934
I don't care, mine is.

671
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:46,813
If you're going to talk like a poetry book,
my heart's in my mouth.

672
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:49,357
My heart's in my boots
if it comes to that.

673
01:01:49,482 --> 01:01:51,860
- He'll think we're idiots.
- He won't be far wrong.

674
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:54,654
Oakworth!

675
01:01:57,574 --> 01:02:00,410
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Perks.

676
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:05,331
- Hello. This is a very great pleasure.
- It was good of you to get out.

677
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:08,209
Er, may I extend a cordial invitation
to the use of my room, sir?

678
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:09,335
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir.

679
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,713
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

680
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:14,507
If you'd care to follow me, sir
just along here.

681
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,725
- Nice and tidy for you sir.
- Ah, thank you, Perks.

682
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,895
- I'll leave you to it then, sir.
- Thank you.

683
01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:30,356
Well?

684
01:02:33,026 --> 01:02:35,987
Well?
What is it?

685
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:41,618
- Oh, please...
- Yes?

686
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:44,746
- What I mean to say is...
- Yes?

687
01:02:44,871 --> 01:02:49,000
- I wish I might say something.
- I wish you would say something.

688
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,128
Well then... it's about our Russian.

689
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:54,547
- Captive.
- A captive.

690
01:02:54,672 --> 01:02:58,092
We want more than anything in the world
to find his wife and children for him.

691
01:02:58,218 --> 01:02:59,344
Only we don't know how.

692
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:02,972
- What did you say his name was?
- I'll write it for you.

693
01:03:05,642 --> 01:03:09,020
Um, would you have a pencil
and the back of an envelope?

694
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:11,439
Here, write it here.

695
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:22,408
This is how you write it.
You say... Szczepansky.

696
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:32,377
That man?
Bless my soul...

697
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:33,837
I've read his book.

698
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:38,091
So your mother took him in
like the good Samaritan.

699
01:03:38,216 --> 01:03:41,427
I'll tell you what, youngsters,
your mother must be a very good woman.

700
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:44,764
- Yes, she is.
- And you're a good man.

701
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:47,100
You flatter me.

702
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:49,853
Now am I to tell you
what I think of you?

703
01:03:49,978 --> 01:03:51,521
- Oh, please don't.
- Why?

704
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:55,108
I don't know why exactly,

705
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:57,610
only if it's something horrid
I don't want you to.

706
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:01,656
And if it's something nice
I'd rather you didn't.

707
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:05,577
Then all I will say is that I'm very glad
you came to me about all this,

708
01:04:05,702 --> 01:04:07,245
very glad indeed.

709
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:10,623
And I shouldn't be surprised
if I don't find out something very soon.

710
01:04:10,748 --> 01:04:12,959
Well now tell me something
about yourselves.

711
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:14,919
Tea first.

712
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:34,230
Who on earth?

713
01:04:36,733 --> 01:04:38,735
Let's go and see.

714
01:04:42,113 --> 01:04:44,491
- Hello.
- Hello.

715
01:04:44,616 --> 01:04:46,951
Hello.
Good news, my dears.

716
01:04:47,076 --> 01:04:49,621
I've found your Russian friend's
wife and children.

717
01:04:49,746 --> 01:04:51,539
- Oh!
- And I couldn't resist

718
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:55,293
the temptation of having the pleasure
of telling him

719
01:04:55,376 --> 01:04:57,670
No, you tell him, my dear.

720
01:04:59,714 --> 01:05:02,717
And the other two
will show me the way.

721
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:11,893
Mother, Mr Szczepansky's wife
and children have been found.

722
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:23,112
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

723
01:05:23,238 --> 01:05:25,156
Goodbye.

724
01:05:27,283 --> 01:05:29,661
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

725
01:05:29,786 --> 01:05:31,079
Goodbye.

726
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:34,666
Excellent.

727
01:05:39,796 --> 01:05:42,090
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

728
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:04,612
Ah! There, that's a likely
little brooch that.

729
01:06:04,737 --> 01:06:08,283
I don't know as ever I seen a thing
more like a buttercup,

730
01:06:08,408 --> 01:06:10,118
without it were a buttercup.

731
01:06:10,243 --> 01:06:12,203
Mother gave it to me
for my birthday.

732
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:15,331
Oh, is that it?
I didn't see it close to.

733
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:18,585
It highly decorative that,
thank you.

734
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,796
- When's your birthday, Mr Perks?
- My birthday?

735
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:24,132
I gave up keeping my birthday
afore you lot were born.

736
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:26,593
But you must have been born
sometime, you know.

737
01:06:26,718 --> 01:06:30,263
Even if it was 20 years ago
or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.

738
01:06:30,388 --> 01:06:33,475
Yeah, well it weren't quite
so long as that.

739
01:06:35,518 --> 01:06:38,104
If you really want to know,

740
01:06:38,229 --> 01:06:40,773
it's my 42 years
come the 15th of this month.

741
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:42,025
Why don't you keep it then?

742
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,110
I've got other things to keep
besides birthdays.

743
01:06:44,235 --> 01:06:47,071
Oh what?
Not secrets, Mr Perks.

744
01:06:47,197 --> 01:06:49,824
No, the kids and bloomin' missus.

745
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,127
I've sold another story, darlings,
the one about the King of the Mussels

746
01:07:01,252 --> 01:07:02,587
so there'll be buns for tea.

747
01:07:02,712 --> 01:07:04,672
You can go and got them
the moment they're ready.

748
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:09,093
Would you mind if we didn't them tonight,
but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.

749
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:11,095
I don't mind, darling,
but why?

750
01:07:12,013 --> 01:07:14,307
Well, it's Mr Perks' birthday,
he's 42.

751
01:07:14,432 --> 01:07:17,435
He says he doesn't keep his birthday
any more, he's got other things to keep.

752
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,564
Not rabbits and secrets,
but the kids and the bloomin' missus.

753
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:24,567
- His wife and children, Bobbie.
- It's the same thing, isn't it?

754
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:27,403
Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ
of endearment, isn't it?

755
01:07:27,529 --> 01:07:29,864
- Term of endearment, Phyl.
- Yes.

756
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:32,033
We thought we'd make
a nice birthday for him.

757
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:33,493
He's been very nice to us.

758
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:36,287
And we agreed that next bun day
we'd ask if we could.

759
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:39,415
It would be rather nice to write his name
on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?

760
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:43,086
- Perks isn't a very pretty name.
- Albert's his other name, I asked once.

761
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:44,712
I think Albert's a pretty name.

762
01:07:48,216 --> 01:07:49,926
What's the matter with that?

763
01:07:52,011 --> 01:07:54,013
What about flowers?

764
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:56,641
He's got lots of flowers of his own,
hasn't he?

765
01:07:56,766 --> 01:07:59,561
Yes, but it's always nice
to be given them.

766
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:01,563
Let's all just sit and think.

767
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:06,025
No one's to speak
until they've thought of something.

768
01:08:12,323 --> 01:08:13,825
- I've got it.
- What?

769
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:17,162
- Perks is so nice to everyone, right?
- Right.

770
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:20,665
So there must be lots of people
who'd like to help make him a birthday.

771
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,418
Mother said
we weren't to ask people for things.

772
01:08:23,543 --> 01:08:25,628
For ourselves, she meant,
not for other people.

773
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:27,463
I think we should ask Mummy first.

774
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:30,008
There's no harm in it,
it depends how you do it.

775
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:33,219
I only hope Mr Perks won't be offended
and think it's charity.

776
01:08:33,344 --> 01:08:35,096
Poor people can be very proud,
you know.

777
01:08:35,221 --> 01:08:37,974
It's not because he's poor,
it's because we're fond of him.

778
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:40,435
All right, I'll look out some things
that Phyllis has outgrown.

779
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,897
- Will that do?
- I'm sure he'd love that.

780
01:08:44,022 --> 01:08:46,024
Come back tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do.

781
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:47,942
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

782
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:49,194
Thank you, bye bye.

783
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:51,946
I've always liked Mrs Ransome.

784
01:08:52,071 --> 01:08:55,074
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

785
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,620
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

786
01:08:58,745 --> 01:09:00,622
Bye!

787
01:09:05,168 --> 01:09:08,379
<i>Some people were kind
and some were crusty</i>

788
01:09:08,505 --> 01:09:10,340
<i>and some would give
some would not.</i>

789
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:13,176
It's Mr Perks' birthday on Thursday,
would you like to give him a present?

790
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:17,806
- No, I would not. I hate the man.
- Thank you!

791
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:19,390
That was pretty rude.

792
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:24,062
<i>It's rather difficult work
asking for things, even for other people.</i>

793
01:09:24,187 --> 01:09:26,189
<i>as you've no doubt found
if you've ever tried it.</i>

794
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:29,359
Tobacco pipe,
half a pound of tea.

795
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:33,655
- Woollen scarf from the Drapers.
- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.

796
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,866
There it is, you can have it
and good riddance to it.

797
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:39,035
- Oh!
- Thank you.

798
01:09:42,038 --> 01:09:44,374
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

799
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:52,298
Thank you, Mr James,
he'll love that.

800
01:09:52,423 --> 01:09:54,425
Goodbye.

801
01:10:11,192 --> 01:10:13,278
Hello?

802
01:10:13,403 --> 01:10:16,072
Hello, is anyone at home?

803
01:10:16,197 --> 01:10:18,616
Me Mam's upstairs,
a- changing herself.

804
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:20,451
Mam, visitors!

805
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:23,705
Thank you Patrick,
just coming.

806
01:10:25,623 --> 01:10:27,750
I'm a bit late changing, Miss,

807
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:30,295
owing to me having had
an extra clean up today

808
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,006
along with Perks happening to say
it's his birthday.

809
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:35,675
I don't know what put such an idea
into his head.

810
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,969
We keeps the children's birthdays,
of course,

811
01:10:38,094 --> 01:10:41,431
but him and me... Well, we've no time
for suchlike as a general rule.

812
01:10:41,556 --> 01:10:44,559
We know it was his birthday
and we've brought him some presents.

813
01:10:44,684 --> 01:10:47,520
Oh, bring them in my dears.

814
01:10:56,488 --> 01:10:59,491
Oh, don't, please don't,
Mrs Perks.

815
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:00,742
Whatever is the matter?

816
01:11:00,825 --> 01:11:03,119
Do you mean to say
you don't like the things we brought?

817
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:04,329
Don't you like them?

818
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:07,874
Oh, there, there, don't mind me,
I'm all right.

819
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:12,378
Like them? Why it's a birthday
such as Perks never had,

820
01:11:12,504 --> 01:11:14,172
not even when he were a boy.

821
01:11:14,297 --> 01:11:15,798
Good, I'm glad you're pleased.

822
01:11:15,924 --> 01:11:17,800
Could we wait and see
if Mr Perks is pleased too?

823
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:19,761
I won't say another word.

824
01:11:19,886 --> 01:11:22,388
Could we have a plate for the buns,
Mrs Perks?

825
01:11:22,514 --> 01:11:24,015
Oh, of course.

826
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,142
Fit for a prince, I'd say.

827
01:11:26,267 --> 01:11:30,522
I never thought there'd be more for him,
except the ounce of his backie.

828
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:34,651
# I'm feeling right today

829
01:11:34,776 --> 01:11:37,111
# Been a lovely day... #

830
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:43,993
Bless us, he's early.

831
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:46,162
Let's hide in there
and you tell him about it

832
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:48,456
but give him the tobacco first
as you got it for him.

833
01:11:48,581 --> 01:11:51,209
When you've told him,
we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".

834
01:11:55,547 --> 01:11:57,215
- How do.
- How do.

835
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,718
Hello, old woman.

836
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:08,268
- Well here's a pretty set out.
- It's your birthday tea, Bert.

837
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:14,566
And here's an ounce
of your extra particular.

838
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:18,319
Yes, she's a good old girl.

839
01:12:18,444 --> 01:12:21,114
Eh, what's that pram doing here?
Hey, you're not...?

840
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,453
Well, what's all these bundles?
Eh?

841
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:30,206
And what's all this sweet stuff and...?

842
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:34,752
What's this squirrel
doing on the table, eh?

843
01:12:35,837 --> 01:12:39,591
Oh, lor!
Whatever should we do?

844
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:42,844
I've forgotten to put the labels
on any of the things.

845
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:45,180
He won't know what's from whom.

846
01:12:45,305 --> 01:12:46,639
He'll think it's all from us

847
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:49,851
and that we're trying to be grand and
charitable or something horrid like that.

848
01:12:49,976 --> 01:12:51,019
Ssh, be quiet!

849
01:12:51,144 --> 01:12:53,396
I don't care. I won't stand it.
I tell you straight.

850
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:56,191
But, it's them children
you make such a fuss about,

851
01:12:56,316 --> 01:12:57,859
the children from the Three Chimneys.

852
01:12:57,942 --> 01:13:01,404
I don't care,
not if it was angels from heaven.

853
01:13:01,529 --> 01:13:03,615
We got on all right all these years
and no favours asked.

854
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,242
I'm not having these charity
goings-on at my time of life.

855
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,869
And don't you think it, Nell.

856
01:13:07,952 --> 01:13:10,622
Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue,
for goodness sake.

857
01:13:10,747 --> 01:13:13,917
All three of�em is in the other room
a- listening to every word you speaks.

858
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:15,960
I'll give them something to listen to.

859
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:18,296
I've spoke my mind to these afore
and I'll do it again. Come out.

860
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:20,256
Come on out!
Out here, come on.

861
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:21,966
No, not you lot, you stop in...

862
01:13:22,091 --> 01:13:24,636
Sophie, look put some pants
on Benjamin, we've got company.

863
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:31,142
Right, you can tell me
what you mean by it.

864
01:13:31,267 --> 01:13:34,604
Have I ever complained of being short
as you starts this charity with me?

865
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:37,106
We thought you'd be so pleased,
Mr Perks.

866
01:13:37,232 --> 01:13:39,818
I'll never try and be kind to anyone else
as long as I live.

867
01:13:39,943 --> 01:13:42,654
- No, I won't. Not never!
- We didn't mean any harm.

868
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:44,489
It isn't what you means
so much as what you does.

869
01:13:44,614 --> 01:13:47,534
We thought you'd love it.
We always have things on our birthdays.

870
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:49,160
Oh ay, from your own relations,
that's different.

871
01:13:49,285 --> 01:13:50,662
No, not just our relations.

872
01:13:50,787 --> 01:13:52,288
They're from all sorts of people
in the village.

873
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:54,707
- And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.
- We did.

874
01:14:04,884 --> 01:14:09,013
So you've been telling the neighbours
that we can't make both ends meet.

875
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,892
Now you've disgraced us as deep
as you can in the neighbourhood,

876
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,812
you can take that pack of tricks
back where it came from.

877
01:14:15,937 --> 01:14:18,523
I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.

878
01:14:18,648 --> 01:14:21,484
I don't doubt that you meant it kind

879
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:25,530
but I'd rather not be acquainted with you
any longer, if it's all the same to you.

880
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:31,369
Look here.
We'll go if you like

881
01:14:31,494 --> 01:14:34,164
and you needn't be friends with us
any more, but...

882
01:14:34,289 --> 01:14:37,125
We'll always be friends with you,
even though you're nasty to us.

883
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,379
But before we go, let us show you
these labels to put on the things.

884
01:14:41,504 --> 01:14:42,964
I don't want to see no labels

885
01:14:43,047 --> 01:14:45,341
except proper luggage labels
in me own walk of life.

886
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:48,970
- Please let Bobbie show you the labels.
- All right, go on.

887
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:51,931
We wrote down everything
everybody said

888
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:54,517
when they gave us the things
with the people's names on.

889
01:14:54,642 --> 01:14:57,645
Because Mother said
that we ought to be careful because...

890
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,439
Well I wrote down what she said
and you'll see.

891
01:14:59,606 --> 01:15:00,607
That's from Mother.

892
01:15:00,732 --> 01:15:04,027
She thought Mrs Perks might like
some of Phyllis' things.

893
01:15:05,111 --> 01:15:08,072
"I can't do much... "

894
01:15:12,285 --> 01:15:16,998
Well that's all right.
I mean, your ma's a born lady.

895
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:19,083
We'll keep the little frocks
and what-not, Nell.

896
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:20,293
Yes, Albert.

897
01:15:20,418 --> 01:15:24,047
Then there's the perambulator
and the gooseberries and sweets.

898
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:25,548
They're from Mrs Ransome.

899
01:15:25,673 --> 01:15:29,761
I can't send the pram back, Bert,
and I won't so don't ask me.

900
01:15:29,886 --> 01:15:31,679
I'm not asking anything.

901
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:34,474
Then there's the shovel.
Mr James made that for you himself

902
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:36,476
and he says...

903
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:38,353
Oh, where is it?
Oh, yes, here.

904
01:15:38,478 --> 01:15:41,272
- No er, you can read it.
- He says,

905
01:15:41,397 --> 01:15:45,819
"You tell Mr Perks it is a pleasure
to make a little trifle for a man

906
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:48,029
"as is so much respected. "

907
01:15:48,154 --> 01:15:50,198
He's a good chap, that.

908
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,076
He's a very good chap, that.

909
01:15:53,952 --> 01:15:55,578
He's not bad at all, that chap.

910
01:15:55,703 --> 01:15:57,831
And everybody who gave anything
said they liked you

911
01:15:57,956 --> 01:15:59,916
and thought it was
a very good idea of ours.

912
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:05,588
And nobody said anything about charity
or anything horrid like that.

913
01:16:05,713 --> 01:16:08,925
We thought that you'd love to know
how fond everybody is of you.

914
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:13,596
And I've never so unhappy
in all my born days.

915
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:15,181
Goodbye.
Come on.

916
01:16:17,142 --> 01:16:18,143
Stop!

917
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:25,859
I take back every word I've said
contrary to what you'd wish.

918
01:16:25,984 --> 01:16:27,610
- Nell?
- Yes, Albert.

919
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:29,154
Put the kettle on.

920
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:31,865
We'll take away the things
if you're unhappy with them.

921
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,116
I'm not unhappy about�em.

922
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,619
I don't know
if I was ever better pleased.

923
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:40,123
...Not so much with the presents
though frankly they're an A. 1 collection

924
01:16:40,248 --> 01:16:42,167
but the kind respect
of our neighbours.

925
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:45,628
- That's worth having, eh Nell?
- I think it's all worth having...

926
01:16:45,753 --> 01:16:48,965
And you've made a most ridiculous fuss
about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.

927
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,466
No, I haven't.

928
01:16:50,592 --> 01:16:52,886
If a man didn't respect himself,
no one wouldn't do it for him.

929
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:55,638
But everyone respects you.
They all said so.

930
01:16:55,763 --> 01:16:58,224
We knew you'd like it
once you understood.

931
01:17:00,518 --> 01:17:04,522
Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?

932
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:06,774
May the garland of friendship
be ever green.

933
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,652
May our garland of friendship
be ever green, Mr Perks.

934
01:17:09,777 --> 01:17:11,905
Hear, hear!

935
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,990
Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?

936
01:17:14,115 --> 01:17:17,494
Let's have a look at them buns
you brought in. Where are they?

937
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:19,954
Who wrote that?
It's Albert.

938
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:21,664
Holy Mary, Mother of God

939
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:25,835
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

940
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:34,478
Now go to sleep all of you
and not another word.

941
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:43,070
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

942
01:17:43,153 --> 01:17:46,365
Yeah they're jolly good
little kids, those Waterburys.

943
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:48,867
Oh, they're all right,
bless their hearts.

944
01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:52,037
It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing
that ever was.

945
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:54,373
- I was ashamed of you, I tell you.
- You needn't be.

946
01:17:54,498 --> 01:17:57,626
I climbed down handsome
as soon as I understood it weren't charity.

947
01:17:57,751 --> 01:18:00,379
Charity's one thing I never could abide,
and won't neither.

948
01:18:00,504 --> 01:18:03,340
- Go to sleep, Albert.
- Yes, dear.

949
01:18:04,174 --> 01:18:06,635
I tell you this though,

950
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,012
it isn't what you does
so much as what you means,

951
01:18:09,138 --> 01:18:10,973
that's what I say.

952
01:18:11,098 --> 01:18:13,934
- Now if it had been charity...
- Oh, drat charity, Bert.

953
01:18:14,059 --> 01:18:17,938
Nobody won't offer you charity
however much you was to want it.

954
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:21,150
That were just friendliness,
that were.

955
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:24,987
I reckon it's what people call
loving kindness.

956
01:18:25,112 --> 01:18:28,073
- Now go to sleep, Bert.
- Yes dear, good night.

957
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:31,368
Good night, Bert.
Happy Birthday.

958
01:18:43,672 --> 01:18:45,215
Nell?

959
01:18:47,092 --> 01:18:50,220
Oh, all right, Bert,
as it's your birthday.

960
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:23,295
Hello, my dears.

961
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,380
Hard at it, are yer?

962
01:19:25,506 --> 01:19:27,883
Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.

963
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:30,010
One good turn deserves another,
that's what I always say.

964
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:31,428
Hello, Mr Perks,
how do mean?

965
01:19:31,553 --> 01:19:35,599
Well I found these magazines, you see,
in the waiting room.

966
01:19:35,724 --> 01:19:37,434
I was cleaning up.

967
01:19:37,559 --> 01:19:41,063
They were in a cupboard and well
they're only collecting dust and...

968
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:43,607
Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.

969
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:44,733
- Hello.
- Hello.

970
01:19:44,858 --> 01:19:47,194
I thought perhaps
you might like them.

971
01:19:47,277 --> 01:19:50,697
There's a lot of pictures in�em.
and that,

972
01:19:50,823 --> 01:19:52,825
and you can colour�em up
with chalks and that.

973
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,076
Anyway I don't want�em.

974
01:19:54,201 --> 01:19:55,911
- You're a dear.
- Yes, you are.

975
01:19:57,246 --> 01:20:00,499
- Hear, hear!
- Well, that's all right then.

976
01:20:00,624 --> 01:20:02,918
I must be getting along.
I've got lots to do.

977
01:20:03,043 --> 01:20:04,753
Perks must be about it.

978
01:20:04,878 --> 01:20:07,589
Thank you.
That was very kind of him.

979
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:10,801
We'd better go inside,
it's going to rain.

980
01:20:40,622 --> 01:20:41,582
Daddy...

981
01:21:17,075 --> 01:21:20,037
- Where's Bobbie?
- I thought I heard her upstairs.

982
01:21:20,162 --> 01:21:24,041
She knows it's tea time.
I wonder if she's all right.

983
01:21:26,752 --> 01:21:44,228
Bobbie?

984
01:21:47,356 --> 01:21:48,899
What is it darling?

985
01:21:50,943 --> 01:21:51,985
Oh, Mummy!

986
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:07,960
You don't believe Daddy did it?

987
01:22:08,085 --> 01:22:10,546
- No.
- Because it's not true.

988
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:13,966
They have shut him in prison,
but he's done nothing wrong.

989
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:17,177
He's good and honourable
and he belongs to us.

990
01:22:18,262 --> 01:22:21,765
Will it make you very unhappy
if you tell me all about it?

991
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,350
I want to understand.

992
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:32,734
Do you remember the day
those two men took Daddy away?

993
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:34,695
Yes, I do.

994
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:39,074
Well they arrested him, charging him
with selling State secrets

995
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,202
with being, in fact,
a spy and a traitor.

996
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:46,999
How could anyone believe that?

997
01:22:47,124 --> 01:22:49,334
How could anyone do such a thing?

998
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:51,170
Someone did.

999
01:22:52,254 --> 01:22:55,674
Why didn't you tell someone,
a lawyer?

1000
01:22:56,633 --> 01:23:00,971
There wasn't anyone who could
hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?

1001
01:23:01,096 --> 01:23:05,017
I don't know.
It's all so complicated.

1002
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:09,855
There was a man in the office
who was very envious of your father.

1003
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:12,691
Daddy always said
he didn't quite trust him.

1004
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:15,402
Why didn't you explain
all that to someone?

1005
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:17,779
No one would listen.

1006
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:20,782
Do you suppose
I haven't tried everything?

1007
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:24,661
No, my darling,
what we have to do, you and I,

1008
01:23:24,786 --> 01:23:28,081
and Daddy, is to be brave.

1009
01:24:16,213 --> 01:24:17,506
Where have you been?

1010
01:24:18,549 --> 01:24:20,050
Where have I been?

1011
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:22,177
Down to the station.
Don't ask why, it's a secret.

1012
01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:23,428
Oh, please yourself.

1013
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:26,515
- There's a paper chase tomorrow.
- Oh, whoopee!

1014
01:24:26,598 --> 01:24:28,016
- Who?
- The grammar school boys.

1015
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:29,059
Oh zippee!

1016
01:24:29,184 --> 01:24:31,228
Perks says we can see them
going along by the line.

1017
01:24:31,353 --> 01:24:32,688
Oh really?

1018
01:24:34,064 --> 01:24:35,816
What's a paper chase?

1019
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,418
Let me pass please

1020
01:24:59,256 --> 01:25:02,176
Hey! That's against by-laws.

1021
01:25:02,301 --> 01:25:05,471
- I ought to report him.
- They're only having fun.

1022
01:25:05,596 --> 01:25:09,475
Passengers is forbidden to cross the line
on any pretence.

1023
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,895
He ain't no passenger.
He's out of sight now, anyway.

1024
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:17,524
What the eye don't see the heart need
take no notice of, that what I always say.

1025
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:20,611
Come on then.

1026
01:25:21,403 --> 01:25:23,864
He's gone in the tunnel.

1027
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:25,866
Oh, it is dark in here.

1028
01:25:33,624 --> 01:25:35,626
They don't know
what they're in for.

1029
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,461
It isn't easy running in the dark.

1030
01:25:37,586 --> 01:25:40,464
They'll take a long time
going through, won't they?

1031
01:25:40,589 --> 01:25:42,299
Aye, they will that.

1032
01:25:50,724 --> 01:25:53,101
- They went that way.
- Oh thanks!

1033
01:25:54,478 --> 01:25:57,231
I know! Let's cut across to the top
and see them come out the other end.

1034
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:59,441
- We'll be there before they are.
- Good idea.

1035
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:01,026
Yes, good idea!

1036
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:43,485
- This way!
- No, this way. Come on, quick.

1037
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:53,704
There, that's all.

1038
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:55,205
What should we do now?

1039
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:57,416
Not yet,
there's one in a red jersey.

1040
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,168
He hasn't come out yet.

1041
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,171
Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth

1042
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:05,007
and perhaps we can see him
from the inside.

1043
01:27:16,935 --> 01:27:18,604
It's dark in there.

1044
01:27:18,729 --> 01:27:21,148
- Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.
- I don't like it.

1045
01:27:22,524 --> 01:27:25,319
Still no sign of him. I reckon
he must have had an accident.

1046
01:27:25,444 --> 01:27:28,113
Let's go and rescue him.
Come on.

1047
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:30,115
Come on, Phyl.
Keep close behind me.

1048
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,242
If a train comes along
get flat against the tunnel wall

1049
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:34,036
and hold your skirts against you.

1050
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:35,496
I still don't like it.

1051
01:27:45,756 --> 01:27:49,218
- I want to go back.
- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?

1052
01:27:49,343 --> 01:27:50,761
It's another earthquake!

1053
01:28:06,777 --> 01:28:09,613
- It's a train.
- Oh, let me go back!

1054
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,865
Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.
Stand back.

1055
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,826
Come in, come on.

1056
01:28:36,098 --> 01:28:38,350
It is a dragon.
I always thought it was.

1057
01:28:51,572 --> 01:28:52,739
Come on.

1058
01:28:52,823 --> 01:28:55,450
Supposing that boy
was caught underneath the train...

1059
01:28:55,576 --> 01:28:57,786
- Oh!
- We've got to go and see.

1060
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:00,330
Can't we go and get someone
from the station?

1061
01:29:00,455 --> 01:29:02,624
- Phyl, you wait here.
- No.

1062
01:29:02,749 --> 01:29:07,546
Hello?

1063
01:29:09,423 --> 01:29:11,842
Hey you two, come quickly!

1064
01:29:13,302 --> 01:29:16,889
Oh, is that blood?
Is that red blood?

1065
01:29:17,014 --> 01:29:20,017
- Is he all killed?
- Phyllis, please.

1066
01:29:20,142 --> 01:29:22,853
Hurry up you two, get help.

1067
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:40,037
"It was on a hot summer's afternoon... "

1068
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:45,501
Oh, do come down, we've found a hound
in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.

1069
01:29:45,626 --> 01:29:47,711
They're bringing him here,
I've sent for Doctor Forrest.

1070
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:50,506
But you should send for a vet,
I can't have a lame dog here.

1071
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:52,633
Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.

1072
01:29:52,758 --> 01:29:54,760
Well then he ought to be taken
to his mother.

1073
01:29:54,885 --> 01:29:57,971
His mother's dead,
his father's in Northumberland.

1074
01:29:58,096 --> 01:29:59,973
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,
won't you?

1075
01:30:00,098 --> 01:30:02,434
I told him I was sure you'd want us
to have him here.

1076
01:30:02,559 --> 01:30:05,771
- You always want to help everybody.
- Come along.

1077
01:30:15,656 --> 01:30:17,449
I'm glad you brought him here.

1078
01:30:17,574 --> 01:30:21,078
- Let's get him to bed.
- It will hurt a bit, won't it?

1079
01:30:21,203 --> 01:30:26,500
I hope you don't think I'm a coward if
I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.

1080
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,293
I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.

1081
01:30:28,418 --> 01:30:32,673
Don't you worry, you're the one
who's got the trouble.

1082
01:30:32,798 --> 01:30:35,467
We'd love to have you here,
wouldn't we, Bobbie?

1083
01:30:35,592 --> 01:30:37,010
Yes.

1084
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:43,016
That will be Doctor Forrest.
I'll go.

1085
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:56,446
- That's not the doctor.
- I know.

1086
01:30:56,572 --> 01:30:58,782
I know that voice though,
at least I think I do.

1087
01:30:58,907 --> 01:31:03,120
I thought I recognised it too.
It's not the doctor, that's for sure.

1088
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,960
Could it be that Doctor Forrest
has been attacked by highwaymen

1089
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:12,629
and left for dead and this is the man
they've telegraphed

1090
01:31:12,754 --> 01:31:15,299
- to take his place?
- Perhaps he's gone mad.

1091
01:31:15,424 --> 01:31:18,051
Perhaps he's caught something awful
from one of his patients

1092
01:31:18,177 --> 01:31:19,636
and that man's come to tell her.

1093
01:31:19,761 --> 01:31:21,805
Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man
up into Jim's bedroom.

1094
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,432
Why should she?

1095
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:26,435
Listen.
The door's opening.

1096
01:31:36,612 --> 01:31:38,280
Now they'll come down.

1097
01:31:38,405 --> 01:31:40,365
It's rude to listen like this.

1098
01:31:40,491 --> 01:31:44,328
It's not listening, nobody in their senses
would talk secrets on the stairs.

1099
01:31:44,453 --> 01:31:46,163
Bobbie?

1100
01:31:46,288 --> 01:31:48,999
A relative of Jim's has come,
he wants to see you.

1101
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:50,000
Wash your hands and faces.

1102
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:52,002
We'll be in the dining room
when you're ready.

1103
01:31:52,085 --> 01:31:53,086
Yes, Mama.

1104
01:31:55,339 --> 01:31:58,592
There now!
Fancy not thinking of that, hm?

1105
01:31:58,717 --> 01:32:01,970
- Any hot water, Mrs Viney?
- Righto love.

1106
01:32:07,851 --> 01:32:10,229
You all right?
There we are, that's it.

1107
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,108
Well I never did!

1108
01:32:15,234 --> 01:32:17,736
This, my dears,
is Jim's grandfather.

1109
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:21,073
Our own old gentleman!
I'm so awfully glad it's you.

1110
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:24,034
When I just think of all
the old gentlemen there are in the world

1111
01:32:24,117 --> 01:32:25,869
it could have been anyone.

1112
01:32:25,994 --> 01:32:27,871
You're not going to take
Jim away though, are you?

1113
01:32:27,996 --> 01:32:29,081
Not at present.

1114
01:32:29,206 --> 01:32:32,251
Your mother has most kindly consented
to let him stay here.

1115
01:32:32,376 --> 01:32:36,713
I thought of sending a nurse but your
mother said she'd nurse him herself.

1116
01:32:36,839 --> 01:32:39,925
But we won't have anything to eat
if Mother doesn't write.

1117
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,969
That's all right, Peter.

1118
01:32:42,052 --> 01:32:43,762
I see you trust your children.

1119
01:32:43,887 --> 01:32:46,849
- Of course.
- Then I may tell them our arrangement.

1120
01:32:46,974 --> 01:32:48,517
Sit down, my dears.

1121
01:32:50,894 --> 01:32:55,065
Your Mother, my dears, has consented
to give up her writing for a while

1122
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,317
and to become
a matron of my hospital.

1123
01:32:57,442 --> 01:33:00,028
Does that mean we'll have to leave
Three Chimneys and the railways?

1124
01:33:00,112 --> 01:33:02,531
No, no, my darling. No.

1125
01:33:02,656 --> 01:33:05,242
The hospital is here.

1126
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:09,997
The Three Chimneys Hospital
and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.

1127
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,458
- Will Mother go on writing again?
- We shall see...

1128
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:15,627
Perhaps something nice will happen
and she won't have to.

1129
01:33:15,752 --> 01:33:17,671
- But I like my writing.
- I know.

1130
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:21,633
Don't be afraid I'm going to try
and interfere but one never know.

1131
01:33:21,758 --> 01:33:24,803
Very beautiful and wonderful things
do happen, don't they?

1132
01:33:24,928 --> 01:33:29,183
And we live most of our lives
in the hope of them.

1133
01:33:36,482 --> 01:33:39,818
I got your letter my dear,
but it wasn't needed.

1134
01:33:39,943 --> 01:33:44,323
When I read about your father's case
in the papers at the time I had my doubts.

1135
01:33:44,448 --> 01:33:48,243
And ever since I've known who you were,
I've been trying to find out things

1136
01:33:48,368 --> 01:33:50,537
and I have hopes.

1137
01:33:50,662 --> 01:33:53,832
- Oh...
- Yes, I may say, great hopes.

1138
01:33:53,957 --> 01:33:56,710
But keep your secret
for a little while longer.

1139
01:33:56,835 --> 01:33:59,922
Wouldn't do to upset your mother
with a false hope, would it?

1140
01:34:00,047 --> 01:34:03,091
But it isn't false.
I know you can do it.

1141
01:34:03,175 --> 01:34:05,886
I knew you could when I wrote.
It isn't false hope, is it?

1142
01:34:06,011 --> 01:34:07,596
No, my dear.

1143
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:11,141
You don't believe Daddy did it?
Oh, say you don't believe he did.

1144
01:34:11,266 --> 01:34:14,853
My dear, I'm perfectly certain
he didn't.

1145
01:34:30,202 --> 01:34:32,621
<i>Life at Three Chimneys
was never quite the same again</i>

1146
01:34:32,746 --> 01:34:34,248
<i>after the old gentleman
came to see us.</i>

1147
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:38,168
Oh, please Phyllis.

1148
01:34:38,252 --> 01:34:40,754
<i>The house became a hospital.</i>

1149
01:34:42,714 --> 01:34:44,883
I give you three guesses
who that is.

1150
01:34:47,928 --> 01:34:51,098
Is everything all right?
Good luck. I'll curtain up.

1151
01:34:52,891 --> 01:34:53,892
Have you...

1152
01:34:54,017 --> 01:34:57,938
Have you noticed
the ship is sinking?

1153
01:34:58,063 --> 01:35:01,316
Yes I know,
but don't blame me.

1154
01:35:03,026 --> 01:35:06,446
Oh, no!
Oh, no they'll all get so wet.

1155
01:35:07,489 --> 01:35:10,033
You'll need some light
on the subject.

1156
01:35:11,702 --> 01:35:15,289
As your solicitor
I must advise you.

1157
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:18,917
Don't worry.

1158
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:22,045
Don't worry,
I've managed to get most of the survivors.

1159
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:23,672
Right, curtain down.

1160
01:35:23,797 --> 01:35:26,884
Thank you, good evening.

1161
01:35:34,016 --> 01:35:36,018
I hope you enjoyed it.

1162
01:35:45,903 --> 01:35:48,447
Children, will you please be quiet.

1163
01:35:48,572 --> 01:35:50,115
Oh, the blood!

1164
01:35:52,034 --> 01:35:54,119
- Oh, is it over?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1165
01:35:54,244 --> 01:35:56,455
- Oh, you are a good doctor.
- Can I have that please?

1166
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,040
There we are. How's that?

1167
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,334
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

1168
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:03,670
<i>Jim's leg got better
and he went home.</i>

1169
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:06,298
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

1170
01:36:12,262 --> 01:36:14,264
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1171
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:18,435
- Goodbye.
- Bye, I'll write.

1172
01:36:20,437 --> 01:36:24,983
- Lor lummy, Pete!
- They'll have to marry now!

1173
01:36:25,108 --> 01:36:26,068
Lummy.

1174
01:36:30,155 --> 01:36:33,158
<i>We seemed to be hardly
Railway Children at all in those days</i>

1175
01:36:33,283 --> 01:36:38,080
<i>and as the days went on each of us
had an uneasy feeling about this</i>

1176
01:36:38,205 --> 01:36:40,207
<i>which Phyllis expressed one day.</i>

1177
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:44,169
I wonder if the railway misses us.
We never go and see it now.

1178
01:36:44,294 --> 01:36:45,462
It seems ungrateful.

1179
01:36:45,587 --> 01:36:48,590
We loved it so when we hadn't
anyone to play with.

1180
01:36:48,715 --> 01:36:51,468
The thing I don't like is our having
stopped waving to the 9:15

1181
01:36:51,593 --> 01:36:53,554
and sending our love to Father by it.

1182
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,973
Let's begin again tomorrow.

1183
01:37:09,403 --> 01:37:11,363
Hurry up, Fatty,
for goodness sake.

1184
01:37:11,488 --> 01:37:13,740
I can't, my bootlace is undone.

1185
01:37:13,866 --> 01:37:17,161
When you marry your laces
will come undone going up the aisle

1186
01:37:17,286 --> 01:37:20,289
and the man that you marry
will tumble over and smash his nose in.

1187
01:37:20,372 --> 01:37:24,918
I'd rather marry a man with
a smashed in nose than not marry at all.

1188
01:37:31,216 --> 01:37:34,511
- Take our love to Father!
- Take our love to Father!

1189
01:38:11,048 --> 01:38:12,549
Most extraordinary!

1190
01:38:12,674 --> 01:38:16,428
- Most extraordinary.
- Extraordinary indeed.

1191
01:38:17,846 --> 01:38:21,975
Now, Bobbie,
I wonder whether you could...

1192
01:38:23,769 --> 01:38:25,854
Don't you feel well?

1193
01:38:25,979 --> 01:38:29,942
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel...

1194
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,819
Will you let me off lessons today?

1195
01:38:31,944 --> 01:38:35,906
I feel as if I want to be
quite alone, by myself.

1196
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:38,075
Of course I'll let you off.

1197
01:38:44,498 --> 01:38:48,001
What is it?
You don't feel ill, do you?

1198
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:51,004
No, not ill.

1199
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:54,716
I've just got to be alone,
do you know?

1200
01:38:54,842 --> 01:38:59,304
Mm, sometimes Roberta,
you're so like me.

1201
01:39:05,435 --> 01:39:07,437
I'll be more alive in the garden.

1202
01:39:19,074 --> 01:39:21,451
- Morning, Miss, I'm sure.
- Good luck, Miss Roberta.

1203
01:39:21,577 --> 01:39:23,078
Thank you.

1204
01:39:24,955 --> 01:39:28,125
Hello. Look, if this is the train,
it'll be smart work.

1205
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:32,504
Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was
never so pleased in all my born days.

1206
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:35,299
One I most have and no offence I know
on a day like this.

1207
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:38,844
And one for luck.
You ain't offended, are you?

1208
01:39:38,969 --> 01:39:42,097
I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I,
on a day like this, you know.

1209
01:39:42,222 --> 01:39:44,975
- No, Mr Perks, of course it's not a liberty.
- No.

1210
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,604
Dear Mr Perks, we love you quite as much
as if you were an uncle of our own

1211
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:50,022
but on a day like what?

1212
01:39:50,147 --> 01:39:53,400
Well like this�ere. I told you,
I seen it in the papers, didn't I?

1213
01:39:53,484 --> 01:39:55,194
Saw what in the papers?

1214
01:39:55,319 --> 01:40:05,037
Oakworth!

1215
01:40:06,497 --> 01:40:09,208
Oakworth Station.

1216
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:12,002
Oakworth. There we are.
Thank you, Madam.

1217
01:40:12,127 --> 01:40:14,588
Yes, thank you.
Quick as you can, please.

1218
01:40:15,964 --> 01:40:18,884
Oakworth Station.

1219
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:25,432
- Right away, Mr Cryer.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

1220
01:41:00,926 --> 01:41:03,762
Daddy, my Daddy!

1221
01:42:37,898 --> 01:42:41,777
<i>I think just now
we're not wanted there.</i>

1222
01:42:41,902 --> 01:42:45,072
<i>Not for a few minutes anyway.</i>

1223
01:42:45,197 --> 01:42:49,868
<i>I think it would best for us
to go quickly and quietly.</i>

1224
01:42:49,993 --> 01:42:56,166
<i>We'll go to the end of the field
among the thin gold spikes of grass.</i>

1225
01:42:56,291 --> 01:43:01,088
<i>We may just take one last look
over our shoulders, at the house</i>

1226
01:43:01,213 --> 01:43:04,466
<i>where neither we nor anyone else
is wanted now.</i>

1227
01:44:16,747 --> 01:44:20,125
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

1228
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:22,211
Hope you loved it.

1229
01:44:34,056 --> 01:44:35,766
Goodbye.
