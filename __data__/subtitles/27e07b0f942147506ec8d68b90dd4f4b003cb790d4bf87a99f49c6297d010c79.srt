1
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,752
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

2
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:39,547
Blessed art thou among women,

3
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,133
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus,

4
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:48,389
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners,

5
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:55,480
Now and at the hour of our death.

6
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,983
Amen.

7
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,872
No, no.

8
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,431
No, no, no!

9
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:05,169
No!

10
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,551
Help!

11
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,352
<i>Aiuto!</i>

12
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,313
<i>Aiuto!</i>

13
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,693
No, no, no!

14
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,528
<i>Aiuto!</i>

15
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,628
Please...

16
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,716
help.

17
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,511
No!

18
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,312
<i>Aiuto!</i>

19
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,305
I'm sorry,
but how much longer will this take?

20
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,015
I've got to take my vows tonight,

21
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,518
and I really can't be late.

22
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,311
Do you speak English?

23
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:47,772
Sorry for the wait.

24
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,857
It's extra work now
when someone arrives

25
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,318
without a return ticket.

26
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:54,987
Parli italiano?

27
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,365
I ask if you're learning Italian.

28
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,785
Oh, I'm trying,
but it's a lot harder than I thought.

29
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,079
Mm.

30
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,624
So this convent,
they bought you the ticket?

31
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,084
Mm-hmm.

32
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:14,507
You're very young
to be a nun, aren't you?

33
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,300
What a waste.

34
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:18,845
Look at her.

35
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,347
It's a different life, yeah?

36
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:24,350
It must have been a hard decision.

37
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,480
I don't think of it like that,

38
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,649
as a decision.

39
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,572
Very well.

40
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:42,243
I hope you find what you're looking for,
Sister Cecilia.

41
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,384
Sister Cecilia.

42
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,719
Apologies.

43
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,345
I'm Deacon Enzo. Come with me.

44
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,723
Thank you.

45
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
How much longer?

46
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,092
We're almost there.

47
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,933
Right this way, Sister Cecilia.

48
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,820
Sister Cecilia!

49
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,322
Reverend Mother.

50
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:47,868
Your eyes radiate
the light of the Holy Spirit.

51
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,455
Like the angels delivered you
straight from the heavens.

52
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,375
We've been eagerly awaiting your arrival,
my dear.

53
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:56,877
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,007
She says you're pretty.

55
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,801
Grazie.
I'm Sister Cecilia.

56
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,679
Isabelle.

57
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,473
Isabelle, will you
please show Cecilia to her room?

58
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:12,601
I have to help our sisters
get ready for tonight's celebration.

59
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,979
Mind your place and do as I ask!

60
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:20,651
Let me show you to your room.

61
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:24,113
Our Lady of Sorrows
was founded in 1632

62
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,032
as a refuge for elder sisters

63
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,992
before their transition
to heaven.

64
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:29,869
- It's really beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

65
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,495
<i>Buongiorno, sorelle.</i>

66
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,497
And we work hard
to keep it that way.

67
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,333
Our sister's final days should be

68
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,002
a pleasing environment
to help distract from all

69
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,338
the sickness and suffering.

70
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:43,215
All of this, it was built
on the catacomb of St. Stephen.

71
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,884
Catacombs?

72
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,927
It's off limits.

73
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:48,804
Hello, Sisters.

74
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,015
This is our new novice, Sister Cecilia.

75
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,767
Ciao.

76
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,144
The one in the wheelchair,
her tumor has metastasized.

77
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,938
So we expect her to meet
God by the end of the week.

78
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,608
You talk about it so casually.

79
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,235
Death is a part of everyday life here.

80
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,113
Have you seen my daddy?

81
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:10,326
Yes, let's go find him,
shall we?

82
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,621
It's best to just
play along with their delusions

83
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,498
unless they get violent.

84
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,541
Be careful of this one.
She bites.

85
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,941
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,984
Living quarters for the caretakers

87
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,070
are down there and upstairs.

88
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,198
Morning prayer begins at 5:00
a.m., communal meal is after.

89
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,283
And if you have any
dietary restrictions,

90
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,285
we cannot accommodate them.

91
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,330
And this room is yours.

92
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,128
Thank you, sister.

93
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,713
I feel honored to serve alongside you.

94
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,340
You're very sweet.

95
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,800
Thank you.

96
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,468
I don't mean that as a compliment.

97
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:14,223
I'm sure this must feel very romantic,

98
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,016
but this is our life.

99
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,977
And I promise you, work is hard,

100
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,603
physically and emotionally.

101
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,873
So if you're here to find yourself,
there are easier ways.

102
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,357
I'm not.

103
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,197
Tonight, you do not
have to take your vows.

104
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,868
You can still go back,
and God will forgive you.

105
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,831
I think he has sufficiently prepared me.

106
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,756
The ceremony will start
at 1700 in the chapel.

107
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:49,341
Don't be late.

108
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,852
- Oh, ciao.
- Ciao.

109
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,979
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

110
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,647
I'm Cecilia.

111
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,649
Oh, I'm Guendalina.
You can call me Gwen.

112
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:07,234
My room is there.

113
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,236
Where in the States are you from?

114
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,614
Just outside of Detroit, Michigan.

115
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:12,907
Mm-hmm.

116
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,658
Are you from around here or...

117
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,994
Closer to Milan.

118
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,914
You're far from home.

119
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,042
Yeah, my parish closed.

120
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,003
- Did the priest get in trouble?
- No.

121
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,130
No, no, no, no, no, no,
nothing, nothing like that.

122
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:30,549
Just low attendance.

123
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,594
And that church was my family, my home.

124
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,804
Leaving, I felt pretty lost.

125
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,682
But then Father Tedeschi,
he reached out to me.

126
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:39,934
Yeah.

127
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,102
He has a talent.

128
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,440
Sniffing out broken birds.

129
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,074
Oh, I didn't want to offend you.

130
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,787
I think that maybe we are all
head cases or runaways.

131
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,582
Which one are you?

132
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,045
Both.

133
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,258
Next time if you want,
you can lock the door.

134
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:14,009
Thanks.

135
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,925
Sister Cecilia.

136
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,846
Father Tedeschi,
it's nice to meet you in person.

137
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:44,642
We all feel so blessed
to have you here.

138
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,227
How's the Italian coming along?

139
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,520
Comme ci, com me ci.

140
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,772
It's fine.

141
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,315
I will translate for you.

142
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:04,536
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

143
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:26,767
Let us rejoice,
for the marriage of the Lamb has come,

144
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:31,105
and his brides
have made themselves ready.

145
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,529
<i>Sorella Cecilia.</i>

146
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,447
Sister Cecilia.

147
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,789
Do you promise to follow Christ

148
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,166
more closely by living a life devoid

149
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,335
of material possessions?

150
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,422
Do you promise
to free yourself from the demands

151
00:15:56,547 --> 00:16:00,050
of a human relationship
and follow with joy

152
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:03,011
when he shall come again...

153
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:06,974
a vow of poverty,
chastity, and obedience?

154
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,350
I do.

155
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,945
May God give you
the strength to fulfill your vows

156
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,031
faithfully and joyfully.

157
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:27,327
May you shine his light
for the world to see.

158
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,711
How are you feeling?

159
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,172
Full.

160
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,674
Yeah, we don't...
we don't really have anything

161
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,634
like this back home.

162
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,887
Cecilia, this is your home.

163
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,099
I know, I know.

164
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,976
I felt the same way
when I started here.

165
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,687
I didn't grow up
wanting to be a priest.

166
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,942
My first career was in sciences, biology.

167
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,654
I was almost two decades in,
and I couldn't

168
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,380
understand the world
any better than back

169
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:06,617
when I was in Sunday school.

170
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:10,662
And then God showed me a path.

171
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,831
He brought me here.

172
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:14,833
This is where I was meant to be.

173
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:22,257
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

174
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,462
Two glasses in and I can't stop
talking about myself.

175
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,011
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK.

176
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,013
- It's OK.
- What about you?

177
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,307
I imagine it was a difficult decision.

178
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:35,938
I mean, yes,
it seemed so far away.

179
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,733
But the opportunities
back in the States,

180
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,362
I didn't feel like
that's what God saved me for.

181
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,657
If it's too personal...

182
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,075
No.

183
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,454
When I was 12 years old,
there was this part

184
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:56,625
of the Saginaw River
that would always freeze over.

185
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,919
And no matter how cold it was, I would

186
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,754
always walk out onto the ice.

187
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,090
And I would do this thing
where I took my gloves off,

188
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,844
and I would place my hands
right on the ice.

189
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,638
And I would hold them there
until I couldn't feel anything.

190
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,767
I don't remember the ice breaking.

191
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,271
I just, I remember this sharp pain of cold.

192
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,960
The paramedics,
they tried to revive me,

193
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,111
but my heart stopped
for almost seven minutes.

194
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,656
That sounds terrifying.

195
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,118
I know God saved me for a reason,

196
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,788
but I guess I'm still searching
for what that reason is.

197
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:43,130
Now will you...
will you excuse me, please?

198
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,883
Ciao?

199
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,524
Are you OK?

200
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:36,952
I'll go get some help.

201
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,246
Cecilia.

202
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,456
Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.

203
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,542
I heard her crying and...

204
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,835
It's OK.

205
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,754
Sometimes
we get caught up in emotion.

206
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,757
You have a question.

207
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,759
All right.

208
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,977
What is this place?

209
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:13,572
Saint Helena,
Mother of Constantine...

210
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,824
brought this back from Jerusalem.

211
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:17,867
Here.

212
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,958
He suffered on the cross.

213
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:35,677
Suffered?
This is the...

214
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,058
Yes.

215
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:46,855
For you. For us.
For our sins. For our salvation.

216
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:49,316
We suffer.

217
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,777
In the name of His love.

218
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,237
It is a gift.

219
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,700
Suffering is love.

220
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,955
Are you alright, Sister?

221
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,473
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

222
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:22,974
Amen.

223
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,144
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

224
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:28,563
It's been three days
since my last confession.

225
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,570
I was...

226
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,906
I was careless last night.

227
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:44,371
I must have drank too much
wine and embarrassed myself

228
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,248
in front of Mother Superior.

229
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:57,259
I promise to carry myself
with grace because I want nothing

230
00:22:57,384 --> 00:23:00,345
more than to belong here.

231
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,597
I'm afraid I've already messed things up.

232
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,398
I'm sorry for these...

233
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,615
Yearnments.

234
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,087
Hello?

235
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:12,727
Good morning, Sisters.
Today a new life begins.

236
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,230
But this new year will not be easy.

237
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,774
You will question your purpose.

238
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,403
You will question me
and why you have come here.

239
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:25,699
And some of you will not have
the spiritual fortitude for this life.

240
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,452
What did she say?

241
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:31,496
God is good.
God is great.

242
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,123
God, my head hurts.

243
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,874
Too much blood of Christ?

244
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,297
Do you find this
amusing, Sister Guendalina?

245
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:42,716
No, forgive me.

246
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,843
This side of the room is with me.

247
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:49,514
The other, will serve with Sister Isabelle.

248
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,725
No.

249
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:55,854
What a blessing
to mentor you both.

250
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,647
Finish eating. We have work to do.

251
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,108
Looks like her
vibrator ran out of battery.

252
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,110
What does that mean?

253
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:03,778
Oh, nothing. I really like her.

254
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:06,072
I'm super excited.

255
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,866
Clean their back thoroughly.

256
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:10,910
And if the consistency
of their feces seems off,

257
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,038
you let Dr. Gallo know.

258
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,249
Ciao.

259
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,418
All: Ciao.

260
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,171
We want to hang the larger
items towards the front

261
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,840
and the shorter items towards the back.

262
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:26,468
That way, the wind can blow underneath it.

263
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,681
First you have to make sure
your knife is nice and sharp.

264
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,726
Otherwise you run the
risk of making a big mess.

265
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,550
I'm sorry. I can't.

266
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:27,237
<i>In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.</i>

267
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,362
<i>Amen.</i>

268
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,530
Blessed.

269
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,366
Saint.

270
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,120
All of us adore you.

271
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:23,042
Sister, let's...
let's get you to bed.

272
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:42,103
Blessed Saint Cecilia.

273
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,528
<i>Buonanotte,</i> sister.

274
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,931
It could have been worse.

275
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,683
She could have given you bangs.

276
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:22,769
Gwen, I'm not joking.

277
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,355
She had scars
on the bottom of her feet.

278
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,568
It's not what you thought
it would be, huh, this place?

279
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,238
No, it's definitely different.

280
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:36,533
It's better than where I came from, though.

281
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,409
What do you mean?

282
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:40,954
There is a boy.

283
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,997
There was a boy, I mean.

284
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:44,916
What happened with this boy?

285
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,254
He hit me.

286
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,340
I hit him back.

287
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,426
Once I left him,

288
00:29:55,552 --> 00:29:58,346
I went to those support
groups, you know?

289
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:00,765
There were these nuns there.

290
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,060
And I thought, these women
have a very good life.

291
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,479
They have a place to live, a job

292
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,815
where they can keep
their clothes on,

293
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,984
nothing to worry about.

294
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,945
So I signed up.

295
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,989
Wait, so you don't even believe in God?

296
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,282
Of course I do.

297
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:18,533
Life is so cruel.

298
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,910
Only a man can be responsible.

299
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,919
Oh, my God, I was joking.

300
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,171
Are you OK?

301
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,550
I don't feel good.

302
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,719
I'm going to call a doctor.

303
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:26,351
Sister Cecilia.
Come with me.

304
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:01,927
Your Eminence.

305
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:03,262
Sit.

306
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:28,037
Could you please
tell Cardinal Merola your vows?

307
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:32,208
- My vows?
- Your vows.

308
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:41,050
I swore to three vows
when I got here,

309
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,261
of obedience,
poverty, and chastity.

310
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,683
- He's asking if you have...
- I understand.

311
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,894
I have.

312
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,205
I have been obedient, your Eminence.

313
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:56,315
- Have you kept your vow of poverty?
- Yes, I, I own nothing.

314
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,441
I want for nothing.

315
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:59,318
Have you remained chaste?

316
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:01,487
I'm sorry,
why are you asking me this?

317
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,822
It's OK.

318
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,116
Just answer the question,
if you would, Cecilia.

319
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,216
Of course, I've been
chaste, your Eminence.

320
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,628
Before you arrived, did
you have congress with a man?

321
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,508
Congress with... no, no.

322
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,429
Have you ever had
congress with a man?

323
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:29,474
I've not broken my vows. I've never
been with a man or a woman, nobody.

324
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,809
You'll not be punished.
We just want to know the truth.

325
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:33,478
I'm not lying, Father.

326
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,317
What is going on?

327
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:52,163
When she arrived,
Dr. Gallo, did you examine her?

328
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:53,539
Her hymen was intact.

329
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:56,709
It's never been touched.

330
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,711
What are they saying?

331
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:13,267
Mother Superior, have we had
visitors during these last few weeks?

332
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:14,435
No.

333
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,437
What are you...
what are you looking at?

334
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:29,575
One last time.

335
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,540
Have you ever had
sexual intercourse?

336
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,046
Why are you asking me this?

337
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:15,580
You are with child.

338
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,542
This child was...

339
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:22,628
conceived without sin.

340
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,591
As God as my witness...

341
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:30,928
we have been blessed with a miracle.

342
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,932
He believes you.

343
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:38,227
It's a miracle.

344
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:52,033
Out of all the women in the
world, why did he choose me?

345
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:57,788
You told me who saved your life,

346
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:00,458
who sent you on the path
that led you here.

347
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,294
Cecilia, you've been
searching for a reason.

348
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,672
God saved you.

349
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,090
This is it.

350
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:14,597
Blessed are the meek,

351
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,725
for they shall
inherit the Earth.

352
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,101
No working.

353
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:28,189
Remember, your only job is baby.

354
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,943
How long before they
start calling you Mary?

355
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:27,665
It was supposed
to be me! Bitch!

356
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,844
Isabelle! Isabelle!

357
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:40,803
Sisters!

358
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:41,928
Stop it!

359
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,139
Leave her alone!

360
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,681
Stop!

361
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:46,851
No! No, no!

362
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:48,602
We have to try again!

363
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:51,188
They have to try again with me!

364
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,233
They have to try again with me!

365
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:06,954
Heartbeat is stable.

366
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,123
There's no bleeding.

367
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:12,084
Praise be.

368
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,713
We'll run some blood tests
to check for distress.

369
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,049
But he appears to be OK.

370
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:28,017
But I'm not OK.

371
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,978
Father, Isabelle said
it was supposed to be her.

372
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,605
Why would she say that?

373
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:38,694
Well, Isabelle has been losing

374
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,988
her battle with mental
illness for a while now.

375
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:44,116
And seeing you and the miracle,

376
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,994
it clearly triggered something,
whether it be jealousy...

377
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,206
She tried to drown me.

378
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:51,832
You're right.
You're right.

379
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:55,211
And I'll make sure
this never happens again.

380
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,180
I want to see another doctor.

381
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:07,723
Why? Dr. Gallo...

382
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,433
Takes care of old women.

383
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:11,393
I want to go to
a real hospital, please.

384
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:13,771
He's a licensed obstetrician.

385
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:16,774
Thursday through Saturdays
I deliver babies at Cosentino.

386
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:20,819
A hospital is not what you need right now.
You're perfectly healthy.

387
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,697
I just puked up one of my teeth.

388
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,117
Hospitals aren't
the safest of places.

389
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:28,619
We wouldn't want
you to get sick.

390
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:31,705
Or for the word
to get out, you know.

391
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,415
The safest thing
is for you to stay

392
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,585
here until the Savior is born.

393
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,349
Bless you, young mother.

394
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:39,565
Oh, Isabelle.

395
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:41,567
All of you, go.

396
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:44,236
Go away, I said!

397
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,510
Cecilia,
you need to stand up for yourself.

398
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,846
- Gwen, shh.
- Open your eyes.

399
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,057
I don't trust this place.

400
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,728
I don't think we can just leave.

401
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:19,333
Cecilia, you're five months pregnant,

402
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:22,274
and you haven't even
been to a hospital.

403
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,611
We can take care of this.

404
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,988
How can we trust
what's inside you?

405
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:31,033
Maybe God is...

406
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:32,701
God has nothing to do with this.

407
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:36,872
Sisters, is something the matter?
I can see you...

408
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,165
Don't touch me.

409
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,293
Fuck this.

410
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,381
How the fuck can you just
stand there as if nothing happened?

411
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:47,966
Cecilia's pregnant and we don't know how.

412
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,344
Isabelle killed herself.
What the fuck is going on?

413
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:51,469
Sorella...

414
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:54,181
Let go of me!
I know when a man is lying to me.

415
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:57,601
And all of you, every single one of you,
is so full of bullshit!

416
00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:59,478
Let go of me! Let go of me!

417
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:00,813
Let go of me!

418
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,022
No!

419
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:04,066
Let go of me! I said let me go!

420
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,139
{\an8}"For Satan himself
often masquerades

421
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:18,849
{\an8}as an angel of light."

422
00:45:25,147 --> 00:45:26,565
Gwen.

423
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:28,859
Gwen.

424
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,004
No!

425
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:25,512
No, no!

426
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:50,287
Let me go! Let me go!

427
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,421
No.

428
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:02,382
No, I'm begging you, please.

429
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,248
Shh.

430
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:46,134
Blessed...

431
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:51,723
<i>Santa.</i>

432
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,732
Please help me.

433
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,943
We have to leave.

434
00:51:09,074 --> 00:51:14,830
You will never leave here.

435
00:51:54,953 --> 00:51:55,829
What's happening?

436
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:56,954
I don't know.

437
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:00,417
Mother! What's going on?

438
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:01,835
I don't know, father.

439
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,133
God in Heaven.

440
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:13,197
- Call Doctor Gallo.
- It's not possible, it's Saturday.

441
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,556
Call him!
Something's wrong.

442
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:18,143
I won't get a hold of him, it's Saturday.
We need to get her to the hospital.

443
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,769
- No.
- You must go. Now.

444
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:21,615
- No.
- That's it, I'm calling an ambulance.

445
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:22,981
Stop!

446
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,900
Something's wrong.

447
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,902
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

448
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:28,069
I don't.

449
00:52:28,194 --> 00:52:29,863
I don't want to die.

450
00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:59,392
What do we do if
she dies on the way there?

451
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,062
We must maintain hope.

452
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:04,063
It ain't looking good.

453
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,315
Then we shall pray.

454
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:10,087
Yes.

455
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:20,181
Uh-huh.

456
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:28,898
Uh-huh.

457
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:31,692
I understand.

458
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:39,324
Stop the car.

459
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:40,577
What?

460
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:41,702
Stop the car.

461
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,083
What are you...
what are you doing?

462
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,710
Go!

463
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,962
Go, go!

464
00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:40,053
Clean yourself.

465
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:42,097
Clean yourself.

466
00:55:49,854 --> 00:55:51,022
Now you're ashamed?

467
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,147
Now?

468
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,820
Where was your shame when you
stuffed a dead animal inside yourself?

469
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,157
Shame on you.

470
00:56:01,574 --> 00:56:03,993
Making us believe the
miracle died inside you.

471
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:06,412
What do you have to say for yourself?

472
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:08,706
God will never forgive you.

473
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:30,353
I want to apologize
if any of my actions

474
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:33,565
made you feel scared.

475
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,736
And I want to reassure you
that you're safe.

476
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:44,492
What did you do to me?

477
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:57,922
When you look at this,
what do you see?

478
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,428
Some people might
see just an old piece

479
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,182
of iron, a rusty nail.

480
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,149
For those of us who know,

481
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:21,571
we see proof
of Jesus' sacrifice,

482
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:25,283
a symbol of his suffering.

483
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,621
And for 2,000 years,
that's all it was.

484
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:39,422
But we looked closer,

485
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:42,842
and we found blood,

486
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:46,721
tissue,
little fragments of bone,

487
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:48,973
a genetic code.

488
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,768
All we had to do was crack it...

489
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:54,312
the key to resurrection.

490
00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:58,775
You're insane.

491
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:03,404
Let me show you.

492
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:24,050
It's taken us 20 years
of trial and error,

493
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:28,680
20 years for God to deliver
unto us the knowledge

494
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:33,184
and the perfect fertile vessel.

495
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,852
Is this what's inside me?

496
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,104
No.

497
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:38,398
These are all our failures.

498
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:42,819
What's inside you
is our success.

499
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:55,206
I left the field of genetics
because some people

500
00:58:55,331 --> 00:59:00,503
disagreed with the ethics
of my experiment.

501
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:08,511
So many people have such
a narrow view of its potential.

502
00:59:08,636 --> 00:59:11,431
But here in the church,
here they

503
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:13,558
understood
that a simple procedure

504
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:17,478
could bring us salvation.

505
00:59:17,603 --> 00:59:19,272
You're playing God.

506
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:23,276
I am not playing God.

507
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:26,279
Do you know what it's like
to watch the miracle die

508
00:59:26,404 --> 00:59:30,616
in the womb, to fail God
again and again and again,

509
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:34,871
but find the strength
to keep going?

510
00:59:34,996 --> 00:59:36,873
This is my calling.

511
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:46,466
And this, this is yours.

512
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:50,720
No.

513
01:00:07,653 --> 01:00:10,448
What are you doing?

514
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,408
What's... what's going on?

515
01:00:14,118 --> 01:00:15,995
What is that?

516
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,289
What are you...
what are you doing?

517
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,625
Please stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

518
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,377
Please, please, stop.
Stop!

519
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:25,588
May you never stray again.

520
01:00:25,713 --> 01:00:28,216
No.
No, no!

521
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:29,717
Stop!

522
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:32,053
Blessed are the meek...

523
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:33,846
No, no, no.
Please no.

524
01:00:33,971 --> 01:00:36,933
- For they shall inherit...
- No, no, no, no, please, no.

525
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:38,226
- The Earth.
- No, no!

526
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:39,394
No!

527
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:21,853
Wait.

528
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:25,982
Wait.

529
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,824
Wait.

530
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,743
Wait.

531
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,539
Wait.

532
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:42,957
Wait.

533
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:30,004
Sister Cecilia.

534
01:02:33,424 --> 01:02:35,885
How long have you
been targeting me?

535
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:39,889
Please, si confessi.

536
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:43,184
Was it since the accident?

537
01:02:48,356 --> 01:02:50,399
What's going to happen
when it's done?

538
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,612
You think it's gonna, what,
save the world?

539
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:57,447
End it?

540
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:03,955
That's what revelation
says, right?

541
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,567
This is not God's work.

542
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,572
Very well.

543
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,616
If this is not the will of God,

544
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,578
why does God not stop us?

545
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,156
Any day now.

546
01:04:23,034 --> 01:04:25,828
Hm.

547
01:04:25,953 --> 01:04:28,080
He's moving.

548
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,500
Ah.

549
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,462
I'll be right back with her medication.

550
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:37,839
Would you care to?

551
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:39,549
Yes!

552
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,013
I'll be right back.

553
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:02,948
Such a beautiful mother.
And those eyes. Like sunflowers.

554
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:05,701
Blessed child...

555
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,913
it's all part of His plan.

556
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:16,212
You will save us.

557
01:05:17,254 --> 01:05:22,677
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

558
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:46,051
God damn it.

559
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,042
Oh my God.

560
01:08:03,754 --> 01:08:06,173
Cecilia, what have you done?

561
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:03,898
Cecilia,
this won't solve anything.

562
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:08,152
If you die, we'll find another.

563
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,447
You can end this.

564
01:09:11,572 --> 01:09:14,199
All you need to do is
deliver our savior.

565
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:34,303
No!

566
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:03,851
No!

567
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:15,858
Cecilia.

568
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:27,786
Cecilia.

569
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,487
Let go of me!

570
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,328
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

571
01:15:33,453 --> 01:15:35,163
Amen.

572
01:15:35,289 --> 01:15:41,169
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

573
01:15:45,257 --> 01:15:49,720
Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed

574
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:53,890
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

575
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,642
Holy Mary...

576
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:57,436
No, no!

577
01:16:00,647 --> 01:16:05,444
Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

578
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:12,075
Now and at the hour...

579
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,288
No.

580
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,033
Fuck you.
