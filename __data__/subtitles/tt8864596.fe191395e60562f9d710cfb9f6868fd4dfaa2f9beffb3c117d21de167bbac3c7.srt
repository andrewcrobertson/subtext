Orion Pax.
Who cares?

48

I'm gonna smash you!

Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

51

How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

Let's give him a head start.

It's not like
he can transform.

Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

[chuckling] Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

83
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,931
You want to give me
another one?

84
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,466
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

[grunts] Hey!
Watch where you're going!

86
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,204
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

87
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,639
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

88
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,541
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

89
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,142
What? Where'd he go?

90
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,510
The filthy
red and blue bot?

91
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,512
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

92
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,248
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,816
Where is he?
He went that way.

94
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,451
When I get
my hands on that bot...

95
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,762
All right, all clear.

96
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,464
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

97
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,000
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

98
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,102
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

99
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,371
[laughs] Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

100
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,006
Almost died.
[laughs] It was wild.

101
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,407
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

102
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,676
Yes, it is.

103
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,077
I need a new best friend.

104
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,979
If there are clues
in our recorded history

105
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,282
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

106
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,583
they're in the archives.

107
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,920
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

108
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,955
is up on the surface
right now,

109
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,158
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

110
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,427
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

111
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,896
Yeah, okay. [laughs]

112
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,698
The sooner Energon
flows again,

113
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,833
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

114
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,102
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

115
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,838
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

116
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:22,442
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

117
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,477
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

118
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,113
you could transform
without a cog?

119
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,949
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

120
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,483
Took me three days
to pry you open.

121
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,786
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

122
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,020
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,723
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

124
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,960
Hey, if we did have cogs--

125
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,162
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

126
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,130
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

127
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,033
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

128
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,269
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

129
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,439
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

130
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,140
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

decal, first edition.

132
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,045
[gasps] What?

133
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,947
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

134
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,615
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

135
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,251
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

136
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,656
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

137
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,591
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

138
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,993
I know, buddy.

139
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:16,630
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

140
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,534

Always got your back.

[all] So much, Elita-1!

155
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,154
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

156
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,156
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

157
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,191
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

158
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,559
Apology accepted.

159
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,161
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

160
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,862
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

161

Feeling like I have
enough power in me

162
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,499
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

163
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,034
You don't have
the touch or the power.

164

Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,140
You ready?
Always ready.

00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,586

00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,294
[miner 3] Low bridge!

176
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,101
Drill it out!

177
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,304
I tapped a vein!

178
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,540
[sputtering, metallic thud]

179
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,741
[metallic groaning]

180
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,277
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

[roar building]

184
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,220
Evacuate!

185
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,921
[all yelling]

186
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,690
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

187
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,425
The tunnel is closing.

188
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,228
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

189
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,865
You with me, D?
[D-16] On your six! Keep going!

190
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:32,534
Look out!

Jazz is stuck!

194
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,973
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

195
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,674
I'm falling back to assist.

196
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,676
[Elita] <i>Negative.</i>
<i>Do not break protocol.</i>
<i>Evacuate!</i>

197
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,778
We're gonna need more lift.

198
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,281
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

199
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,482
Yeah. Good idea.

200
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:51,051
What? No, I didn't mean it!

201
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,387
[grunts]
[electronic whirring]

202
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,456
Pull him clear!

[Elita] <i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

205
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,864
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

206
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,332
It's all good.
[deep rumbling]

207
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,802
Oh, that's not good.
[rumbling swells]

208
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,272
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

209
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,542
[Orion] <i>Elita, it's about</i>

[mechanical whirring]

213
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,520
Run! Run!

214
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,388
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

215
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,757
Come on! Go, go, go!

216
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,693

[electrical sputtering]

218
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,165
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

219
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,834
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

220
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:43,103
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

221
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,139
Elita-1, you're fired.

222
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,209
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

223
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,344
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

224
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,879
No one asked you!

225
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,114
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

226
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,184
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

227
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,920
Report to waste management
immediately.

228
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,455
Waste management?

229
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,658
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

230
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,292
before you ruin someone's life?

231
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:06,427
I'm sorry!

232
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,962
[indistinct chatter]

233
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,531
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

234
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,900
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

235
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,869
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

236
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,038
[imitates mechanical creak]
[growls]

237
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,574
Excuse me, sir.

238
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,275
Allow me.
[grunts]

239
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,844
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

240
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,780
[slow groan] Why?

241
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,162
[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]

242
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,797
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

243
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,332
You know you were
out of line,

244
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,736
talking back
to a superior like that.

245
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,070
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

246
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,506
[sighs]

247
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,408
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

248
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,979
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

249
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,551
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

250
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,353
I'm glad
you were there with me

251
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,022
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

252
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,190
[laughs]
Anytime, buddy.

Maybe he found the Matrix.

Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

Psst! Hey, D.

[groans groggily]

288
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,028
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

289
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,965
[D-16] Whatever this is,
it better be good.

290
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,734
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

291
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,803
All right, what if...
what if...

292
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,204
what if tomorrow

293
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:08,375
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

294
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,044
What if kill you
for waking me up?

295
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,847
No, no, no, hear me out.

296
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,214
We don't even have to win!

297
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,517
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

298
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,887
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

299
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,889
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

300
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,990
Not only would we
go down in history,

301
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,260
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

302
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,162
but we would show everyone
that we're--

303
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,197
we're capable
of so much more!

304
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,465
Or we get
publicly humiliated

305
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,267
and then busted
back to tier one.

306
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,203
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

307
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,138
Pax...
Come on, D.

308
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,306
Pax.

309
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,209
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

310
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,580
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

311
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,848
we can't race.

312
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,916
Come on, let's go.

313
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,517
[sighs]

314
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:50,919
All right, fine.

315
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,020
Yeah, maybe you're right.

316
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,059
Maybe.

317
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,230
[D-16] The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

318
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,666
[Orion] I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

319
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,034
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

320
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,770
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

321
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,839
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

322
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,774
I wanted good seats.

323
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,844
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

324
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,978
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

325
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,514
Hold up!

326
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,750
[electronic pulse]
[groans, sighs]

327
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:26,320
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

328
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,988
Okay,
where are you taking me?

329
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,657
[mechanical whirring]

330
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,292
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

331
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,561
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

332
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,329
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

333
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,798
like, we're joking around,

334
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,466
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

335
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:43,437
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

340

You did this for me?

No.

342
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,097
I did this for us.

precisely 50 cycles

355

since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

356

Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

357
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,311
and our Energon supply
dried up.

358
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:01,348
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

359
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,350
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

360
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,354
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

361
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,593
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

362
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,165

Miners?

No way!
They can't even transform!

510
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,587
and we're gonna go--
[heavy footsteps]

511
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,757
[growling] Miners!

512
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,826
Hi, Darkwing.

513
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,263
[Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
[D-16] No! [yells]

514
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,433
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

515
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,036
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

516
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,472
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

517
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:39,874
I'll make sure of that.

518
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,309
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

519
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,745
[groans]
I hate that guy!

520
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,781
[clattering]

521
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,787
[clattering continues]

522
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,860
You! How did you get down here?

523
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,662
There's no access to this level.

524
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,697
There is nobody
down here but me.

525
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,100
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

526
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,504
You're others!
You're not... me!

527
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:12,306
You're here,
and you're not me!

528
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,475
[laughs]

529
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,277
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

530
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,879
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

531
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:21,048
I just haven't had
a lot of company

532
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:23,117
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

533
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,555
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

534
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,089
That's what I thought!

535
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,058
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

536
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,860
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

537
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:34,395
How long have you
been down here?

538
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,930
How long have I been here?
[laughs]

539
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,100
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

540
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,870
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

541
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,772
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

542
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,808
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

543
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,176
But you can call me B.

544
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,911
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

545
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,481
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

546
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,485
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

547
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,786
But if you have any critiques--

548
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,789
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

549
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:03,757
Great question. You don't.

550
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,226
We don't?
Nope.

551
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,461
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

552
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,732
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

553
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,768
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

554
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,203
Which is?
Oh!

555
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,373
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

556
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:21,008
onto the conveyor belt.

557
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,944
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

558
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,714
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

559
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,949
So you watch garbage burn.

560
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,151
Yes!

561
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,852
It is so great
that you're here now.

562
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,821
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

563
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,456
And then tell you
everything about me!

564
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,560
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

565
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,827
with one or two
new best friends.

566
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,996
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

567
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,532
[splutters]
Where are my manners?

568
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,567
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

569
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:47,868
Hey, guys, we've got company!

570
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,205
This is EP-508,

571
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:55,042
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

572
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,546
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

573
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,548
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

574
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,782
Um, they're not real.

575
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,285
[laughing]
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

576
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:05,853
It's just
you've been down here a--

577
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,522
No, I was talking to Steve.
[beeps and whirs]

578
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,089
[indistinct robotic speech]
[laughs]

579
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,024
Classic Steve.

580
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,859
What is that?
Look at this guy.

581
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:15,196
[mocks electronic speech]
It's coming from inside.

582
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,298
Oh! Steve! No!

583
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:20,669
I am so sorry.
[dramatically] Steve, no!

584
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,037
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

585
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,474
[voice over transmission]
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

586
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,078
<i>Calling the High Guard</i>
<i>for immediate support.</i>
<i>Immediate support!</i>

587
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,180
That's Alpha Trion.

588
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,616
One of the Primes?

589
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,884
<i>Repeat,</i>
<i>Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

590
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:39,554
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

591
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:43,290
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>

592
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,896
Holy Primus!

593
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,132
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

594
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:56,837
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

595
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,374
Which means
this is where we could find

596
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,443
the Matrix of Leadership.

597
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:06,080
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

598
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,582
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

599
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:10,417
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

600
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:13,254
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

601
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,788
You already tried
to "show everyone"

602
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,423
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

603
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:17,726
which got us
stuck down here

604
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:20,361
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

605
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,030
really cool guy.

606
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:25,199
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

607
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,234
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

608
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:28,637
It's dangerous!

609
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,338
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

610
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,840
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

611
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:36,076
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

612
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,612
Forever? This is great!

613
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:39,581
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

614
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,549
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

615
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:43,851
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

616
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,286
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

617
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,054
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

618
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,223
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

619
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:53,662
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

620
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,463
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

621
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:59,366
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

622
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,603
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

623
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,204
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

624
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,541
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

625
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,976
Easy. I know a way.

626
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,579
But it won't be easy.

627
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,248
[D-16]
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

628
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,751
[Orion] Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

629
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,453
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!

630
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,289
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

631
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,425
that go all the way
to the surface.

632
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,994
[D-16] Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

633
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,330
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

634
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:32,199
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

635
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,974
[worker] That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

636
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,943
[door whirs, thuds]

637
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,083
[Elita] Hold up! One more.

638
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,388
I'll lock it down.

639
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,559
[electronic beeps, clicks]

640
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,332
[laughs]
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

641
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:08,636
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

642
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,672
Got her!
[grunting]

643
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:11,840
No, wait, I--

644
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,107
Elita! Stop!

645
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,942
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

646
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,443
Security! Sound the ala--

647
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,383
[grunts angrily]

648
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,885
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

649
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,857
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

650
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,291
So am I. To ruin your life.

651
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:39,933
[yells]
[all grunt]

652
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:44,773
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

653
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,374
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

654
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,010
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

655
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,478
Well, she's gone.

656
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,348
[all grunting]

657
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,023
[groans]

658
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,394
Whoa!

659
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,532
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

660
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:11,965
Climb faster!

661
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:21,975
[all groaning]

662
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,215
Gotcha!
[grunts]

663
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,217
Ah, the surface.

664
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,153
It's beautiful.

665
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:12,092
[B-127] I am speechless.

666
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:15,195
Elita, listen to me.

667
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,397
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

668
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:19,433
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

669
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,971
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

670
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:25,372
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

671
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:27,174
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

672
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,744
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

673
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,078
What?
Look.

674
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,247
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

675
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,148
and then we found this message.

676
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,351
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

677
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:40,555

00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,600
<i>intercepted</i>
<i>an enemy transmission.</i>

853
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:03,704
<i>There was going to be</i>
<i>a secret gathering</i>
<i>of Quintesson commanders.</i>

854
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,340
<i>Their elimination</i>
<i>could end the war.</i>

855
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:12,479
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

856
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:16,884
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

857
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:19,588
here in this cave.

858
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,422
But we were not alone.

859
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:23,490
[chittering]

860
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,092
[Prime] Quintessons!
[Prime 2] They're here!

861
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:26,695
[Prime 3] It's a trap!
Battle positions!

862
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,263
Hold the line!
[Prime] Primus be with us!

863
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,065
[laserfire pulsing]

864
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,468
For Cybertron!

865
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,210
[Alpha Trion]
<i>We were outnumbered,</i>
<i>but stood as one.</i>

866
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,414
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

867
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,987
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

868
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,928
[metallic slice]

869
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:03,063
[grunts]

870
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:04,798
[pained yell]

871
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:07,434
[audio slows]

872
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:17,545
[grunting]

873
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,080
Sentinel, why?

874
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:23,017
For all the power
of Cybertron.

875
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:32,192
[Alpha Trion] <i>But Sentinel never</i>
<i>understood the true power</i>
<i>of what he desired.</i>

876
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:36,230
<i>The Matrix of Leadership</i>
<i>can only be wielded</i>

877
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:41,536
<i>by one that Primus himself</i>
<i>deems worthy.</i>

878
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:47,174
<i>And Sentinel</i>
<i>most certainly was not.</i>

879
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,343
No!

880
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:58,485
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

881
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,020
No.

882
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:02,557
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

883
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:04,425
Why would Sentinel
do that?

884
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:05,926
To make a bargain.

885
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,861
A bargain? With who?

886
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,665
[deep rumbling]

887
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:14,368
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

888
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,041
[Orion] The Quintessons.

889
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,544
[Elita] There are so many.

890
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,412
[electronic whirring]

891
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:45,999
He's here.

892
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,203
Sentinel Prime is here.

893
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,255
[warbling]

894
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:11,559
[chittering]

895
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,305
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

896
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:44,258
[gasping]

897
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,294
[guttural chittering]

898
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:07,481
[Elita] I load those crates.

899
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:10,017
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

900
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,586
I don't understand.

901
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:14,589
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

902
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,061
Our Energon.

903
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:29,236
Traitor!
D, no.

904
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,980
[grunts, groans]

905
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:44,084
[straining]
I know what
I promised you

906
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:47,187
but our mines,
they're running out!

907
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,557
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

908
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:51,992
[roars]

909
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,495
I swear I will
get you the rest.

910
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,636
Triple-time
every mining shift.

911
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,606
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

912
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,440
All of it! Let's go.

913
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,785
[ship rumbling]

914
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:26,326
Now you have seen the truth.

915
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,265
Every day...

916
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,639
Every single day
of my life

917
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:40,407
has been a lie.

918
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:42,510
My God, I knew it!

919
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:45,613
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

920
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:47,815
He deceived everyone.

921
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:53,153
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

922
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:54,956
I can't believe it.

923
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:56,390
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

924
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,258
I just saw it,
but I still...

925
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,494
I can't believe it.

926
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:03,297
Sentinel lied

927
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,399
to my face.
[Orion]
It was all a sham.

928
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:08,268
How could we
have been so gullible?

929
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,973
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

930
00:51:12,105 --> 00:51:13,508
[thudding]

931
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,208
[grunting]

932
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,279
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

933
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,248
Me? What did I do?

934
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:23,116
You just had
to go to the surface,

935
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,152
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

936
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,822
You just had to break protocol!

937
00:51:27,956 --> 00:51:30,324
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

938
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,960
I care!

939
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,862
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

940
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:36,263
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

941
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,365
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

942
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:42,135
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

943
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,339
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

944
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:47,407
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

945
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,142
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

946
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,778
That's the whole thing!

947
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,081
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

948
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:57,552
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

949
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,053
Don't you want
to stop him?

950
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,288
No, I want to kill him!

951
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,925
I want to put Sentinel in chains

952
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:05,459
and march him
through the mines

953
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:08,896
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

954
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,333
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

955
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,803
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

956
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:17,304
what I want, right, Pax?

957
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:21,109
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

958
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:27,982
[D-16 chuckles bitterly]
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

959
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:33,888
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

960
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:37,025
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

961
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,028
and this slot's
always been empty.

962
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,829
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

963
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:45,533
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

964
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:49,871
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

965
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:55,242
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

966
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,210
He took them from us.

967
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,414
What defines a Transformer...
[grunts]

968
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,784
...is not the cog
in his chest

969
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:07,822
but the spark
that resides in their core.

970
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:13,594
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

971
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:17,699
My fellow Primes had that spark.

972
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:22,235
And I see their strength
in you.

973
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:30,277
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

974
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:32,412
Prima.

975
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:34,816
Onyx.

976
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,951
Alchemist.

977
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:38,786
Micronus.

978
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,659
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

979
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:48,963
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

980
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:54,635
[electronic whirring]

981
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,278
[electronic whirring continues]

982
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:20,094
They were one. You are one.

983
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:23,296
All are one!

984
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:39,514
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

985
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,917
The ability
to change your world.

986
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:48,556
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

987
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,626
[laughs]

988
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,194
[heavy thud]

989
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:54,461
They've found us.

990
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,031
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

991
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,434
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

992
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:07,542
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

993
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,410
Use it to reveal the truth.

994
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:12,412
We will.

995
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:14,515
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

996
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:17,417
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

997
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:19,020
[thudding boom]
We're out of time.

998
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,521
We got to move!

999
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:23,356
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

1000
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,793
Your fight will come,
my friend.

1001
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:29,297
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

1002
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,232
But this fight...
[heavy booming thud]

1003
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,167
This fight is mine.

1004
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,870
Now go!
[thudding continues]

1005
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,082
Stand down, old timer.

1006
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:51,085
Ah. Old, you say?

1007
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:53,353
[rumbling]

1008
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,392
[laserfire pulsing]

1009
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,033
[roars]

1010
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:11,138

[laserfire pulsing]

1012
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:17,078
[roars]

1013
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,050
Not too old for you.

1014
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:27,088
[roaring]

1015
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:29,757
We need to hurry!

1016
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:31,525
I still think
we have better odds

1017
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,327
fighting than outrunning them.

1018
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,163
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

1019
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:39,333
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

1020
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,068
On three. One--

1021
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:42,603
[all yelling]

1022
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:47,074
[faint yelling, grunting]

1023
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:50,745
Ah!

1024
00:56:52,113 --> 00:56:54,447
[laserfire pulsing]

1025
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:56,284
[grunting]

1026
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,718
How do we use these things?

1027
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,887
I don't know. Just try.

1028
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,589
[straining]

1029
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:04,625
It's working. Ha! It's working!

1030
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,193
My head! My head!

1031
00:57:06,327 --> 00:57:07,261
Whoa!

1032
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:09,429
Help! Help!

1033
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:16,604
This is not faster!

1034
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,407
[yells, grunts]

1035
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,208
Oh, come on!

1036
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:24,612
And transform!

1037
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:26,547
[yelling]

1038
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,649
Wheels! I need wheels!

1039
00:57:29,383 --> 00:57:32,019
[laserfire pulsing]

1040
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,656
[Elita yelling]

1041
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,193
Whoa.

1042
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,667
[audio slows]

1043
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:49,637
[mechanical whirring]

1044
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:54,141
[B-127 yelling]

1045
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,616
[mechanical whirring]
Ha! [grunts]

1046
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,252
[grunts, laughs]

1047
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:06,687
Oh, wow.

1048
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,122
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

1049
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,158
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

1050
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,994
[overlapping chatter]

1051
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:14,562
[laser blast]

1052
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:17,198
[engine humming]

1053
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,332
[mechanical whirring]

1054
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,499
Yes!

1055
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:22,536
[laughing deliriously]

1056
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,005
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

1057
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:27,942
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

1058
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,077
We transform!

1059
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:31,379
Oh, hey! I know.

1060
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,647
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

1061
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:34,815
Looks like the fastest way

1062
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:36,617
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

1063
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,019
Hey, what are you doing?

1064
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:39,787
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

1065
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,957
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

1066
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:49,697
I... got... it.

1067
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:52,900
Okay.

1068
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,139
Follow me.

1069
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:04,979
[wheezes]

1070
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:06,914
Alpha Trion!

1071
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:10,084
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

1072
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,920
You look horrible.

1073
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:17,758
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

1074
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,961
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1075
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:24,799
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

1076
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:26,367
Anything to get
out of working for you

1077
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,669
and that boring
council of elders.

1078
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,838
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

1079
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,740
spend half the day
losing a war

1080
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:37,812
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

1081
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:39,246
And now look at you.

1082
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,917
Hear my words:
You will fall.

1083
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,186
And a new Prime will rise--

1084
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,587
There you go again.

1085
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,558
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

1086
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,858
[groans]

1087
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,393
There were others
in the cave with you.

1088
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:53,461
Who are they?

1089
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,565
They are to be your undoing.

1090
00:59:56,697 --> 01:00:00,901
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

1091
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:03,871
[pained grunt]
[electrical crackling]

1092
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:06,107
[body thuds]

1093
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:10,211
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

1094
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:11,712
You heard me, right?

1095
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:14,048
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

1096
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,284
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

1097
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:18,652
[sighs]

1098
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,055
Okay. Hunt down the others.

1099
01:00:21,188 --> 01:00:22,623
With pleasure.

1100
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,301
[engines humming]

1101
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,307
Hey, buddy.

1102
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,343
Oh. Hey.

1103
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:46,881
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

1104
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:51,152
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

1105
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:54,822
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1106
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:59,193
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

1107
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,263
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

1108
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:04,465
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

1109
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,467
They worship Sentinel.

1110
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,502
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

1111
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:11,472
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

1112
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:13,874
I trusted Sentinel!

1113
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,409
With everything.

1114
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:22,016
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

1115
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,953
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

1116
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:27,321
[electrical crackling]

1117
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:28,557
[grunting]

1118
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,157
[electronic sputtering]

1119
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,033
[voice] All right,
wake them up.

1120
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:40,401
[gasps]

1121
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,169
[breathes heavily]

1122
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:48,309
[grunts]

1123
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:05,326
Now, are you spies

1124
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:09,263
or just incompetent lackeys?

1125
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:12,132
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

1126
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:16,403
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1127
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:21,041
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

1128
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:23,244
[muffled indistinct speech]

1129
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:25,680
Uh, why is he gagged?

1130
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,248
He wouldn't stop talking.

1131
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,882
[muffled speech continues]
Even when he was
unconscious?

1132
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:31,252
Especially when
he was unconscious!

1133
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:32,554
Enough!

1134
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,723
Two options for you!

1135
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:39,694
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

1136
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:42,429
and really make sure
you feel it.

1137
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:43,531
Or two:

1138
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:45,165
In exchange
for a quick death,

1139
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,736
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

1140
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:49,537
access to the mines

1141
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:53,508
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1142
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:54,908
Who exactly are you guys?

1143
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,678
[muffled grunting, straining]

1144
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,746
Ah!

1145
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:00,781
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1146
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:02,517
[growls] I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

1147
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:05,620
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

1148
01:03:05,754 --> 01:03:08,422
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

1149
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:11,992
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

1150
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,794
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

1151
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:16,531
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

1152
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:19,433
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

1153
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,901
Silence!

1154
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:23,203
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

1155
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:24,004
Whoo!

1156
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:25,674
We were once the High Guard.

1157
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:29,476
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

1158
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:32,379
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1159
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:35,182
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1160
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,950
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1161
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:40,722
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

1162
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:43,123
I'm just saying we're allies.

1163
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:45,025
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

1164
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:49,229
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

1165
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:53,367
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

1166
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,439
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1167
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,240
[all cheering]

1168
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:03,344
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

1169
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:05,312
Yeah. Just a little.

1170
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:06,581
Hey!

1171
01:04:06,715 --> 01:04:08,349
What are you doing?

1172
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:13,253
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1173
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:17,191
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1174
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:19,360
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1175
01:04:19,493 --> 01:04:22,129
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1176
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:24,365
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1177
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:26,568
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1178
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:27,968
Today!

1179
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:31,639
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1180
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:35,677
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1181
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,512
[chuckles] Is that right?

1182
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,548
Well, how can you say so

1183
01:04:40,682 --> 01:04:42,517
with my head in your teeth?

1184
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,051
[grunts]
D!

1185
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,588
[grunts]
[excited chatter]

1186
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:48,055
[both grunting]

1187
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,059
Whoa!

1188
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,728
[grunting]
[mechanical whir]

1189
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,530
[growls]
[grunts]

1190
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:58,399
Hit me!

1191
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:01,803
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!
[crowd cheers]

1192
01:05:01,935 --> 01:05:05,540
[laughs]
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1193
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:12,379
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1194
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:14,649
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1195
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:17,484
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1196
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:20,522
[yells angrily]

1197
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:22,423
[mechanical whirring]

1198
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,365
[panting]

1199
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,070
Please! I beg you!

1200
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:40,240
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1201
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,311
Bear witness!

1202
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:47,147
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1203
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,684
Decide right now:

1204
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:54,388
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

1205
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:57,859
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1206
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:01,529
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1207
01:06:01,663 --> 01:06:03,898
[cheers, chanting]

1208
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:08,570
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1209
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,705
[chanting fades]

1210
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,013
[distant rumbling]

1211
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,519
[all screaming]

1212
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,290
[laserfire pulsing]

1213
01:06:35,597 --> 01:06:36,764
B, come on!

1214
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,099
[B-127 yelling]

1215
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:47,374
[mechanical whirring]

1216
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:56,684
[grunts]

1217
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:04,626
[Airachnid] Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1218
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:23,043
[grunts angrily]

1219
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,345
[D-16 yelling]

1220
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:30,718
[mechanical whirring]

1221
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,321
[grunts]

1222
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,357
Elita, get down!

1223
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:42,429
[grunts]

1224
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:58,813
[Orion coughs, clears throat]

1225
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:02,249
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1226
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,686
[groans]
Where are the others?

1227
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:08,723
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1228
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:10,558
They got D-16 and B.

1229
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,292
Oh, no.

1230
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,228
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1231
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:16,931
[sighs]

1232
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:18,700
Our proof.

1233
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,367
It's gone.

1234
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,170
So, what do we do now?

1235
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,839
D was right.

1236
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:27,341
About what?
Everything.

1237
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:31,345
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1238
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:32,647
It's all my fault.

1239
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,882
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1240
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:37,484
[sighs]

1241
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:44,324
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1242
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,693
Are you listening?

1243
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,697
I'm better than you.

1244
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:52,399
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1245
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,802
I'm better than you
in every way,

1246
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:57,005
except you have hope.

1247
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:00,775
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1248
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:04,746
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1249
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,814
[chuckles] Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1250
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,415
My point is,

1251
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:12,654
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1252
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:15,723
This blind optimism
that you have

1253
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:20,528
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1254
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:23,131
that are also extremely stupid.

1255
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:25,767
First time
giving a pep talk?

1256
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,401
You're inspiring.

1257
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:31,005
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1258
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,776
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1259
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:39,312
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1260
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,516
Listen to me.

1261
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:43,584
We can do this.

1262
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:49,023
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

1263
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:51,592
If we intercepted one--

1264
01:09:51,726 --> 01:09:54,762
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1265
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:59,867
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1266
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:03,838
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1267
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:07,508
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1268
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:10,745
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1269
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,181
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1270
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:16,517
[pained grunt]
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1271
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:20,220
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1272
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,591
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1273
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,126
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1274
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,162
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1275
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:33,333
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1276
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:36,470
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1277
01:10:36,604 --> 01:10:38,472
Why should we follow you?

1278
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,842
We will follow you.

1279
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:44,244
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1280
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,246
What is our first move?

1281
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:47,715
[quietly] We roll out.

1282
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,084
What?

1283
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:51,418
Louder.

1284
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:54,287
[boldly]
Transform and roll out!

1285
01:11:03,798 --> 01:11:07,400
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1286
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:10,905
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1287
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:12,807
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1288
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,476
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1289
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:19,113
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1290
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:20,380
Oh-ho-ho!

1291
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:23,117
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

1292
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,485
[high-pitch]
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

1293
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,088
so that your death
is painful!
[laughs]

1294
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:28,321
You'll regret
the day you were--

1295
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,290
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1296
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,161
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1297
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:37,265
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1298
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,332
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1299
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:41,936
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1300
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:45,506
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1301
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,242
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1302
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,476
None of that is true!

1303
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,978
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1304
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:53,915
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1305
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:57,985
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1306
01:11:58,119 --> 01:11:59,319
[thud reverberates]

1307
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:09,197
Well, well.
What's this about?

1308
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:12,567
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1309
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,535
Feeling confident, are we?

1310
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:17,939
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1311
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,106
Please.

1312
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:23,211
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1313
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,646
You took it all.

1314
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:28,115
I sure did.

1315
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:29,449
[grunts]

1316
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:31,185
[gasps]
[groans]

1317
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,821
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1318
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:37,892
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

1319
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:41,095
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1320
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,699
That's why,
after I killed him,

1321
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:47,602
I took his cog for myself.

1322
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:50,204
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1323
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:52,240
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1324
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:55,343
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1325
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:56,711
Here.

1326
01:12:57,678 --> 01:13:00,982
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1327
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:02,382
[electrical crackling]

1328
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:05,887
[pained shouts, groans]

1329
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,203
Okay. [sighs]

1330
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:24,972
[stammers] I can do this.

1331
01:13:38,286 --> 01:13:41,789
[miner] You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

1332
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,557
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1333
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,826
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1334
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,363
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

1335
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:50,798
[aggressive thud]

1336
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:54,902
[triumphant electronic jingle]

1337
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:57,104
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

1338
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:58,272
[miner] That can't be him.

1339
01:13:58,406 --> 01:13:59,640
[Jazz] Is that...

1340
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,109
It can't be.

1341
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:04,545
Orion?
Jazz.

1342
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:05,880
Is it really you?

1343
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,416
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1344
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:09,884
"Little"?

1345
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:11,752
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1346
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:13,654
Uh, how is this possible?

1347
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:16,824
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1348
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,527
Sentinel is a liar.

1349
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,529
What?
Huh?

1350
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,664
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1351
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:27,068
I was never
the most focused miner.

1352
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,637
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1353
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,872
[mechanical whirring]

1354
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:42,016
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1355
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:44,819
My friends,

1356
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:49,223
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1357
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:53,094
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1358
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:56,597
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1359
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:59,033
He stole our freedom.

1360
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:08,242
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1361
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:12,847
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1362
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:17,284
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1363
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:19,520
Right now.

1364
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:23,524
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

1365
01:15:25,393 --> 01:15:29,430
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1366
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:32,199
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1367
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:36,337
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1368
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:40,241
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

1369
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,777
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1370
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:46,580
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1371
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,649
We are not alone in this.

1372
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:51,485
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1373
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,020
we will have to
fight for it.

1374
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:56,525
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1375
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:58,527
[supportive chatter]
...for ourselves.

1376
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:00,161
[scattered cheers]

1377
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,730
Stand up for this injustice.

1378
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:04,899
[cheers growing]

1379
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:08,969
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1380
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,205
Follow me.

1381
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:14,108
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1382
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:17,745
[cheering, chanting]
Together as one.

1383
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:22,349
[all chanting]
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1384
01:16:22,483 --> 01:16:24,952
[Orion] <i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1385
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:26,020
You got it.

1386
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:28,756
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1387
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:38,199
[groaning, gasping]

1388
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,135
[determined groans]

1389
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:43,270
Not a good idea.

1390
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:47,741
[whispering]
D, stay down.
[groans]

1391
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:00,955
Well, that's a shame.
[mechanical whirs]

1392
01:17:01,088 --> 01:17:03,224
You really were
a great miner.

1393
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:10,197
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

1394
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:11,932
[grunts]

1395
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:22,042
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1396
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:24,445
High Guard, eject.

1397
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:26,515
Come on! Move out!

1398
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:28,315
[laserfire pulsing]

1399
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:43,731
[alarm blaring]
There's too many.
We have to abort!

1400
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:47,168
[yelps]
[alarm intensifying]

1401
01:17:49,069 --> 01:17:50,204
We're not gonna make it.

1402
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:52,339
[all yelling]

1403
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:53,874
Whoo-hoo!

1404
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,544
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1405
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,178
Let's break some protocol!

1406
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:59,280
[Elita] That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1407
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,387
[growling]

1408
01:18:06,521 --> 01:18:08,623
[grunting]

1409
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:10,925
Whoa! That's intense.

1410
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:15,996
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1411
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:18,399
That's right, you do.

1412
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:21,702
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1413
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:36,217
[alarmed chatter]
What's going on?

1414
01:18:38,852 --> 01:18:40,254
[electronic charge]

1415
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,722
[Orion] Hey!

1416
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:48,429
What has he done to you?

1417
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:51,633
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1418
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,703
[Orion] Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1419
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:57,471
[electronic throbbing]

1420
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,710
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1421
01:19:01,842 --> 01:19:03,811
I'm doing this my way.
D!

1422
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,984
Yes!

1423
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,218
Whoa!
[metal clangs]

1424
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:12,654
Whoa-ho-ho!

1425
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:14,255
I got a battle mask!

1426
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:15,756
[grunts]

1427
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,692
Elita! Battle mask!

1428
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:20,662
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

1429
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,997
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

1430
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:27,067
What the--?

1431
01:19:28,002 --> 01:19:29,770
[laughs triumphantly]

1432
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,905
[deep voice] Badassatron.

1433
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,079
Where's Sentinel?
[both grunt]

1434
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,417
[Sentinel]
You pathetic little twits.

1435
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:47,689
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

1436
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:51,559
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
[Sentinel] What truth?

1437
01:19:51,693 --> 01:19:54,361
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1438
01:19:54,495 --> 01:19:56,665
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

1439
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:57,965
and live like a king?

1440
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,968
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1441
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:05,272
[mechanical whirring]
...is what I make it.

1442
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:08,375
Incoming!

1443
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:11,513
Whoa!

1444
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,181
[laserfire pulses]

1445
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:16,718
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

1446
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,886
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

1447
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:21,288
We need her memory.
Where is she?

1448
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:23,090
Found her! [yells]

1449
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:25,492
Elita!

1450
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:27,428
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1451
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:28,862
<i>Bring her</i>
<i>to the broadcast station.</i>

1452
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,064
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1453
01:20:30,197 --> 01:20:32,232
[strained]
Easier said than done.

01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:33,867

[Orion] <i>I said,</i>
<i>don't break her!</i>

1457
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:55,623
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1458
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:02,664
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1459
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:04,131
I can see that.

1460
01:21:04,264 --> 01:21:06,300
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1461
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:08,502
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

1462
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:13,006
[B-127] Yeah!

1463

1467
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:34,428
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

1468
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,070
B!

1469
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:45,939
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

1470
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,643
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

1471
01:21:48,777 --> 01:21:50,177
It was already like that.
Right?

1472
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,445
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

1473
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:54,014
Yeah, it was already like--
Yes. Mm-hmm.

01:27:08,261 --> 01:27:11,298
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:13,601
[Alpha Trion] <i>Orion Pax,</i>

1543
01:27:13,735 --> 01:27:16,704
<i>your noble sacrifice</i>
<i>for the greater good</i>

1544
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:21,241
<i>has proven you worthy</i>
<i>in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1545
01:27:21,876 --> 01:27:24,145
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1546
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:27,081
the future of Cybertron

1547
01:27:27,215 --> 01:27:32,787
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1548
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,755
[crowd clamoring]

1549
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,592
I will lead us all
into the future!

1550
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:44,264
[electrical crackling]

1551
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:55,643
I...

1552
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,512
am...

1553
01:27:58,212 --> 01:28:00,081
Megatron!

1554
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,784
[Alpha Trion] <i>Arise...</i>

1555
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,887
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1556
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,792
Burn it down!

1557
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:12,794
All of it!

1558
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:21,468
All hail Megatron!

1559
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,773
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

1560
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:28,643
Stop! It's over.

1561
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:32,780
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1562
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:34,481
[grunts]

1563
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:07,715
Impossible.

1564
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:13,855
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1565
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:16,224
We could've built
the future together.

1566
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:18,226
I'll build it myself.

1567
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:22,029
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1568
01:29:23,331 --> 01:29:24,899
[roars]

1569
01:29:39,947 --> 01:29:40,848

[electronic charging]

1572
01:30:03,503 --> 01:30:04,739
Ah!

1573
01:30:06,574 --> 01:30:07,942

[panting heavily]

1579
01:31:06,634 --> 01:31:09,704
We were given the power
to change our world

1580
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,306
and you chose to destroy it.

1581
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,674
Just like Sentinel.

1582
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:17,878
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1583
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:22,249
And you betrayed me.

1584
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,362
Go.

1585
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,999
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1586
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,870
You are banished from Iacon.

1587
01:31:47,575 --> 01:31:50,044
It didn't have to end
this way.

1588
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:55,883
This isn't over, Prime.

1589
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:05,826
High Guard, follow me!

1590
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:21,642
[Optimus Prime] <i>The line</i>
<i>between friend and enemy</i>

1591
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:24,779
<i>is not as clear</i>
<i>as I once believed.</i>

1592
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:28,716
<i>Once it's crossed,</i>
<i>there's no going back.</i>

1593
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:32,753
<i>Because some transformations</i>
<i>are permanent.</i>

1594
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:34,655
[Orion] Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1595
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:36,791
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1596
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:38,659
[both] The greatest Prime
to ever live.

1597
01:32:38,793 --> 01:32:40,428
[both laugh]

1598
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:43,264
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

1599
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:45,566
You ever mine Energon before?

1600
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:46,901
No. You?

1601
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:49,370
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1602
01:32:49,937 --> 01:32:51,138
Well, I'll tell you what.

1603
01:32:51,272 --> 01:32:53,974
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1604
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:55,242
All right.

1605
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:58,112
Thanks, Pax.

1606
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,294
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1607
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,362
And a new leader.

1608
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:17,164
Yes, about that.

1609
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:22,369
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1610
01:33:22,503 --> 01:33:24,138
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1611
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:26,674
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1612
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:29,677
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1613
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:32,480
How's Major Elita sound?

1614
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:35,149
How about Commander?

1615
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:36,717
[chuckles] Even better.

1616
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:40,888
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1617
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:42,756
I may be a Prime now,

1618
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,358
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1619
01:33:44,492 --> 01:33:47,962
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

1620
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:50,131
I get to work
for the government.

1621
01:33:50,264 --> 01:33:53,834
[shimmering tone]
Okay. So that's new.

1622
01:33:53,968 --> 01:33:55,870
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

1623
01:34:07,248 --> 01:34:09,250
[all cheering]

1624
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:30,004
[Optimus Prime]
<i>And now we stand here</i>

Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1637
01:35:42,309 --> 01:35:44,411
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1638
01:35:44,546 --> 01:35:46,347
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1639
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,017
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1640
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,186
Watch this. Knife hands!

1641
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:55,122

<i>A personal enemy.</i>
