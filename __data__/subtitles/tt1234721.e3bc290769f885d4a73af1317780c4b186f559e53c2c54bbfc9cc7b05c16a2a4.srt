worst neighborhood in America

00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,074
could be made completely safe,

8
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,075
and what if I told you
that this could be accomplished

9
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,748

single law enforcement officer?

State of the Union segment

by General Curtis Monroe,

16
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,242

in the Pentagon.

17

General Monroe, welcome back.

18

- Good to see you, Pat.
- Uh, thank you

19
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,906
for this unprecedented
access to your operation.

20
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,749
Could you walk us through

21
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,574

22
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,954
Well, this is a, uh,
a routine operation.

23
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,949
We found that random patrols

24
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,744
helped the local population

25
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,741
to feel safer and to trust us.

26
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,743

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,740
They sweep and mop up.

34

just standard op, all right?

39

to pacify these people.

68

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,458

From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.

00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,115
What lead?

183
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,241
Not in front of them.

184
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,581
This is bullshit.

185
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,823
Yeah?

186
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,351
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

187
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,240
Vallon's our case.

188
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,456
Yeah, two years

189
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,199
without no arrest, no nothing?

190
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,623
You've got to be dumb or dirty.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,072
You got something on us,
or is this personal?

192
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,074
No, it's nothing personal...

193
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,408
Although I don't like you
as a person.

194
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,078
KAREN:
Okay, you two, out.

195
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,539
No problem.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,911
Maybe if you hadn't gone
off the reservation,

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,582
your partner would
still be standing.

198
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,540
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

199
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,954
Okay, Alex.

200
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,582
Just you and me now.

201
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,416
80, me and Jack, we've been
doing some street buys.

202
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,249
We get a line on some guns.

203
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,618
(voice-over): We meet up with
this low-level G called Jerry

204
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,412
who ends up having a piece
he's not supposed to have.

205
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,411
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry?

206
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,453
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

207
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,244
Two crates?
No disrespect, J,

208
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,700
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

209
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,226
Yo, what's it matter
where it comes from?

210
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,450
Why it matters—— we don't want

211
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,873
no dirty guns, Jerry.

212
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,226
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

213
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,610
Yo, look, they're clean,
all right?

214
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,578
- You gonna buy this shit or not?
- Hey, hey,

215
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,768
why you acting so nervous, man?

216
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,328
You fishing on us, Jerry?

217
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,124
What'd you say?

218
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,351
- You think he fishing, D?
- I think he's fishing on us.

219
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,851
Yo, what the hell are
they talking about, man?

220
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,286
Hey, let me see your phone.

221
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,726
- Let me see your phone.
- I'm not showing you

222
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,366
- my phone, man!
- You recording this?

223
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,415
- What?
- I think you're a goddamn cop.

224
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,741
What the hell
are you talking about, man?!

225
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,790
- Don't even try that!
- Hey, put your gun down!

226
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,578
We're not cops, all right?

227
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,434
- We work for Antoine Vallon.
- Put your phones on the table!

228
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,119
What?
Hey, hey, hey, shut up, shut up.

229
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,115
What'd you say?

230
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,332
Ends up he works for Vallon.

231
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,954
Before the meet we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

232
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,575
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

233
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,416
(voice-over):
Not out on the street.

234
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,616
Intake papers blank,
no signatures.

235
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,458
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

236
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,745
How do you think that happened?

237
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,457
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

238
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,200
These guys'll shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

239
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,078
We need backup.

240
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,620
We call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station,

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,036
he's gonna disappear.

242
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,707
It's gonna be all right.

243
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,643
(voice-over): We told Vallon
we were gun buyers,

244
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,284
and he bought it.

245
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,249
What do you two need
with that much product?

246
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,744
You plotting a coup?

247
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,240
Man, don't trip.

248
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,457
We ain't gonna bust
a single shot in your town.

249
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,423
We got some problems back home
with Chicago PD.

250
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,032
(phone rings)

251
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,866
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

252
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,949
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

253
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,867
What do you got for me?

254
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,574
Really?

255
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,268
MURPHY (voice-over): We were
just about to close the deal,

256
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,372
but someone tipped him off.

257
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,749
Gentlemen,
I got to deal with this.

258
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,035
-(tires screech)
—Two minutes.

259
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,283
Make sure you kill 'em both!

260
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,411
I got two handguns,

261
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,332
one automatic.

262
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,200
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

263
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,453
We gotta get out of here.

264
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,744
I'm gonna take the automatic.

265
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,074
You sure about this?

266
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,074
(gunfire continues)

267
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,907
You ready?

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,411
Move.

Officer down... 331 Hamilton.

277

This is Detective Alex Murphy

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,866

KAREN (voice-over): Alex, you
don't do something like this...

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,518
- Come on, Jack!
- ...unless you bring it

288
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,032
to me first.

289
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,707
Vallon's connected.

290
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,783
I'm warning you, don't
make any more moves

291
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,078
until I vet this.

292
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,643
If officers are supplying him
with guns...

293
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,580
That's up to IAD.

294
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,783
I'll handle it.

295
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,005
MAN (voice-over):
I don't care how sophisticated

296
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,833
these machines are,
Mr. Sellars.

297
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,577
A machine does not know
what it feels like to be human.

298
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,455
It can't understand
the value of human life.

299
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,915
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,163
To, to, to legislate
over life and death,

301
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:19,331
we need people who understand
right from wrong.

302
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,619
What do your machines feel?

303
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,458
Well, uh, they feel no anger.

304
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,283
They feel no prejudice.

305
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,082
They feel no fatigue,

306
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,121
which makes them ideal
for law enforcement.

307
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,156
Putting these machines
on the streets

308
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,330
will save
countless American lives.

309
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,059
- You're evading the question.
- No, I'm not.

310
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,619
Yes, you're evading
the question.

311
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,746
I asked, what do
these machines feel?

312
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,163
If one of them...
killed a child,

313
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,659
what would it feel?

314
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,949
- Nothing.
- And that's the problem.

315
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,621
That's why 72% of Americans
will not stand

316
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,661
for a robot pulling the trigger.

317
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,783
(applause)

318
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,893
MAN (voice-over): The world's
most valuable market,

319
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,749
and we can't touch it.

320
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,449
With a domestic expansion,

321
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:17,160
we'd clear $600 billion
per annum.

322
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,000
In other words, every second
that law is in existence,

323
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,165
we are hemorrhaging money.

324
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,991
What do you want me to do?

325
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,268
We've thrown cash at senators
at both sides of the aisle.

326
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,828
Nobody's budging.

327
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,893
They don't want to vote
against their constituents,

328
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,989
so, unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

329
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,618
Now, to that effect,
my team have come up

330
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,496
with a pretty aggressive
new campaign.

331
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,287
Wow factor off the charts.

332
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,614
We need to give Americans
a product they can love,

333
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,244
a figure they can rally behind.

334
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,655
Sir, I have dissected this bill.

335
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,994
There are no loopholes.

336
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,241
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

337
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,664
Forget machines.

338
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,578
You saw the polls.

339
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,910
Americans don't want a machine.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,074
They want a product
with a conscience.

341
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:07,331
They want something
that knows...

342
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,202
...what it feels like
to be human.

343
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,245
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

344
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,619
DOCTOR (voice-over):
You're not you

345
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,450
because of your legs,
your arms, your hands.

346
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,290
You're you
because of your brain.

347
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,284
It's your, your brain's capacity
to process information

348
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,207
that makes you who you are.

349
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,615
Relax and just do

350
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,699
what you've always done.

351
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,290
I've never played with these.

352
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,787
The music doesn't come
from your fingers, Michael,

353
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,619
it comes from your mind.

354
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,832
All you have to do
is let it out.

355
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,791
Please.

566
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:56,622
and your family's fine,
both your wife and your son.

567
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,615
Who the hell are you?

568
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,582
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.

569
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,991
I'm treating you.

570
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,116

00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,491
I can't move.

573
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,741
- What the hell is all that?
- Visual input unstable.

574
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,289
I want you to relax, Alex.

- Not yet.

577
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,950
Unlock vertebrae.

578
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,450
(clicking, whirring, hissing)

579
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,453
Go ahead, Kim.

580
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,704
Unlock upper, lower extremities.

581
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,287
What kind of suit is this?

582
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:50,617
It's not a suit, Alex, it's...

583
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,707
it-it's you.

584
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,957
This was the only option.

585
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,157
We're here...

586
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:00,455
All of us... to make
you whole again.

587
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,453
- Full body unlock.
- (clank, thud)

588
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,283
I want you to walk now, Alex.

589
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,366
You can do that.

590
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,241
(footsteps thudding)

591
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,199
(whirring, thudding)

592
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,995
This seems so real.

593
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,161
Alex, it's, it's very important

594
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,748
you understand
what is happening.

595
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,119
This is real.

596
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,744
It's not a dream,

597
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,494
it's not drugs or anesthetics.

598
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,617
I know I'm dreaming
because I can feel all of this.

599
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,780
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

600
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:49,782
It's called phantom
limb sensation.

601
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,499
What do you mean "amputees"?

602
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,893
- What the hell did you do to me?
- Alex, you need to relax.

603
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,476
Take this off me now.
I need to get out of this thing.

604
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
You need to relax.

605
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,948
Alex, Dr. Norton
saved your life.

606
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,684
What did you do to me?!
What have you done to me?!

607
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,618
Your body was beyond
biological repair!

608
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,824
KIM:
Alex... hey!

609
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,907
Shut him down.

610
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,286
NORTON:
Uh, no! Let him run!

611
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,703
Let him run!

612
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:16,166
(whirring, thudding)

613
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,832
(startled shouts, gasping)

614
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,199
(crew speaking Mandarin)

615
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,909
(man shouting in Mandarin)

616
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,537
Where am I?!

617
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,073
(man shouts in Mandarin)

618
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,411
(whirring, thudding)

619
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,740

620
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,699
(workers murmuring)

621
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,532
NORTON (over radio):
Alex, please.

622
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,991
Stop.

623
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,366
Alex, you have to stop.

624
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,624
Please.

625
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,458
Alex.

626
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,283
Please stop.

627
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:14,036
Stay where you are and,
and we'll come and pick you up.

628
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,908
(thudding)

629
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,828
(thud, whirring)

630
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,617
Okay, Kim.

631
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,746
Shut him down.

632
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,540
(power whirring down)

633
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,287
(workers murmuring,
birds chirping)

634
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:21,536
Alex... you can't
run from this.

635
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,494
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.

636
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,783
Show me.

637
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,199
Kim.

638
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,616
(whirring)

639
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,783
(whirring and clanking)

640
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,866
No.

641
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,241
No.

642
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:04,577
Holy Christ.
Holy Christ.

643
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,957
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

644
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,042
(sobbing)

645
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,791
(heart beating quietly)

646
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,823
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

647
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,786
That's not even my brain.

648
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,788
We had to repair
the damaged areas,

649
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,582
but we didn't interfere
with your emotion

650
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,782
or your intellect.

651
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,784
Do you un... you
understand me, Alex?

652
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:39,581
You're, you're in control.

653
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,578
I'm in control?

654
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,658
Yes.

655
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,283
Okay.

656
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:53,326
If I'm in control...

657
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,449
then I want to die.

658
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,245
Just unplug whatever it is
keeping me alive

659
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,496
and end this nightmare.

660
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,616
Now, say I did that,
which, as a doctor,

661
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:08,997
would almost be impossible
for me, but, but say I did.

662
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,830
What, what, what do
I say to your wife?

663
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,494
What does she say to your son?

664
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,866
That it didn't work,
that you tried.

665
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,161
Something went wrong.

666
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:27,083
You did everything
you could, but...

667
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,290
I died.

668
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,332
So, after all
they've been through,

669
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,664
all the pain,

670
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,999
all their hope restored,

671
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,618
we would just rip that away?

672
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,949
Your wife loves you, Alex.

673
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,074
She signed
the consent forms herself.

674
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,034
Otherwise, y-you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

675
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,789
She loves you,

676
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,038
and she gave you
a second chance.

677
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,286
I need you

678
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,749
to take it.

679
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,875
I don't want to see myself
like this again.

680
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,744
Ever.

681
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,824
And the same goes for my family.

682
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,782
Just put me back in.

683
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,365
(quiet whirr, click)

684
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,407
(phone ringing)

685
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,036
ROBOCOP:
Zoom in.

686
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,448
Stop.

687
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,624
(ringing continues)

688
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,741
Zoom in.

689
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,366
Stop.

690
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,078
(ringing continues)

691
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,623
Accept the connection.

692
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,949
(beeping)

693
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,950
(sighs)

694
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,454
It's so good to finally see you.

695
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,533
I was gonna say the same thing.

696
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,454
I'm sorry.

697
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,079
I know how I must look to you.

698
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,909
I think you look beautiful.

699
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,492
(Clara laughs gently)

700
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,083
Are they treating you okay,
baby?

701
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,784
So far. Dr. Norton,

702
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,993
he seems like a nice guy.

703
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,116
Does David know you're calling?

704
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,125
He misses you.

705
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,412
...I can go get him. I just...
—No.

706
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,413
I don't want him to
see me like this.

707
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,491
Not yet.

708
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,616
Sure.

709
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,457
(crying)

710
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,166
We're gonna get
through this, baby.

711
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,533
We're gonna make it like it was.

712
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,328
When are you coming home?

713
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,995
Well, they still got some tests,

714
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,207
but they're saying it's
going really well.

715
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,290
The minute they let me.

716
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:12,659
I gotta go.

717
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,578
I love you.

718
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,658
- End the connection.
- (beeping)

719
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,033
(whirring)

720
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,906
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

721
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,659
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

722
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:45,956
Releasing proteins, fats,

723
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,124

00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,499
Kim, it's all yours.

1083
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:29,663
KIM: Archive footage
uploading successfully.

1084
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,208
Your system draws connections
automatically.

1085
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:34,453
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes and give you

1086
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,164
their exact locations
whenever available.

1087
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,535
ROBOCOP: I got evidence
to make 138... no, no...

1088
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,534
166 arrests.

1089
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:47,830
KIM:
His emotions are stable.

1090
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:49,032
This is incredible.

1091
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,518
KELLY (voice-over):
You will notice

1092
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:53,000
his family is here
in the building as well.

1093
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,643
The mayor is
standing onstage behind me.

1094
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,329
Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.

1095
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:58,828
They seem like great friends,

1096
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,203
obviously echoing
the partnership

1097
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:01,949
that they've brought together.

1098
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,329
LIZ: How much longer
will this take?

1099
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,559
KAREN: Well, the feed from
the database is almost done,

1100
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,166
so we're approaching
present day.

1101
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,823
634 pending arrests.

1102
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,791
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

1103
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,036
ROBOCOP:
He's on top of her.

1104
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,999
KIM: Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

1105
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,523
...I got to do something...!
—Alex...

1106
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,159
Alex, ca-calm down.

1107
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,954
Take a breath; R-relax.

1108
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:29,122
Kim, what are the readings?

1109
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:30,828
I haven't seen him

1110
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,080
- at levels like this.
- He's gonna shoot 'em. -Alex.

1111
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,455
Alex, Alex, r-relax.

1112
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:38,124
Relax.

1113
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,661
Alex...

1114
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,661
- What is this?
- This just a computer glitch?

1115
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,458
KAREN:
No, that's his own crime scene.

1116
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:45,582
- Alex.
- KIM: He's spiking

1117
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,034
...all over the place.
—Alex!

1118
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,434
- Alex!
- The system is crashing, Doctor.

1119
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,166
Alex, can you hear me?
Alex? Alex?

1120
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,393
KIM: I'm not sure
he can handle this.

1121
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,518
ROBOCOP:
I gotta do something.

1122
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,158
He's emotionally ovefloaded.

1123
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,498
Unlock me!

1124
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,457
Alex, stop! Stop!

1125
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,203
He's having a seizure!

1126
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,290
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

1127
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,036
...Get me a live feed.
—I can't do it.

1128
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:06,351
...Dr. Norton's with the patient.
—Do it now!

1129
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,332
Jesus Christ!

1130
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,893
...Dr. Norton... Dr. Norton...
- What?!

1131
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:11,624
The press is waiting.
We have to get him

1132
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,995
- up there now.
- What do you want me to do?!

1133
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,833
I don't know... fix him!
Do what you have to do.

1134
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:20,531
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

1135
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:24,035
We're running out of time.

1136
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,374
Okay.

1137
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,992
Everybody out.

1138
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,786
Out!

1139
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,242
Mayor Durant is about to take
to the stage and introduce

1140
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,825
Detroit's newest weapon
in the war on crime.

1141
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,076
I'm, I'm actually getting word
that he's ready to go right now.

1142
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,994
(car alarm blaring)

1143
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,832
KIM:
Heart rate rising.

1144
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,448
He might start spiking, Doctor.

1145
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,534
NORTON: Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

1146
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,101
But you'll be taking
away his emotions.

1147
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,725
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

1148
01:00:51,792 --> 01:00:53,282
Doctor, you'll be taking away

1149
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,366
- his ability to feel anything.
- Now, please.

1150
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,828
Pull the footage.

1151
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:04,033
Put it on a loop.

1152
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,199
Dopamine level's at 20%.

1153
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,791
More.

1154
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,204
KIM: Dopamine level's
at ten percent.

1155
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,949
NORTON:
More.

1156
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,164
KIM:
Dopamine level's

1157
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,490
...at five percent.
—Lower...

1158
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,995
...You're flattening him out.
—Lower.

1159
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,950
KIM:
Two percent.

1160
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:24,033
Hold it there.

1161
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,541
Alex...

1162
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,658
Alex, how do you feel?

1163
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,453
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

1164
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:42,453
MAYOR (voice-over):
Well, today

1165
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:47,207
I'm not here to talk
about crime prevention.

1166
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:50,830
I am here to give you the cure!

1167
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:51,998
That's right!

1168
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,664
Hi, Dad.

1169
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,874
(whirring, footsteps thudding)

1170
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,911
Dad?

1171
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,491
MAYOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

1172
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,957
the revolution begins right now

1173
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:17,660
with Detective Alex Murphy.

1174
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,161
(cheering, whistling, applause)

1175
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:32,285
<i>♪♪</i>

1176
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,042
SELLARS:
Detective.

1177
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,867
(whirring)

1178
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:52,784
POPE:
He looks like a zombie.

1179
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:55,287
I think he's accessing
criminal data.

1180
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,912
Thomas King,
you are under arrest.

1181
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,954
(crowd screaming)

1182
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,328
(whirring)

1183
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:25,201
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

1184
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:29,281
wanted for rape,
arson, and murder.

1185
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:33,539
This man has torn apart
American families.

1186
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:38,207
On the loose for six years.

1187
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:43,248
And where was
this criminal mastermind hiding?

1188
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:51,120
Right in front
of the police headquarters.

1189
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:56,032
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

1190
01:03:56,167 --> 01:04:00,035
These two officers
are completely unaware

1191
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:04,161
of the monster in their midst.

1192
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,490
(crowd screaming)

1193
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,208
And then, in 60 seconds...

1194
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:12,327
I repeat, just 60 seconds...

1195
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:15,990
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

1196
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,991
ROBOCOP: If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1197
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,662
one will be provided for you.

1198
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:23,663
This, my friends, is the future

1199
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,367
of American justice.

1200
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,207
How many like Thomas King

1201
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,494
will pay for their crimes

1202
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:33,664
now that RoboCop is here?

1203
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,448
Yes, let's not shy away

1204
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,658
from what this means, people.

1205
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,823
Men weren't up to the task,

1206
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,624
but Alex Murphy...

1207
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:49,576
A robot cop... was.

1208
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:50,994
We can't take him
off the street.

1209
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,289
This, this is what I'm saying.

1210
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,867
He's a hit,
a big, fat, stinking hit.

1211
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,116
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

1212
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,790
Hey, we all knew
there would be issues.

1213
01:04:58,875 --> 01:04:59,785
Uh, it's inevitable.

1214
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,161
Dennett, you're my guy.

1215
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,809
I just need you to
get a handle on this.

1216
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,323
I know, but I need more time.

1217
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:07,000
Scientifically,
w-w-we're in uncharted water.

1218
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,226
We need to take him back to
the lab and do more tests.

1219
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,866
I mean, it was like something

1220
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,786
was interfering with our system,

1221
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,458
something beyond
chemistry or physics.

1222
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,499
Like what, his soul?

1223
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,995
Hey, look, this train
has already left the station.

1224
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,366
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

1225
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,912
<i>“</i> Sorry, I released
a defective product,"

1226
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,161
so, no matter what we do,

1227
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:28,033
we just need to keep him
on the streets.

1228
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,331
Uh, what about the interviews?

1229
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,664
Cancel 'em.

1230
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:34,365
Cancel all of 'em... everything.

1231
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,868
In fact, Dennett, let's, uh,

1232
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,994
let's keep the wife
at a distance for now as well.

1233
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,994
CLARA (voice-over):
I'd like to see him.

1234
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,994
Can you arrange that?

1235
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,994
Look, I won't lie to you.

1236
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:52,156
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

1237
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,457
I looked in his eyes
and I couldn't see my husband,

1238
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,829
and then he just shoots
a man in front of our son.

1239
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,830
That's not sedation.

1240
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:03,496
He's responding to drugs
differently now.

1241
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:07,659
We both knew, from day one...

1242
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:09,783
there would be complications.

1243
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,992
Just give me a little more time.

1244
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,541
I promise...

1245
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:22,658
you'll have your husband back.

1246
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,203
(elevator bell dings)

1247
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,655
KAREN: This goes for every
squad in every department.

1248
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,783
Detective Murphy
will have full access

1249
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,457
to all investigations...

1250
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:35,330
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.

1251
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,499
If he requests
to take over a case,

1252
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,494
the case will be handed to him.

1253
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,491
No arguments, no complaints.

1254
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,823
MAN:
This is bullshit.

1255
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:44,658
I said no complaints,
and I mean it.

1256
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,827
Now...

1257
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:48,659
ROBOCOP:
Good morning, Chief Dean.

1258
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,661
Good morning, officers.

1259
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:53,534
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

1260
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:54,953
John Biggs is target number one.

1261
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:56,282
I'll be taking over this case.

1262
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:58,992
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

1263
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,666
should be ready
to move in on my request.

1264
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,912
I wish you all a very good day.

1265
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,160
Murphy...

1266
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,332
you okay, man?

1267
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,119
I'm fine, Sergeant.

1268
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,119
Can't wait to get back to work.

1269
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,059
Lake and Daniels are in there
shitting their pants.

1270
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,541
Excuse me, I have casework.

1271
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,412
(engine roaring)

1272
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,574
(crowd cheering)

1273
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:41,657
(cheering)

1274
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,783
(engine roaring)

1275
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,783
(engine roaring)

1276
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,333
Brother.

1277
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,782
So what's this do?

1278
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:15,829
(yelling)

1279
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,620
Don't shoot, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot!

1280
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,824
(tires screech)

1281
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,824
Walter Karrel, look at me.

1282
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,328
You have two options.

1283
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,498
Option one:

1284
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:32,416
I shoot you with 50,000 volts,

1285
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,822
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1286
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,325
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control,

1287
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,328
and then I arrest you.

1288
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,873
Option two: You tell me

1289
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,332
where John Biggs' drug lab
is located,

1290
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,000
and then I arrest you.

1291
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,871
You have two seconds to decide.

1292
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:02,034

Totally justifiable.

1299
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,832
We are going to make
a lot of money.

1300
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:05,701
Nothing, no fear,
no increase in heart rate,

1301
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:09,280
no traces of anger whatsoever.

1302
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,366
LIZ:
Congratulations, Doctor.

1303
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,540
You did it.

1304
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,574
Yes, I did.

1305
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,869
MATTOX (voice-over):
I told you, sir.

1306
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,456
Norton clearly never had

1307
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:28,953
control of the product.

1308
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:31,534
SELLARS: I agree,
that's why I called you here.

1309
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,864
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1310
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,867
Okay, I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head...

1311
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,458
plus full surveillance
of the lab and...

1312
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,829
You're gonna have full access
to everything.

1313
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:46,865
If anything comes up,
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1314
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,067
NOVAK (voice-over):
He brought peace

1315
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,659
to this country's
most violent city.

1316
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,953
He showed us all

1317
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,703
that Detroit and America

1318
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:58,993
can have a brighter future...

1319
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,874
A future of economic growth,

1320
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,161
freedom, and happiness.

1321
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,161
On tonight's show,

1322
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,322
a visionary and true patriot:

1323
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:11,365
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1324
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,207
(applause)

1325
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,198
- Hello, Pat.
- Raymond.

1326
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,664
Thanks for having me.

1327
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:18,375
You must be doing a
victory lap about now.

1328
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,491
- Well...
- Two weeks ago,

1329
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,995
Omni's stock went
through the roof,

1330
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,495
and the Senate
has finally agreed

1331
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,824
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1332
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,791
Well, look, I mean,
the tide is definitely turning.

1333
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,832
I, I just feel certain
that, soon,

1334
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,328
we'll be keeping
all Americans safe.

1335
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:35,498
I certainly hope so,

1336
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,665
but I think
our next guest will have

1337
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,790
a different point of view.

1338
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:39,990
SELLARS:
Mm-hmm.

1339
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,665
Hubert Dreyfus.

1340
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,787
Senator, thank you
for joining us.

1341
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,206
Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.

1342
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,200
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1343
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,870
The American public is divided

1344
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,490
on the Dreyfus Act.

1345
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:57,491
Our polls at NovakElement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1346
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,493
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,

1347
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:05,118
but this bill is not
about Alex Murphy.

1348
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,996
It's about whether America
is willing to give robots

1349
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,268
the authority over human lives.

1350
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,784
No, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

1351
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,458
This, uh, sea change
we're witnessing...

1352
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:17,409
And it is a sea change... shows
that Americans don't really care

1353
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,208
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1354
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,199
What they care about
is efficiency

1355
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:23,619
and they care about safety.

1356
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,164
You're clouding the issue.

1357
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:28,000
This is clearly an attempt
to sway public opinion

1358
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,620
- with a marketing stunt.
- No, what's clear is

1359
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,449
that with just one system
in place,

1360
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:33,998
we've cut crime by 80%.

1361
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,620
Just imagine if we put,
I don't know,

1362
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,059
let's say
a hundred systems in place.

1363
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,996
And then I want you
to ask yourself,

1364
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,619
why are you holding us back?

1365
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:43,934
- Is that your plan?
- Thank you, Senator.

1366
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,824
- And thank you, Raymond.
- Thank you, Pat.

1367
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:49,205
Well, there you have it.

1368
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,199
Who could argue with that?

1369
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,950
Which begs the question:

1370
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,165
<i>Has the US. Senate</i>

1371
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,743
become pro-crime?

1372
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:04,658
(phone ringing)

1373
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,101
(phone rings, then beeps on)

1374
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,661
Yeah, hi.

1375
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,491
No, no, $5,000.

1376
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,165
Yeah, call me tomorrow.

1377
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:16,000
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1378
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,833
Vallon's waiting for you inside.

1379
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,494
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1380
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,184
- I'm out here making money.
- Yeah, no, I know.

1381
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,434
VALLON:
Where are my trip wires?

1382
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,994
I gotta do this myself?

1383
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,448
What took you so long?

1384
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:27,768
DANIELS: What the hell
is all this shit?

1385
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:28,792
I can't move any product

1386
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,617
with this thing on the streets.

1387
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,039
What are you doing
to protect me?

1388
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:35,204
Relax, the guy's
a walking zombie.

1389
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,664
Tell me your phones are off.

1390
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:37,657
He's not going after you.

1391
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,157
We covered our tracks.

1392
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,617
He can't manufacture evidence
out of thin air.

1393
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,665
If he does, I'm ready for him.

1394
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:46,159
(thudding, whirring)

1395
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,074
Well?

1396
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,448
I've been getting calls.

1397
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:00,374
From whom?

1398
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,956
Well, Clara.

1399
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,828
You need to let her
see her husband.

1400
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:06,158
She has rights.

1401
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:07,498
That's not your decision.

1402
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,449
That's Legal's call.

1403
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:11,533
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1404
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:14,034
before she turns up
on television.

1405
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:16,158
Well, she can try.

1406
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:19,038
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1407
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,699
- I'd hop to it.
- CLARA (voice-over): Alex.

1408
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,541
Alex, Alex!

1409
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,624
Alex.

1410
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,540
You need to come home.

1411
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,203
Clara, please stand aside.

1412
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,449
- You need to speak to your son.
- Right now,

1413
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:35,828
I see three crimes in progress.

1414
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,494
- My objective...
- Alex, listen to me.

1415
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,995
I know you're in there.

1416
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,204
David won't show
his face at school.

1417
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,991
He's having nightmares.

1418
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,457
He's falling apart.

1419
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:51,158
I'm falling apart.

1420
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,365
(gasping)

1421
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,333
Please.

1422
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,665
I can't do this on my own.

1423
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,953
He's been scared

1424
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,708
ever since that night.

1425
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,658
- (clamoring)
- Come on, brother...!

1426
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:12,268
LIZ (voice-over): What do you
think she's gonna do?

1427
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:15,250
Hm. What's he gonna do?

1428
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:26,704
(crowd clamoring)

1429
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,074

01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,324
the men and women

1608
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:18,330
who swore to keep us safe,

1609
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:20,540
they can be bribed.

1610
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:23,242
They... can be bought.

1611
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,162
Machines, however,

1612
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,659
are corruption-free.

1613
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,538
Americans could be living
in a country

1614
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:35,989
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1615
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,996
but incorruptible.

1616
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,040
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done,

1617
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:43,204
and for all that you are.

1618
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:46,655
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1619
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:49,495
Our doctors are
working ceaselessly

1620
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:52,496
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1621
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,207
(reporters clamoring)

1622
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,199
KELLY: Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt

1623
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,290
on Detective Alex Murphy's life

1624
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:00,662
will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?

1625
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,536
LIZ: At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern

1626
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:05,125
is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.

1627
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:07,495
NOVAK: How many times
does Detective Murphy

1628
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,500
have to give his life
for his country?

1629
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:14,163
I sincerely hope

1630
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,158
the Senate makes
the right vote tomorrow,

1631
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,991
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices

1632
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,825
will not have been in vain.

1633
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:27,290
OHIO SENATOR (voice-over):
Senator Dreyfus is my friend.

1634
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,493
He has been
my mentor and my strength

1635
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,494
in times of difficulty
on this floor.

1636
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,996
But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio

1637
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,371
and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.

1638
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,491
So I vote yes.

1639
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:43,491
The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.

1640
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,291
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

1641
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,831
Yeah, I spoke to
the Senate liaison,

1642
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,665
and it looks like
it's in the bag.

1643
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:52,162
But we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1644
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:56,533
We're here live
at DPD headquarters

1645
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,999
where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.

1646
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,494
POPE:
What the hell?

1647
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:03,450
Omnicorp has denied me
and my son

1648
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:05,158
access to Alex for weeks.

1649
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:08,455
I demand to know why.

1650
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:10,704
This treatment is inhuman,

1651
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:13,825
and somebody needs
to be held accountable.

1652
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,199
- CLARA: Thank you.
- Oh, we're fucked.

1653
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:18,828
No, we only need 12 votes.

1654
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,184
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1655
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,434
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1656
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,789
We... I mean,

1657
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,434
those two should not
be allowed contact.

1658
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:27,120
If-if she starts putting ideas
in his head...

1659
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:28,369
Bring her in.

1660
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,601
I'll handle the explanation.

1661
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:30,706
And what about Alex?

1662
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,323
You know, unfortunately,

1663
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:33,873
we can't just keep him on ice.

1664
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,619
LIZ: The shooting
at the station

1665
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,164
spooked some of the politicians.

1666
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,659
They're our clients;
We have to take care of them.

1667
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,033
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1668
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:45,285
but when a man
is investigating city politics,

1669
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,831
they get nervous.

1670
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,995
All right, first off,
it's not a man, okay?

1671
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,699
It's property of Omnicorp.

1672
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,495
And politics are the
least of your concern.

1673
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,199
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1674
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:56,494
How long till it realizes

1675
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,893
you haven't been
on the level with it?

1676
01:29:57,917 --> 01:29:59,624
POPE: If that happens,
every journalist

1677
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,308
in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1678
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:03,707
I mean, we-we created a hero.

1679
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:07,291
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1680
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,492
What's bigger than a hero?

1681
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,830
A dead hero.

1682
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,616
Get me Dr. Norton.

1683
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,914
What is this, Raymond?

1684
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,241
You have Mattox spying on me

1685
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,620
and now this bullshit
about a "critical condition"?

1686
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,741
You know and I know

1687
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,119
Alex is fine!

1688
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,456
Calm down.

1689
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,618
What... Dennett.

1690
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,976
Your work is so good, I don't...

1691
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,351
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1692
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:56,456
You saw the woman on TV!

1693
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,245
This has to stop!

1694
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,536
You're right.

1695
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,283
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1696
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:08,250
What kind of life have we really
given Alex Murphy?

1697
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,949
He's never gonna be
a normal man,

1698
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,828
a father, a husband.

1699
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:14,120
By the time we put
the other units on the street,

1700
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,582
he's just... Dennett...

1701
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:17,953
(sighs)

1702
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,666
Let's face it.

1703
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:23,580
We failed him.

1704
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,328
We failed Alex Murphy.

1705
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:27,297
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1706
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:29,116
because that's
what we're talking about.

1707
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,742
The work you've done with him
is gonna be studied for decades.

1708
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,949
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1709
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:37,121
No policeman
is ever going to die

1710
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,448
in the line of duty again

1711
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,874
because of you.

1712
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:44,366
Think about that.

1713
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:54,409
I want that family

1714
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,413
taken care of
beyond their wildest dreams.

1715
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,615
We owe them that.

1716
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,164
I agree.

1717
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:02,499
I want full funding

1718
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,115
for ten years.

1719
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,245
New staff, all my own people.

1720
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,119
Fantastic.

1721
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,661
Deal.

1722
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:21,124
Hey, what's going on?

1723
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,285
Security's here.

1724
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,623
They're clearing everyone out.

1725
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,286
They're not waking him up.

1726
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,457
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1727
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,184
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1728
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:31,996
SENATE LEADER:
The voting period has ended.

1729
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,165
The clerks have
tabulated the results.

1730
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:37,125
The yeas are 63.

1731
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,957
The nays are 22.

1732
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,825
A majority of senators
have voted in the affirmative.

1733
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:44,575
The Dreyfus Act
has been repealed

1734
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,956
by Congress.

1735
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:47,999
(applause over TV)

1736
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:51,957
(phone rings)

1737
01:32:52,042 --> 01:32:54,158
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1738
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:55,327
This is Mattox.

1739
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,074
<i>SELLARS:
Bennett's on board.</i>

1740
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:59,158
It's about time.

1741
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,574
Call it.

1742
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,123
Get it done.

1743
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,199
My pleasure.

1744
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,616
(doorbell rings)

1745
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:18,865
Mrs. Murphy...

1746
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,494
You can come here
as much as you want.

1747
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,956
You can threaten me.

1748
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,518
You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1749
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,309
But I am not gonna stop
till I see my husband.

1750
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,619
Do you understand that?

1751
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,038
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1752
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,786
Is Alex okay?

1753
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,786
He has important information
to share with you.

1754
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:37,329
Will you accompany me?

1755
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,832
David.

1756
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:41,958
We gotta go.

1757
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,164
Can you grab your coat?

1758
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:44,327
(phone rings)

1759
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,823
Hey.

1760
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:47,434
NORTON: I'm in the elevator,
on my way down.

1761
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:48,994
I need access to the lab.

1762
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,309
That's insane;
They're still here.

1763
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,744
NORTON:
Distract them.

1764
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,449
Okay.

1765
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
|cannot...!

1766
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:58,120
There's a lady in here
going hysterical.

1767
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,268
She will not let us in;
She's got the code for the door.

1768
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,476
I repeat:
She will not let us in.

1769
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,851
Lady, you need to let us
in there now.

1770
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,286
We have to get in there.

1771
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,976
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1772
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,786
Do you want to be responsible
for the deaths

1773
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,934
of everyone in this building?

1774
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:09,958
Hey! Stop!

1775
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:12,074
(panting)

1776
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:15,167
Don't shoot.

1777
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,575
Step outside.

1778
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,411
Unlock the transmitter!

1779
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,707
KIM:
Transmitter unlocked.

1780
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,617
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1781
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,411
WOMAN (over intercom):
Right away, sir.

1782
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:42,074
NORTON (voice-over):
Wake him up!

1783
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:45,489
Alex! Alex!

1784
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:46,625
Alex, it's Dr. Norton.

1785
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:48,745
You have to wake up!

1786
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,449
Alex, can you hear me?

1787
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:52,907
These men are here to kill us.

1788
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,456
They're here to kill us,

1789
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:56,328
for Christ sakes!

1790
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,786
SELLARS (voice-over):
Mrs. Murphy, last night,

1791
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,661
Alex had a psychotic break.

1792
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,749
He killed an unarmed colleague

1793
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,074
and later suffered a seizure.

1794
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,750
We did everything...

1795
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,619
Everything... we could,

1796
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,028
but the doctors
couldn't save him.

1797
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:17,790
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1798
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,908
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1799
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,412
ROBOCOP (voice-over):
You shut me down.

1800
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,116
I was about to get a confession.

1801
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,618
Mattox shut you down.

1802
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:28,914
I've removed your transmitter,

1803
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,616
so he won't do it again.

1804
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:33,788
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1805
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:36,367
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1806
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,415
He wants you dead, Alex.

1807
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,116
You understand?

1808
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,768
SELLARS (voice-over):
Sorry. If there's anything

1809
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:43,954
we can do for you and
David, we'll do it.

1810
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:46,659
I want nothing from you.

1811
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:48,328
I understand.

1812
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,870
You stay out of our lives.

1813
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,824
You and your company.

1814
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,824
If that's what
you think is best.

1815
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,665
There's one more thing.

1816
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:59,999
I think it would be to
the benefit of everyone,

1817
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,365
especially David,

1818
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,790
if we kept this matter private.

1819
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,833
We don't want to damage
Alex's legacy.

1820
01:36:08,042 --> 01:36:09,783
NORTON (voice-over):
Alex.

1821
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:10,998
Alex!

1822
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,331
I can fix this!

1823
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:13,573
You lied to me.

1824
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:15,453
You lied to my wife.

1825
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:17,393
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1826
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:18,601
You want me to
trust you, Doctor?

1827
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:20,741
Alex, I can go to the press!

1828
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:24,121
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1829
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,996
Alex!

1830
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:30,083
Listen to me, please!

1831
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:31,407
Alex!

1832
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,491
Alex...!

1833
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,332
(engine roaring)

1834
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:46,199
What the hell...?

1835
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:48,661
(tires squealing)

1836
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:52,573
(passing car honking horn)

1837
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:54,123
(engine revving)

1838
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,559
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1839
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,268
and for Christ sakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1840
01:36:57,292 --> 01:36:58,157
MAN:
Roger that.

1841
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:01,159
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1842
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:03,624
Look at this city.

1843
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,287
So beautiful.

1844
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:10,742
It's become so peaceful.

1845
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:16,325
I wish...

1846
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,790
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1847
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,331
I have very sad news.

1848
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:21,573
Despite our best efforts

1849
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,749
to save him,

1850
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,291
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1851
01:37:26,417 --> 01:37:27,623
Alex Murphy was...

1852
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,286
SECURITY OFFICER:
Mr. Sellars.

1853
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:31,283
- What is it?
- Mattox just called.

1854
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:33,533
We need to you to come
with us now.

1855
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:36,789
(elevator bell dings)

1856
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:41,559
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1857
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:42,663
What are you talking about?

1858
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:44,028
We have
a security situation here.

1859
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,601
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1860
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,726
Sir, there's a car
outside that's...

1861
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:47,911
That area is locked down.

1862
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,120
- Now go.
- What's happening?

1863
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,119
I said go!

1864
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,412
I want to talk to Mr. Sellars.

1865
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:57,282
Mr. Sellars.

1866
01:37:57,417 --> 01:37:59,657
- How close is that helicopter?
- About ten minutes, sir.

1867
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,741
<i>♪♪</i>

1868
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:18,619
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1869
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,661
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1870
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:21,832
- Yes.
- It's an emergency.

1871
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:22,957
SECURITY OFFICER:
Stand by.

1872
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,081
Mr. Sellars.

1873
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:25,657
Apparently there's
a Clara Murphy

1874
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:26,998
in the lobby.

1875
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:28,581
Uh, Raymond, if she sees him,

1876
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:30,476
- we are dead in the water.
- What do you want to do?

1877
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,161
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1878
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:33,453
Yes, sir.

1879
01:38:33,542 --> 01:38:36,284
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

1880
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,454
LEWIS (voice-over):
Norton said they may be

1881
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:39,953
using drones for protection.

1882
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:42,415
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1883
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,241
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed.

1884
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:46,370
...Clear?
—Clear. —Clear.

1885
01:38:54,792 --> 01:38:56,783
(siren wailing)

1886
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,082
(engine decelerating)

1887
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,123
OFFICER:
Hold it right there!

1888
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,268
OFFICER 2 (over radio):
...coming your way.

1889
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,292
Don't move!

1890
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:10,124
This is private property.

1891
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,208
You are not authorized
to be here!

1892
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,495
(electricity crackling,
officer groans)

1893
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,018
ROBOCOP:
I'd put those guns down now

1894
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:19,373
if I were you.

1895
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,786
OFFICER:
Stand down. Stand down.

1896
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:22,908
OFFICER 2: All right, man,
we're good We're good!

1897
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:24,792
Let's go! Back it up!

1898
01:39:38,667 --> 01:39:40,658
(whirring)

1899
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,036
(thudding)

1900
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:06,242
(sirens wailing)

1901
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,250
Head to the lower level.

1902
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:12,374
-GUARD: Hold up! Hold up!
—Ram it!

1903
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:24,449
(thudding)

1904
01:40:41,167 --> 01:40:44,080
(grunting, groaning)

1905
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,704
(grunting with effort)

1906
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:05,542
(sirens wailing)

1907
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:07,415
(tires squealing)

1908
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,081
(grunting)

1909
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:14,167
Gun it!

1910
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:17,536
Go, go, go, now!

1911
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,240
(groaning)

1912
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:33,948
Alex, run!

1913
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:36,871
Omnicorp Security!

1914
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,518
- Drop your weapons!
- ED-209: Drop your weapon.

1915
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:41,330
Keep your hands above your head,

1916
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,948
and no one will be harmed.

1917
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:54,583
(sirens wailing in distance)

1918
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:59,073
What's going on?

1919
01:41:59,167 --> 01:42:01,408
Mrs. Murphy, I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1920
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,300
The organic part
of your husband Alex is dead.

1921
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:06,325
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1922
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:07,768
and he's shooting up
the building.

1923
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:09,282
So we've got to get you
and your son

1924
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:10,456
out of here right away.

1925
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:13,330
I've got to take this call.

1926
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,101
He just left the lobby,
and he's headed our way.

1927
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:16,615
MATTOX:
Roger that, sir.

1928
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,956
Don't shoot.

1929
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,289
My robot. You just flank.

1930
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:21,366
...Got it.
—Tin Man!

1931
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:25,448
Tin Man?

1932
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:28,291
Tin Man.

1933
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,615
Oh, there it is.

1934
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,741
You look like crap.

1935
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,448
What's the matter?

1936
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:36,828
Can't shoot?

1937
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,164
Huh?

1938
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:40,829
What were you thinking?

1939
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,414
This isn't a drill.

1940
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,500
You're a robot.

1941
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,786
I'm a red asset.

1942
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:45,956
Wrote that myself.

1943
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:47,824
What do you think?

1944
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:50,996
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1945
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:53,116
Pull it.

1946
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:54,414
You can run.

1947
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Go on.

1948
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:57,073
Run.

1949
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,456
Run!

1950
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,448
There you go.

1951
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:00,664
Run.

1952
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:02,533
Run. Run!

1953
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:04,615
(yells)

1954
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:06,787
(whoops)

1955
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,635
- Stings like a bitch, don't it?
- (groaning)

1956
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:11,663
Aren't you lucky I didn't have
my gun set to "kill"?

1957
01:43:13,542 --> 01:43:15,624
Hey, listen...

1958
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:18,166
this isn't personal.

1959
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,158
Well, maybe a little.

1960
01:43:20,292 --> 01:43:23,739
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1961
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,619
(gunshot)

1962
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,822
SECURITY OFFICER:
Helicopter's approaching.

1963
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:38,164
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1964
01:43:38,292 --> 01:43:39,623
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy,

1965
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,366
you and your son
can get on first.

1966
01:43:43,292 --> 01:43:45,283
(groaning, gasping)

1967
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:47,954
Officer down.

1968
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:49,123
Mechanical room.

1969
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,911
Omnicorp Building.

1970
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,116
OFFICER (over radio):
Roger that. EMS on the way.

1971
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:55,287
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1972
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:57,412
Nonfatal.

1973
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,662
Go. Go.

1974
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:03,415
PILOT: Omni-LZ Helo One
on approach to deck.

1975
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,491
(whirring, footsteps thudding)

1976
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,207
CO-PILOT:
What's that?

1977
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,309
- CO-PILOT: He's got a gun.
- PILOT: What?

1978
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:15,373
CO-PILOT:
Pull up! Pull up!

1979
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:21,292
What the hell's he doing?

1980
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:22,623
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1981
01:44:27,667 --> 01:44:29,203
Alex?

1982
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:30,202
Dad?

1983
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:32,033
(gasping)

1984
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:35,875
Clara, David.

1985
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,575
No, wait-wait-wait. Wait.

1986
01:44:38,667 --> 01:44:40,032
Get out of the way.

1987
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:42,036
- Alex, put down the gun.
- Clara,

1988
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,605
take David
and get out of the way now!

1989
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:46,744
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1990
01:44:46,833 --> 01:44:48,619
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1991
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:53,248
Are you here to cuff me?

1992
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,911
All right.

1993
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:57,204
Go ahead, cuff me.

1994
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:59,374
You can't.

1995
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:00,789
You're not programmed that way.

1996
01:45:00,917 --> 01:45:02,203
If you go against the program,

1997
01:45:02,292 --> 01:45:04,124
the entire system
shuts down, so...

1998
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,036
You don't even have a warrant.

1999
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:08,018
- We'll overlook this little...
- Get down on the ground and put

2000
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:10,143
- your hands behind your back.
- I-I'm just from Marketing.

2001
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:11,287
- Now!
- Okay, yep, yep, yep.

2002
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,573
Yep.

2003
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:14,059
Alex, we need
to work together here.

2004
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,074
Because I'm the only one

2005
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:18,750
with the technology
to keep you alive.

2006
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,908
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

2007
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,911
(whirring)

2008
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,708
- (clank)
- (groaning)

2009
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:28,198
All right.

2010
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,124
Weapon.

2011
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:31,869
Alex, honestly,

2012
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,414
I mean you no harm.

2013
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:34,703
If I wanted to,

2014
01:45:34,792 --> 01:45:36,374
I could have killed you
along time ago.

2015
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:38,018
I just aim this right
at your head and blow it off.

2016
01:45:38,042 --> 01:45:39,248
CLARA:
Sellars, please!

2017
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,536
Don't!

2018
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:41,976
I mean, if I wanted to,
I could just

2019
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,241
aim this at your little family,

2020
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:46,082
and I could just kill them too.

2021
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:47,893
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it,

2022
01:45:47,917 --> 01:45:49,783
because, let's face it...

2023
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,874
you're a robot.

2024
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:54,666
Do you understand that?

2025
01:45:58,167 --> 01:45:59,202
Alex...

2026
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,286
Dad!

2027
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,573
CLARA (whispering):
Baby.

2028
01:46:08,708 --> 01:46:10,699
(whirring)

2029
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,790
Hey...

2030
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:20,205
Hey... everything's
gonna be all right.

2031
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:21,744
(Clara and David crying)

2032
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,291

NOVAK:
There's still no word

2047
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:37,081
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

2048
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:40,535
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

2049
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,208
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

2050
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:46,455
But we have obtained
exclusive video

2051
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,073
taken by cell phone

2052
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,449
that shows the people of Detroit

2053
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:52,745
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

2054
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:55,242
sooner than they think.

2055
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:58,697
The real tragedy here is that

2056
01:48:58,792 --> 01:49:03,116
our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

2057
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:06,743
Now, I have no doubt
he was manipulated

2058
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,912
by our biased media

2059
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,205
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

2060
01:49:12,292 --> 01:49:16,411
I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.

2061
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:20,285
But I do believe
my research program is sound.

2062
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:23,165
What I did With it...

2063
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,207
...was wrong.

2064
01:49:26,292 --> 01:49:28,124
The fact that
this mother (bleep)

2065
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:32,073
Is not serving time
in some Federal penitentiary

2066
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:36,156
is a huge, hot, heaping pile
of horse (bleep)!

2067
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,457
Now I know some of you may think

2068
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:46,371
that this kind
of thinking is dangerous

2069
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:48,620
and these machines violate

2070
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,411
your civil liberties.

2071
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:54,365
Some of you even believe that
the use of these drones overseas

2072
01:49:54,458 --> 01:49:56,870
makes us the same kind

2073
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,790
of bullying imperialists

2074
01:49:58,917 --> 01:50:02,239
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

2075
01:50:02,375 --> 01:50:05,208
To you, I say,

2076
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:08,743
stop whining!

2077
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:11,913
America is now,

2078
