00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,912

(insects trilling)

00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,152
HAINES (on radio):
<i>Picket One, copy.</i>

6
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,778
<i>Do you got eyes</i>
<i>on the hostages?</i>

7
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,363
Still negative.

8
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,907
DUPREE (on radio): <i>20 bucks</i>
<i>says they don't show.</i>

9
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,742
You two morons
really making bets

10
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,620
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

11
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,580
DUPREE: <i>Abso-fucking-lutely.</i>

12
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,039
HAINES: <i>I believe</i>
<i>that was implied. Yeah.</i>

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,916
Just checking. I'm in for 20.

14
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,978
(indistinct chatter)

15
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,313
QUINN: I got two hostages.

16
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,444
No crosswind.

17
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,906
I'm not waiting. 10-50, out.

18
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,204
(spaceship whirring)

19
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,084

-(groans)

20
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,014

23
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,743
(radio beeps)

24
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,578
Bluebill Two,
are you out there?

25
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,247
Over.

26
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,390
(engine slowly powering down)

27
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,021
-(rustling)
-(gasps)

28
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,732
Goddamn it!

29
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,193
Dupree, Jesus!

30
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,071
(pants) Where's Haines?

31
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,948
Don't know.
Comm's not fucking working.

32
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,117
Give me the pack.

33
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,790
It's evidence.

34
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,834
Ain't nobody
gonna believe this one.

35
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,716
The fuck is that, Cap?

36
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,219
It's above our pay grade.

37
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,556
-(radio beeps)
-Haines! Come in. Over.

38
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,183
(grunts)

39
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,687
Haines, goddamn it,
come in. Over! (echoes)

40
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,607
(clicking sound)

41
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,733
Sir?

42
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,818
(quiet crackling)

43
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,528
PREDATOR (distorted voice):
The fuck is that, Cap?

44
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,654
The fuck is that, Cap?

45
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,198
Comm's not fucking working.

46
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,620
-(birds squawking)
-(gasps)

47
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,666
Haines?

48
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,921
Light it up!

49
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,881
(gun firing)

50
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,429

(indistinct radio chatter)

61
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,742
Gentlemen, remember...

62
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,827
they're large, they're fast,

63
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,246
and fucking you up's
their idea of tourism!

64
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,040
Go!

65
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,833
SOLDIER: Eyes up! Come on!

66
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,336
I want the passenger.
I want the pod.

67
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,378
If it's not from here...

68
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,671
-You want it.
-...I want it.

69
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,683
(mariachi music playing)

70
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,809

71
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,441
(speaks Spanish)

72
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,199
(in English) I need help.

73
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,867
And I have money.

74
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,370
(speaks Spanish) Why should I
help a man with a gun, eh?

75
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,456
(in English) All right.

76
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,510
(gasps)

77
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,434
I need you
to mail this for me.

78
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,520
You send it to this address.

79
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,731
Mail what's in the pack,
not the backpack.

80
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>Ahora.</i> Go!

81
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,073
(sirens blaring in distance)

82
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,492
Okay.

83
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,792
-(thudding)
-(cops shouting indistinctly)

84
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,085
COP: Back up!

85
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,962
GIRL: It was so amazing!

86
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,463
Yeah, it was.

87
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,842
Bye, Mom!

88
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,159
(exclaims)

89
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,205
-(laughs) Do it, man.
-No, you do it.

90
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,415
Okay.

91
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,667
-Do it.
-(both laughing)

92
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,419
(alarm blaring)

93
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,214
(alarm continues blaring)

94
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,091
(whimpering)

95
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,473
(continues whimpering)

96
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,932
(both laughing)

97
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,518
Oh, shit.

98
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,022
Looky, looky, loo.

99
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,649
Hey, EJ, you hungry?

100
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,151
I'm hungry for an ass-burger.

101
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,694
Mmm. Sounds delicious.

102
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,072
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

103
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,324
-EJ: Oh, yeah.
-(whimpering)

104
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,744
The hell are you doing?

105
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,039
-DEREK: He's a goner.
-All right.

106
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,552
-(dog barking)
-(gasps)

107
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,517
(door closes)

108
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,987
(doorbell rings)

109
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,952
Hi, there.

110
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,371
Does, uh, Quinn McKenna
live here?

111
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,624
His post office box payments
are past due.

112
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,711
Department of Defense.

113
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,046
He works for the government,
does he?

114
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,592
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

115
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,927
Military designation.

116
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,555
-Ah.
-He kills people...

117
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,475
so you can be a mailman.

118
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,609
(dogs barking)

119
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,198
Dr. Brackett?

120
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,249
I understand
you enjoy stargazing?

121
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,462
My men
will take care of your dog.

122
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
Will you come with me, please?

123
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,518
What am I looking at?

124
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,313
It's exactly
what you think it is. Yeah.

125
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,400
They've been here before.

126
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,778
'87. '97.

127
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,534
Lately, the visits
are increasing in frequency.

128
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,381
EMILY: Rory, I'm home!
Hey, I got you something.

129
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Hey.

130
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,097
Did you do
one of these after school?

131
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,723
I did all of them.

132
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,101
Oh. Okay.

133
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,063
Well, I got you two options.

134
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,399
We have...

135
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,193
pirate, or...

136
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,697
Frankenstein.

137
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,951
Frankenstein,
you know, green skin?

138
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,370
Threw a girl
to see if she would float?

139
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,498
No. Okay.

140
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, let's go with pirate.
Yeah?

141
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,544
This is dumb.

142
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,630
The guys will...

143
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,049
They will still
be able to see.

144
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,468
See what?

145
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,470
That it's me.

146
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,100
PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once
quoted as saying,

147
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,227
"I dropped
from my mother's womb...

148
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,229
I hit the floor...

149
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,981
and I started crawling

150
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,400
through hostile territory
toward my grave."

151
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,402
(laughing)

152
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,778
QUINN: <i>About right, yeah.</i>

153
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,780
-That's badass.
-It's pretty morbid.

154
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,032
It's pretty dark.

155
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,535
What's with the polygraph?

156
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,912
I thought
this was a psych eval.

157
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,247
We need to know
if you pose a threat.

158
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,582
Oh, I'm a sniper.

159
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,501
Isn't posing a threat
kind of the fucking point?

160
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,380
You spend most of your time
now in-country...

161
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,758
estranged from your wife
and son?

162
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,346
(sighs)

163
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,098
Look, I get it.

164
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,894
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

165
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:37,937
Excuse me?

166
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,689
You're not here
to find out if I'm crazy.

167
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,275
You wanna make sure
the label sticks.

168
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,944
So, you feel
you're being railroaded?

169
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,488
I can see the tracks
on the floor!

170
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,908
I don't see tracks
on the floor, for the record.

171
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,826
You feel
like you're a stranger

172
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,328
on your own planet,
don't you, Captain?

173
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,165
Like an alien, you mean?

174
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,087
That's what you wanted.

175
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>Do I get a cookie now?</i>

176
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,759
He saw something.

177
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,927
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

178
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,932
Wow!

179
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,696
Ow.

180
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,122
(beeps)

181
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,635
(device trilling)

182
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,434
(exhales deeply)

183
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,979
You shove me again,
I'm gonna break your neck.

184
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,148
Did I say that out loud?

185
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,112
-(Quinn clears throat)
-McKenna.

186
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,991
OFFICER: Last one.

187
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,659
Thanks for your kindness.
Thank you.

188
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,625
(sighs)

189
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,128
(keys jangling)

190
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,470
Oh, yeah?

191
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,307
(Baxley mumbles)

192
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,060
(clicks and sniffs)

193
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,104
You all right over there?

194
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,939
No, don't worry about him.
He's just got Tourettes.

195
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,941
-He can't control it.
-Fuck you, Coyle.

196
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,526
You get used to it, bro.

197
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,366
Welcome to Group Two.

198
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,826
Oh, yeah? What's that?

199
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,993
Like a unit?

200
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,787
No, group. Group Two.

201
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,747
Group therapy, room two.

202
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,999
Oh.

203
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,751
-McKenna.
-Nebraska Williams.

204
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,919
That's your real name?

205
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,129
Gaylord.

206
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,131
-That's a good call, then.
-Yeah, I thought so.

207
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,632
(chuckles)

208
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,008
Where did you serve?

209
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,511
Operation
Enduring Freedom, '03.

210
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,848
Went for the Taliban,
stayed for the opium.

211
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,933
(laughing)

212
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,229
That's Coyle.
Friendly fire incident.

213
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,190
Got turned around, fired
at one of his own vehicles.

214
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,609
Now, he tells jokes.

215
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
(Coyle clears throat)

216
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,988
-(thuds)
-(grunts) That's Lynch.

217
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,532
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

218
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,409
Entropy.

219
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,452
That's my game.

220
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,621
Things like to fall apart

221
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,790
and I... make it happen.

222
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,668
Just... Just like that.

223
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,087
-(gasping)
-Ooh! Wow! Oh.

224
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,965
-Hey.
-Hey. Don't.

225
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,968
Don't.

226
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,469
That's Nettles.

227
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,889
(stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.

228
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,891
Did three tours flying Hueys.

229
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,185
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?

230
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,853
Is it end times yet?

231
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,396
Yeah, laugh all you want.

232
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,481
But when you're standing at
attention before your Maker...

233
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,400
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

234
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,194
-(whistles)
-(laughter)

235
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,904
God makes shitty people.

236
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,572
Yeah.

237
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,824
I mean, why do you think
people make war?

238
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,326
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?

239
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,745
-Come on, Baxley!
-Because fuck-cock-cock!

240
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,830
-Because we fuck cock-cock?
-Yes, we fuck cocks.

241
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,123
That's it,
because we fuck cocks,

242
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,499
that's why. We get upset.

243
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,085
How'd you snag a ticket
on this shitmobile?

244
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,254
Put a bullet in a CO.

245
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,757
Any particular reason?

246
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,718
He was an asshole.

247
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,159
Keep your head down.

248
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,794
Here, throw this on.

249
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,050
(bell rings)

250
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,929
Is it just your imagination?

251
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,432
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

252
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,227
Every fucking time?

253
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,521
(elevator dings)

254
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,606
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

255
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,235
<i>The GRC meeting has been moved</i>
<i>to section 3, room A.</i>

256
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,487
Aha! There you are!

257
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
Welcome.
I'm Sean Keyes.

258
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,910
Wow. I heard you basically
wrote the book

259
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,287
on evolutionary biology.

260
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,122
Um, I'm sorry, can I just...

261
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,498
Is that...?

262
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,752
Oh, my God!

263
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,798
(chuckles nervously)
Holy shit.

264
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,842
That's alien technology.

265
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,804
This is what
you brought me here to see?

266
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,181
KEYES: Well, yeah.

267
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,518
Can I... Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

268
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Doc.

269
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,688
Let's go.

270
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,982
(indistinct PA announcement)

271
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,328
-TRAEGER: <i>Everything good?</i>
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

272
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,747
TRAEGER: <i>What is it?</i>

273
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,833
<i>Dr. Brackett.</i>

274
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,169
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to meet a Predator?</i>

275
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,296
(chuckles) <i>Come on.</i>

276
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,139
WOMAN (on PA):
<i>Please observe</i>

277
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,058
<i>decontamination protocol.</i>

278
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,685
KEYES: So, how'd they
rope you into this?

279
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,146
I wrote a letter to
the president when I was six.

280
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,647
Told him how much
I loved animals,

281
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,274
and that if NASA
ever found a space animal,

282
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,776
they should call me.

283
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,737
Couple years ago,
I was put on a short list

284
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,655
for a paper
I wrote on hybrid strains.

285
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,326
Computer cross-referenced
the letter, and... here I am.

286
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,454
(machine whirring)

287
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,251
Dr. Brackett.

288
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,670
Thanks for coming.

289
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm sure you have questions.

290
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,966
-Oh. Just two, actually.
-Okay.

291
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,927
Why do you call it
"the Predator"?

292
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,179
It's a nickname.

293
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,682
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.

294
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,267
Exploits weakness.

295
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,977
Seems to...

296
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,646
well, enjoy it.

297
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,147
Like a game.

298
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,233
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.

299
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,192
Sorry?

300
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,611
A predator
kills its prey to survive.

301
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,490
I mean, what you're describing
is more like a bass fisherman.

302
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,534
Well, we took a vote.
Predator's cooler, right?

303
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,536
-SAPIR: Fuck yeah.
-Fuck yeah.

304
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,579
Found his escape pod
in Mexico.

305
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,415
Still looking
for the ship he came in.

306
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,708
He's heavily sedated.

307
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
You are
one beautiful motherfucker.

308
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,595
I'm gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?

309
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,934
Our test results yielded
something a little... odd.

310
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,312
(scoffs) Is this a joke?

311
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,065
KEYES: We ran the genome
sequence ten times.

312
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,984
This specimen has...

313
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,652
-Human DNA?
-Yeah.

314
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,862
Yeah.

315
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,781
Look, we know
about spontaneous speciation.

316
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,283
Mostly plants and insects,
but...

317
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,077
But some mammals,
sheep, goats, uh...

318
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,036
Yeah.

319
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,746
KEYES: The red wolf
is known to be a hybrid

320
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,039
between the coyote
and the grey wolf...

321
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,500
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

322
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,878
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

323
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,464
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?

324
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,884
Yeah.

325
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,597
Okay, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,

326
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,639
biohelmet, and...

327
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,100
What are these? Like,
some kind of wrist gauntlets?

328
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,226
Exactly.

329
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,937
So, where's the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

330
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,105
We've looked, believe me.

331
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,817
Who is this?

332
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,570
He made first contact
with the Predator.

333
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,405
Great.
I'd like to talk to him.

334
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,700
Well, he's
being evaluated, so...

335
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,121
Okay.

336
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,498
Well, before
you lobotomize him,

337
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,291
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.

338
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,170
MAN (on radio):
<i>We have a request to reroute.</i>

339
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,839
OFFICER: Read you
five-by-five. Destination?

340
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,925
<i>Starkweather Dam.</i>
<i>Proceed at once.</i>

341
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,927
<i>You'll be met</i>
<i>by military personnel. Over.</i>

342
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
COYLE: Hey, Baxley!

343
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,515
Question for ya.

344
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,933
All right, here we go.

345
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,101
How do you circumcise
a homeless man?

346
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,061
Here it comes.

347
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,188
Kick your mom in the chin.
(chuckles)

348
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,814
Fuck your mother...
Fuck your mother...

349
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,608
-(imitates barking)
-(laughter)

350
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,735
-Shut the fuck up!
-WILLIAMS: All right.

351
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,111
You shut the fuck up.

352
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,947
(laughter)

353
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,533
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Y'all going too fucking much.

354
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,701
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

355
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,161
Why are you here?

356
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,832
Come on, man,
this is the loony bus.

357
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,459
-Look at this motherfucker.
-LYNCH: Loonies!

358
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,794
Loonies, yeah. (ululates)

359
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,420
Ah... (sighs)

360
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,090
I had a run-in
with a space alien.

361
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,342
Oh, shit!

362
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,302
(all laughing)

363
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,595
-No, let him...
-COYLE: Okay, that guy wins.

364
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,972
That's the best story
I've ever heard.

365
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,973
Classic story...

366
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,016
That's the winner right there.
Fuckin' hell.

367
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,018
Would you shut the fuck up?

368
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,353
Oh.

369
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,524
They want to put a lid on it,

370
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,901
so here I am.

371
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,361
Stuck in Group Two.

372
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,530
The sequel to Group One,
only stupider.

373
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,699
Oh, huh.

374
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,994
(laughing)

375
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,287
NETTLES: Give this man
a fuckin' cigar.

376
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,371
Shut the fuck up.

377
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,290
"Would you shut the fuck up?"

378
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,750
(laughter continues)

379
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,003
COYLE: It's a conspiracy.

380
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,463
The goddamn space aliens, huh?

381
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,686
SENSORS ENGAGED

382
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,898

doing down there, Rory?

389
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,220
Uh, just... just playing games.

390
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,847
EMILY: Well,
dinner's getting cold.

391
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,807

392
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,852
Major?

393
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,771
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

394
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,149
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

395
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,109
GENERAL (sighs): Damn it.

396
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,236
We need something in the air.

397
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,738
Get me NORAD.

398
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,449
I feel like I'm missing
something in the research.

399
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,825
There's something
I'm just not seeing.

400
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,120
Look, if this is
the blood, okay, I think--

401
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,206
can you just tell me
what that is?

402
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,916
Because I was trying

403
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,751
to get into this earlier,
but somebody stopped me.

404
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,503
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

405
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,505
-That guy actually.
-KEYES: Hold that thought.

406
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,298
Sir, NORAD's reporting
a 202 anomaly

407
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,716
possibly heading
our direction.

408
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,218
Is it coming here?

409
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,177
God, I hope not.

00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,425
-Sorry.
-Move!

545
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,593
NETTLES: Damn.

546
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,179
Get to the choppers!

547
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,598
(moans)

548
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,456
SOLDIER: Stargazer, I got eyes
on the woman.

549
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,749
Instructions?

550
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,334
-TRAEGER:<i> Eliminate her.</i>
-Hey.

551
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,668
<i>Retrieve any contraband.</i>

552
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,337
SOLDIER:
Roger that, Stargazer.

553
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,762
(groans)

554
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,263
(groans)

555
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,349
That's it, that's it, girl.

556
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,184
Hey, Nebraska!

557
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,518
Got it.

558
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,359
(sirens blaring)

559
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,819
(thuds)

560
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,616
(men groaning)

561
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,037
Everything okay back there?

562
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,960
You fucking guys.

563
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,924
(clicking)

564
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,724
(growls)

565
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,735
(sniffs)

566
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,404
(growls)

567
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,823
-(laughing)
-(indistinct chatter)

568
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
COYLE: We found the one place
to hide out

569
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,330
where we don't look crazy.

570
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,875
(snoring)

571
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,130
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

572
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,423
What's it feel like?

573
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,426
Like a gun.

574
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,929
Hey, you think she's safe
in there with them?

575
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,764
The girl?

576
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,142
They're soldiers, man.

577
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,562
Sleeping ladies? Nah, bro.

578
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,648
Sit down.

579
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,945
Here.

580
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,282
It's the end of times, huh?

581
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,619
Worst thing
about the end times...

582
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,039
they never fucking are.

583
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,999
(chuckles)

584
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,126
So, um...

585
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,004
did he live?

586
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,422
Say again?

587
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,841
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

588
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,967
Ah.

589
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,219
Yeah. He did.

590
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,055
Yeah, and where is he at now?

591
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,602
You're shitting me.

592
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,895
I missed.

593
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,813
(Williams chuckles)

594
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,231
Why did you do that?

595
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,525
-Miss?
-No, shoot yourself.

596
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,778
Doctors asked me
the same thing.

597
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,074
Walked to the hospital with
a bullet in my skull.

598
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,618
-Good times.
-Hey.

599
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,704
Should I be worried?

600
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,214
Probably. (chuckles)

601
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
-NETTLES: There we go.
-COYLE: Did you get that?

602
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,801
-That's too close to her hand.
-NETTLES: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

603
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,010
But then
she's gonna drop that there.

604
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,428
Guys!

605
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,181
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

606
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,849
We're trying
to make her feel comfortable.

607
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,850
WILLIAMS: Come on.

608
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,602
She's gonna wake up and see

609
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,978
a bunch of motherfuckers.
Come on.

610
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,230
What are you doin'?

611
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,607
(whispers) Nettles! Nettles!

612
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,775
BOTH: Move!

613
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,943
WILLIAMS: Move!

614
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,444
QUINN: Get out of there!

615
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,043
Morning, sunshine.

616
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,712
(exhales)

617
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,550
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

618
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,136
COYLE: Chill, hey!

619
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,931
(laughs) I told you
she'd grab it. Ten bucks!

620
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,474
Pay up! Whoo!

621
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,518
-Fuck it, fuck it.
-(laughing)

622
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,562
-Where's my phone?
-You're not gonna need that.

623
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,980
(cocks gun)

624
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,023
COYLE: Oh, that's not cool.

625
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,108
It's okay.

626
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,026
I said it's okay.

627
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,237
Give me the gun.

628
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,197
-Give me the gun.
-No. No.

629
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,242
(gun clicks)

630
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,286
(all gasp)

631
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,538
WILLIAMS: Oh, she pulled...

632
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,708
Oh! Shit, I told you
she'd pull the trigger!

633
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,001
I should have bet you
that time!

634
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,210
WILLIAMS: I like her.
I like her.

635
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,378
I should have bet you
that time!

636
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,671
-I like her.
-NETTLES: I like her.

637
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,047
I like her. I like her a lot.

638
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,466
QUINN: Give me that,
ding-dong.

639
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,385
COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.

640
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,763
What? You're a scientist, huh?
What they got you working on?

641
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,683
You're not gonna last a day
out there!

642
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,604
What, you think you're special?

643
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,482
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

644
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,192
They were gonna shoot her?

645
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,359
Yes.

646
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

647
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,822
Get out of the way.
See you around.

648
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,659
(stutters) Eat your pussy.

649
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,328
Wait, what?

650
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,704
How you doing?

651
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,206
No, you just said,
"Eat your pussy."

652
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,290
Hey...

653
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,042
-How you doing?
-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

654
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,210
What the fuck
is wrong with him?

655
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,003
-I said you're pushy.
-He said you're pushy.

656
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,087
No, you said,
"Eat your pussy."

657
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,756
No. I said,
"Sheesh! You're pushy!"

658
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,090
CASEY: No, you said,
"Eat my pussy."

659
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,467
No, that's what he said,
I heard it.

660
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,177
-He said... pushy.
-What the fuck?

661
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,929
Which is also fucking rude.

662
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,388
He doesn't mean your pussy
in particular.

663
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,932
You're insane, right?

664
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,266
-Are you fucking insane?
-COYLE: Probably.

665
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,434
Well, what's it gonna be?

666
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,102
-BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy.
-NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.

667
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,229
BAXLEY: I feel fine.

668
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,022
CASEY: They were gonna
shoot me?

669
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,649
Why?

670
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,653
Uh, maybe 'cause of this?

671
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,992
Well, I guess I'm in.

672
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,912
Stay the fuck away from me.

673
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,625
What the fuck is this?

674
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,961
What is this?

675
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,463
-What is that? Like a unicorn?
-NETTLES: A unicorn.

676
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,965
-It's a unicorn.
-A unicorn.

677
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,758
I made a unicorn...

678
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,468
I'm sorry,
it's a piece of shit.

679
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,304
So, what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?

680
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,056
Uh, maybe staying alive?

681
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,474
We are soldiers.

682
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,767
We're the good guys, okay?

683
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,185
CASEY: Well, that's debatable.

684
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,273
I read your file.
The guys in Mexico it killed?

685
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,440
They yours?

686
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,401
They're gonna need
a patsy for that.

687
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,652
You're looking at him.

688
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,112
Yeah, I figured.

689
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,573
Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's
actually kind of perfect.

690
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,991
How about you telling us

691
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,909
what you were doing
in a secret base.

692
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,912
Surrounded by
trained soldiers. Mercs.

693
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,126
I'm a biologist, and they have
me on call in case there's...

694
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,170
contact.

695
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,840
What did I tell you?

696
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,675
End days. End days.

697
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,302
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

698
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
I'm gonna set you on fire.

699
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,138
Guys, if we wanna
keep breathing,

700
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,764
we need to find this thing.

701
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,057
Expose it.

702
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,226
It's called the Predator.

703
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,228
It hunts people for sport.

704
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,564
Technically, that's not
a predator. That's like...

705
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,648
Thank you.

706
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,191
-It's a hunter.
-I said the same thing.

707
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,860
NETTLES: A sportsman,
or a hunter, or a fisherman.

708
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
COYLE: Well, look at you...

709
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,196
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

710
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,657
Equipment. Weapons.

711
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,578
I took its gear.

712
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,538
What?

713
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,873
You took something
from the thing?

714
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,750
-What?
-So, I'd have evidence.

715
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,878
I think I know
where it's going.

716
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,342
(whirring)

717
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,702
(growls)

718
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,621
What?

719
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,425
(indistinct chattering)

720
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,766
(door opens)

721
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,063
Oh, hi, honey, you're home.

722
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
-I'm looking for a package.
-A package?

723
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,109
Rory!

724
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,902
Hey! This is
not your house anymore!

725
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,237
QUINN: Rory!

726
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,989
Hey, buddy. Where are ya?

727
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,866
He's not here.

728
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,535
What do you mean,
he's not here?

729
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,037
Oh, shit!

730
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,956
What? So we
ordered some video games.

731
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,958
No! No! No!

732
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,252
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

733
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,003
was so
I didn't put you in danger.

734
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,714
Goddamn it,
we need to find him.

735
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,965
Wait, Quinn,
you're scaring me now.

736
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,675
(footsteps)

737
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,886
(indistinct chatter)

738
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,268
I specifically said

739
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,061
no first-person shooter.
No combat games.

740
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,855
Did you ever think that
maybe he plays them

741
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,981
to connect with his father?

742
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,274
Oh, my God.
We're doing this again.

743
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,067
Hey! Can you
stop taking all my...

744
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,654
Who are these people
in my house?

745
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,740
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

746
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,199
Good evening.

747
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,784
Uh, the brushstrokes on this

748
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,453
are really dynamic.
It's a wonderful piece.

749
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,079
Okay, you need
to put that down.

750
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,039
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

751
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,499
They're my unit.
They're soldiers.

752
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,002
Marines. There's his unit.
(laughing)

753
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,503
Hi. You seem like
a really nice...

754
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,255
Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

755
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,549
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

756
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,551
What happened
to Haines and Dupree?

757
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,928
They're dead.

758
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,972
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

759
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,390
What are you talking about?

760
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,558
There's something out there.

761
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,436
It tore my friends apart.
What is it?

762
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,437
(Coyle stuttering)

763
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,606
Like, it's a creature.
Seriously, it's not a person.

764
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,648
Like from the Bible.

765
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,442
-Revelations.
-From the Bible?

766
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,402
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

767
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,403
It's a space alien.

768
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,447
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

769
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,157
It's like
an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

770
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,326
Oh, shit!

771
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,827
Shit.

772
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,120
I want a grid search.

773
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,371
Three teams.

774
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,915
(men exclaiming)

775
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:33,999
Hey!

776
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,835
-No.
-No, no, I'm coming with you.

777
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,212
QUINN: No, nix that.

778
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,463
(gun cocking)

779
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,048
(Quinn clears throat)

780
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,967
Is there a problem?

781
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,054
Thing is, we're
kind of moving targets.

782
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,556
Yeah, in case you haven't
noticed, we're fugitives.

783
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,517
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?

784
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,101
I get it. Fine,
stay here and watch TV.

785
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,271
You know what? If you try
to split? Or draw the Feds?

786
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,606
Or if you jeopardize my son

787
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,858
by your half-assed
yardbird bullshit...

788
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,485
I will come back here,
and I will happily

789
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,278
kill every single
fucking one of you.

790
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,161
WILLIAMS: Come on,
brothers. Let's go.

791
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,038
(door closes)

792
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,040
Seriously?

793
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,959
It's not our fight.

794
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,757
Is your husband
the man I think he is?

795
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,884
Excuse me?

796
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,178
Tell me
about your husband, please?

797
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,099
He's a security
counter-sniper.

798
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,517
-Mmm.
-Army Rangers.

799
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,811
He supervised

800
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,522
23 close precision engagements
across five continents

801
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,024
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

802
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,278
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,

803
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,196
to ever receive
a Distinguished Service Medal

804
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,406
and the Silver Star.

805
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,200
So, he might be
a lousy husband,

806
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,743
but he is a good soldier.

807
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,582
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.

808
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,125
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ.

809
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,418
That's what I thought.

810
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,587
Fucking pussies.

811
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,173
(door opens and closes)

812
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,466
Where you going, Nettles?

813
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,929
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

814
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,349
But... he called me a pussy

815
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,393
and nobody
calls me a pussy, so...

816
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,978
-Fuck off, pussy.
-Okay...

817
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,313
(clears throat)

818
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,192
Come on, Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

819
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,737
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.

820
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,117
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move.

821
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,118
Hey!

822
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,286
You too, lucky charms.

823
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,454
LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.

824
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,957
I'd like to watch TV

825
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,250
-with you sometime.
-Okay.

826
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,418
I liked your speech.

827
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,836
BAXLEY: I liked the couch.

828
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,798
Whoa, what's happening? What?

829
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,509
Well, we're finding my son,
that's what.

830
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,803
All right,
when all this is over...

831
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,056
Fuck me in the face
with an aardvark.

832
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,265
(groaning)

833
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,352
I just want to be famous.

834
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,353
LYNCH: Ostensibly,

835
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,021
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

836
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,522
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.

837
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,191
COYLE: You're using
"ostensibly" incorrectly.

838
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,275
Is this for me?

839
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,902
This is like the reverse
of a clown car.

840
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,278
All right, Nebraska,

841
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,655
let's find some wheels,
nothing flashy.

842
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,739
Copy.

843
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,533
All right. Find my son.

844
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,243
Casey, you're with me.

845
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,662
Let's go.

846
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,373
DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.

847
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,211
What are you supposed to be?

848
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,462
RORY: Leave me alone.

849
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,507
EJ: Or what? You'll wash our
hands five hundred times?

850
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,716
(snickers)

851
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,718
(doorbell rings)

852
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387
RORY: Trick or treat?

853
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,935
EJ: What's the matter, dude?

854
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,395
(chuckles)

855
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,146
Here's a treat,
you little shit.

856
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,815
-Oh!
-(laughs)

857
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,566
(helmet whirring)

858
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,530
(grunting)

859
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,952
(tires screeching)

860
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,666
(indistinct shouting)

861
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,127
-(horns honking)
-(alarms blaring)

862
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,052
(whimpering)

863
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,686
OFFICER (on radio):
<i>I got a male juvenile.</i>

864
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,146
<i>10 to 12 years old.</i>

865
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,480
<i>Metal cast on his arm.</i>

866
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,648
Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?

867
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,191
OFFICER:
<i>Ran right in front of my car.</i>

868
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,277
<i>Moving east on Woodruff.</i>

869
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,446
<i>Repeat, moving</i>
<i>east on Woodruff.</i>

870
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,909
(sirens wailing in distance)

871
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,537
(panting)

872
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,539
Nebraska, you got wheels?

873
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,624
WILLIAMS: <i>Yeah, I got wheels.</i>
<i>Something flashy.</i>

874
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,670
Listen, the kid's spooked,
he's rabbiting.

875
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,548
Where's he headed?
Where's some place he knows?

876
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,303
(faint growl)

877
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,684
(whimpering)

878
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,528
(whimpers)

879
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,417
(snarling)

880
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,673
(dog barking)

881
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,425
(creature hissing)

882
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,813
There he is.

883
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,070
Dad!

884
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,617
How you doing, buddy, huh?

885
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,827
I'm good.

886
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,375
(grunts)

887
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,254
(grunts)

888
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,132
-Move! Move!
-(gasps)

889
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,843
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

890
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,682
(roars)

891
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,517
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

892
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,644
BAXLEY: Oh, shit!

893
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,772
(snarling)

894
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:32,941
(grunts)

895
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,778
(roars)

896
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,113
WILLIAMS: McKenna!

897
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,197
(grunts)

898
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,993
NETTLES: Take cover!
Take cover!

899
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,369
(growls)

900
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,666

Maybe, like, sensor receptors.

909
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,790
Kind of like cat whiskers.

910

Whoa! What the--
I'm getting a sample.

911
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,170
It's a fucking space dog.

I was naked and unarmed,

I know what it is.
Our big boy's a hunter.

1049
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,262
He brought his dogs with him.

She's doing fine.

1078
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,249
Mom says you're a killer.

1079
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,087
-Well, I'm a soldier.
-(Williams clears throat)

1080
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,838
What's the difference?

1081
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,635
Well, when you like it,

1082
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,470
that's when you're a killer.

1083
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,599
-(sniffles)
-Are you good?

1084
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,520
Sorry I never grew up.

1085
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,315
You know...
the way you wanted.

1086
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,572
Tell you a secret.

1087
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,118
Truth is, kid,

1088
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,121
I never grew up
the way I wanted.

1089
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,127
(sighs)
Are we gonna get killed?

1090
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,336
(grunts softly)

1091
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,257
Nope.

1092
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,593
Come on.
(clears throat) Get up.

1093
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,971
I'm single.
I don't know if you knew that.

1094
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,056
No, I could tell
that you're single.

1095
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,309
We got so much stuff
in common, you know...

1096
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,271
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

1097
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,273
-Shit.
-What?

1098
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,817
This is more than spinal fluid.

1099
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:18,901
What does that mean?

1100
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,319
If I'm right,

1101
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,573
they're trying
to upgrade themselves.

1102
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,116
McKenna, I got something.

1103
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,118
I think I know
what they're up to

1104
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,453
on Predator World these days.

1105
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,706
You see this? They found this
in the Predator's plexus.

1106
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,082
So, remember how I told you

1107
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,584
how they take
people's spines, right?

1108
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,544
Yeah, for trophies.

1109
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,046
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,

1110
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:42,008
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

1111
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,384
Collecting survival traits

1112
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,844
from the most
high-end specimens.

1113
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,305
I think they're
attempting hybridization.

1114
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,391
You're just pulling this
out of your ass.

1115
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,435
Did you not see
the new Predator?

1116
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,396
It's evolving.

1117
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,064
Or being upgraded.

1118
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,907
QUINN: That little boy

1119
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,117
managed to figure out
alien technology.

1120
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,204
You know,
a lot of experts say that

1121
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,414
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.

1122
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,292
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

1123
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,586
NETTLES: Hey, yo!
What the fuck?

1124
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,754
Get the fuck away from me!

1125
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,714
Yo! Casey! (whistling)

1126
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,008
QUINN: Casey, get inside.

1127
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,802
Casey!

1128
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,346
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

1129
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,847
Casey! Look.

1130
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,016
I think this thing's
been following us, all right?

1131
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,727
-Move, Netty!
-Hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,521
-Space dog!
-Move, Netty!

1133
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,897
(whimpers)

1134
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,692
Fuck that.

1135
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,277
Hey! You had
your fucking chance.

1136
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,654
(creature whines)

1137
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,240
Look, I'm just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

1138
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,200
You know, maybe we can
use it, or something?

1139
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,244
Okay, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

1140
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,538
We're gonna study it. That's
what we're gonna do with it.

1141
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,122
What's to learn?
Except Williams sucks

1142
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,541
at shooting shit in the head.

1143
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,417
Williams, you lobotomized him.
(chuckles)

1144
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,837
Okay, new rule.
No one shoots my fucking dog.

1145
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:01,921
(creature growls)

1146
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,214
BAXLEY: There it is.
It's official.

1147
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,841
You were right,
we can use this.

1148
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,054
BAXLEY: Shit.

1149
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,848
COYLE: Netty, what is that?

1150
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,476
WILLIAMS:
Everybody, tighten up.

1151
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,270
-Little man, come here.
-NETTLES: That's an EC-130.

1152
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,437
That's not civilian.

1153
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,522
Hey, hey, hey!

1154
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,899
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

1155
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,109
WILLIAMS: There you go.

1156
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,945
Do you wanna help? Go get
a helicopter and some pyro.

1157
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,905
All right! On me!

1158
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,198
Now go!

1159
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,534
-Casey! I'll be right back!
-No, you won't.

1160
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,369
Hold on. Hey. See this?

1161
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,705
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

1162
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,582
-Fetch!
-(creature huffing)

1163
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,879
(coughing)

1164
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,189
Where is it?

1165
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,441
Where's what?

1166
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,776
The device.

1167
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,529
It goes, right in here.

1168
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,324
(grunting)

1169
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,370
Okay, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.

1170
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,581
Why'd he come here? To Earth?

1171
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,917
The "Thing One",
as you called him,

1172
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,252
arrived in
a hijacked spacecraft.

1173
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,379
We think there's
something on it.

1174
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,381
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

1175
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,216
CASEY: Wait, enemies?

1176
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,719
Other Predators.
Like that big one.

1177
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,430
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?

1178
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,098
I'll help you find it.
We can analyze it...

1179
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,475
Shut the fuck up!

1180
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,605
Why are they here?

1181
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,401
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

1182
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,946
There was a run on Twinkies?

1183
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,073
Snapped up
from coast-to-coast.

1184
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,783
Get 'em while they still last.

1185
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,618
Remember?

1186
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,997
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?

1187
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,625
Two generations?

1188
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,710
One?

1189
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,712
CASEY: That's why their visits
are increasing?

1190
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,922
They're trying to snap up

1191
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,465
all of our best DNA
before we're gone.

1192
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,010
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.

1193
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,222
We're an endangered species,
and they know it.

1194
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,015
They thrive
in a hothouse environment.

1195
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,226
Maybe they want
to move into ours.

1196
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,353
And that dead Predator

1197
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,146
was bringing us
a way to stop them.

1198
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,649
(grunts)

1199
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,026
You've hidden this thing
before in the mail.

1200
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,194
(groans)

1201
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,904
So, where is it this time?

1202
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,489
Your mother's ass.

1203
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,574
Wait, did I say that out loud?

1204
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,535
(grunts)

1205
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,373
Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no.
That is not for you.

1206
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,499
That is my son's,

1207
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,042
and you are violating
his privacy reading that.

1208
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,293
You both need
to leave right now.

1209
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,421
Ma'am, I don't wanna
restrain you.

1210
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,673
Really? Well,
why don't you try?

1211
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,718
(objects clattering)

1212
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,055
(footsteps running)

1213
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,980
(snarling)

1214
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,444
(yells)

1215
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:13,779
(gunshots)

1216
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,698
(snarling)

1217
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,246
(low growling)

1218
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,673
(speaking alien language)

1219
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,643
CRYPTOGRAPHER: <i>You haven't</i>
<i>found the spacecraft?</i>

1220
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,353
<i>Why are we trying</i>
<i>to crack the entry code?</i>

1221
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,397
SAPIR: Because when we do
find it, wouldn't it be great

1222
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,732
if we could
get into the fucking thing?

1223
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:50,983
What's that?

1224
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,902
A map.

1225
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,445
A map to what?

1226
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,655
CRYPTOGRAPHER:<i> ...give us</i>
<i>a clue of where this place is,</i>

1227
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,365
<i>maybe we can try</i>
<i>to get into it.</i>

1228
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,493
<i>But if you don't give us</i>
<i>anything, we can't get in!</i>

1229
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,044
(grunts)

1230
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,547
(whimpering)

1231
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,050
Hey, Rory, I'm Will.

1232
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,718
How you doing?

1233
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,137
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

1234
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,152
Golf tomorrow?

1235
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:36,612
Why not?

1236
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,323
You two never read
my file, did ya?

1237
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,075
What makes you say that?

1238
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,536
'Cause you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

1239
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,079
(laughing)

1240
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,288
The worst part is,

1241
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,624
you're making me lie to my son.

1242
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,710
What lie did you
tell him, hmm?

1243
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,505
That I won't enjoy this.

1244
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,341
(grunting)

1245
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,010
(screams)

1246
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,595
(mouthing)

1247
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,849
-(gun cocking)
-Hey, please, don't.

1248
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,643
Look, I don't know
what they told you...

1249
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,979
Can you just wait
for a second? Just wait!

1250
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,605
No, no, no!

1251
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,149
No.

1252
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,942
(grunting softly)

1253
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,156
-Jeez!
-(yipping)

1254
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,323
Oh, my God.

1255
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,580
(retches)

1256
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,503
(both grunting)

1257
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,310
(gasping)

1258
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,191
(grunting)

1259
01:09:58,652 --> 01:09:59,695
Nebraska!

1260
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,655
-Yeah?
-You just kill somebody?

1261
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,781
Well, he ain't well.

1262
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,074
Untie my friend.

1263
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,618
They got Rory. We gotta move.

1264
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,494
Shit, they rough you up?

1265
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,580
Did worse on myself,
back in the day.

1266
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,081
(grunting)

1267
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,750
What do you want to do
with this guy?

1268
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,213
Sorry, buddy,
that was a dumb question.

1269
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,547
Yeah, that was
a dumb question.

1270
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:20,966
(panting)

1271
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,640
(low growling)

1272
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,811
QUINN: Casey!

1273
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,900
Can I interest you in getting
the fuck out of here?

1274
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,444
"Getting the fuck out of here"
is my middle name.

1275
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,821
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1276
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:43,906
(Quinn groans)

1277
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,241
(stomach grumbling)

1278
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,493
What? What's wrong?

1279
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,745
(toilet flushing)

1280
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,748
Whew! All right.

1281
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,959
Hey! Just let me unpack this.

1282
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,752
You're saying my son's headed
towards a spaceship

1283
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,003
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1284
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,380
Uh, 11, actually.

1285
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,881
Used to be a contractor.

1286
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,633
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

1287
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,760
Meaning it's the Chinese menu
of DNA.

1288
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,804
Comprised of the deadliest
species in the entire...

1289
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,097
In the entire universe, yeah?

1290
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,556
-Galaxy.
-What?

1291
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,725
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1292
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,435
Why go universe? Just saying.

1293
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,437
(helicopter whirring)

1294
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,410
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1295
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,536
That's what you asked for?

1296
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,620
Yeah, that'll do.

1297
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,456
Saddle up!

1298
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,586
COYLE: It's the best
we could do, man.

1299
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:43,757
WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!

1300
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,050
That's it? Another one.

1301
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,218
QUINN: The other one!

1302
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,845
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1303
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,559
Figured something out.
I think we're gonna die.

1304
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,520
We're gonna go hunt and fight
the what, the army?

1305
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,938
COYLE: We're not gonna
fight the army...

1306
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,648
BAXLEY: And some
fucking people from space!

1307
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,191
You wanna talk survival, huh?

1308
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,735
Fine!

1309
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,945
You, yesterday,
you were on a prison bus

1310
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,155
barking to yourself,

1311
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,906
now you got a gun
in your hand.

1312
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,325
Who's a survivor now?

1313
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,578
We put bullets in our head

1314
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,121
and walk
to the fucking hospital.

1315
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:15,789
We're soldiers!

1316
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,751
Nettles, what's our 20?

1317
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,961
I can follow
your boy's chopper.

1318
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,296
I locked into its frequency.

1319
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:37,811
SOLDIER: Fence is hot!

1320
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,538
(indistinct radio chatter)

1321
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,124
What do you say, buddy?

1322
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,418
You think you can get us
in there?

1323
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,254
Because I'm not sure
that you can.

1324
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,090
Nice reverse psychology.

1325
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,008
I can do that, too.

1326
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,468
Don't go fuck yourself.

1327
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:11,887
(laughs)

1328
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,348
TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.

1329
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,975
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1330
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,060
TRAEGER: Right on.

1331
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,520
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1332
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:20,896
Been trying to figure out

1333
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,314
what these
bird-chirping motherfuckers

1334
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,649
been saying since '87.

1335
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,484
Gave the Harvard School
of Linguistics

1336
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,777
a billion-dollar grant.

1337
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:29,154
Voila. Watch your step,
come on.

1338
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,961
Goddamn, kid, I don't know
where you get it from.

1339
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,005
(trilling)

1340
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,365
TRAEGER: Put the translator
into the mainframe.

1341
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,616
Download everything.

1342
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,791
SAPIR: What the hell's
inside there?

1343
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,626
It's property
of Project Stargazer.

1344
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,753
That's what the fuck it is.
(laughs)

1345
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,340
OFFICER (on comms):
<i>Code three. Code three.</i>

1346
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,800
<i>We have motion</i>
<i>at the south fence line.</i>

1347
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,594
Send a fireteam
to check it out.

1348
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,054
That's my dad.
He's gonna come save me now.

1349
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:37,639
Oh, is he?

1350
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,309
Is that what he's gonna do?

1351
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:42,352
I'll tell you what, buddy...

1352
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,771
if it is your daddy,

1353
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,982
and I truly hope that it is...

1354
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,443
he's gotta be just about

1355
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,696
the dumbest motherfucker
I've ever met. (laughing)

1356
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,993
I mean, a Ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1357
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,453
He's gotta be...

1358
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,331
creating a diversion.

1359
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,874
It's a fucking diversion.

1360
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,334
(grunts)

1361
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,543
Oh, shit!

1362
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,086
Wow. Howdy.

1363
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,088
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1364
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,424
You took my boy, so yeah.

1365
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,134
Told you.

1366
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,053
Take this, son.

1367
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,014
You outta your mind? We
literally have you surrounded.

1368
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,516
That's why
you're coming with me.

1369
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,100
I just want the boy.
Nobody's got to die.

1370
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,060
Dad?

1371
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,980
From here forward.

1372
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,607
Don't look at the dead guy.

1373
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,289
(grunting)

1374
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,420
That was pretty good.

1375
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,672
You all right? Did I get you?

1376
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:52,756
No, I'm good.

1377
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:54,758
Welcome back.

1378
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,009
Fuck you. I never left.

1379
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,055
You open your mouth,

1380
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,890
I'm gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1381
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,225
Come on, just get behind me.

1382
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,310
SOLDIER (on radio):
<i>All units. They got Traeger.</i>

1383
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,436
<i>They got Traeger.</i>

1384
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,147
(softly) Let's go. Let's go.

1385
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,483
Just tell them
to put the guns down.

1386
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,286
Tell them!

1387
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,622
If Captain McKenna
doesn't lower his weapon

1388
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:26,665
in the next 10 seconds...

1389
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,584
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1390
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,085
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1391
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,588
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1392
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,339
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1393
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,382
10.

1394
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,759
Nine.

1395
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,469
Eight.

1396
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,847
Seven.

1397
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,391
Come on, you just give
the fucking word, man.

1398
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,475
TRAEGER: Six. Five.

1399
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,935
(predator clicking)

1400
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,562
(predator grunting)

1401
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,397
(grunts)

1402
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:52,733
(growling)

1403
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,693
(screaming)

1404
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,696
(yelling)

1405
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,242
-(distant yelling)
-Oh, shit!

1406
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,910
(grunting)

1407
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,120
Come on, son!

1408
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,664
(indistinct shouting)

1409
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:08,790
Take them down!

1410
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:15,922
Get down, sir.

1411
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:17,507
Let's go, son. Go!

1412
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,800
SOLDIER: Come on. Come on.

1413
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,391
Okay, take this. (spits)

1414
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:28,810
You wanna vanish,

1415
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,437
you really vanish, son,
you understand?

1416
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,106
All right, we're going home.
I promise you.

1417
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:39,655
(predator growls)

1418
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:43,992
It's here.

1419
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,209
-(predator growls)
-No! No! No!

1420
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,841
SOLDIER 2: Come on,
go around the end there!

1421
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,426
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1422
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:02,928
Move, move, move!

1423
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,513
-You got him?
-SOLDIER 3: Yeah!

1424
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,567
-(explosion)
-QUINN: Stay back.

1425
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,860
Get down! Get down!

1426
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:25,283
SOLDIER 4: Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1427
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,795
(low growling)

1428
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,131
(both panting quietly)

1429
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,437
-COYLE: Huh?
-All right.

1430
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,021
Hey, McKenna.

1431
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,941
Be reasonable. There's six
of you, seven of us.

1432
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,818
(grunts)

1433
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,069
Fuck!

1434
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,696
Who taught you math?

1435
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,990
You ain't the only
fucking sniper, white boy.

1436
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,077
You can walk away
from this, Captain.

1437
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:11,163
I just want the ship.

1438
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:13,415
-Dad, he's lying.
-Yeah.

1439
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,876
McKenna! I don't like this.

1440
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,586
What's he doing in there?

1441
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:20,922
(predator warbling)

1442
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,509
-(loud warbling)
-(feedback whines)

1443
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,305
(all groan)

1444
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,099
It's using the translator.

1445
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,312
PREDATOR (over speaker):
<i>Hello. I have enjoyed</i>

1446
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,022
<i>watching you kill each other.</i>

1447
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,816
<i>I came here</i>
<i>to destroy this vessel.</i>

1448
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,777
<i>You cannot have it.</i>

1449
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,112
<i>What you can do is run.</i>

1450
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,699
<i>I detect one among you</i>
<i>who is a true warrior.</i>

1451
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,035
<i>The one called McKenna.</i>

1452
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,371
<i>He will be your leader.</i>

1453
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,373
<i>He will be my prize.</i>

1454
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,626
<i>I offer time advantage.</i>

1455
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,586
<i>Go.</i>

1456
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,505
What the fuck
is time advantage?

1457
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:02,672
Like a head start?

1458
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,926
(alarm sounding)

1459
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,761
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1460
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,013
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1461
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,975
Hey!

1462
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:15,435
I'm coming out!

1463
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,112
We're in.

1464
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,406
-Baxley!
-Shit!

1465
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:30,659
Watch where the fuck you're
throwing, dickhead.

1466
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,118
-(vehicle engine stalling)
-Will do.

1467
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:35,205
Okay, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1468
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:36,957
-McKenna's the one he wants.
-TRAEGER: No, no, no!

1469
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,417
We stay together,
or it'll take us one by one.

1470
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,877
He's right. It's their MO.

1471
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,921
-Grow a dick, will you?
-SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!

1472
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:45,131
Son of a bitch. He must have
hacked the vehicles.

1473
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,551
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1474
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:48,635
-Got you.
-Hey?

1475
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:50,720
When this is over, you and me,
we're gonna dance.

1476
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:51,930
I got my shoes all picked out.

1477
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,014
All right.

1478
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:00,856
(soft growling)

1479
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,941
-Fuck.
-No, no, no! Don't.

1480
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,735
Here, boy. Fetch.

1481
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,280
-(creature barks)
-Here, boy. (whistles)

1482
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:09,447
Here you go.

1483
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,869
That was a valuable weapon.

1484
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,664
Let's go.
He'll be coming for us.

1485
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,333
(alarm blaring)

1486
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,901
(warbling)

1487
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:47,193
(device beeps)

1488
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,746
Give me the goody bag.

1489
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,833
Hey. On Halloween,
this blew up a whole house.

1490
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,585
-How do you shoot it?
-You don't.

1491
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,670
It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1492
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,297
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1493
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,550
(man coughing)

1494
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:13,595
(faint rustling)

1495
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,015
I heard something.

1496
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,309
TRAEGER: Hey, man.
That's Predator technology.

1497
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:21,519
Fuck.

1498
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,229
That-- It's gonna come back.

1499
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,106
You got, uh, a catcher
on the wrist.

1500
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:26,942
That's gonna come back.

1501
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,444
No!

1502
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,364
-(screaming)
-Quiet. Quiet.

1503
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,950
-Let me see. Let me see.
-My fucking hand.

1504
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,493
-Shit.
-My fucking hand.

1505
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,955
Gotta be quiet.

1506
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,252
(screaming)

1507
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,092
(predator warbles)

1508
01:22:58,807 --> 01:22:59,933
Moving!

1509
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,159
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1510
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:20,870
There's a clearing up ahead.

1511
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,331
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1512
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,083
Let's find it
and trap the motherfucker.

1513
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,627
You guys go set it up.
We'll lure him in.

1514
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,546
-Who?
-You and me.

1515
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:30,630
Yeah? All right.

1516
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,465
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1517
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:34,509
Come on.

1518
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,929
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1519
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,097
What's this "we" shit?

1520
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:40,598
What, are you gonna
live forever, Coyle?

1521
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,100
-Just calm down.
-COYLE: Calm down?

1522
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,061
Me, calm down?
Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.

1523
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,188
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1524
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,291
(owl hooting)

1525
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,212
-(indistinct animal croaking)
-Shit!

1526
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,091
Okay, fuck this.

1527
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,844
Hey! Asshole!

1528
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:19,387
What the fuck was that?

1529
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,097
COYLE: It's a chance for you
to survive.

1530
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:23,058
Go! I got this.

1531
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,226
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I've ever heard.

1532
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,318
Come and get us, asshole!

1533
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,571
Contact!

1534
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:38,031
-Alien!
-Contact!

1535
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,659
-Contact!
-Alien!

1536
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:42,786
-Contact!
-He's coming!

1537
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,210
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1538

Light him up!

(pained screeching)

1545
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,536
BAXLEY: Coyle!

1546
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:08,454
Bax, no!

1547
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,167

Oh, shit.

1557
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,869
Fuck.

I love you.

Hey! I'm the one you want.

No! No!

1577

He said he wanted me.

1578

He said he wanted me!

1579
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,660
No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1580
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:13,371
The next step
in the evolutionary chain.

1581
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,832
Not you. Your son.

01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,479
Guys! Something's coming!

1604
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,024
Go!

1605
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:07,944
(all grunting)

1606
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:13,574
Netty!

1607
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:15,868
(groans)

1608
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:19,956
(screams) Fuck!

1609
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,416
Netty!

1610
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,632
(coughing)

1611
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:32,218
QUINN: Hey, hey, hey.

1612
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:33,845
No, no, no! Bro!

1613
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:35,847
Bro.

1614
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,018
(engine whooshing)

1615
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,273
No.

1616
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,275
(laughs)

1617
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,778
(yelling)

1618
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:55,825
Fuck!

1619
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,929
(grunts)

1620
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,777
(growls)

1621
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,824
-(roars)
-(yells)

1622
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:40,203
(speaks alien language)

1623
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,099
(yelling)

1624
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:15,488
(panting)

1625
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,208
(grunting)

1626
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,568
Shit!

1627
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:01,784
Rory!

1628
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:05,454
(roars)

1629
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:09,292
(screeching)

1630
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:11,335
(growls)

1631
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,304
(predator growling)

1632
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:28,311
(speaks alien language)

1633
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,229
(grunting)

1634
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,483
(screams)

1635
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:35,860
(groans)

1636
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:39,905
(predator groans)

1637
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:46,954
-(growling)
-(gasps)

1638
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:50,666
(predator bellows)

1639
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,338
(screeches)

1640
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:57,840
(roars)

1641
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:00,176
Toss it!

1642
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,194
(beeping)

1643
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:19,278
(creature whines)

1644
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,824
(roars)

1645
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:45,054
(predator whimpers)

1646
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:55,272
What are you?

1647
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,316
(speaks alien language)

1648
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:58,442
Shut the fuck up.

1649
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:00,945
(gasps)

1650
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:20,339
My unit.

1651
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:23,884
Nettles.

1652
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:27,388
Coyle.

1653
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:31,684
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1654
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,188
Baxley had this
the whole time.

1655
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:40,943
Nebraska's bad habit.

1656
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:43,654
Son...

1657
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,198
these are the ones
that no one's gonna remember.

1658
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,659
Just us.

1659
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,120
What do you say
we put them to rest?

1660
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,328
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

1661
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,332
Captain McKenna.

1662
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,377
Hiroshi Yamada.

1663
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,379
-Sir.
-First things first.

1664
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,632
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1665
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:45,883
He loves it here.

1666
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:47,843
Yeah, he's something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1667
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:50,095
Well, I assume
that you know by now,

1668
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:53,057
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1669
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,100
-He brought something.
-Exactly.

1670
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:56,685
Now, you want
to hear the good news?

1671
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,230
The cargo survived.

1672
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:01,690
With some sort of fail-safe.

1673
01:37:01,857 --> 01:37:03,901
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1674
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:05,319
a pod escaped.

1675
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,946
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.

1676
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,617
It seems that our boy
wasn't taking any chances.

1677
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,245
He wanted us to have this.

1678
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,663
(door sliding open)

1679
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,042
(indistinct announcement)

1680
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,969
What is it again
you do here, exactly?

1681
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,389
He's the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.

1682
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:36,851
QUINN: Hey, kiddo.

1683
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,229
RORY: Pretty cool, huh?

1684
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:41,730
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1685
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,190
I'll make sure to tell Mom.

1686
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:48,112
So, this is his gift
to humankind?

1687
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:57,580
(static interference)

1688
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,044
-(electricity crackling)
-(woman screams)

1689
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:06,046
-MAN 1: Get back!
-MAN 2: Look out!

1690
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:07,631
MAN 3: Everyone, stand back!

1691
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:08,716
MAN 4: Stand back!
Clear the area!

1692
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,551
(pod hissing)

1693
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,344
(indistinct shouting)

1694
01:38:15,347 --> 01:38:17,099
Dad, the pod
sent me a message.

1695
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,729
-Rory, what's in that pod?
-Don't know!

1696
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,690
Oh, wow... Oh, shit!

1697
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,567
-It's got a name!
-Name? What name?

1698
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,694
I guess you'd call it,

1699
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,321
the Predator Killer.

1700
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,615
-QUINN: Get him out of here!
-Come with me. Let's go.

1701
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,910
SOLDIER 1: Get back.
Clear the area.

1702
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,077
SOLDIER 2: Eyes on it.

1703
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,065
(device trilling)

1704
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,362
Whatever it is,
it appears to be dormant.

1705
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:14,239
-I assume it needs to be...
-(women gasp)

1706
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:16,784
SOLDIER: Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.

1707
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:19,578
(gasps) Get it off!
Get it off me!

1708
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:21,914
(screaming)

1709
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,029
What the hell is that?

1710
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:56,073
That's my new suit, bubba.

1711
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:00,285
I hope they got it
in a 42 long.
