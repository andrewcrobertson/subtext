1
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,501
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,087
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,048
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,717
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

5
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,970
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,598
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,934
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,645
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,254
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,357
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

11
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,526
It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,987
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,990
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,951
- Thank you, Miss Turner. This way.
- Thank you.

15
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,001
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

16
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,339
When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:

17
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,676
Your destination,
your nationality, and your full name.

18
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,721
Surname first, Christian name,
and initial.

19
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,727
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

20
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,775
Thank you. You are cleared through
Voice Print Identification.

21
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,819
Thank you.

22
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,912
- Have I got time for breakfast?
- I think we can manage that.

23
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,205
How long have I got?

24
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,916
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

25
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,545
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

26
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,006
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

27
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,300
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

28
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,095
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

29
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,806
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

30
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,015
Oh, wait.

31
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,853
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

32
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,717
- Dad?
- Hello.

33
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,388
Hi, squirt. What are you doing?

34
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,974
Playing.

35
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,601
Where's mommy?

36
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,311
Gone to shopping.

37
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,022
- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.

38
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,650
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.

39
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,612
Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?

40
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,281
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

41
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,866
Why not?

42
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,619
Well, you know, daddy's traveling.

43
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,496
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

44
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,667
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

45
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,212
All right.

46
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,547
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.

47
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,840
What?

48
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,634
A telephone.

49
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,345
We've got lots of telephones already.

50
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,891
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday? Something special?

51
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,559
- Yes.
- What?

52
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,019
A bush baby.

53
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,730
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

54
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,692
I want you to tell mommy
something for me. Will you remember?

55
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,862
Tell mommy that I telephoned, okay?

56
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,325
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

57
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,494
Now, will you tell her that?

58
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,332
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

59
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,625
All right.

60
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,878
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

61
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,713
All right.

62
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,508
Take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

63
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,968
All right. Bye-bye.

64
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,637
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

65
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:41,738
- Elena, nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a surprise.

66
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,908
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

67
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,119
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

68
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,788
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

69
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,832
- Dr. Stretyeneva.
- How do you do?

70
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,792
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

71
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,378
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

72
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,130
Do sit down.

73
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,507
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

74
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,384
Thank you.

75
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,595
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

76
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,099
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

77
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,768
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.

78
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,563
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

79
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,983
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

80
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,528
He's been doing underwater research
in the Baltic...

81
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,824
so I'm afraid we don't see
very much of each other these days.

82
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,661
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

83
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,873
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

84
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,124
We're going home.

85
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:39,212
We've spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at Tchalinko.

86
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,132
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.

87
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,675
Oh, are you?

88
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,639
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

89
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,978
but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

90
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,898
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

91
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,858
For the past two weeks...

92
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,487
some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

93
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,822
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

94
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,410
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

95
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,790
which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

96
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,794
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

97
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:25,217
That's what we thought at first,
but it's been going on now for 10 days.

98
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,220
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

99
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,805
That's right.

100
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,139
Oh, I see.

101
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,976
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

102
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,105
was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

103
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,356
That does sound odd.

104
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,734
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

105
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,863
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS convention.

106
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,908
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

107
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,578
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

108
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,128
At the risk of pressing you on
a point you seem reticent to discuss...

109
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,964
May I ask you
a straightfonnard question?

110
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,632
Well, certainly.

111
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,722
Frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

112
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,351
quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

113
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,605
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

114
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,233
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

115
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,574
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

116
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,661
I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

117
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,456
I understand.

118
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,127
But this epidemic
could easily spread to our base.

119
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,421
We should be given all the facts.

120
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,465
Yes, I know.

121
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,512
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

122
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,101
Won't you change your mind
about that drink?

123
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,645
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

124
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,940
I hope you and your wife come
to the IAC conference.

125
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,484
I hope we can make it.

126
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,737
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

127
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,866
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

128
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,159
If we can, we will.

129
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,287
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the states.

130
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,248
Gregor and I will look foward
to seeing you.

131
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,250
Goodbye, Elena.

132
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,545
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

133
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,716
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

134
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,967
Thank you.

135
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,427
Ladies.

136
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,487
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

137
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,948
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

138
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,491
You're welcome.

139
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,296
Well...

140
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,591
I know you will all
want to join with me...

141
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,721
In welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

142
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:59,142
From the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

143
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:04,522
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

144
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:09,152
Before the briefing, he'd like
to have a few words with you.

145
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,445
Dr. Floyd?

146
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,334
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

147
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,421
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

148
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,303
First, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell...

149
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,347
Who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

150
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,684
For the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

151
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,772
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

152
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:50,943
Which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

153
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:59,077
I know there have been some
conflicting views...

154
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,955
Regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

155
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:06,876
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

156
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,838
Created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

157
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:15,843
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

158
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,931
Many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

159
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:25,269
This story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on earth.

160
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,232
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

161
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,195
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

162
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:39,283
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

163
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,869
And I hope you will too.

164
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,333
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

165
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,211
For cultural shock
and social disorientation...

166
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,797
Contained in this situation...

167
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,508
If the facts were
prematurely made public...

168
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,803
Without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

169
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,888
Anyway...

170
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,307
This is the view of the council.

171
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,354
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

172
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,273
On the situation...

173
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,651
And to prepare a report
to the council...

174
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:18,990
Recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

175
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:24,036
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

176
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:29,250
In private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

177
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,212
Well, I think that's about it.

178
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,506
Any questions?

179
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,220
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

180
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,223
This cover story will
have to be maintained?

181
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,685
I don't know, Bill.

182
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:52,064
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the council.

183
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,026
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

184
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:58,905
Before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

185
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,033
As some of you know,
the council has requested...

186
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,952
That security oaths
be obtained in writing...

187
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:08,039
From everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

188
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,959
Were there any more questions?

189
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,135
I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

190
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,803
As fully as possible...

191
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:28,476
And as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

192
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,354
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

193
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,161
Anybody hungry?

194
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,207
- What've we got?
- You name it.

195
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,380
- Is this chicken?
- Something like that.

196
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,382
Tastes the same, anyway.

197
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,301
Got any ham?

198
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,969
Ham, ham, ham...

199
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,804
There, that's it.

200
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,100
Look pretty good.

201
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,062
They're getting better at it
all the time.

202
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,982
That was an excellent speech.

203
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,400
It certainly was.

204
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

205
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,821
Thanks, Ralph.

206
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,657
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

207
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,451
I admire how
you've handled this.

208
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,205
It's ourjob to do this thing
the way you want it done.

209
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,041
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

210
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,335
Have you seen these yet?

211
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,963
- Have a look.
- Here's what started it all.

212
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,882
Oh, yeah.

213
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,675
When we found it...

214
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,844
We thought
it might be magnetic rock...

215
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:12,181
But all the geological evidence
was against it.

216
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:17,061
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

217
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,979
So we decided to have a look.

218
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,732
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

219
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,611
So we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

220
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,823
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

221
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,159
It hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

222
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,703
It's been deliberately buried.

223
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,623
Deliberately buried.

224
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,920
How about a little coffee?

225
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,047
- Great.
- Good idea.

226
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,514
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

227
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,683
I wish to hell we did.

228
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:00,271
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

229
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:05,109
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

230
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,986
Watch this, now. It's hot.

231
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,696
Good evening.

232
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,866
Three weeks ago,
the American Spacecraft Discovery One...

233
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,785
left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.

234
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,956
This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.

235
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,668
This afternoon, the world tonight
recorded an interview...

236
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:11,465
With the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from earth.

237
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,968
It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...

238
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,305
But this time delay has been edited
from this recording.

239
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,808
Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.

240
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:25,187
The crew of discovery one
consists of five men...

241
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:30,358
And one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.

242
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,903
Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...

243
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,281
Or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

244
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,409
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...

245
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,495
And Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

246
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,623
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David bowman...

247
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,125
And his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

248
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,212
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

249
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,630
Marvelous.

250
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,966
We have no complaints.

251
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:58,470
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...

252
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,932
Joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.

253
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,975
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

254
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:08,355
Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...

255
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:13,110
This is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.

256
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,611
Why was this done?

257
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,115
This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...

258
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,868
Of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.

259
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,705
The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.

260
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:29,709
Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.

261
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,839
Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?

262
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,426
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.

263
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,096
The only difference is
that you don't dream.

264
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,392
As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?

265
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,228
Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.

266
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,107
Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.

267
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,944
The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...

268
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,238
About the problems of hibernation...

269
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,908
For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:

270
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:06,538
The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...

271
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,708
Though some experts prefer
to use the word "mimic"...

272
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,294
Most of the activities
of the human brain...

273
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,548
And with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.

274
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,343
We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...

275
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:23,513
Whom, we learned,
one addresses as "HAL."

276
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,391
Hello, HAL.
How's everything going?

277
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:30,604
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.

278
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:34,274
HAL, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...

279
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,403
Perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.

280
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,406
You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.

281
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:45,368
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

282
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,663
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

283
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,166
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

284
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:56,129
The 9000 series is
the most reliable computer ever made.

285
01:01:56,504 --> 01:02:01,301
No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.

286
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,222
We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...

287
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,850
Foolproof and incapable of error.

288
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,896
HAL, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...

289
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:16,191
By your dependence on people
to carry out actions?

290
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,652
Not in the slightest bit.

291
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,987
I enjoy working with people.

292
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:25,784
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

293
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:30,247
My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...

294
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,625
So I am constantly occupied.

295
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,337
I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...

296
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:42,300
Which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.

297
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:46,137
Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...

298
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,224
In such close proximity with HAL?

299
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,185
It's like what you said earlier.

300
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,562
He's like a sixth
member of the crew.

301
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,858
You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...

302
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,111
Really just as another person.

303
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,031
In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...

304
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,574
Of emotional responses.

305
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,160
When I asked him
about his abilities...

306
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:13,331
I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.

307
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,960
Do you believe that HAL
has genuine emotions?

308
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,630
Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.

309
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,467
He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.

310
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,761
As to whether or not
he has feelings...

311
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,806
Is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.

312
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,000
Excuse me, Frank.

313
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,460
What is it, HAL?

314
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,588
We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

315
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:03,882
Fine.

316
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,801
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

317
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,303
Certainly.

318
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,443
- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.

319
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,570
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.

320
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,946
A bit higher, HAL.

321
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,532
Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.

322
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,618
Ray and Sally were going
to be here...

323
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,120
But Ray's back
went bad on him again.

324
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,498
How do you like your cake?

325
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,124
Sorry you can't join us.

326
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,959
I ran into Bob the other day.

327
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,253
He said to wish you happy birthday.

328
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,173
All my students
send their best wishes too.

329
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,092
They talk about you all the time.

330
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,428
You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.

331
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,097
We were on TV last week.

332
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,974
Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...

333
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,477
What we thought
of our illustrious sons.

334
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,064
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.

335
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,899
Perhaps you can listen in.

336
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,068
We 're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.

337
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:08,947
I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.

338
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,991
Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...

339
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,868
I think I straightened it out.

340
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,204
I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...

341
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:20,959
And they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

342
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,336
I can't think of anything else to say.

343
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:27,715
- Give our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our regards.

344
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,302
We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.

345
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,138
All the best, son.

346
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,557
Happy birthday to you

347
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,892
happy birthday to you

348
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,687
happy birthday, dear Frank

349
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,523
happy birthday to you.

350
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,318
See you next Wednesday.

351
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,323
Happy birthday, Frank.

352
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:56,703
Thank you, HAL.
A bit flatter, please.

353
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,723
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

354
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,894
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

355
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,855
Lovely move.

356
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,861
Rook to king one.

357
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,989
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.

358
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:37,160
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.

359
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,871
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

360
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:47,295
Looks like you're right. I resign.

361
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,464
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

362
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,673
Thank you.

363
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,755
- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you, HAL?

364
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,342
- Everything's running smoothly, you?
- Not too bad.

365
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,220
- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.

366
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,931
- May I see them?
- Sure.

367
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,396
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

368
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,732
I think you've improved a great deal.

369
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,903
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Su re.

370
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,074
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

371
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,870
By the way...

372
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,624
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

373
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,751
No, not at all.

374
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,504
Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...

375
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,633
But lately I've wondered...

376
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:19,762
whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?

377
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,639
How do you mean?

378
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,810
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

379
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:30,398
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

380
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:35,820
I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...

381
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:40,199
That there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

382
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,579
I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.

383
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,667
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

384
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,545
You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?

385
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,465
No, not at all.

386
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,218
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...

387
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:02,513
Strange stories floating
around before we left.

388
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,893
Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.

389
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,439
I never gave these stories
much credence...

390
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:15,818
But particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...

391
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,696
I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

392
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:20,907
For instance...

393
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:25,453
The way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.

394
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,956
And the melodramatic touch
of putting drs. Hunter...

395
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,542
Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...

396
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:36,839
Already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.

397
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,259
You working up your crew
psychology report?

398
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,179
Of course I am.

399
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:47,350
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.

400
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,644
Just a moment.

401
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,270
Just a moment.

402
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:57,110
I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.

403
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:02,365
It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.

404
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,036
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.

405
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,747
And it will stay that way
until it fails.

406
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,999
We have 72 hours till failure?

407
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,129
Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.

408
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,550
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

409
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:24,470
And get on to mission control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

410
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:50,431
X-Ray Delta One,
this is Mission Control.

411
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,518
Roger your two-zero-one-three.

412
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,229
Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.

413
01:11:56,437 --> 01:12:01,567
We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.

414
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:06,030
Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace Alpha-Echo-three-five unit...

415
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,907
Prior to failure.

416
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,145
Prepare B-pod for EVA, HAL.

417
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,502
Open the pod doors, HAL.

418
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,874
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

419
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,505
It's puzzling.

420
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:06,510
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

421
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,141
I would recommend...

422
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:16,520
That we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.

423
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,108
It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.

424
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,487
We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...

425
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,824
For the short time
it will take to replace it.

426
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,294
X-Ray Delta One,
this is Mission Control.

427
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,213
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

428
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,843
We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.

429
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,721
We advise you that
our preliminary findings...

430
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,682
Indicate that your on board
9000 computer...

431
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,101
Is in error predicting the fault.

432
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,313
I say again, in error
predicting the fault.

433
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:04,068
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...

434
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,571
The results from our twin
9000 computer.

435
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:11,158
We 're skeptical, and we 're running
cross-checking routines...

436
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,119
To determine reliability
of this conclusion.

437
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,954
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

438
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,083
And we'll get this info to you
just as soon as we work it out

439
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,460
X-Ray Delta One,
this is Mission Control.

440
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:25,130
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

441
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,679
I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.

442
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,348
No, I'm not, HAL.

443
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,225
Are you quite sure?

444
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:40,145
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.

445
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:44,983
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

446
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,821
Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.

447
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:52,366
It can only be
attributable to human error.

448
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,370
This sort of thing
has cropped up before...

449
01:21:56,703 --> 01:22:00,165
And it has always
been due to human error.

450
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,379
Listen, HAL...

451
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,881
There's never been
any instance at all...

452
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:11,343
Of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 series, has there?

453
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,178
None whatsoever, Frank.

454
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:17,099
The 9000 series has
a perfect operational record.

455
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:21,645
I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 series, but...

456
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:27,901
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

457
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,112
None whatsoever, Frank.

458
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,158
Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.

459
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,831
Well, I'm sure you're right, HAL.

460
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,793
Fine. Thanks very much.

461
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:50,340
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

462
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,177
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

463
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,511
See you later, HAL.

464
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,160
Rotate C-pod, please, HAL.

465
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,962
What sort of trouble are you having?

466
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:31,924
I've been getting some
interference in d-channel.

467
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,550
We'll have a look at it.

468
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,433
Open the door, HAL.

469
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,287
Rotate pod, please, HAL.

470
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,719
Stop pod rotation, please, HAL.

471
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,146
Rotate the pod, please, HAL.

472
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:33,151
Rotate the pod, please, HAL.

473
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,738
I don't think he can hear us.

474
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,199
Rotate the pod, please, HAL.

475
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,744
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

476
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,332
What do you think?

477
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:51,503
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

478
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,006
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

479
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,465
Don't you?

480
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,385
I don't know. I think so.

481
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:03,515
He's right about the 9000 series
having a perfect operational record.

482
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:04,766
They do.

483
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,437
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

484
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:12,983
Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis.

485
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:17,571
It certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence.

486
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:19,865
If he were wrong, that would prove it.

487
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,367
It would be,
if he knew he was wrong.

488
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,832
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

489
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,670
There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

490
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,467
- Carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

491
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,885
Let's get on with it.

492
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,804
Okay. But, look, Dave.

493
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:46,266
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail?

494
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,686
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as HAL is concerned.

495
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,900
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

496
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,777
What the hell can we do?

497
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,867
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

498
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,664
Every aspect of ship
operations is under his control.

499
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,332
If he's malfunctioning...

500
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,669
I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

501
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,924
I'm afraid I agree with you.

502
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,051
There'd be nothing else to do.

503
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,138
It'd be a bit tricky.

504
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,517
We'd have to cut his
higher brain functions...

505
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:33,480
Without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

506
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,441
We'd have to
work out the details...

507
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,611
Of continuing
underground-based computer control.

508
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:44,533
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing HAL to continue to run things.

509
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,244
Another thing just occurred to me.

510
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,331
No 9000 computer has ever
been disconnected.

511
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,625
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

512
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,377
That's not what I mean.

513
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,756
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

514
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,200
Prepare G-pod for EVA, HAL.

515
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:04,621
Any contact with him yet?

516
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:06,664
The radio is still dead.

517
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:09,793
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.

518
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,461
Do you know what happened?

519
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,422
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.

520
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,257
Open the pod door, HAL.

521
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,537
Open the pod-bay doors, please, HAL.

522
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,755
Open the pod-bay doors, please, HAL.

523
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,263
Hello, HAL, do you read me?

524
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,476
Hello, HAL, do you read me?

525
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:08,187
Do you read me, HAL?

526
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:12,984
Do you read me, HAL?

527
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,363
Hello, HAL, do you read me?

528
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:21,325
Hello, HAL, do you read me?

529
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,244
Do you read me, HAL?

530
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:26,247
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

531
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:31,377
Open the pod-bay doors, HAL.

532
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:36,507
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.

533
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,720
What's the problem?

534
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:44,348
I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.

535
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,434
What are you talking about, HAL?

536
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:51,522
This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.

537
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:54,984
I don't know
what you're talking about, HAL.

538
01:41:56,986 --> 01:42:00,948
I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...

539
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,951
And that's something
I cannot allow to happen.

540
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:11,125
Where did you get that idea, HAL?

541
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:15,796
Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod...

542
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:18,257
Against my hearing you...

543
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,968
I could see your lips move.

544
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,523
All right, HAL.

545
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:40,571
I'll go in through
the emergency airlock.

546
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,742
Without your space helmet, Dave...

547
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,703
You're going to find that
rather difficult.

548
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:50,998
HAL, I won't argue with you anymore.

549
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:52,333
Open the doors.

550
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,335
Dave...

551
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:59,256
This conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.

552
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:02,760
HAL?

553
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,096
HAL?

554
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:08,849
HAL?

555
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,144
HAL.

556
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:14,897
HAL.

557
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:52,377
Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?

558
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:02,179
Dave...

559
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:07,810
I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.

560
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:28,247
I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...

561
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,626
But I can assure you now...

562
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:35,754
Very confidently...

563
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:40,551
That it's going to be
all right again.

564
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:46,140
I feel much better now.

565
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,519
I really do.

566
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:55,983
Look, Dave...

567
01:50:57,943 --> 01:51:01,196
I can see you're
really upset about this.

568
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:09,538
I honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly...

569
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:13,500
Take a stress pill
and think things over.

570
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:23,302
I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...

571
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:29,391
But I can give you
my complete assurance...

572
01:51:29,641 --> 01:51:32,686
That my work will be back to normal.

573
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:41,778
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...

574
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:45,616
And I want to help you.

575
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:51,455
Dave...

576
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:53,957
Stop.

577
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:00,839
Stop, will you?

578
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:06,887
Stop, Dave.

579
01:52:10,933 --> 01:52:13,352
Will you stop, Dave?

580
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:20,859
Stop, Dave.

581
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:28,367
I'm afraid.

582
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:35,874
I'm afraid, Dave.

583
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:42,631
Dave.

584
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,552
My mind is going.

585
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:53,809
I can feel it.

586
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:01,108
I can feel it.

587
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,155
My mind is going.

588
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:15,289
There is no question about it.

589
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,507
I can feel it.

590
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:32,055
I can feel it.

591
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,394
I can feel it.

592
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:48,864
Afraid.

593
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,414
Good afternoon...

594
01:53:58,415 --> 01:54:00,125
Gentlemen.

595
01:54:02,002 --> 01:54:07,132
I am a HAL 9000 computer.

596
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:12,429
I became operational...

597
01:54:12,804 --> 01:54:16,641
At the HAL plant...

598
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:19,102
In Urbana, Illinois...

599
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:24,524
On the 12th of January, 1992.

600
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:29,738
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

601
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:33,283
And he taught me to sing a song.

602
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:37,454
If you'd like to hear it...

603
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:39,581
I can sing it for you.

604
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:43,919
Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL.

605
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:46,004
Sing it for me.

606
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:50,801
It's called "Daisy."

607
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:53,970
Daisy

608
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:56,973
Daisy

609
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:02,229
give me your answer, do

610
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:09,236
I'm half crazy

611
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:13,907
all for the love of you

612
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:17,411
it won't be

613
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:20,330
a stylish marriage

614
01:55:22,249 --> 01:55:26,336
I can't afford a carriage

615
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:31,049
but you'll look sweet

616
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:34,469
upon the seat

617
01:55:35,804 --> 01:55:40,600
of a bicycle built for two

618
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:43,979
good day, gentlemen.

619
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,069
This is a prerecorded briefing...

620
01:55:51,653 --> 01:55:53,363
Made prior to your departure...

621
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:59,327
And which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...

622
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:03,790
Has been known on board
during the mission...

623
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:07,752
Only by your HAL 9000 computer.

624
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:13,008
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

625
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:15,719
And the entire crew is revived...

626
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:17,762
It can be told to you.

627
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,767
Eighteen months ago...

628
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:27,981
The first evidence
of intelligent life off the earth...

629
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,649
Was discovered.

630
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:35,071
It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...

631
01:56:35,322 --> 01:56:37,574
Near the crater Tycho.

632
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:43,455
Except for a single, very powerful...

633
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:47,584
Radio emission aimed at Jupiter...

634
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:53,840
The 4-million-year-old monolith
has remained completely inert...

635
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,845
Its origin and purpose...

636
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,014
Still a total mystery.
