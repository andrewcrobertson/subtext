1
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,155
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,093
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,968
"l'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,408
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,271
You forget about it in a day or two.

6
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,023
The days of me forgetting are over. The
days of me remembering have just begun.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,285
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,227
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:54,613
Quack, quack, quack.

10
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,993
Take heart, 'cause you're
never gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:00,529
Since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,000
After tonight?

13
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,572
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,099
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

15
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,578
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:17,921
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'
the same risk as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,758
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

18
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:23,769
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,648
They're insured. 
Why should they give a fuck?

20
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,030
I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

21
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,373
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

22
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:34,787
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

23
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,009
"We got this guy's little girl.

24
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,523
If you don't give him all your money, 
we're gonna kill her."

25
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,309
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,159
That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead
walks into a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:47,356
Not a pistol, not a shotgun, 
a fuckin' phone.

28
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,809
Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.

29
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,884
Did they hurt the little girl?

30
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,793
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

31
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,831
The point of the story is 
they robbed a bank with a telephone.

32
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,575
You want to rob banks?

33
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:02,001
I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

34
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:04,478
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier 
than what we've been doing.

35
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:05,857
No more liquor stores?

36
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,530
What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

37
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:10,230
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.

38
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,049
There's too many foreigners-owned
liquor stores.

39
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,124
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

40
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:16,635
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,978
They make it too personal.

42
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,011
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers 
gonna make us kill him.

43
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,203
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

44
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:23,815
I don't want to either.

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,629
But they'll probably put us in 
a situation where it's us or them.

46
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,194
And if it's not the gooks,

47
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,481
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

48
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:35,916
You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

49
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,648
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

50
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,609
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

51
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:42,572
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

52
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,984
- Not in this life.
- What then?

53
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,840
Gar�on, coffee!

54
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,739
This place.

55
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,848
Gar�on means boy.

56
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:02,294
This place? A coffee shop?

57
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,200
What's wrong with that?

58
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,885
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?

59
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,360
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations;

60
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:15,741
you get your head blown off 
stickin' up one of them.

61
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:19,595
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

62
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:23,362
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

63
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:27,279
I bet you could cut down on
the hero factor in a place like this.

64
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,209
Correct.

65
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,489
Same as banks, these places are insured.

66
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,057
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

67
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,949
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

68
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:40,873
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

69
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:44,161
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour

70
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,778
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

71
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:50,016
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

72
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,526
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet,

73
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,849
the next minute, 
someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

74
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,363
See, I got the idea the last liquor store 
we stuck up, remember?

75
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:01,143
All the customers kept comin' in.

76
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,262
Yeah.

77
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:06,506
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

78
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,241
Thank you.

79
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,255
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,408
Yes, we did.

81
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,368
A lot of people
come to restaurants.

82
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:13,752
A lot of wallets.

83
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:15,761
Pretty smart, huh?

84
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,121
Pretty smart.

85
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,721
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

86
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,866
- Come on.
- All right.

87
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,304
Same as last time, remember?

88
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:30,024
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

89
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,604
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

90
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,164
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

91
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,351
Any of you fucking pricks move,

92
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,283
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

93
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,975
Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.

94
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,615
Okay, what you want to know?

95
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,619
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

96
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:18,021
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

97
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,223
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

98
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:23,913
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

99
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,380
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

100
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,812
And if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

101
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:34,221
It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't
matter, 'cause get a load of this.

102
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:38,650
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

103
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,336
I mean, that's a right 
the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

104
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,766
Oh, man! I'm goin'. That's all
there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

105
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,313
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

106
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,604
But you know what the funniest thing 
about Europe is?

107
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:51,498
What?

108
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:52,885
It's the little differences.

109
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,496
I mean, they got the same shit over there 
that they got here,

110
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:57,318
but it's just there, 
it's a little different.

111
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,466
Example.

112
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,946
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

113
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,744
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

114
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,469
And in Paris, 
you can buy a beer in McDonald's.

115
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:13,323
You know what they call 
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

116
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,643
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

117
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,539
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

118
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,470
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

119
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,500
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

120
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,162
What do they call a Big Mac?

121
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,133
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

122
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,609
Le Big Mac.

123
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:33,948
What do they call a Whopper?

124
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,092
I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

125
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:39,493
You know what they put on French fries 
in Holland instead of ketchup?

126
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,206
What?

127
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,097
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

128
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,089
I seen 'em do it, man. 
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.

129
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,262
Yuck.

130
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,991
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

131
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,093
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

132
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,746
That's countin' our guy?

133
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,591
Not sure.

134
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,599
So that means that it could be 
up to five guys up there?

135
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,800
It's possible.

136
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,326
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

137
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,789
- What's her name?
- Mia.

138
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,882
Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?

139
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:19,592
I don't know. However people meet
people. She used to be a actress.

140
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,110
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

141
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:25,149
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

142
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,725
Pilot? What's a pilot?

143
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,690
Well, you know the shows on TV?

144
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,201
I don't watch TV.

145
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,978
Yeah, but you are aware that 
there is an invention called television,

146
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:36,287
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

147
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,302
Yeah.

148
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:41,663
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

149
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,340
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows

150
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:47,551
and on the strength of that one show,
they decide if they wanna make more shows.

151
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:52,411
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

152
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,845
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

153
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,602
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

154
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:02,216
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror".

155
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,905
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

156
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,901
I wouldn't go so far as
to call the brother fat.

157
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,737
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

158
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,811
I think I know who you mean. 
What about him?

159
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,184
Marsellus fucked him up good.

160
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,151
Word 'round the campfire is it was
on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

161
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,179
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

162
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,167
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

163
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,362
A foot massage?

164
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,532
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,843
Then what'd Marsellus do?

166
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:45,370
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

167
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,231
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

168
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:53,321
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

169
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:55,613
Nigger fell through that.

170
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,576
Since then, he kind of developed 
a speech impediment.

171
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,204
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

172
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:10,923
But still, you play with matches, 
you get burned.

173
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,247
What do you mean?

174
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,847
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

175
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,889
You don't think he overreacted?

176
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:21,133
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react the way he did,

177
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:23,322
but he had to expect a reaction.

178
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:27,052
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

179
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:30,968
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

180
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,665
I mean, is it as bad
as eatin' her pussy out?

181
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,990
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

182
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,502
Whoa, stop right there.

183
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,486
Eatin' the bitch out and
givin' the bitch a foot massage

184
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,164
ain't even the same fucking thing.

185
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,991
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

186
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,947
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

187
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,878
But touchin' his wife's feet

188
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:53,294
and sticking your tongue in the holiest
of holies ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;

189
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,002
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

190
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,259
Foot massages don't mean shit!

191
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,196
Have you ever given a foot massage?

192
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,798
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
I'm the foot fuckin' master.

193
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,107
You given a lot of them?

194
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:09,730
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

195
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,536
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

196
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,768
Fuck you.

197
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,820
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

198
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,716
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.

199
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,986
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off. 
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

200
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,980
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

201
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,282
What time you got?

202
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,142
7:22 in the a.m.

203
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,731
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

204
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:53,228
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right

205
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:56,651
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

206
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,153
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

207
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,898
Motherfucker do that shit to me, 
he better paralyze my ass,

208
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,522
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

209
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,934
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' 
a massage don't mean nothin'.

210
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,512
I'm sayin' it does.

211
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,377
Now, look, I've given a million ladies 
a million foot massages,

212
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,129
and they all meant somethin'.

213
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:16,948
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

214
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,528
There's a sensuous thing goin' on
where you don't talk about it,

215
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,572
but you know it and she knows it.

216
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:26,877
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

217
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,725
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humor about this shit.

218
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,869
You know what I'm sayin'?

219
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,721
It's an interestin' point.

220
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,957
Come on. Let's get into character.

221
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,563
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

222
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,362
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

223
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,685
He's goin' out of town, Florida.

224
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,715
And he asked me if I'd take care of her 
while he's gone.

225
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:57,453
Take care of her?

226
00:13:57,477 --> 00:14:00,132
No, man. Just take her out.

227
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,241
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

228
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,204
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

229
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,024
It is not a date.

230
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:13,086
It's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

231
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:15,253
It's just good company, that's all.

232
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,230
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

233
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,793
Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?

234
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,625
Hey, keep chillin'.

235
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,174
You know who we are?

236
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:52,093
We're associates of your business partner, 
Marsellus Wallace.

237
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,794
You do remember your business partner, 
don't you?

238
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,863
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

239
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,328
You're Brett, right?

240
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:05,614
Yeah.

241
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,081
I thought so. You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?

242
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:13,709
Yeah, I remember.

243
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:17,772
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

244
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,423
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?

245
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:22,832
Hamburgers.

246
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:26,958
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

247
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,464
What kind of hamburgers?

248
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,539
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

249
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,966
Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's,
Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box? Where?

250
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,355
Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

251
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,465
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

252
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,470
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

253
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,887
They're- They're good.

254
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,783
You mind if I try one of yours?

255
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,499
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:06,052
Mmmm. This is a tasty burger!

257
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,242
Vincent!

258
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:09,342
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?

259
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,416
Want a bite? They're real tasty.

260
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:13,765
I ain't hungry.

261
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,485
Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

262
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,570
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

263
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,279
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

264
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:27,104
But I do love the taste of 
a good burger. Mmmm.

265
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:30,937
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?

266
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,948
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

267
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:37,515
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

268
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,669
You know why they call it that?

269
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:44,436
Uh, because of the metric system?

270
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,479
Check out the big brain on Brett!

271
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:52,188
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

272
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,772
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

273
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,156
Sprite. Good.

274
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:02,215
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

275
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,144
Go right ahead.

276
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,702
That hit the spot.

277
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,666
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

278
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,472
Why don't you tell my man Vince here 
where you got the shit hid.

279
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,488
It's over there-

280
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,001
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

281
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,036
You were sayin'?

282
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:38,648
It's in the cupboard.

283
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,050
N-No, the one by your k-knees.

284
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,742
We happy?

285
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,070
Vincent?

286
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,844
We happy?

287
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,217
Yeah, we happy.

288
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:19,829
Look, I'm sorry, uh, 
I-I didn't get your name.

289
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:23,031
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

290
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:26,674
My name's Pitt, and your ass 
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.

291
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,068
No, no, no.

292
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,388
I just want you to know how-

293
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,911
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up

294
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,803
with us and Mr. Wallace.

295
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,792
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never-

296
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,360
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

297
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,282
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

298
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:57,240
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions".

299
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,045
What's the matter?

300
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,445
Oh, you were finished!

301
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:05,175
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

302
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,770
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?

303
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:13,925
What?

304
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,478
What country you from?

305
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:17,356
Wh-What?

306
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:20,472
"What" ain't no country I ever heard of. 
They speak English in What?

307
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:21,846
What?

308
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,026
English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?

309
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,808
Yes!

310
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,421
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

311
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:30,005
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

312
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:32,816
- What? I-
- Say "what" again!

313
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:36,726
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

314
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,733
Say "what" one more goddamn time!

315
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:40,595
H-H-He's black.

316
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,613
Go on!

317
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,121
He's bald!

318
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,756
Does he look like a bitch?

319
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,799
What?

320
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,550
Does he look... like a bitch?

321
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:52,564
No!

322
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,459
Then why you tryin' to fuck him 
like a bitch?

323
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,376
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

324
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,163
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

325
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:05,301
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

326
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:07,717
You read the Bible, Brett?

327
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,295
Yes!

328
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,740
Well, there's this passage I got
memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.

329
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,488
Ezekiel 25:17.

330
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:21,800
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides

331
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:26,445
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

332
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:31,997
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

333
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,065
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

334
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,944
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

335
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:47,459
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger

336
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:51,890
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

337
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,217
And you will know My name is the Lord
when I lay My vengeance upon thee!"

338
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:22,242
I think you gonna find 
when all this shit is over and done,

339
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,899
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

340
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:36,314
The thing is, Butch...
right now you got ability.

341
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:43,462
But painful as it may be, 
ability don't last.

342
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,127
And your days are just about over.

343
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:52,911
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' 
fact of life.

344
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:58,120
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

345
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:05,572
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

346
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:10,741
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

347
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:16,239
If you mean it turns to vinegar... it does.

348
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:21,762
If you mean it gets better with age... 
it don't.

349
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,949
Besides, Butch,

350
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,771
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

351
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:31,900
Hmm?

352
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:34,084
Two?

353
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,573
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

354
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,542
You came close, but you never made it.

355
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,959
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

356
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,153
You my nigger?

357
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,358
Certainly appears so.

358
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,790
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

359
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,360
That's pride fuckin' with you.

360
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,776
Fuck pride!

361
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,748
Pride only hurts.

362
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:41,980
It never helps.

363
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,659
You fight through that shit.

364
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:52,209
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

365
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:56,824
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

366
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,369
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

367
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:07,209
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

368
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:12,688
Say it.

369
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,918
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

370
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:23,693
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

371
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:27,593
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

372
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,679
Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?

373
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,304
You don't even want to know.

374
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:35,460
Where's the big man?

375
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:37,988
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

376
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:42,703
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

377
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:47,202
How ya been?

378
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,705
I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

379
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,792
All right.

380
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,680
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

381
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,477
At Marsellus's request.

382
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,808
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

383
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:08,495
What's so fuckin' funny?

384
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,117
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

385
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:15,891
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

386
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,832
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

387
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:20,803
laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

388
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:23,662
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

389
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,236
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

390
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:27,863
Asshole.

391
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,588
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

392
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:38,620
No.

393
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,378
You lookin' at somethin', friend?

394
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,310
You ain't my friend, palooka.

395
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:49,804
What was that?

396
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,073
I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

397
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,558
Vincent Vega's in the house?

398
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:58,119
My nigger, get your ass over here.

399
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,383
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

400
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:10,868
You shouldn't worry about it.

401
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:13,929
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

402
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:17,892
And some matches.

403
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:23,191
Thanks.

404
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:29,922
It's as if it turns every part of
your body into the tip of a penis.

405
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,291
Whoa.

406
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,496
I'll lend it to you. 
It's a great book on piercing.

407
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:38,421
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

408
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:42,377
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

409
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:47,800
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

410
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:50,904
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

411
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:54,224
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

412
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:56,917
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

413
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:59,206
and I wear a stud in my tongue.

414
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,460
Excuse me.

415
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:06,467
I was just curious, but, um... why
would you wear a stud in your tongue?

416
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,163
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

417
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:13,698
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

418
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,003
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

419
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:27,149
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

420
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:30,112
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

421
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:34,713
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

422
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,994
But this one is a little more expensive.

423
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,028
This is 500 a gram.

424
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:43,873
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

425
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:47,998
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

426
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,127
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

427
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,646
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

428
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:57,848
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.

429
00:27:57,873 --> 00:28:01,039
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference

430
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:04,013
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

431
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,564
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit

432
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,324
any old day of the fuckin' week.

433
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,981
That's a bold statement.

434
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:14,572
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

435
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:18,921
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

436
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:22,080
Heroin, it's comin' back 
in a big fuckin' way.

437
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,763
All right. Gimme three grams of madman.

438
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:27,749
Okay.

439
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,177
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

440
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:33,402
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

441
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:38,105
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

442
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,870
That is what a nice guy I am.

443
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,391
I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?

444
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,512
Yeah, that's cool.

445
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,530
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

446
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:52,661
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

447
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:53,804
Okay.

448
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,734
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?

449
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,282
She ain't got a boyfriend. 
You wanna hang out and get high?

450
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,674
Which one's Trudi? The one
with all the shit in her face?

451
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:07,521
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

452
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,309
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

453
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,828
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

454
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:18,265
I'll take a rain check.

455
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:23,318
Thank you, Jody.

456
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:25,176
Still got your Malibu?

457
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:29,913
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

458
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,923
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

459
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:35,631
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

460
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,279
I had it in storage for three years.

461
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:42,561
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

462
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:46,850
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

463
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,808
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

464
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,266
It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.

465
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,567
What a fucker!

466
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,389
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

467
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:02,431
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

468
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:04,064
It's just against the rules.

469
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:05,092
Thank you.

470
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:06,331
Thank you.

471
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:10,225
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

472
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,775
Muchas gracias.

473
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,635
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. 
The door's open.

474
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,953
Come inside and make yourself a drink. Mia.

475
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,108
Hello?

476
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,878
Vincent.

477
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:26,602
Vincent.

478
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:29,220
I'm on the intercom.

479
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,952
Where is... Where is the intercom?

480
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:35,123
It's on the wall by 
the two African fellows.

481
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:36,933
To your right.

482
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:41,977
Warm.

483
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:44,377
Warmer.

484
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:46,324
Disco.

485
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,038
Hello?

486
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,990
Push the button if you want to talk.

487
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:54,841
Hello?

488
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,878
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

489
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,927
The bar's by the fireplace.

490
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,390
Okay.

491
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,490
Let's go.

492
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,016
What the fuck is this place?

493
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,758
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

494
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:25,037
An Elvis man should love it.

495
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:26,854
Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.

496
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,320
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

497
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:31,109
Don't be a...

498
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,683
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

499
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,802
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

500
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,820
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

501
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,996
- We reserved a car.
- Oh, a car.

502
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:09,095
Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

503
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:17,924
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

504
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,556
Fantastic job, Rick. Thank you very much.

505
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,936
Vincent!

506
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,852
Just to let you all know, Ricky will
be back in the second half of our show,

507
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:33,974
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

508
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,359
Thank you.

509
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:43,124
Call for Phillip Morris.

510
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,746
What do you think?

511
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,236
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

512
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:50,881
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?

513
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:57,407
Let's see, steak, steak, steak.

514
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:59,791
Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

515
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,492
I'll have that.

516
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:04,350
How do you want that cooked?
Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?

517
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:07,566
Bloody as hell, and... Oh, yeah, 
look at this... vanilla Coke.

518
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,127
What about you, Peggy Sue?

519
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:18,301
I'll have the...
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

520
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,033
And... a five-dollar shake.

521
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,746
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

522
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,086
Martin and Lewis.

523
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:29,905
Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

524
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:31,605
Mm-hmm.

525
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:34,721
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

526
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,425
Last I heard.

527
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,615
That's five dollars? 
You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?

528
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:40,861
No.

529
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:42,267
Just checking.

530
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:44,411
I'll be right back with your drinks.

531
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:56,489
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

532
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,676
You can have this one, cowgirl.

533
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:01,495
Thanks.

534
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,951
Think nothin' of it.

535
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:15,816
So,

536
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,213
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

537
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,617
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

538
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,635
Just over three years.

539
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:30,069
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

540
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:33,686
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

541
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,499
Why would you?

542
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,371
I heard you did a pilot.

543
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:46,685
That was my 15 minutes.

544
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,601
What was it?

545
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:53,223
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

546
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,965
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

547
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,505
Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.

548
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:01,186
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

549
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,799
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

550
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,660
There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. 
She was the leader.

551
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:14,573
The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
The black girl was a demolition expert.

552
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,767
French fox's speciality was sex.

553
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,498
What was your speciality?

554
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,268
Knives.

555
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:24,435
The character I played, Raven McCoy,

556
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,332
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

557
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:32,664
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

558
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,540
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

559
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:38,940
Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, 
taught her.

560
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:41,733
And if we would have got picked up,

561
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:46,726
they would've worked in a gimmick where
every show I would've told another joke.

562
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,032
You know any of them old jokes?

563
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,551
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

564
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,029
Tell me.

565
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,379
It's corny.

566
00:39:58,557 --> 00:40:00,407
Don't be that way. Tell me.

567
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:03,468
No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

568
00:40:03,492 --> 00:40:08,090
You'd be... You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

569
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:12,127
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

570
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,827
That's not what I meant. You know it.

571
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:18,189
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

572
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:19,889
What a gyp.

573
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,288
Martin and Lewis.

574
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:28,729
Vanilla Coke.

575
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,256
Mmm. Yummy.

576
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,671
You think I could have a sip of that?

577
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,191
Be my guest.

578
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,957
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

579
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,278
You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.

580
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,937
Yeah, but maybe I do.

581
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:53,400
Cooties I can handle.

582
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,266
All right.

583
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,938
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

584
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:07,840
Told ya.

585
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,750
I don't know if it was worth $5, 
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

586
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,221
Don't you hate that?

587
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:49,224
Hate what?

588
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,508
Uncomfortable silences.

589
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:57,928
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak
about bullshit in order to be comfortable?

590
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,897
I don't know.
That's a good question.

591
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:06,198
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

592
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:11,671
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

593
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,708
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

594
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,164
I'll tell you what.

595
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,463
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

596
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:27,242
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

597
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:29,865
I'll do that.

598
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:34,640
Okay.

599
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,107
I said goddamn!

600
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:05,298
Goddamn! Goddamn.

601
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,595
Mmmm.

602
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:21,034
Don't you just love it when 
you come back from the bathroom

603
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,897
to find your food waiting for you?

604
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,272
We're lucky we got anything at all.

605
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:27,600
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

606
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,912
Maybe we should've sat in 
Marilyn Monroe's section.

607
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:33,813
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

608
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:36,387
That is Marilyn Monroe.

609
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:40,335
That is Mamie Van Doren.

610
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:44,768
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

611
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:46,550
Pretty smart.

612
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:48,597
Yeah. I got my moments.

613
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:50,688
So did you think of somethin' to say?

614
00:43:50,906 --> 00:43:52,395
Actually, I did.

615
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,803
However...

616
00:43:59,147 --> 00:44:01,414
...you seem like a really nice person, 
and I...

617
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:03,654
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

618
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:09,227
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,
boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

619
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:12,065
This sounds like 
you actually have somethin' to say.

620
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,926
Well, well, I do. I do.

621
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:18,265
But you have to promise not to be offended.

622
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,674
No, no.

623
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:23,941
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

624
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,945
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me,

625
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,548
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

626
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,368
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

627
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,404
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

628
00:44:34,532 --> 00:44:38,331
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

629
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:39,597
Is that a fact?

630
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:43,994
And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?

631
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,551
All right, all right.

632
00:44:45,576 --> 00:44:47,371
Well, here goes.

633
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,431
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

634
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,896
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

635
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:58,229
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

636
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,355
Well, that is one way to say it.

637
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,862
Another way to say it would be that
he was thrown out.

638
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:06,213
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

639
00:45:06,238 --> 00:45:10,454
Yet even another way is to say 
he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus

640
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:11,539
because of you.

641
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,373
Is that a fact?

642
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:17,380
No. No, it's not a fact. It's just
what I heard. That's just what I heard.

643
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,119
- Who told you?
- They.

644
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,915
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

645
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:27,506
They certainly do. They certainly do.

646
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,729
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?

647
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:31,497
I'm... I'm not shy.

648
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,444
Did it involve the "F" word?

649
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:38,538
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

650
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:42,424
- And?
- And... And nothin'.

651
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:44,123
That's it.

652
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:50,445
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window

653
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,303
for giving me a foot massage?

654
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:54,339
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

655
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,069
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

656
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:02,482
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window

657
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:04,897
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

658
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:07,828
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

659
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:11,578
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

660
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:15,899
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

661
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:20,080
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

662
00:46:20,884 --> 00:46:22,208
But did it happen?

663
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:27,952
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

664
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:29,977
Really?

665
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,824
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window

666
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,785
except Marsellus and Tony.

667
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:40,012
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

668
00:46:40,037 --> 00:46:44,602
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

669
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:49,187
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

670
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:56,609
Now, this is where one lucky couple

671
00:46:56,634 --> 00:47:00,701
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

672
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:04,427
Now, who will be our first contestants?

673
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:05,880
- Right here!
- All right!

674
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:10,122
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

675
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:15,016
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

676
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,091
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

677
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:22,039
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

678
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,932
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

679
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:26,093
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

680
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:35,455
Now let's meet our first contestants here 
this evening.

681
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,604
Young lady, what is your name?

682
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:39,810
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

683
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:42,291
And how 'bout your fella here?

684
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:44,135
Vincent Vega.

685
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:47,281
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

686
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:49,204
Go for it.

687
00:47:49,454 --> 00:47:50,584
Come on!

688
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:34,615
Is that what you call 
an uncomfortable silence?

689
00:50:35,228 --> 00:50:37,713
I don't know what you call that.

690
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,700
Drinks! Music!

691
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,077
I'm gonna take a piss.

692
00:50:45,024 --> 00:50:49,633
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

693
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,887
One drink, and that's it.

694
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:48,930
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

695
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,904
Say good night... and go home.

696
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:34,704
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

697
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:38,167
Because... being loyal is very important.

698
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,842
Hello.

699
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:30,310
So, you're gonna go out there

700
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:33,137
and you're gonna say, "Good night. 
I've had a very lovely evening."

701
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,071
Walk out the door, get in the car,

702
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,596
go home, jerk off, 
and that's all you gonna do.

703
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,141
All right, Mia.

704
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,737
So listen, I gotta go, all right?

705
00:54:35,928 --> 00:54:38,950
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

706
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:42,145
You fu- Oh, Jesus Christ!

707
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,061
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me! Oh-

708
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,159
Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta here. 
We gotta walk now.

709
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:02,172
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

710
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:04,032
Fuck!

711
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,526
Answer.

712
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:15,463
Have you got the ring?

713
00:55:15,488 --> 00:55:19,033
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

714
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:24,463
- Please! Please!
- Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.

715
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,404
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

716
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:41,970
- Now what do you say?
- I give up! I'll marry you!

717
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,438
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

718
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:51,694
I can hear it.

719
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,000
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call here this late!

720
00:55:55,025 --> 00:55:56,430
Yeah, I told them.

721
00:55:56,455 --> 00:56:00,006
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

722
00:56:03,169 --> 00:56:04,535
Don't you dare strike me!

723
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,312
Hello.

724
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:07,061
Lance! Vincent.

725
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:10,565
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

726
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,690
Wh-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
Wh-What's the problem?

727
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:16,718
I got this chick, 
she's fuckin' O. D.in' on me!

728
00:56:16,742 --> 00:56:18,248
Well, don't bring her here!

729
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:19,936
I'm not even joking with you!

730
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,429
Do not be bringing 
some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

731
00:56:22,454 --> 00:56:23,496
No choice.

732
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:24,786
She's O.D.in'?

733
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:26,837
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!

734
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:32,040
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

735
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:32,851
Negative!

736
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,772
This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

737
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:37,393
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

738
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:41,033
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

739
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:44,059
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

740
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,539
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

741
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,533
What the hell was that?

742
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,555
Have you lost your fucking mind?

743
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,578
You were talking about drug shit 
on a cellular phone!

744
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,199
You crashed your car into my fucking house!

745
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:07,473
Grab her feet.

746
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:11,785
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

747
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:14,465
This "fucked-up bitch" is 
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

748
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,633
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

749
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:19,216
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

750
00:57:20,592 --> 00:57:25,546
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

751
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,097
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

752
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:30,655
Shit.

753
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,691
Lance!

754
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,113
Shit.

755
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:42,280
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
What the fuck's going on out here?

756
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:45,561
Who's she?

757
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:48,524
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

758
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:49,755
What's wrong with her?

759
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:50,782
She's O.D.ing!

760
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:51,867
Get her outta here!

761
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:52,973
Get the shot!

762
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:55,059
Fuck you! Fuck you too!

763
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,715
What a fuckin' bitch.

764
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,386
Just keep talking to her, all right?

765
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:00,874
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go 
get my little black medical book.

766
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,708
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

767
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,283
- I've never had to give an adrenalin shot.
- You never give an adrenalin shot?

768
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,011
I've never had to, all right! I don't go 
joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!

769
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:09,291
My friends can handle their highs!

770
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:11,255
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

771
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,434
I ain't stopping you!

772
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,157
Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

773
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:15,952
- Get the shot!
- All right!

774
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:23,189
- Hurry up. We're losing her! 
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

775
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:24,651
What's he looking for?

776
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:26,856
I don't know. Some book.

777
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,487
What are you looking for?

778
00:58:28,512 --> 00:58:29,993
A little black medical book.

779
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:31,285
What are you looking for?

780
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,964
My little black medical book! 
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

781
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,497
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

782
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:40,742
If it's so important, 
why don't you keep it with the shot?

783
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,614
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

784
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:45,450
Listen. While you're looking, 
that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

785
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:47,478
You're never gonna find anything 
in this mess!

786
00:58:47,503 --> 00:58:49,117
I'm gonna fucking kill you 
if you don't shut up!

787
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:50,830
Lance, get in here!

788
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,654
Right?

789
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,468
Get the fuck outta my way.

790
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:55,572
Pig.

791
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:58,038
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. 
Come on.

792
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:01,205
Look. While I'm doing this, you take off
her shirt and find her heart.

793
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:03,340
Does it gotta be exact?

794
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:06,187
We're giving her a shot in the heart, 
so I guess it's gotta be fucking exact.

795
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:08,802
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

796
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,217
- That's it.
- That's it?

797
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:12,918
All right, what I need is 
a big, fat magic marker.

798
00:59:13,577 --> 00:59:14,902
- You got it?
- What?

799
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,351
A magic marker.

800
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,274
A felt pen! A fuckin'
black magic marker! Christ.

801
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:21,687
Come on, man. Hurry up!

802
00:59:21,717 --> 00:59:25,652
Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

803
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,077
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

804
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:34,375
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

805
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,202
I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.

806
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:38,404
I never done this either!
I ain't starting now!

807
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:40,581
Look. You brought her here and 
that means you're gonna give her the shot.

808
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:43,569
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to
your house, then I give her the shot.

809
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,668
- Give it to me.
- Here.

810
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:45,768
Give me that.

811
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:48,937
All right, tell me what to do.

812
00:59:48,962 --> 00:59:52,307
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

813
00:59:52,332 --> 00:59:54,930
But she's got a breastplate...
You gotta pierce through that.

814
00:59:54,955 --> 00:59:58,300
You gotta bring the needle down 
in a stabbing motion.

815
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,766
I gotta... I gotta stab her three times?

816
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,730
No, just stab her once!

817
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:04,433
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

818
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:07,518
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

819
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,177
Okay. Then what happens?

820
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:10,805
Kinda curious about that myself.

821
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:13,435
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

822
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,190
She's supposed to come out of it like that.

823
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:16,977
All right, count to three.

824
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,701
- All right. Ready?
- One.

825
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:25,898
Two.

826
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,381
Three!

827
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:53,882
If you're all right, then say something.

828
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,250
Something.

829
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,419
That was fuckin' trippy.

830
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:02,532
Ohh.

831
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,757
Oh, man.

832
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:31,633
Mia. Mia.

833
01:01:33,746 --> 01:01:36,183
What's...

834
01:01:36,753 --> 01:01:40,607
What's your thoughts on...
on how to handle this?

835
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:42,941
What's yours?

836
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:50,568
Well, I'm of the opinion that 
if Marsellus lived his whole life,

837
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:52,922
he doesn't need to know nothing 
about this incident.

838
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:59,038
If Marsellus knew about this incident,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

839
01:01:59,371 --> 01:02:01,120
I seriously doubt that.

840
01:02:02,274 --> 01:02:04,639
I can keep a secret if you can.

841
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:08,238
Shake on it?

842
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:16,022
Mum's the word?

843
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:17,986
Cool.

844
01:02:18,899 --> 01:02:21,722
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

845
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,861
Vincent.

846
01:02:29,151 --> 01:02:31,898
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?

847
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:34,631
Sure.

848
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:38,524
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

849
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,900
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

850
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,554
But if you still wanna hear it, 
I'll tell it.

851
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:45,747
I can't wait.

852
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:46,929
Okay.

853
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:49,482
Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.

854
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:51,825
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

855
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:56,472
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

856
01:02:56,718 --> 01:02:59,656
Goes back and squishes him and says,

857
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:00,952
"Ketchup."

858
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:05,863
Ketchup.

859
01:03:10,851 --> 01:03:12,297
See you around.

860
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:37,788
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

861
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:40,537
He think totem pole alive!

862
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:43,595
He arctic tenderfoot!

863
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:47,901
That totem pole been here forever!

864
01:03:47,926 --> 01:03:48,942
Butch?

865
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,207
One more thing, and we'll start for...

866
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,201
Butch, stop watching TV for a second.

867
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:56,910
- Yeah?
- You've got a special visitor.

868
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:05,443
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

869
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:12,640
Well, this here is Captain Koons.
He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

870
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:23,971
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

871
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:27,704
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

872
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:33,083
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together
over five years.

873
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,517
Hopefully, you'll never have
to experience this yourself,

874
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:44,166
but when two men are in a situation like me
and your dad were for as long as we were,

875
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:48,337
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

876
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:54,717
If it'd been me who'd not made it,

877
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:58,926
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

878
01:04:59,912 --> 01:05:02,773
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

879
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:05,625
Butch,

880
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:09,358
I got something for ya.

881
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:18,459
This watch I got here

882
01:05:18,484 --> 01:05:22,636
was first purchased by your great-
grandfather during the first World War.

883
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:27,276
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

884
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:31,364
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

885
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,679
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

886
01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:40,457
It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine
Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris.

887
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:43,171
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

888
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:46,016
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

889
01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:50,384
...when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

890
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:55,326
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed

891
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:59,816
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country

892
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:03,109
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

893
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:05,540
This time they called it World War II.

894
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:11,173
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

895
01:06:11,908 --> 01:06:14,921
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

896
01:06:14,946 --> 01:06:17,884
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed,

897
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:20,894
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

898
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,937
Your granddad was facing death.

899
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,248
He knew it.

900
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:31,409
None of those boys ever had any illusions
about leaving that island alive,

901
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:34,378
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

902
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:39,105
your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki,

903
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:45,549
a man he'd never met before in
his life, to deliver to his infant son,

904
01:06:45,574 --> 01:06:49,504
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

905
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:54,558
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

906
01:06:55,335 --> 01:06:59,085
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

907
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,081
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

908
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,861
This watch.

909
01:07:11,203 --> 01:07:16,267
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

910
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:20,124
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

911
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:27,269
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch, 
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

912
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,527
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

913
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,356
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow hands

914
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,619
on his boy's birthright,

915
01:07:35,644 --> 01:07:39,757
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something, his ass.

916
01:07:39,782 --> 01:07:43,157
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

917
01:07:43,182 --> 01:07:47,234
Then he died of dysentery.
He give me the watch.

918
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:51,071
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

919
01:07:51,096 --> 01:07:59,085
Then, after seven years, I was
sent home to my family and now,

920
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:04,480
little man, I give the watch to you.

921
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:29,433
It's time, Butch.

922
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:43,734
In the heavyweight division, in 
the right corner wearing the blue trunks,

923
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,253
weighing 210 pounds,

924
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,082
Floyd Ray Wilson!

925
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:55,693
It's official. It's official. 
Wilson is dead!

926
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:57,604
Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,

927
01:08:57,629 --> 01:08:59,876
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

928
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:03,563
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

929
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:04,958
Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?

930
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:06,313
My guess would be yes.

931
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:10,475
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.

932
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,625
I think any man would've left 
the ring that fast.

933
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,941
Do you feel this tragedy is
gonna affect the world of boxing?

934
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:19,581
A tragedy like this can't help but shake
the world of boxing to its very foundations.

935
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,904
But it's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,

936
01:09:21,928 --> 01:09:23,530
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-

937
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:01,270
Man, you know I didn't...

938
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:02,633
Marsellus.

939
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,838
No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

940
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:07,292
How you doing?

941
01:10:07,685 --> 01:10:10,962
Great. I never thanked you for dinner.

942
01:10:13,366 --> 01:10:15,062
- What you got?
- He booked.

943
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,258
His trainer?

944
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,565
Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

945
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:20,441
I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

946
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,390
No, we don't wanna "think". We wanna know.

947
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,857
Take him to the kennel, 
sic the dogs on his ass.

948
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:28,488
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

949
01:10:28,513 --> 01:10:30,583
Butch's search...
How do you want it done?

950
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:33,727
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

951
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:35,568
If Butch goes to lndochina,

952
01:10:35,593 --> 01:10:39,022
I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice 
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

953
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,509
I will take care of it.

954
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:53,511
Mister.

955
01:10:57,276 --> 01:10:58,580
Hey, mister.

956
01:10:58,783 --> 01:10:59,769
What?

957
01:10:59,987 --> 01:11:03,473
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

958
01:11:04,487 --> 01:11:06,188
You're the fighter?

959
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:08,157
Whatever gave you that idea?

960
01:11:08,419 --> 01:11:10,161
No, come on.

961
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,077
You're him.

962
01:11:13,758 --> 01:11:15,428
I know you're him.

963
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,083
Tell me you're him.

964
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,822
I'm him.

965
01:11:22,068 --> 01:11:24,279
You killed the other boxing man.

966
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:29,792
He's dead?

967
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:32,342
The radio said he was dead.

968
01:11:35,776 --> 01:11:37,760
Sorry about that, Floyd.

969
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,121
What does it feel like?

970
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:43,379
What does what feel like?

971
01:11:43,558 --> 01:11:45,237
Killing a man.

972
01:11:47,447 --> 01:11:51,372
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

973
01:11:52,078 --> 01:11:53,596
What are you, a weirdo?

974
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:57,831
No. It is a subject 
I have much interest in.

975
01:12:00,418 --> 01:12:04,020
You are the first person I have ever met 
who has killed somebody.

976
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:08,230
So?

977
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:12,204
What does it feel like to kill a man?

978
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,190
I'll tell you what.

979
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:18,814
Give me one of them cigarettes you got
up there, and I'll tell you all about it.

980
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,933
So, Esmarelda...

981
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,529
Villa Lobos... Is that Mexican?

982
01:12:45,554 --> 01:12:48,788
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

983
01:12:48,813 --> 01:12:50,629
That's some handle you got there, honey.

984
01:12:50,653 --> 01:12:54,240
Thank you.
And what is your name?

985
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:55,965
Butch.

986
01:12:56,396 --> 01:12:57,521
Butch.

987
01:12:58,837 --> 01:12:59,894
What does it mean?

988
01:12:59,919 --> 01:13:02,328
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

989
01:13:03,556 --> 01:13:10,082
So, moving right along, Esmarelda,
what is it you want to know?

990
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:13,665
I want to know what it feels like 
to kill a man.

991
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,105
I couldn't tell ya.

992
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,828
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

993
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,579
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

994
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:36,652
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

995
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:50,610
What the fuck'd I tell ya? Huh?

996
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:54,415
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

997
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,736
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

998
01:13:57,237 --> 01:14:00,469
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

999
01:14:00,494 --> 01:14:01,923
If he never laced up his gloves,

1000
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:04,981
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1001
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,402
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1002
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:13,775
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1003
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,415
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1004
01:14:17,436 --> 01:14:19,544
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1005
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,143
All eight? How long to collect?

1006
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:26,721
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?

1007
01:14:26,745 --> 01:14:29,178
No, I understand. A few stragglers aside.

1008
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:33,061
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
That is great news, man.

1009
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:37,136
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1010
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:40,488
It'll probably take us a couple days 
to get down to Knoxville.

1011
01:14:40,779 --> 01:14:42,715
Okay, my brother.

1012
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,733
You're right. You're goddamn right.

1013
01:14:47,226 --> 01:14:50,721
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1014
01:14:50,844 --> 01:14:52,238
Cool, brother.

1015
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:09,892
$45.60.

1016
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:19,689
And, uh,
here's a little something for the effort.

1017
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,806
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1018
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:25,212
The truth.

1019
01:15:25,237 --> 01:15:28,733
Three well-dressed, 
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1020
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,331
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1021
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:36,073
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1022
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,743
Whew.

1023
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:52,376
Keep the light off.

1024
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:55,506
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1025
01:16:00,092 --> 01:16:02,028
Hard day at the office?

1026
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:03,322
Pretty hard.

1027
01:16:03,953 --> 01:16:05,650
Got in a fight.

1028
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:07,994
Poor baby.

1029
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,704
Can you make spoons?

1030
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,453
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1031
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,364
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.

1032
01:16:15,388 --> 01:16:17,211
I like the way you stink.

1033
01:16:18,476 --> 01:16:20,603
Let me take this jacket off.

1034
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,224
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

1035
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:26,422
Uh-huh.

1036
01:16:26,534 --> 01:16:28,223
I wish I had a pot.

1037
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:33,324
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror, and you wish you had some pot?

1038
01:16:33,349 --> 01:16:36,613
A pot. A pot belly.

1039
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,932
Pot bellies are sexy.

1040
01:16:39,472 --> 01:16:44,119
Well, you should be happy,
'cause you have one.

1041
01:16:44,144 --> 01:16:47,164
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1042
01:16:47,372 --> 01:16:51,310
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star".

1043
01:16:51,335 --> 01:16:52,997
It's not the same thing.

1044
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,959
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1045
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:58,096
The difference is huge.

1046
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:02,616
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1047
01:17:02,641 --> 01:17:03,990
No.

1048
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:08,631
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1049
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:11,993
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1050
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:18,347
The rest of you is normal... normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass,

1051
01:17:18,353 --> 01:17:22,120
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1052
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:26,309
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1053
01:17:26,677 --> 01:17:29,114
You think men would find that attractive?

1054
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:32,362
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1055
01:17:32,797 --> 01:17:36,437
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye

1056
01:17:36,462 --> 01:17:38,121
is seldom the same.

1057
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:45,224
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1058
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:47,934
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1059
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:54,167
Oh! I'd smother you! I'd drop it right
on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!

1060
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:56,248
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1061
01:17:56,273 --> 01:17:57,757
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1062
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,242
Did you get everything?

1063
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:16,879
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1064
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:19,342
Did everything go as planned?

1065
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:21,225
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1066
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:23,896
You didn't listen to the radio?

1067
01:18:23,921 --> 01:18:27,223
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1068
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,415
I won, all right.

1069
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:32,403
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1070
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,240
So it all worked out in the finish.

1071
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,529
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1072
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:50,169
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1073
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,735
If they find us, they'll kill us, 
won't they?

1074
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,368
But they won't find us, will they?

1075
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:05,303
Do you still want me to go with you?

1076
01:19:07,454 --> 01:19:11,078
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.
It's...

1077
01:19:17,857 --> 01:19:19,562
Say it.

1078
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:22,265
Fabienne,

1079
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:25,047
I want you to be with me.

1080
01:19:26,213 --> 01:19:27,476
Forever?

1081
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,133
Forever and ever.

1082
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,919
Do you love me?

1083
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:35,120
Very, very much.

1084
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:42,525
Butch.

1085
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:43,760
Yes?

1086
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:47,674
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1087
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:50,756
Will you kiss it?

1088
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:54,783
But you first.

1089
01:19:55,603 --> 01:19:57,477
- Okay.
- Okay.

1090
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:09,990
Butch.

1091
01:20:10,717 --> 01:20:14,156
Mon amour. L'aventure commence.

1092
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:31,912
I think I cracked a rib.

1093
01:20:32,188 --> 01:20:33,927
Giving me oral pleasure?

1094
01:20:33,951 --> 01:20:35,742
No, retard, from the fight.

1095
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:37,145
Don't call me "retard".

1096
01:20:37,169 --> 01:20:39,014
My name is Fabby.

1097
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:41,731
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1098
01:20:41,756 --> 01:20:43,002
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi-

1099
01:20:43,027 --> 01:20:46,411
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1100
01:20:46,436 --> 01:20:49,533
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1101
01:20:50,318 --> 01:20:51,700
I take it back.

1102
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,813
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1103
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:01,680
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1104
01:21:01,705 --> 01:21:03,976
"Tulip" is much better than "mongoloid".

1105
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:06,939
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1106
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,903
And I took it back.

1107
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:11,437
Butch?

1108
01:21:11,608 --> 01:21:13,121
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1109
01:21:13,395 --> 01:21:14,970
Where are we going to go?

1110
01:21:14,994 --> 01:21:16,570
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1111
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:18,929
Wherever you want.

1112
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:23,665
We're gonna get a lot of money from this,
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money

1113
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:26,805
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1114
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:31,491
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1115
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:35,359
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1116
01:21:35,384 --> 01:21:38,202
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1117
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,747
And if after a while you didn't dig that,

1118
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:44,099
we could go someplace else.
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1119
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:46,394
But I do not speak Spanish.

1120
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:49,215
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1121
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:53,510
Besides, Mexican's easy.
�Donde esta el zapateria?

1122
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,353
- What does that mean?
- Where is the shoe store?

1123
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,314
- �Donde esta-
- Spit, please.

1124
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:01,949
�Donde esta el zapateria?

1125
01:22:01,973 --> 01:22:03,849
Excellent pronunciation.

1126
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:08,578
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1127
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,906
- �Que hora es?
- �Que hora es?

1128
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:14,060
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1129
01:22:14,085 --> 01:22:15,668
Time for bed.

1130
01:22:16,829 --> 01:22:18,628
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1131
01:22:26,592 --> 01:22:27,875
Butch?

1132
01:22:34,401 --> 01:22:36,057
Never mind.

1133
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:49,990
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1134
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:02,150
What is this you're watching?

1135
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:06,567
A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.

1136
01:23:08,654 --> 01:23:10,055
Are you watching it?

1137
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:11,904
In a way.

1138
01:23:14,084 --> 01:23:17,086
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1139
01:23:20,491 --> 01:23:21,762
What was it about?

1140
01:23:21,786 --> 01:23:24,348
How should I know? 
You were the one watching it.

1141
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,161
No, imbecile, what was your dream about?

1142
01:23:27,314 --> 01:23:30,584
I don't know. I don't remember.

1143
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:33,645
It's really rare that I remember my dreams.

1144
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:36,642
Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
in the morning.

1145
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:41,802
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1146
01:23:41,827 --> 01:23:43,757
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1147
01:23:46,773 --> 01:23:48,197
Satisfied?

1148
01:23:48,964 --> 01:23:50,008
Yep.

1149
01:23:51,074 --> 01:23:54,013
Get up, lazy bones!

1150
01:23:54,038 --> 01:23:56,716
Oh. God.

1151
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:59,376
What time is it?

1152
01:23:59,602 --> 01:24:01,362
Almost nine in the morning.

1153
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,731
What time does our train arrive?

1154
01:24:03,823 --> 01:24:05,001
Eleven.

1155
01:24:05,685 --> 01:24:07,470
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?

1156
01:24:07,494 --> 01:24:09,014
What, Lemon Pie?

1157
01:24:09,965 --> 01:24:16,173
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,

1158
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:19,637
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1159
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:22,027
Anything to drink with that?

1160
01:24:22,052 --> 01:24:24,189
Wow, that looks nice.

1161
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:31,102
To drink, a tall glass of orange juice 
and a black cup of coffee.

1162
01:24:31,452 --> 01:24:34,011
After that,
I'm going to have a slice of pie.

1163
01:24:34,147 --> 01:24:35,939
Pie for breakfast?

1164
01:24:36,345 --> 01:24:39,555
Any time of the day is a good time for pie.

1165
01:24:39,928 --> 01:24:46,030
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1166
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:47,920
Where's my watch?

1167
01:24:52,795 --> 01:24:54,221
It's there.

1168
01:24:55,028 --> 01:24:56,349
No, it's not.

1169
01:24:57,171 --> 01:24:58,196
Have you looked?

1170
01:24:58,221 --> 01:25:00,792
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1171
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:03,779
You sure you got it?

1172
01:25:04,595 --> 01:25:06,591
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1173
01:25:06,616 --> 01:25:07,890
On the little kangaroo?

1174
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,767
Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1175
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:12,280
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1176
01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:15,664
Well, it should be.

1177
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:19,900
Yes, it most definitely should be, but
it's not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1178
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,926
Fabienne, 
where's my father's fucking watch?

1179
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,683
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1180
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:37,023
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1181
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:38,920
All this other shit 
you could've set on fire,

1182
01:25:38,945 --> 01:25:42,994
but I specifically reminded you
not to forget the fucking watch.

1183
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:46,532
Now think. Did you get it?

1184
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:48,469
I believe so.

1185
01:25:48,494 --> 01:25:52,021
"You believe so"? What the fuck does
that mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1186
01:25:53,388 --> 01:25:54,952
Then I did.

1187
01:25:57,009 --> 01:25:58,382
Are you sure?

1188
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:01,426
No.

1189
01:26:03,504 --> 01:26:05,527
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1190
01:26:05,552 --> 01:26:07,839
Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'-

1191
01:26:09,168 --> 01:26:12,431
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1192
01:26:12,456 --> 01:26:13,749
No!

1193
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,001
It's not your fault.

1194
01:26:23,933 --> 01:26:26,094
You left it at the apartment.

1195
01:26:32,202 --> 01:26:34,668
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1196
01:26:37,446 --> 01:26:39,458
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1197
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:44,440
I reminded you about it,

1198
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:48,343
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1199
01:26:49,578 --> 01:26:52,584
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1200
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:55,880
You're not a mind reader.

1201
01:26:56,494 --> 01:26:57,834
Are you?

1202
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,456
I-I'm sorry.

1203
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:13,763
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1204
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:16,926
Why does it mean that?

1205
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:22,877
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1206
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,277
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1207
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:29,947
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1208
01:27:30,598 --> 01:27:34,037
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1209
01:27:34,062 --> 01:27:35,182
then I'll split.

1210
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:40,082
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1211
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:50,880
Here's some money. Go out and get
those pancakes. Have a nice breakfast.

1212
01:27:50,905 --> 01:27:53,384
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie".

1213
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:54,942
Blueberry pie.

1214
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,429
Maybe not that fast.

1215
01:27:59,095 --> 01:28:00,748
But pretty fast. Okay?

1216
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,625
- Bye.
- Bye.

1217
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:07,236
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1218
01:28:07,261 --> 01:28:09,171
she forgets my father's watch!

1219
01:28:09,196 --> 01:28:13,713
I specifically reminded her,
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1220
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:17,020
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1221
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,548
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...

1222
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,426
Lookin' good, Butch.

1223
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,348
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.

1224
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:09,851
They keep underestimatin' ya.

1225
01:34:42,419 --> 01:34:43,862
Motherfucker.

1226
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,239
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1227
01:34:57,251 --> 01:34:59,379
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1228
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,284
If you need someone to go to court, 
I'll be glad to help.

1229
01:35:12,309 --> 01:35:15,998
That guy was a drunken maniac.
He hit you, then he crashed into that car.

1230
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:17,470
Who?

1231
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:18,752
Him.

1232
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,783
I'll be damned.

1233
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,203
I'm shot!

1234
01:35:49,825 --> 01:35:51,930
Sally! Sally!

1235
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,346
Motherfucker!

1236
01:36:05,321 --> 01:36:06,901
Can I help you with somethin'?

1237
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:08,311
Shut the fuck up.

1238
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:13,501
Now you just wait a goddamn minute, now!
What the fuck you up to?

1239
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:15,296
Come here, motherfucker!

1240
01:36:17,892 --> 01:36:21,841
You feel that sting, huh, big boy?
That's pride fuckin' with you, see?

1241
01:36:21,866 --> 01:36:25,281
You gotta fight through that shit! Huh?

1242
01:36:25,306 --> 01:36:27,769
- You'd better kill me-
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1243
01:36:28,108 --> 01:36:30,717
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to-

1244
01:36:31,376 --> 01:36:33,252
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1245
01:36:33,277 --> 01:36:34,926
This ain't none of your business, mister.

1246
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:36,820
I'm makin' it my business.

1247
01:36:37,076 --> 01:36:38,587
Toss the weapon.

1248
01:36:38,611 --> 01:36:40,297
You don't understand, man.

1249
01:36:40,322 --> 01:36:41,799
Toss the weapon.

1250
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,947
Take your foot off the nigger,
put your hand behind your head,

1251
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:54,669
approach the counter right now.

1252
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:57,364
This motherfucker's trying to kill me.

1253
01:36:57,466 --> 01:37:01,236
Shut up. Keep comin'. Come on.

1254
01:37:26,301 --> 01:37:28,237
Zed. Maynard.

1255
01:37:29,484 --> 01:37:32,052
Yeah, the spider just caught 
a couple flies.

1256
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:24,158
Nobody kills anybody in 
my place of business except me or Zed.

1257
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:29,775
That's Zed.

1258
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:45,633
- I thought you said you waited for me. 
- I did.

1259
01:38:51,319 --> 01:38:53,680
Then how come they're all beat up?

1260
01:38:54,914 --> 01:38:57,738
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1261
01:38:58,334 --> 01:39:02,189
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1262
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:05,677
Is that right? You gonna shoot him, boy?

1263
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,836
Huh?

1264
01:39:10,392 --> 01:39:13,056
Hey, is Grace all right out front?

1265
01:39:13,638 --> 01:39:15,368
Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?

1266
01:39:15,393 --> 01:39:16,711
No, it's Thursday.

1267
01:39:16,736 --> 01:39:18,331
She oughta be fine.

1268
01:39:18,356 --> 01:39:19,466
Mmm.

1269
01:39:21,465 --> 01:39:25,474
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1270
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:28,119
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1271
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,925
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1272
01:40:12,325 --> 01:40:13,714
Get up.

1273
01:40:27,519 --> 01:40:29,102
Get down.

1274
01:40:39,499 --> 01:40:41,838
Which one of 'em you wanna do first?

1275
01:40:43,523 --> 01:40:45,596
I ain't for sure yet.

1276
01:40:49,473 --> 01:40:52,138
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1277
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:58,127
catch a nigger by his toe.

1278
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:01,922
If he hollers, let him go.

1279
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:05,934
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1280
01:41:09,114 --> 01:41:15,698
My mother said pick the perfect one,

1281
01:41:15,723 --> 01:41:18,718
and... you... are...

1282
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:21,785
...it.

1283
01:41:23,955 --> 01:41:25,475
Guess that means you, big boy.

1284
01:41:25,499 --> 01:41:26,796
Fuck you!

1285
01:41:28,513 --> 01:41:29,656
Shh.

1286
01:41:31,504 --> 01:41:32,947
You wanna do it in here?

1287
01:41:32,972 --> 01:41:36,019
No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1288
01:41:36,778 --> 01:41:38,231
Sounds good to me.

1289
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:04,385
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1290
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:41,906
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1291
01:42:41,931 --> 01:42:43,661
Now, motherfucker!

1292
01:42:46,019 --> 01:42:49,555
Come on! Yeah!

1293
01:43:16,024 --> 01:43:18,708
Yeee! Yeeee-hah!

1294
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,428
Yeah!

1295
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:11,580
Come on! Get down there!

1296
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:18,404
Do it! Yeah!

1297
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,109
Yeah! Yeah!

1298
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:55,009
Shut the fuck up!

1299
01:44:59,105 --> 01:45:00,472
Fuck him!

1300
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:04,571
Come on!

1301
01:45:09,271 --> 01:45:11,404
Fuck him. Yeah.

1302
01:45:43,035 --> 01:45:45,113
You want that gun, don't ya, Zed?

1303
01:45:50,058 --> 01:45:51,754
Go ahead and pick it up.

1304
01:45:54,246 --> 01:45:55,775
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1305
01:45:58,889 --> 01:46:00,946
Come on. Thatta boy!

1306
01:46:02,911 --> 01:46:06,474
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1307
01:46:11,834 --> 01:46:13,555
Step aside, Butch.

1308
01:46:26,807 --> 01:46:28,143
Fuck!

1309
01:46:32,296 --> 01:46:33,790
You okay?

1310
01:46:36,466 --> 01:46:37,890
No, man.

1311
01:46:39,271 --> 01:46:41,775
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1312
01:46:53,577 --> 01:46:55,034
What now?

1313
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:59,850
"What now"?

1314
01:47:01,311 --> 01:47:03,528
Let me tell you what now.

1315
01:47:04,894 --> 01:47:07,978
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers

1316
01:47:08,003 --> 01:47:13,463
to go to work on the homes here
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1317
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:18,463
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?

1318
01:47:19,784 --> 01:47:22,347
I ain't through with you by a damn sight!

1319
01:47:22,372 --> 01:47:24,758
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1320
01:47:29,055 --> 01:47:31,303
I meant what now between me and you.

1321
01:47:36,721 --> 01:47:38,906
Oh, that "what now".

1322
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:43,309
I tell you what now between me and you.

1323
01:47:46,064 --> 01:47:48,878
There is no me and you.

1324
01:47:50,347 --> 01:47:51,945
Not no more.

1325
01:47:55,781 --> 01:47:57,149
So, are we cool?

1326
01:47:58,759 --> 01:48:00,311
Yeah, we cool.

1327
01:48:01,492 --> 01:48:03,178
Two things.

1328
01:48:04,977 --> 01:48:07,566
Don't tell nobody about this.

1329
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:12,870
This shit is between me, you

1330
01:48:12,895 --> 01:48:17,526
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-
Of-His-Short-Ass-Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"

1331
01:48:17,551 --> 01:48:19,027
rapist here.

1332
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:23,303
It ain't nobody else's business.

1333
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:24,598
Two:

1334
01:48:25,395 --> 01:48:29,271
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1335
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:36,041
And when you gone, you stay gone, 
or you be gone.

1336
01:48:37,046 --> 01:48:39,984
You lost all your L.A. privileges. Deal?

1337
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,467
Deal.

1338
01:48:45,384 --> 01:48:47,320
Get your ass outta here.

1339
01:49:14,245 --> 01:49:15,642
Oh, shit.

1340
01:49:49,068 --> 01:49:50,903
Fabienne!

1341
01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:53,872
Fabienne!

1342
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,957
Fabienne!

1343
01:49:58,185 --> 01:50:00,819
Come on, baby. Come on. 
Get your shit. We gotta go right now.

1344
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,551
I was so worried. What about our bags?

1345
01:50:02,576 --> 01:50:05,025
Fuck the bags. If we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1346
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,565
Come on. I'll be downstairs.

1347
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:07,530
Is everything well?

1348
01:50:07,555 --> 01:50:09,518
Just come on! No talking now!

1349
01:50:09,543 --> 01:50:11,495
A-Are we in danger?

1350
01:50:15,219 --> 01:50:16,850
Come on, honey!

1351
01:50:20,108 --> 01:50:22,143
Where did you get this motorcycle?

1352
01:50:22,168 --> 01:50:25,029
It's not a motorcycle, baby. 
It's a chopper. Let's go.

1353
01:50:25,053 --> 01:50:26,701
What happened to my Honda?

1354
01:50:26,726 --> 01:50:30,496
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1355
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:32,867
Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1356
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:38,457
You're hurt?

1357
01:50:38,482 --> 01:50:42,110
No, no, I might've broken my nose.
It's no biggie. Come on. Hop on.

1358
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:43,513
Baby, please, we-

1359
01:50:43,538 --> 01:50:46,476
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
Get on!

1360
01:50:48,768 --> 01:50:51,878
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1361
01:50:51,903 --> 01:50:53,373
I'm sorry.

1362
01:50:54,112 --> 01:50:55,112
I'm so sorry.

1363
01:50:55,137 --> 01:50:58,053
You were gone so long, 
I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1364
01:50:58,078 --> 01:51:00,723
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1365
01:51:00,748 --> 01:51:02,538
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1366
01:51:02,558 --> 01:51:04,494
Did you get the blueberry pancakes?

1367
01:51:04,519 --> 01:51:08,007
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1368
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,789
Honey, since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1369
01:51:10,822 --> 01:51:14,482
the single weirdest fuckin' day
of my life. I'll tell you all about it.

1370
01:51:14,508 --> 01:51:16,999
Come on. Get on. Gotta go. Come on.

1371
01:51:17,898 --> 01:51:19,917
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1372
01:51:20,153 --> 01:51:22,301
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1373
01:51:22,505 --> 01:51:24,441
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1374
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,359
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1375
01:51:43,459 --> 01:51:45,759
Yes, you did, Brett!

1376
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:49,751
You tried to fuck him, and 
Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked

1377
01:51:49,765 --> 01:51:52,056
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1378
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:53,554
Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.

1379
01:51:53,578 --> 01:51:55,252
You read the Bible, Brett?

1380
01:51:55,585 --> 01:51:56,271
Yes!

1381
01:51:56,295 --> 01:52:00,352
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sorta fits the occasion.

1382
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:03,599
Ezekiel 25:17.

1383
01:52:04,142 --> 01:52:08,619
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides

1384
01:52:08,644 --> 01:52:13,451
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

1385
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:18,781
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1386
01:52:18,806 --> 01:52:21,835
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1387
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:27,457
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1388
01:52:27,482 --> 01:52:33,940
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger

1389
01:52:33,965 --> 01:52:38,373
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1390
01:52:38,486 --> 01:52:42,371
And you will know
My name is the Lord

1391
01:52:42,387 --> 01:52:45,621
when I lay My vengeance upon thee."

1392
01:52:54,423 --> 01:52:56,423
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1393
01:52:56,448 --> 01:52:58,729
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1394
01:52:58,754 --> 01:53:01,500
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1395
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,719
Better tell him to shut up. 
He's gettin' on my nerves.

1396
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:04,473
Marvin.

1397
01:53:04,498 --> 01:53:06,315
Marvin. Marvin!

1398
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:08,872
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1399
01:53:09,422 --> 01:53:12,505
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1400
01:53:40,973 --> 01:53:44,252
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1401
01:53:44,277 --> 01:53:49,003
Slip your mind? Did you forget that someone
was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?

1402
01:53:49,028 --> 01:53:52,658
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1403
01:53:58,132 --> 01:54:00,634
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1404
01:54:00,659 --> 01:54:02,595
I know. We was lucky.

1405
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:05,496
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1406
01:54:05,637 --> 01:54:07,239
Yeah, maybe.

1407
01:54:07,995 --> 01:54:12,058
This was divine intervention.
You know what divine intervention is?

1408
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:20,424
I think so.

1409
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:23,524
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1410
01:54:23,549 --> 01:54:25,985
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1411
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:29,149
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1412
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:32,319
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1413
01:54:32,344 --> 01:54:34,780
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1414
01:54:34,805 --> 01:54:37,018
What just happened here 
was a fuckin' miracle!

1415
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:38,825
Chill. This shit happens.

1416
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:41,780
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen".

1417
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:45,550
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car

1418
01:54:45,575 --> 01:54:47,597
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1419
01:54:47,622 --> 01:54:49,622
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1420
01:54:50,098 --> 01:54:54,546
What happened here was a miracle, and 
I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1421
01:54:54,862 --> 01:54:59,106
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1422
01:55:06,392 --> 01:55:09,649
Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.

1423
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:13,887
You ever seen that show Cops?

1424
01:55:13,912 --> 01:55:16,506
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1425
01:55:16,531 --> 01:55:20,239
and he was talkin' about this gunfight
he had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1426
01:55:20,264 --> 01:55:23,981
He just unloaded on this guy and 
nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1427
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:26,587
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1428
01:55:26,612 --> 01:55:30,312
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1429
01:55:30,514 --> 01:55:32,939
Look. You wanna play blind man, 
go walk with the shepherd,

1430
01:55:32,963 --> 01:55:35,344
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1431
01:55:35,668 --> 01:55:37,150
What the fuck does that mean?

1432
01:55:37,174 --> 01:55:38,845
It means that's it for me.

1433
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:41,239
From here on in, 
you can consider my ass retired.

1434
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:42,819
- Jesus Christ. 
- Don't blaspheme.

1435
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:44,634
- Goddamn it.
- I said, don't do that!

1436
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:46,713
Hey, why are you fuckin' 
freakin' out on us?

1437
01:55:46,738 --> 01:55:49,405
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today.
I'm through.

1438
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:51,444
Why don't you tell him 
at the same time why?

1439
01:55:51,468 --> 01:55:52,510
Don't worry, I will.

1440
01:55:52,535 --> 01:55:55,003
Yeah. And I bet you $10,000 
he laughs his ass off.

1441
01:55:55,027 --> 01:55:56,716
I don't give a damn if he does.

1442
01:55:57,495 --> 01:56:00,366
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1443
01:56:00,495 --> 01:56:02,581
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1444
01:56:02,606 --> 01:56:06,616
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped-

1445
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:09,233
What the fuck's happenin'?

1446
01:56:09,267 --> 01:56:10,833
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1447
01:56:10,858 --> 01:56:12,508
Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.

1448
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:13,901
Why the fuck'd you do that?

1449
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:15,865
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1450
01:56:15,890 --> 01:56:17,989
Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit 
in my time, but this...

1451
01:56:18,013 --> 01:56:21,854
Chill out, man! It was an accident. 
We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1452
01:56:21,879 --> 01:56:23,882
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1453
01:56:23,907 --> 01:56:27,366
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1454
01:56:27,391 --> 01:56:30,966
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1455
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:32,873
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1456
01:56:32,898 --> 01:56:36,329
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1457
01:56:36,354 --> 01:56:39,017
Just take it to a friendly place, 
that's all!

1458
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:41,779
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.

1459
01:56:41,804 --> 01:56:43,934
Well, Jules, 
this ain't my fuckin' town, man!

1460
01:56:43,959 --> 01:56:44,990
Shit!

1461
01:56:45,507 --> 01:56:47,913
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1462
01:56:47,938 --> 01:56:51,469
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1463
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:54,840
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1464
01:56:54,865 --> 01:56:57,310
'cause I ain't got no other partners
in 818.

1465
01:56:57,754 --> 01:57:00,107
Jimmie, how you doin', man? It's Jules.

1466
01:57:00,312 --> 01:57:01,514
Just listen up, man.

1467
01:57:01,539 --> 01:57:05,612
Me and my homeboy are in a car, 
and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1468
01:57:05,637 --> 01:57:07,955
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1469
01:57:09,134 --> 01:57:12,102
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1470
01:57:12,127 --> 01:57:15,082
He's one remark away from
kickin' our asses out the door.

1471
01:57:15,107 --> 01:57:16,174
If he does, what do we do?

1472
01:57:16,203 --> 01:57:18,191
We ain't leavin' 
'til we make a couple calls,

1473
01:57:18,216 --> 01:57:21,142
but I don't want it to reach that pitch. 
Jimmie's a friend.

1474
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:24,058
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1475
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:26,408
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1476
01:57:26,433 --> 01:57:28,791
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1477
01:57:28,816 --> 01:57:30,364
Put yourself in his position.

1478
01:57:30,388 --> 01:57:33,893
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up. 
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1479
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:36,778
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1480
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,103
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1481
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:43,972
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd 
you just do to his towel, man?

1482
01:57:43,996 --> 01:57:45,358
I was dryin' my hands!

1483
01:57:45,392 --> 01:57:47,484
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1484
01:57:47,498 --> 01:57:48,966
I watched you get 'em wet.

1485
01:57:48,991 --> 01:57:51,609
I was washin' 'em. 
This shit's hard to get off.

1486
01:57:51,634 --> 01:57:53,712
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1487
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:55,775
I used the same fuckin' soap you did, 
and when I finished,

1488
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,215
the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxi-pad!

1489
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,884
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1490
01:58:00,909 --> 01:58:04,581
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1491
01:58:06,144 --> 01:58:09,584
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1492
01:58:09,609 --> 01:58:14,153
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1493
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:16,877
All right. Fine. Fine.

1494
01:58:16,915 --> 01:58:19,259
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1495
01:58:19,768 --> 01:58:22,571
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1496
01:58:24,582 --> 01:58:29,580
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!
This some serious gourmet shit.

1497
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:33,632
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1498
01:58:33,657 --> 01:58:34,577
Right?

1499
01:58:34,823 --> 01:58:38,063
And he springs 
this serious gourmet shit on us.

1500
01:58:38,298 --> 01:58:40,501
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1501
01:58:41,246 --> 01:58:42,126
What?

1502
01:58:42,152 --> 01:58:44,969
I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is, okay?

1503
01:58:44,994 --> 01:58:47,305
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1504
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:49,411
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1505
01:58:49,796 --> 01:58:53,104
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1506
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:57,189
But you know what's on my mind right
now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1507
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:59,436
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1508
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:00,692
Jimmie, don't even worry-

1509
01:59:00,717 --> 01:59:03,435
Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1510
01:59:03,455 --> 01:59:05,054
When you came pulling in here,

1511
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:08,199
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1512
01:59:08,307 --> 01:59:09,506
You know I ain't seen no-

1513
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:13,776
Did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1514
01:59:14,368 --> 01:59:16,798
No. I didn't.

1515
01:59:16,823 --> 01:59:18,791
You know why you didn't see that sign?

1516
01:59:19,072 --> 01:59:19,761
Why?

1517
01:59:19,759 --> 01:59:22,891
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing
dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business,

1518
01:59:22,916 --> 01:59:24,034
that's why!

1519
01:59:24,059 --> 01:59:25,596
We're not gonna store the motherfucker-

1520
01:59:25,617 --> 01:59:27,408
Don't you fuckin' realize

1521
01:59:27,433 --> 01:59:31,598
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1522
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:35,268
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced. Okay?

1523
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:37,845
And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!

1524
01:59:38,448 --> 01:59:43,524
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1525
01:59:43,549 --> 01:59:45,375
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1526
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:49,872
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1527
01:59:49,897 --> 01:59:53,159
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's
gonna make me forget I love my wife.

1528
01:59:53,184 --> 01:59:54,204
Is there?

1529
01:59:56,291 --> 02:00:00,982
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1530
02:00:01,632 --> 02:00:04,244
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1531
02:00:04,269 --> 02:00:07,977
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1532
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:11,980
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1533
02:00:12,005 --> 02:00:14,828
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1534
02:00:14,853 --> 02:00:17,751
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1535
02:00:17,752 --> 02:00:20,682
You don't wanna fuck my shit?
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1536
02:00:20,707 --> 02:00:23,393
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time 
if Bonnie comes home.

1537
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,345
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1538
02:00:27,827 --> 02:00:29,796
Well, say she comes home.

1539
02:00:30,513 --> 02:00:32,321
What do you think she'll do?

1540
02:00:34,466 --> 02:00:39,052
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
That ain't no kinda answer.

1541
02:00:39,157 --> 02:00:42,220
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1542
02:00:42,755 --> 02:00:47,234
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie situation is.

1543
02:00:47,259 --> 02:00:51,233
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen

1544
02:00:51,258 --> 02:00:53,105
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1545
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:55,616
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1546
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:03,319
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1547
02:01:03,344 --> 02:01:05,559
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1548
02:01:05,584 --> 02:01:07,007
All I want to hear from your ass is,

1549
02:01:07,031 --> 02:01:09,762
"You ain't got no problem, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker.

1550
02:01:09,787 --> 02:01:14,370
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1551
02:01:14,566 --> 02:01:19,516
You ain't got no problem, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker.

1552
02:01:19,799 --> 02:01:25,005
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1553
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,515
You sendin' the Wolf?

1554
02:01:28,112 --> 02:01:29,923
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?

1555
02:01:30,258 --> 02:01:34,397
Shit, yeah, negro! 
That's all you had to say!

1556
02:01:35,391 --> 02:01:37,360
She the hysterical type?

1557
02:01:38,574 --> 02:01:40,291
When is she due?

1558
02:01:41,799 --> 02:01:43,088
Mm-hmm.

1559
02:01:43,778 --> 02:01:45,714
Give me the principals' names again.

1560
02:01:45,812 --> 02:01:47,108
Place your bets.

1561
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:50,159
Jules.

1562
02:01:50,195 --> 02:01:51,298
Cards, please.

1563
02:01:51,311 --> 02:01:52,471
Mm-hmm.

1564
02:01:52,938 --> 02:01:54,686
Vincent.

1565
02:01:59,519 --> 02:02:01,004
Jimmie.

1566
02:02:02,554 --> 02:02:04,736
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1567
02:02:09,444 --> 02:02:12,339
It's thirty minutes away. 
I'll be there in ten.

1568
02:02:29,858 --> 02:02:32,796
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1569
02:02:32,821 --> 02:02:33,739
It sure is.

1570
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:36,508
I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1571
02:02:36,644 --> 02:02:37,696
Good. We got one.

1572
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:39,354
So I heard. May I come in?

1573
02:02:39,379 --> 02:02:41,204
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1574
02:02:41,514 --> 02:02:45,279
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1575
02:02:45,304 --> 02:02:47,472
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1576
02:02:47,497 --> 02:02:50,397
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1577
02:02:50,422 --> 02:02:51,938
Uh, one hundred percent.

1578
02:02:51,963 --> 02:02:55,538
Your wife Bonnie comes home 
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?

1579
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:56,579
Uh-huh.

1580
02:02:56,604 --> 02:02:59,458
I was led to believe 
if she comes home and finds us here,

1581
02:02:59,482 --> 02:03:01,281
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1582
02:03:01,306 --> 02:03:02,439
She wouldn't at that.

1583
02:03:02,463 --> 02:03:06,022
That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1584
02:03:06,047 --> 02:03:08,933
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1585
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:13,380
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1586
02:03:21,296 --> 02:03:23,232
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1587
02:03:23,568 --> 02:03:25,015
Do me a favor, will ya?

1588
02:03:25,039 --> 02:03:27,695
Thought I smelled some coffee
back there. Would you make me a cup?

1589
02:03:28,563 --> 02:03:30,024
Uh, yeah, sure.

1590
02:03:32,196 --> 02:03:34,719
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1591
02:03:34,744 --> 02:03:36,745
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1592
02:03:39,851 --> 02:03:42,576
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1593
02:03:42,601 --> 02:03:45,611
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1594
02:03:45,636 --> 02:03:47,779
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.

1595
02:03:48,314 --> 02:03:49,367
Positive?

1596
02:03:49,513 --> 02:03:52,269
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1597
02:03:52,307 --> 02:03:55,105
As far as I know, 
the motherfucker's tip-top.

1598
02:03:55,717 --> 02:03:56,707
Good enough.

1599
02:03:57,515 --> 02:03:59,362
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1600
02:04:05,237 --> 02:04:07,625
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1601
02:04:13,168 --> 02:04:14,602
Mmm.

1602
02:04:15,862 --> 02:04:18,096
Okay, first thing. You two.

1603
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:20,555
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1604
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:23,254
Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1605
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,824
That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.

1606
02:04:26,848 --> 02:04:28,116
Yeah. Under the sink.

1607
02:04:28,141 --> 02:04:31,336
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products

1608
02:04:31,361 --> 02:04:35,093
and clean the inside of the car.
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1609
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:39,312
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1610
02:04:39,337 --> 02:04:42,021
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1611
02:04:42,046 --> 02:04:45,118
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1612
02:04:45,143 --> 02:04:47,143
Just give it a good once-over.

1613
02:04:47,168 --> 02:04:49,709
What you need to take care of 
are the really messy parts.

1614
02:04:50,088 --> 02:04:53,532
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1615
02:04:53,557 --> 02:04:56,406
Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet.

1616
02:04:56,431 --> 02:04:59,853
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1617
02:04:59,878 --> 02:05:03,369
The thicker the better, the darker
the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1618
02:05:03,394 --> 02:05:08,618
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards

1619
02:05:08,643 --> 02:05:10,405
with quilts and blankets,

1620
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:14,805
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1621
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:17,292
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1622
02:05:17,649 --> 02:05:18,957
Jimmie, lead the way.

1623
02:05:18,981 --> 02:05:20,157
Boys, get to work.

1624
02:05:20,605 --> 02:05:21,947
"Please" would be nice.

1625
02:05:23,076 --> 02:05:24,192
Come again?

1626
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:26,014
I said, a "please" would be nice.

1627
02:05:27,907 --> 02:05:30,188
Get it straight, buster. 
I'm not here to say please.

1628
02:05:30,212 --> 02:05:31,881
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1629
02:05:33,268 --> 02:05:35,594
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1630
02:05:35,619 --> 02:05:37,890
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1631
02:05:38,996 --> 02:05:42,787
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1632
02:05:42,812 --> 02:05:46,410
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1633
02:05:46,414 --> 02:05:49,758
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, 
okay? I respect you.

1634
02:05:49,778 --> 02:05:52,579
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1635
02:05:52,604 --> 02:05:55,322
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1636
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:57,160
I think fast, I talk fast,

1637
02:05:57,184 --> 02:05:59,953
and I need you guys to act fast 
if you wanna get out of this.

1638
02:06:00,258 --> 02:06:03,646
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1639
02:06:08,207 --> 02:06:11,519
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1640
02:06:14,549 --> 02:06:16,962
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1641
02:06:19,059 --> 02:06:20,275
Green.

1642
02:06:22,749 --> 02:06:24,762
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1643
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:30,334
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1644
02:06:31,925 --> 02:06:33,701
Nobody who'll be missed.

1645
02:06:35,889 --> 02:06:38,771
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1646
02:06:39,976 --> 02:06:41,027
How we comin', Jimmie?

1647
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:44,618
Pretty good. I got it all here, but, uh,

1648
02:06:45,325 --> 02:06:47,382
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston.

1649
02:06:47,391 --> 02:06:48,813
Jimmie, please. Winston.

1650
02:06:48,838 --> 02:06:52,014
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1651
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:54,199
Uh- Uh, no, thank you.

1652
02:06:54,224 --> 02:06:57,588
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1653
02:06:57,613 --> 02:07:02,605
and it's, uh, it was a wedding present
from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1654
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:04,681
They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-

1655
02:07:04,705 --> 02:07:06,734
Let me ask you a question, Jimmie.

1656
02:07:07,631 --> 02:07:10,078
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1657
02:07:12,039 --> 02:07:16,977
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1658
02:07:17,999 --> 02:07:19,207
No.

1659
02:07:19,589 --> 02:07:21,901
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1660
02:07:22,552 --> 02:07:26,013
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1661
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:26,871
Ginny.

1662
02:07:26,896 --> 02:07:33,041
Ginny were here, they would
furnish you with a whole bedroom set,

1663
02:07:33,066 --> 02:07:35,767
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1664
02:07:40,076 --> 02:07:44,016
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1665
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:46,916
How about you, Jimmie?

1666
02:07:48,302 --> 02:07:49,873
You an oak man?

1667
02:07:51,313 --> 02:07:52,630
Oak's nice.

1668
02:07:59,198 --> 02:08:03,070
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1669
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:05,303
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1670
02:08:05,328 --> 02:08:08,901
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong,

1671
02:08:08,926 --> 02:08:11,995
that he is immediately forgiven for all
wrongdoings? Have you ever heard that?

1672
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:14,005
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1673
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:16,983
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull

1674
02:08:17,008 --> 02:08:18,561
on account of your dumb ass.

1675
02:08:18,585 --> 02:08:21,812
I got a threshold, Jules, 
for the abuse that I will take.

1676
02:08:21,837 --> 02:08:24,828
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1677
02:08:24,853 --> 02:08:28,721
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1678
02:08:28,746 --> 02:08:30,842
That's all. I could blow.

1679
02:08:30,867 --> 02:08:33,041
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

1680
02:08:33,046 --> 02:08:35,950
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1681
02:08:35,975 --> 02:08:39,152
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1682
02:08:39,177 --> 02:08:41,113
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1683
02:08:41,138 --> 02:08:43,570
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1684
02:08:43,595 --> 02:08:46,969
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1685
02:08:46,994 --> 02:08:50,125
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1686
02:08:59,754 --> 02:09:01,565
Fine job, gentlemen.

1687
02:09:02,691 --> 02:09:04,735
You may get out of this yet.

1688
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,961
I can't believe this is the same car.

1689
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:10,612
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1690
02:09:10,983 --> 02:09:14,555
Phase one is complete: Clean the car,
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1691
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:15,993
Clean you two.

1692
02:09:18,878 --> 02:09:20,220
Strip.

1693
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:23,025
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1694
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:26,054
Quickly, gentlemen.

1695
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:30,232
We got about 15 minutes before Jimmie's
better half comes pulling into the driveway.

1696
02:09:30,257 --> 02:09:32,750
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1697
02:09:32,775 --> 02:09:34,940
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

1698
02:09:34,965 --> 02:09:37,166
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1699
02:09:37,191 --> 02:09:39,821
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1700
02:09:40,704 --> 02:09:44,074
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1701
02:09:48,497 --> 02:09:50,409
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1702
02:09:50,434 --> 02:09:51,623
Don't do nothin' stupid,

1703
02:09:51,647 --> 02:09:55,130
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1704
02:09:55,212 --> 02:09:57,013
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.

1705
02:09:57,256 --> 02:09:59,366
Jim, the soap.

1706
02:10:01,301 --> 02:10:02,043
Vincent.

1707
02:10:02,068 --> 02:10:03,338
Okay, gentlemen.

1708
02:10:03,450 --> 02:10:06,610
You both been to County before, I'm sure. 
Here it comes.

1709
02:10:06,884 --> 02:10:09,527
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1710
02:10:09,552 --> 02:10:11,490
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1711
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:16,066
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1712
02:10:16,108 --> 02:10:17,397
Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.

1713
02:10:17,412 --> 02:10:19,241
Hey, get out of my hair!

1714
02:10:19,266 --> 02:10:21,278
Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!

1715
02:10:22,903 --> 02:10:24,113
Towel.

1716
02:10:35,611 --> 02:10:37,866
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1717
02:10:40,304 --> 02:10:41,614
Perfect.

1718
02:10:42,017 --> 02:10:44,738
Perfect. 
We couldn't have planned this better.

1719
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,436
You guys look like...

1720
02:10:47,803 --> 02:10:49,830
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1721
02:10:50,122 --> 02:10:53,882
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1722
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:57,243
Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, 
motherfucker.

1723
02:10:57,268 --> 02:11:00,049
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1724
02:11:00,068 --> 02:11:01,441
Don't make me beg.

1725
02:11:04,979 --> 02:11:08,327
Okay, gentlemen, 
let's get our rules of the road straight.

1726
02:11:08,352 --> 02:11:11,172
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1727
02:11:11,665 --> 02:11:15,295
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1728
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:17,335
The place is North Hollywood,

1729
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:20,513
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1730
02:11:21,179 --> 02:11:24,669
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1731
02:11:26,011 --> 02:11:27,947
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1732
02:11:27,967 --> 02:11:31,907
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1733
02:11:31,932 --> 02:11:34,681
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something, right?

1734
02:11:34,686 --> 02:11:35,998
What did I say?

1735
02:11:36,232 --> 02:11:37,967
Don't do shit unless.

1736
02:11:37,992 --> 02:11:40,439
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1737
02:11:40,543 --> 02:11:42,744
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1738
02:11:42,852 --> 02:11:46,583
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1739
02:11:46,608 --> 02:11:50,708
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1740
02:11:50,733 --> 02:11:53,763
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1741
02:11:53,788 --> 02:11:56,320
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1742
02:11:56,345 --> 02:11:59,022
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1743
02:12:02,673 --> 02:12:04,292
Outta my way, Rex.

1744
02:12:06,226 --> 02:12:07,466
We cool?

1745
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:08,908
Like it never happened.

1746
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:10,329
All right.

1747
02:12:10,354 --> 02:12:15,334
Boys, this is Raquel.
Someday all this will be hers.

1748
02:12:15,435 --> 02:12:18,341
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1749
02:12:18,575 --> 02:12:20,835
You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

1750
02:12:22,924 --> 02:12:25,012
I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.

1751
02:12:25,099 --> 02:12:27,238
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1752
02:12:27,263 --> 02:12:28,630
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1753
02:12:28,805 --> 02:12:34,610
It's... It's your future. I...
I see a... a cab ride.

1754
02:12:34,883 --> 02:12:36,797
Move outta the sticks, fellas.

1755
02:12:36,822 --> 02:12:38,181
Say good night, Raquel.

1756
02:12:38,206 --> 02:12:39,374
Good night, Raquel.

1757
02:12:39,398 --> 02:12:42,796
I'll see you guys around.
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1758
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:46,672
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1759
02:12:46,697 --> 02:12:49,517
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1760
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:52,114
Call me Winston.

1761
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:56,674
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1762
02:12:56,977 --> 02:12:59,360
Respect for one's elders shows character.

1763
02:12:59,384 --> 02:13:01,113
I have character.

1764
02:13:01,352 --> 02:13:05,238
Because you are a character 
doesn't mean that you have character.

1765
02:13:13,124 --> 02:13:14,872
Wanna share a cab?

1766
02:13:15,333 --> 02:13:18,715
I'd go for some breakfast. 
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1767
02:13:19,082 --> 02:13:20,351
Cool.

1768
02:13:26,223 --> 02:13:28,948
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1769
02:13:28,973 --> 02:13:31,019
Yeah, he's about as European 
as fuckin' English Bob.

1770
02:13:31,043 --> 02:13:32,437
I know that now.

1771
02:13:32,462 --> 02:13:34,383
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1772
02:13:34,408 --> 02:13:37,204
Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1773
02:13:37,736 --> 02:13:41,716
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1774
02:13:43,264 --> 02:13:44,613
Want some bacon?

1775
02:13:44,638 --> 02:13:46,574
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1776
02:13:46,607 --> 02:13:47,709
Are you Jewish?

1777
02:13:47,736 --> 02:13:50,162
I ain't Jewish. 
I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1778
02:13:50,197 --> 02:13:51,360
Why not?

1779
02:13:51,562 --> 02:13:54,665
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

1780
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:58,353
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1781
02:13:58,378 --> 02:14:00,466
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,

1782
02:14:00,499 --> 02:14:03,287
but I'd never know 'cause 
I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.

1783
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:07,771
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1784
02:14:07,796 --> 02:14:11,033
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1785
02:14:11,148 --> 02:14:13,801
What about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.

1786
02:14:13,825 --> 02:14:15,486
I don't eat dog either.

1787
02:14:15,958 --> 02:14:18,715
Yeah, but do you consider a dog 
to be a filthy animal?

1788
02:14:19,309 --> 02:14:23,514
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog
filthy, but they're definitely dirty.

1789
02:14:23,689 --> 02:14:26,910
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

1790
02:14:26,934 --> 02:14:28,610
Ah, so, by that rationale,

1791
02:14:28,635 --> 02:14:33,124
if a pig had a better personality, he would
cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?

1792
02:14:33,148 --> 02:14:36,164
We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1793
02:14:36,322 --> 02:14:39,843
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1794
02:14:45,766 --> 02:14:47,895
Oh, man, that's good.

1795
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,646
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1796
02:14:51,696 --> 02:14:53,864
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1797
02:14:54,093 --> 02:14:56,953
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1798
02:14:57,102 --> 02:14:58,902
About the miracle we witnessed.

1799
02:14:59,272 --> 02:15:02,088
Miracle you witnessed. 
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

1800
02:15:02,226 --> 02:15:03,771
What is a miracle, Vincent?

1801
02:15:05,586 --> 02:15:08,418
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1802
02:15:12,266 --> 02:15:16,104
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1803
02:15:17,154 --> 02:15:21,070
But this morning, I don't think qualifies.

1804
02:15:21,094 --> 02:15:25,727
Hey, Vincent. See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1805
02:15:26,001 --> 02:15:30,821
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1806
02:15:31,128 --> 02:15:33,700
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1807
02:15:33,789 --> 02:15:35,702
Now, whether or not what we experienced

1808
02:15:35,727 --> 02:15:39,277
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1809
02:15:39,298 --> 02:15:43,508
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1810
02:15:43,533 --> 02:15:45,061
God got involved.

1811
02:15:45,878 --> 02:15:47,110
But why?

1812
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:50,129
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1813
02:15:50,154 --> 02:15:51,809
But I can't go back to sleep.

1814
02:15:51,833 --> 02:15:55,301
You're serious. You're
really thinkin' about quittin'.

1815
02:15:55,326 --> 02:15:56,874
- For life? 
- Yeah.

1816
02:15:56,907 --> 02:15:58,002
Most definitely.

1817
02:15:58,027 --> 02:16:01,398
Fuck. What you gonna do then?

1818
02:16:02,544 --> 02:16:06,179
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1819
02:16:06,863 --> 02:16:10,238
First I'm gonna deliver this case 
to Marsellus.

1820
02:16:10,671 --> 02:16:13,553
Then, basically, 
I'm just gonna walk the Earth.

1821
02:16:13,578 --> 02:16:15,312
What you mean, "walk the Earth"?

1822
02:16:15,336 --> 02:16:17,323
You know, like Caine in Kung Fu.

1823
02:16:17,348 --> 02:16:20,265
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1824
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:22,680
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1825
02:16:22,705 --> 02:16:24,775
'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.

1826
02:16:24,799 --> 02:16:26,210
What if He don't do that?

1827
02:16:26,228 --> 02:16:28,371
If it takes forever, 
then I'll walk forever.

1828
02:16:29,277 --> 02:16:31,134
So you decided to be a bum.

1829
02:16:31,266 --> 02:16:34,319
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1830
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:36,879
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,

1831
02:16:36,904 --> 02:16:40,206
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1832
02:16:40,231 --> 02:16:43,169
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1833
02:16:43,194 --> 02:16:46,151
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1834
02:16:46,156 --> 02:16:50,127
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1835
02:16:50,169 --> 02:16:52,105
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1836
02:16:52,130 --> 02:16:54,864
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1837
02:16:54,889 --> 02:16:57,906
Gar�on, coffee!

1838
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:02,385
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1839
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:05,426
- But water into wine, I...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1840
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,282
Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.

1841
02:17:07,306 --> 02:17:11,313
If my answers frighten you, then 
you should cease asking scary questions.

1842
02:17:14,483 --> 02:17:16,231
I'm gonna take a shit.

1843
02:17:20,519 --> 02:17:22,109
Let me ask you something.

1844
02:17:22,134 --> 02:17:23,567
When did you make this decision?

1845
02:17:23,591 --> 02:17:25,348
When you were sittin' there 
eatin' that muffin?

1846
02:17:25,373 --> 02:17:29,133
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1847
02:17:29,158 --> 02:17:30,928
replayin' the incident in my head,

1848
02:17:30,953 --> 02:17:34,757
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1849
02:17:35,616 --> 02:17:38,277
Fuck. To be continued.

1850
02:17:50,144 --> 02:17:51,648
I love you, Pumpkin.

1851
02:17:51,675 --> 02:17:53,310
I love you, Honey Bunny.

1852
02:17:54,733 --> 02:17:56,842
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1853
02:17:56,867 --> 02:17:59,675
Any one of you fucking pricks move,

1854
02:17:59,688 --> 02:18:02,910
and I'll execute 
every one of you motherfuckers!

1855
02:18:02,935 --> 02:18:04,511
- You got that? 
- Waitresses on the floor!

1856
02:18:04,536 --> 02:18:06,330
You just be quiet over there!

1857
02:18:06,355 --> 02:18:09,419
Get on the fuckin'-
Get the fuck down!

1858
02:18:09,444 --> 02:18:14,123
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1859
02:18:14,127 --> 02:18:15,681
Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!

1860
02:18:15,706 --> 02:18:18,627
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1861
02:18:19,061 --> 02:18:21,645
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1862
02:18:22,845 --> 02:18:24,490
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1863
02:18:24,515 --> 02:18:26,333
Fucking move! Move!

1864
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,643
Move! Get the fuck-

1865
02:18:30,681 --> 02:18:32,436
Get down on the fucking floor!

1866
02:18:32,461 --> 02:18:34,397
Grandpa! Down!

1867
02:18:34,422 --> 02:18:38,020
I'm the manager here, 
and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1868
02:18:38,045 --> 02:18:40,983
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1869
02:18:40,988 --> 02:18:44,326
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1870
02:18:46,201 --> 02:18:48,128
I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.

1871
02:18:48,139 --> 02:18:50,067
Well, just execute him!

1872
02:18:50,961 --> 02:18:53,490
I am not a hero. I'm just
a coffee shop manager.

1873
02:18:53,515 --> 02:18:54,962
Get the fuck down!

1874
02:18:54,987 --> 02:18:56,752
The restaurant's ours!

1875
02:18:56,777 --> 02:18:58,994
Just take whatever you want.

1876
02:19:00,076 --> 02:19:01,862
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1877
02:19:01,887 --> 02:19:05,097
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1878
02:19:05,122 --> 02:19:06,836
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1879
02:19:09,178 --> 02:19:10,976
Listen, everybody.

1880
02:19:11,197 --> 02:19:16,420
Be calm, cooperate, and
this'll all be over in a minute!

1881
02:19:16,445 --> 02:19:18,415
Get the fuck down! Well done.

1882
02:19:30,395 --> 02:19:33,888
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1883
02:19:33,913 --> 02:19:37,375
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1884
02:19:37,714 --> 02:19:39,782
I said, are we fucking clear?

1885
02:19:40,062 --> 02:19:42,430
Good! Now, wallets out!

1886
02:19:43,125 --> 02:19:46,513
That's it. Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1887
02:19:46,742 --> 02:19:49,722
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1888
02:19:49,747 --> 02:19:51,120
In the bag.

1889
02:19:51,842 --> 02:19:54,561
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

1890
02:19:54,586 --> 02:19:57,524
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1891
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:00,038
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1892
02:20:00,063 --> 02:20:01,656
In the fucking bag.

1893
02:20:03,407 --> 02:20:06,509
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1894
02:20:06,872 --> 02:20:09,291
In the bag. In the bag.

1895
02:20:21,924 --> 02:20:23,223
In the bag.

1896
02:20:38,991 --> 02:20:41,616
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1897
02:20:41,641 --> 02:20:44,119
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1898
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:45,189
Sounds like a shit job.

1899
02:20:45,213 --> 02:20:47,118
Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1900
02:20:47,143 --> 02:20:48,307
Open it.

1901
02:20:48,541 --> 02:20:50,072
'Fraid I can't do that.

1902
02:20:52,027 --> 02:20:53,014
I didn't hear you.

1903
02:20:53,038 --> 02:20:54,200
Yes, you did.

1904
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,949
What's going on?

1905
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:59,751
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.

1906
02:20:59,775 --> 02:21:01,265
Shoot him in the face!

1907
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,619
I hate to shatter your ego,

1908
02:21:02,643 --> 02:21:05,029
but this ain't the first time 
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1909
02:21:05,054 --> 02:21:07,236
If you don't take your hand off that case, 
it'll be your last.

1910
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:09,478
Stop causing problems! 
You'll get us all killed!

1911
02:21:09,503 --> 02:21:11,468
Give 'em what you got 
and get 'em outta here!

1912
02:21:11,493 --> 02:21:14,542
Shut the fuck up, fat man! 
This ain't none of your goddamn business!

1913
02:21:15,811 --> 02:21:20,053
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.
No problem. I got it under control.

1914
02:21:21,688 --> 02:21:23,681
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1915
02:21:25,413 --> 02:21:29,165
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1916
02:21:33,617 --> 02:21:34,979
We clear?

1917
02:21:38,928 --> 02:21:40,055
One.

1918
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:44,505
Two.

1919
02:21:45,879 --> 02:21:47,229
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1920
02:21:47,437 --> 02:21:50,218
You win. It's yours.

1921
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:57,630
Open it.

1922
02:22:02,197 --> 02:22:03,636
Hey, what is it?

1923
02:22:04,606 --> 02:22:05,956
What is it?

1924
02:22:07,816 --> 02:22:09,405
Is that what I think it is?

1925
02:22:09,430 --> 02:22:10,421
Mm-hmm.

1926
02:22:14,205 --> 02:22:15,498
It's beautiful.

1927
02:22:15,523 --> 02:22:17,914
Goddamn it, what is it?

1928
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,871
You let him go! You let him go!

1929
02:22:22,896 --> 02:22:25,580
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1930
02:22:25,587 --> 02:22:27,556
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

1931
02:22:27,581 --> 02:22:29,049
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"

1932
02:22:29,082 --> 02:22:31,630
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1933
02:22:31,655 --> 02:22:33,326
Chill that fuckin' bitch out!

1934
02:22:33,336 --> 02:22:34,763
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
- Let go of him!

1935
02:22:34,784 --> 02:22:36,477
- Chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1936
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:38,567
- Now tell her it's gonna be alright.
- It's gonna be alright.

1937
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:39,605
- Promise her! 
- I promise!

1938
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:41,667
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1939
02:22:41,692 --> 02:22:42,886
Now tell me her name.

1940
02:22:42,910 --> 02:22:43,669
Yolanda.

1941
02:22:43,694 --> 02:22:47,082
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1942
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,981
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1943
02:22:49,978 --> 02:22:53,740
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1944
02:22:54,923 --> 02:22:56,826
Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?

1945
02:22:56,851 --> 02:22:57,616
He's cool.

1946
02:22:57,641 --> 02:22:58,928
- What?
- Cool.

1947
02:22:58,953 --> 02:23:04,179
Correctamundo. And that's what
we're gonna be. We're gonna be cool.

1948
02:23:04,534 --> 02:23:08,414
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1949
02:23:09,435 --> 02:23:13,688
And when I count three, 
I want you to let go of your gun,

1950
02:23:13,713 --> 02:23:17,724
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1951
02:23:18,817 --> 02:23:22,459
And when you do it, you do it cool.

1952
02:23:23,167 --> 02:23:24,485
You ready?

1953
02:23:25,467 --> 02:23:26,709
One,

1954
02:23:27,628 --> 02:23:28,846
two,

1955
02:23:30,008 --> 02:23:31,053
three.

1956
02:23:39,901 --> 02:23:41,421
Okay, now you let him go!

1957
02:23:41,446 --> 02:23:43,624
Yolanda! I thought you were gonna be cool.

1958
02:23:43,664 --> 02:23:45,882
Now, when you yell at me, 
it makes me nervous.

1959
02:23:45,907 --> 02:23:48,114
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1960
02:23:48,139 --> 02:23:52,353
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1961
02:23:53,677 --> 02:23:57,309
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1962
02:23:58,022 --> 02:24:00,349
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1963
02:24:00,708 --> 02:24:04,503
But I don't want that.
And you don't want that.

1964
02:24:04,528 --> 02:24:07,508
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1965
02:24:07,533 --> 02:24:09,295
So let's see what we can do.

1966
02:24:11,136 --> 02:24:14,737
Now... here's the situation.

1967
02:24:15,705 --> 02:24:19,107
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1968
02:24:19,132 --> 02:24:22,103
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1969
02:24:22,128 --> 02:24:24,597
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1970
02:24:24,664 --> 02:24:28,672
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1971
02:24:29,323 --> 02:24:32,395
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning

1972
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:34,875
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1973
02:24:35,873 --> 02:24:37,107
Vincent!

1974
02:24:37,132 --> 02:24:38,413
- Be cool! 
- Get back!

1975
02:24:39,012 --> 02:24:43,498
Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
It's cool! We still just talkin'.

1976
02:24:43,523 --> 02:24:46,163
Come on. Point the gun at me. 
Point the gun at me.

1977
02:24:46,187 --> 02:24:47,542
There you go.

1978
02:24:47,567 --> 02:24:51,889
Now, Vincent, you just hang back 
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1979
02:24:51,914 --> 02:24:53,508
Tell her it's still cool.

1980
02:24:54,286 --> 02:24:56,895
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1981
02:24:58,207 --> 02:25:00,309
I-I gotta go pee.

1982
02:25:00,967 --> 02:25:02,383
I wanna go home.

1983
02:25:02,408 --> 02:25:07,325
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you. It's almost over.

1984
02:25:07,591 --> 02:25:09,017
Tell her you're proud of her.

1985
02:25:09,635 --> 02:25:11,121
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

1986
02:25:11,276 --> 02:25:12,669
I love you.

1987
02:25:12,841 --> 02:25:14,478
I love you too, Honey Bunny.

1988
02:25:14,502 --> 02:25:20,276
Now, I want you to go in that bag 
and find my wallet.

1989
02:25:22,686 --> 02:25:23,861
Which one is it?

1990
02:25:23,891 --> 02:25:26,319
It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker".

1991
02:25:40,876 --> 02:25:44,089
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1992
02:25:44,114 --> 02:25:46,299
Open it up. Take out the money.

1993
02:25:52,354 --> 02:25:53,727
Count it.

1994
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:01,847
How much is there?

1995
02:26:05,041 --> 02:26:06,615
About 1,500 dollars.

1996
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,022
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1997
02:26:09,918 --> 02:26:12,755
Now, with the rest of those wallets 
and the register,

1998
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:15,022
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1999
02:26:15,047 --> 02:26:17,361
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 
1,500 dollars,

2000
02:26:17,385 --> 02:26:19,021
and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2001
02:26:19,046 --> 02:26:22,124
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2002
02:26:22,149 --> 02:26:24,244
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2003
02:26:25,015 --> 02:26:27,589
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2004
02:26:29,072 --> 02:26:33,730
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.
I'm buyin' something for my money.

2005
02:26:35,029 --> 02:26:36,932
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?

2006
02:26:37,159 --> 02:26:38,190
What?

2007
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:42,872
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2008
02:26:44,285 --> 02:26:45,979
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2009
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:48,783
Not regularly, no.

2010
02:26:48,808 --> 02:26:51,279
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

2011
02:26:51,555 --> 02:26:53,908
Ezekiel 25:17.

2012
02:26:55,023 --> 02:26:57,859
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides

2013
02:26:57,884 --> 02:27:01,999
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

2014
02:27:02,466 --> 02:27:05,408
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2015
02:27:05,433 --> 02:27:07,710
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2016
02:27:07,735 --> 02:27:11,580
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2017
02:27:12,082 --> 02:27:16,512
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger

2018
02:27:16,537 --> 02:27:19,600
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2019
02:27:20,175 --> 02:27:25,386
And you will know I am the Lord
when I lay My vengeance upon you."

2020
02:27:27,178 --> 02:27:32,619
I been sayin' that shit for years,
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2021
02:27:33,984 --> 02:27:36,074
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2022
02:27:36,099 --> 02:27:39,135
I just thought it was some
coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker

2023
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:41,136
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2024
02:27:41,346 --> 02:27:44,084
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2025
02:27:45,065 --> 02:27:48,761
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means

2026
02:27:48,786 --> 02:27:52,894
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2027
02:27:52,919 --> 02:27:55,065
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,

2028
02:27:55,083 --> 02:27:58,648
he's the shepherd protecting 
my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.

2029
02:27:59,558 --> 02:28:05,106
Or it could mean you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2030
02:28:05,131 --> 02:28:08,499
and it's the world that's evil and selfish.

2031
02:28:08,995 --> 02:28:10,930
Now, I'd like that.

2032
02:28:11,403 --> 02:28:13,590
But that shit ain't the truth.

2033
02:28:14,572 --> 02:28:16,323
The truth is,

2034
02:28:17,682 --> 02:28:19,708
you're the weak...

2035
02:28:20,609 --> 02:28:23,770
...and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2036
02:28:25,443 --> 02:28:27,379
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2037
02:28:28,742 --> 02:28:33,524
I'm tryin' real hard...
to be the shepherd.

2038
02:28:49,335 --> 02:28:50,574
Go.

2039
02:29:09,513 --> 02:29:11,537
I think we should be leaving now.

2040
02:29:11,904 --> 02:29:14,232
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
