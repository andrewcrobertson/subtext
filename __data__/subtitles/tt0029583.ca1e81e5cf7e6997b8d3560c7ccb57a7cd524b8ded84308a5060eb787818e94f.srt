little chairs!

153
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,920
Must be seven
little children.

155
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,480
seven untidy little children.

156
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,520

Why, they've never
swept this room.

165

You'd think
their mother would...

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,000
Maybe they have no mother.

167
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,960
Then they're orphans.

168
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
That's too bad.

169
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,280

Now, you wash the dishes.

173
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
You tidy up the room.

174
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,320
You clean the fireplace.

175
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400

Let's kill it

364
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
What'll we do?

365
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,560
Hide.

366
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
Oh, dear.

367
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,720
I wonder if
the children are...

368
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,720
Oh!

369
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,080
Why, why, you're little men!

370
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,360
How do you do?

371
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,600
I said, how do you do?

372
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
How do you do what?

373
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,960
Oh, you can talk!
I'm so glad!

374
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,200
Now, don't tell me
who you are.

375
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
Let me guess.

376
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I know, you're Doc.

377
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,600
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.

378
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,600
And you're, you're Bashful.

379
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Oh, gosh!

380
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
And you, you're Sleepy.

381
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,800
How'd you guess?

382
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,120
And you?

383
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,880
And you're Sneezy.

384
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,280
Yes, and you must be...

385
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
Happy, ma'am. That's me.

386
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,560
And this is Dopey.
He don't talk none.

387
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,440
You mean he can't talk?

388
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
He don't know.
He never tried.

389
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,920
Oh, that's too bad.

390
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,600
Oh!

391
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,440
You must be Grumpy.

392
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh, yes! Yes!

393
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,000
Hah! We know who we are.

394
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,800
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

395
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,200
Hmph! Yeah!

396
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,200

Who are you, my dear?

398
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,080
Oh, how silly of me.
I'm Snow White.

399
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,960

400
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000

401
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,720
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.

402

Mad as hornets!
No, no, we're not.

410
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,200
Aw, shut up and

411
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,800
Please don't send me away!

412
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
If you do, she'll kill me.
- Kill you?

413
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,200
- Who will?
- Yes, who?

414
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,280
My stepmother, the Queen.
- The Queen?

415
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
She's wicked!
She's bad!

416
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,080
She's mighty mean!

417
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,080
She's an old witch!

418
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm warnin' ya.

419
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,680
If the Queen
finds her here,

420
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,200
she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!

421
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,880
But she doesn't
know where I am!

422
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,840
She don't, eh?
She knows everything.

423
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,560
She's full of black magic.

424
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,720
She can even make
herself invisible.

425
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,880
Pfft!

426
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,560
Might be in this
room right now.

427
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,400
Oh, she'll never
find me here.

428
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,040
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

429
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,760
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

430

Supper's not quite ready.

443
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,640
You'll just have
time to wash.

444
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Wash? Wash?

445
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,760
Wash? Wash? Wash?

446
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,120
Hah! Knew there
was a catch to it.

447
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
Why wash?

448
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,800
What for?
We ain't goin' nowhere.

449
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
'Tain't New Year's.

450

Oh, perhaps you have washed.

451
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
Perhaps we...

452
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,120
Yes! Perhaps we have.

453
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,520
But when?

454
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,560
When? When.
Uh, you said whe...

455
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,560
Why, last week.

456
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,760

467
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,440
Goodness me,
this will never do.

468
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,600
March straight
outside and wash,

469
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,720

a bite to eat.

470

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,440
Well, it'll please
the Princess.

00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,760
Over the seven jeweled hills

539
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,400
beyond the seventh fall,

540
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,920
in the cottage of
the seven dwarfs

541
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,720
dwells Snow White,
fairest one of all.

542
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,920
Snow White lies dead
in the forest.

543
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,600
The Huntsman has
brought me proof.

544
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,120
Behold her heart.

545
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,680
Snow White still lives,

546
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,880
the fairest in the land.

547
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,720
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

548
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,360
The heart of a pig!

549
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,000
Then I've been tricked!

550
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,400
The heart of a pig!

551
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,040
The blundering fool!

552
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,840
I'll go myself to
the dwarfs' cottage

553
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,840
in a disguise so complete

554
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,400
no one will ever suspect.

555
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,600
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

556
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,080
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

557
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,880
Mummy Dust to make me old.

558
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,320
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

559
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,880
To age my voice,
an old hag's cackle.

560
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,560
To whiten my hair,
a scream of fright.

561
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,720
A blast of wind

562
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,320
to fan my hate!

563
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,040
A thunderbolt

564
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,120
to mix it well.

565
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,160
Now,

566
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,240
begin thy magic spell.

567
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,960
Look!

568
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,280
My hands!

569
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,640
My voice!

570
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,560
My voice.

571
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,960
A perfect disguise.

572
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,000
And now...

573
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,000
A special sort of death

574
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,680

575
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,360

don't get excited.

655

Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

Death seep through!

what lies within.

667
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,160
Now, turn red
to tempt Snow White.

668
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,040
To make her hunger
for a bite.

669
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,880
Have a bite?

670
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,120
It's not for you.

671
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,560
It's for Snow White.

672
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,280
When she breaks
the tender peel

673
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,080
to taste the apple
in my hand,

674
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,880
her breath will still,
her blood congeal.

675
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,720
Then I'll be
fairest in the land!

676
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,080
But wait!

677
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,040
There may be an antidote.

678
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,240
Nothing must be overlooked.

679
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,280
Oh, here it is!

680
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,920
"Love's First Kiss."

681
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,280
Bah!

682
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,720
No fear of that.

683
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,680
The dwarfs will
think she's dead.

684
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,280
She'll be buried alive!

685
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,360
Buried alive!

686
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,480

691
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,000

All alone, my pet?

Why, why, yes, I am. But...

731
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,400
The, the little men
are not here?

732
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,440
No, they're not, but...

733
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,960
Mmm-hmm.

734
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,680
Making pies?

735
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,640
Yes, gooseberry pies.

736
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,960
It's apple pies

737
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,280
that make the menfolks'
mouths water.

738
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,760
Pies made from
apples like these.

739
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,520
Oh, they do
look delicious.

740
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,800
Yes!

741
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,360
But wait 'til you
taste one, dearie.

742
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,160
Like to try one?

743
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,440
Hmm?

744
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,280
Go on. Go on,
have a bite.

745
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,640
Stop it! Stop it!
Go away! Go away!

746
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,560
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

747
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,320
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

748
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,040
There, there.
I'm sorry.

749
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,080
Oh! My heart!

750
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,120
Oh, my... My poor heart.

751
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,040
Take me into the house
and let me rest.

752
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,280
A drink of water,
please.

753
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,280

Stop that! Get away, boy.
Get away! Go on, shoo!

758
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,560
Go on! Get outta here!

759
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,720
What ails these
crazy birds?

760
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,960
They've gone plumb daffy.

761
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,240
Yeah, they've...

762
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,800
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,

763
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,000
I'll share
a secret with you.

764
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,680
This is no ordinary apple.

765
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,400
It's a magic wishing apple.

766
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,200
A wishing apple?

767
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,680
Yes!

768
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,720
One bite and all your dreams will come true.

769
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,160
Really?

770
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,480
Yes, girlie.

771
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,960
Now, make a wish

772
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,400
and take a bite.

773
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,960
Go on, get!

774
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,160
These pesky critters
won't stop.

775
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,920
- 'Tain't natural.
- There's something wrong.

776
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,880
They ain't actin'
this way for nothin'.

777
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,720
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

778
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,520
The Queen!
- Snow White!

779
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,040
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

780
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,600
Yes! Yes!
We, we, we gotta save her!

781
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,160
She'll kill her!
What'll we do?

782
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,400
Yes,
yes, what'll we do?

783
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,800
Come on! Giddap!

784
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,680
Wait for me! Wait for...

785
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,160
There must be something
your little heart desires.

786
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,520
Perhaps there's
someone you love.

787
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Well, there is someone.

788
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,520
I thought so. I thought so!

789
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,560
Old Granny knows
a young girl's heart.

790
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,480
Now, take
the apple, dearie,

791
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,160
and make a wish.

792
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,040
I wish... I wish...

793
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,440
That's it, go on! Go on.

794
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,200
And that he will carry me away to his castle

795
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,600
where we will live
happily ever after.

796
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,600
Fine! Fine!
Now take a bite.

797
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,240
Don't let
the wish grow cold!

798
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,040
Oh, I feel strange.

799
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,440
Her breath will still.

800
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,520
Oh. Oh.

801
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,920
Her blood congeal.

802
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,560
Oh.

803
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,480
Now I'll be
fairest in the land!

804
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,000
Hurry, hurry.

805
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,480
There she goes!

806
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,920
After her!

807
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,080
I'm trapped! What will I do?

808
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,320
The meddling little fools!

809
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,160
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

810
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,000
I'll fix ya!
I'll crush your bones!

811
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,520
