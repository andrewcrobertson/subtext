1
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,501
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

2
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:55,501
Get that monkey on the train.

3
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,042
The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!

4
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,709
Breathing normal...

5
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,292
heart rate normal.

6
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,667
You're cleared to perform.

7
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,751
Milly!
Another train!

8
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,417
Ninos, wait!
We are coming, too!

9
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,501
Joplin!

10
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,292
Joplin, Missouri!

11
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,459
- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!

12
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,459
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

13
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:10,834
You know,
in the letter I sent?

14
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,459
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.

15
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,834
Well, come here now.

16
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,250
Still me.

17
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,876
And you...

18
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,334
you're just as pretty
as your momma.

19
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,292
We missed you, Dad.

20
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,000
I missed you, too.

21
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,542
Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...

22
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,334
for looking out for them.

23
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,792
Captain Farrier,
of course.

24
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,584
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

25
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:57,918
It's just Holt.

26
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,542
Don't you worry.

27
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,417
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

28
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:08,626
Come on! Come on!

29
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:10,000
Home sweet home.

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,292
- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.

31
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,626
- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!

32
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,834
Hi, Holt.

33
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,501
Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.

34
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,626
Pramesh!

35
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,334
The very best journey,
dear friend.

36
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,792
The road that leads home.

37
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,667
Welcome home.

38
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:32,375
No hugs!

39
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,375
Pramesh,
I missed you, too.

40
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,542
What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.

41
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,042
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

42
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,792
Attention, everybody!

43
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:54,751
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

44
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,542
Because
"keep the cages locked"

45
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,834
is the most important
rule of all!

46
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,834
When I catch
that fugitive scalawag

47
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,542
who interrupted my dream...

48
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,501
Rongo!

49
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,834
Where is Rongo?

50
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,918
Who's heading
camp management?

51
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,167
I'm the strongman.

52
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,834
Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!

53
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,667
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

54
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,167
Which means
animal whereabouts!

55
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,167
Now, go find that monkey!

56
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,083
I'll have a look around.

57
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,667
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

58
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:37,959
Holt!

59
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,709
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

60
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,167
Natalya, Vincenzo...

61
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,834
the Vanderjees, and then...

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,626
your wife.

63
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:02,918
Poor Annie.

64
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,667
How she fought.

65
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,959
She was the best of us.

66
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,042
I know it.

67
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,751
So, uh, you know, for her,

68
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,042
let's have
our best season yet!

69
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,959
Now where's my horses?

70
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,209
Ah...

71
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,083
Funny story about that.

72
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,626
Funny how?

73
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,667
He sold them.

74
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,459
But our act is the soul
of this show!

75
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:36,000
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,501
If only Milly would have
learned the trade.

77
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,918
I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.

78
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,042
- "Show-off"?
- You see?

79
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,709
I wanna make
scientific discoveries.

80
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,542
I wanna be noticed
for my mind.

81
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,626
Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!

83
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:54,667
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

84
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,083
Oh.

85
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,083
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

86
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,834
Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?

87
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,250
The crowds come to see me!

88
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
Max, please.

89
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,667
I need to work.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,709
Good news.

91
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,542
One job, I have.

92
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,584
Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.

93
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,250
You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?

94
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,959
He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.

95
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,083
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

96
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,209
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

97
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,250
No, you can't... 
You're not serious.

98
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,626
I am on occasion.

99
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,167
This is a big job
and you know it.

100
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,792
No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...

101
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,792
Dad.

102
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,667
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

103
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,918
Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.

104
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:47,167
They're important.
Especially this season.

105
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,209
Why's that?

106
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,042
I know it goes
against my nature...

107
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,834
but for once,
I made an investment.

108
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,042
Bellissima!
There she is!

109
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,834
Our brand-new Asian female.

110
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,792
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

111
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,792
I had to get him
way down on the price.

112
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,584
But I swear to you, Holt,

113
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:12,667
I saw something special
in her eyes.

114
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,000
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Oh, no. She's not sick.

116
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,751
Any day now...

117
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,042
she's having a baby.

118
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,125
Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!

119
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,834
Hang on now,
this is our tent?

120
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,375
What happened to our things?

121
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,792
We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.

122
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,125
Max, what didn't you sell?

123
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,042
You son of a gun.

124
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,125
Dad, look!

125
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,000
Toys?

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,834
They're not toys.

127
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,334
They're for
my science experiments.

128
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:52,042
Well, we're a circus,
darlin', a circus.

129
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,792
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

130
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,375
You couldn't
just take up one act?

131
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,792
Tumblin' or tightrope?

132
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,709
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,751
Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.

134
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,334
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

135
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,918
Mom did.

136
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,125
Yeah, well,
I make them now.

137
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,250
So just, uh...
Go to your room!

138
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,667
This is my room.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,209
This is all our rooms.

140
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,292
See this?

141
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,125
You know what this is?

142
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,667
It's your inheritance.

143
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,334
Dad!

144
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,792
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

145
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,667
He's stuck here.

146
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,209
Like you and me.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,667
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

148
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:53,125
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

149
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,000
A new season!

150
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,292
Let me in,
you little hairball!

151
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,209
Hey!

152
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:23,751
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

153
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,209
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

154
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,501
The elephants need us!

155
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,959
Good God, son,

156
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,417
you're gonna make me
miss the war.

157
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,751
Gimme that.

158
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,042
Go on, lead the way.

159
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,918
Move it!

160
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,083
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

161
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't make me
have to incentivize.

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,083
Get her out of there, boys.

163
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,918
Easy, Rufus.

164
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,459
That's a lady in there.

165
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,125
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

166
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,334
But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.

167
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,083
Time to see
what he's been missing.

168
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,792
Do you ever
get that feeling?

169
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,209
Like there's something
you're missing?

170
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,459
Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.

171
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,125
- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.

172
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,042
Dad? Something's wrong.

173
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,375
She doesn't wanna leave.

174
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,375
Come on!

175
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,918
Let's get her outta there!

176
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,792
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,459
Leave her alone!

178
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,292
- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!

179
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,167
Dad, look.

180
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,459
What now?

181
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,876
Move her!

182
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:28,918
Whoa, we got
a baby in here.

183
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,626
She had a baby!

184
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:36,876
- Baby!
- Huh?

185
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,042
Notify the press!

186
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,292
"The Medici Brothers...

187
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,375
"proudly present
America's newest,

188
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,334
"precious bundle of joy!"

189
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,501
Look at that.

190
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,125
It's okay now.

191
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,292
Don't be scared.

192
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,375
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

193
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,375
Baby! We got a baby!

194
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,959
We got a baby!

195
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,626
What is that?

196
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:40,959
Baby Jumbo.

197
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:45,250
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

198
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,459
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

199
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,459
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

200
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,417
Gone and
bought yourself a baby monster.

201
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,459
Think he can hear me?

202
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,501
Boo!

203
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,209
Rongo!

We are not advertising

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,292
Tell me you didn't do it.

210
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,209
You did it?

211
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,334
Never do anything I tell ya

212
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,292
without checking
with me first!

213
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,667
Why me? Why me?

214
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,959
A face
only a mother could love.

215
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,125
Sir?

216
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,459
Many of us
find you handsome.

217
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,292
I was talking
about the elephant!

218
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,584
Look, she's drawing him
a bath.

219
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,334
Need a vet to come
to look at him, Max.

220
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,125
No, no witnesses!

221
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,042
We are going to be in Joplin
for two weeks.

222
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,626
We promised them
a beautiful baby!

223
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,083
You have until tomorrow
night to fix that!

224
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,626
- Me?
- Yes, you!

225
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,000
This is my problem?

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,292
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

227
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,167
Make those ears disappear!

228
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't look at me.

229
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,667
Look at him, those
giant ears weigh him down.

230
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,584
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

231
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,459
Welcome to the circus.

232
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,417
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

233
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,042
Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?

234
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,334
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

235
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,542
Someone needs to
keep him company.

236
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,751
when he's not with his momma.

237
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,334
Look. Give him one.

238
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:21,501
If he can lift his ears
out of the way.

239
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,667
No. You have to blow
your ears out of the way.

240
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,542
Like this.

241
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,125
Good luck with that.

242
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,167
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

243
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,792
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

244
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,125
Do what I do.

245
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,334
Blow.

246
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,167
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

247
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,125
He thinks it's a game.

248
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,209
- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?

249
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,125
Watch this.

250
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,292
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

251
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,292
stampede!

252
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,375
Send 'em!

253
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,375
Get out of the way, Max!

254
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,751
I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.

255
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,334
Let me have a turn.

256
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,459
Meanwhile, for when you

257
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,667
- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.

258
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,751
I had the
costume departments

259
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:36,876
make you up
a little something.

260
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:37,876
Okay.

261
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,792
What in gosh...

262
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:42,792
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

263
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,417
A lot of kids
come to the show.

264
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,209
You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.

265
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,334
Dad, Dad!

266
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,751
It's Baby Jumbo.
Come see.

267
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,709
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

268
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,375
Guys,
I said leave him be.

269
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,542
But he was this
far off the ground!

270
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,876
Yeah, I bet he was.

271
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,709
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

272
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,626
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

273
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,334
Just leave the poor guy alone.

274
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,584
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

275
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,876
Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.

276
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,167
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

277
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,792
Annie knew
how to talk to 'em.

278
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,709
Ladies and gentlemen,

279
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,292
boys and girls,
step right up.

280
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,417
Hurry, hurry.

281
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,459
Come see the circus today.

282
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:37,584
"To be or not to be...

283
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,834
"that is the question.

284
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,751
"Whether 'tis
nobler in the mind

285
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,751
"to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous..."

286
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,918
That ain't no snake.

287
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,709
Heck, I could do it.

288
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,375
As you wish.

289
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,918
Get out of here!

290
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,918
Rongo, let's go!

291
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,209
Hey, get away
from the baby elephant!

292
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,918
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

293
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:45,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,334
I am
your Master of Ceremonies,

295
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,292
Maximilian Medici.

296
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,626
And now, I give to you...

297
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,959
the Medici Brothers' circus.

298
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:06,667
Okay.

299
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,501
Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.

300
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,250
Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.

301
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:41,501
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

302
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,918
Hey!
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

303
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,417
Nah, he died
in the war. So sad.

304
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,334
Aw!

305
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:58,709
Aw!

306
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,709
What's he doing?

307
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,334
He's reaching
for the feathers.

308
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,667
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

309
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,834
Ooh...

310
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,501
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

311
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,042
Those ears are fake!

312
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,959
Look! Look at the sign!

313
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,751
"Dumbo!"

314
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,876
Uh-oh.

315
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,083
Whoa, calm down, now.

316
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:04,876
He's a fake!

317
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,125
Yeah, he's a fake!

318
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,792
Shut up!

319
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,626
You're scaring the elephants!

320
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,751
Take it easy now.
Calm down.

321
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,751
Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

322
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,125
All right, sit down.

323
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:18,876
Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!

324
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:19,918
I said sit down!

325
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,083
It's okay, little fella.

326
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:24,918
Fake!

327
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,667
Rongo! Music!

328
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,751
Happiness, joy!

329
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,751
Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?

330
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,626
Who's gonna help him now?

331
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,459
Holt, get those ears
off the stage!

332
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:53,709
Whoa!

333
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,042
Okay, all right.

334
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,459
Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

335
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:03,584
Just calm down.

336
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,542
Okay. Attagirl.

337
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,417
We're here to protect him.
Same as you.

338
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,667
Attagirl.

339
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,876
Nice and easy.

340
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,876
Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

341
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,584
Rufus, no!

342
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,042
- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!

343
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,125
Get back!

344
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,167
Max, get the kids out of here!

345
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,042
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

346
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,584
Careful, careful.

347
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,000
Kids?

348
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,542
Go, go, go!

349
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,626
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

350
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:50,709
Come on. This way, come on.

351
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,042
How do you like your job now,
cowboy?

352
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:58,834
Uh-oh.

353
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,542
Milly, Joe! Come on!

354
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,751
Let's go!
Come on!

355
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,876
And I wanna
just emphasize,

356
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,542
we did everything right.

357
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,584
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

358
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:47,959
It just collapsed.

359
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,959
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

360
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,417
Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,

361
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,792
do you understand?

362
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,417
This is what they're reading

363
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,000
from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!

364
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,083
You have
a moral responsibility

365
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,083
to buy
your killer elephant back.

366
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,250
What about the baby?

367
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,292
Well, at least
he got a few laughs.

368
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,918
I'll put him
in the clown act,

369
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:17,083
see if I can
salvage something.

370
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,918
I'll buy her back half price.

371
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,167
You will buy her back
full price.

372
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,375
Quarter price.

373
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,918
Half price it is!

374
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,709
Up!

375
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,876
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

376
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,083
Away.
Back to your tent now.

377
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,876
But she's his mom!

378
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:45,834
Dad, please.
Stop them.

379
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,125
Please!

380
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,501
Do something.

381
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,167
Mom would have
done something.

382
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,709
Momma's not here.

383
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:01,167
Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.

384
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,042
I know, I do.

385
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,250
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

386
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:33,209
Darlin', it's late.

387
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,083
Go on now.

388
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:33,000
I know.
I can't sleep, either.

389
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,375
My momma told me
there'd be times

390
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:39,542
when my life seemed
locked behind a door.

391
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:45,959
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

392
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:49,459
And said
whenever I have that feeling,

393
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,542
imagine that door...

394
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,626
and just turn the key.

395
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,501
So, I keep trying.

396
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:07,709
Not supposed to
be in here alone.

397
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,667
I'm not. You're here.

398
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,250
What's that?

399
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,709
I just thought
he might be hungry.

400
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,334
He's sad.

401
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,000
You don't eat
when you're sad.

402
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,375
The mermaid does.

403
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,042
Come on.

404
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,501
Have one, Dumbo.

405
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,501
We're calling him Dumbo now?

406
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,626
If we call him
Jumbo Junior...

407
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:32,209
it might make him
miss his mom.

408
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:41,626
Here you go... Dumbo.

409
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,417
Come on,
and flap those ears again.

410
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,501
To show us
we didn't imagine it.

411
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:54,209
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

412
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,334
She was just protecting you.

413
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,959
And we think
your ears are great.

414
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:07,584
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

415
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,584
Nobody wants to be alone.

416
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:11,542
Well...

417
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,125
if you change your mind...

418
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,667
Night-night, Dumbo.

419
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,542
Wow!

420
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,709
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

421
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,083
It's the feathers!

422
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,209
Dumbo!

423
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,709
Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.

424
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,417
What do you mean?

425
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,792
'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets

426
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,250
and Medici makes
more money...

427
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,417
then we can get him
to use some

428
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,417
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

429
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,584
Yeah!

430
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,125
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

431
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,834
Just show them all
what you can do.

432
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,459
Come on.
We gotta tell Dad.

433
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:55,292
No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.

434
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,292
Shows got canceled
for a week, right?

435
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,334
We can research
and study and test.

436
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:04,167
You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.

437
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,292
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

438
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,125
Fire!

439
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:33,709
So low.

440
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:35,375
An all-time low.

441
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,334
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

442
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:42,542
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

443
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,542
Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.

444
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,417
- You can do it.
- Come on, Dumbo.

445
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,626
You can do it, Dumbo!

446
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:50,876
Show 'em all
like you showed us!

447
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,918
- Come! Come! Come!
- Attaboy, come on.

448
00:35:57,918 --> 00:35:59,876
Keep comin'. Come on.

449
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,709
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

450
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,250
Whoa.

451
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:17,542
Hey! Hey!

452
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,542
They love it! They love it!

453
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,501
All right, Dumbo.

454
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,709
You put out the fire.

455
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,584
He won't fly.
He's scared.

456
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,417
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

457
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:17,542
Go on, Dumbo!

458
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,751
Attaboy.

459
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,542
Yeah!
Rule Number One.

460
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,292
"Always have a big finish!"

461
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,459
Aw!

462
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,501
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

463
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:53,751
Yeah!

464
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,876
Holt!

465
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,501
- Look, Max!
- What? What?

466
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:10,250
- He's trapped up there.
- Put the fire out!

467
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,000
Dumbo! Fly!

468
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,459
He won't fly
without a feather!

469
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,501
Put the fire out!

470
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,584
Put it out!

471
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,667
- Joe!
- Stop!

472
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,751
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

473
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,125
Milly!

474
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,459
Here, Dumbo!

475
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:54,959
Come on.

476
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,667
Show 'em.

477
00:38:58,459 --> 00:38:59,709
Come on, Dumbo.

478
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:27,959
Fly, Dumbo.

479
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Fly!

480
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,584
Whoa!

481
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,959
Yeah!

482
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,167
You knew
he could do this?

483
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,459
You should talk
to your kids more.

484
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:38,209
Sotheby...

485
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:40,459
cancel my dinner
with the president.

486
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,709
We've got business
with an elephant.

487
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,501
Friends,

488
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:50,751
the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

489
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,083
♪ Happy clowns!

490
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:01,125
- Ah, Rongo the Strong!
- Boss.

491
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,667
Hello, Jo!

492
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,042
The Medici Brothers' circus.

493
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:09,000
Where true love
and mystery abound!

494
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,042
Now where's my star?

495
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:15,167
Ah, Dumbo!

496
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,501
How's your bath?

497
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,542
Too warm? Too cold?

498
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,751
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

499
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:24,167
In our country,
legend tells us

500
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,918
the gods can
take animal forms.

501
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,709
Champagne for Dumbo!

502
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:30,751
No booze near the baby!

503
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,000
Sorry, Dumbo.

504
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,667
It's not your momma.

505
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,292
Take Dumbo back inside.

506
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make way

507
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,918
for the emperor
of enchantment.

508
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,250
For the architect of dreams.

509
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,584
For the Columbus
of Coney Island.

510
00:42:15,584 --> 00:42:17,542
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

511
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:25,042
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

512
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,584
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

513
00:42:28,584 --> 00:42:30,125
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

514
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:34,709
Ah.

515
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,042
Signore Medici!

516
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,584
He knows who I am.

517
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:41,125
We were just
passing through Missouri...

518
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,125
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

519
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,834
Mr. Vandevere.
It's an honor.

520
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,834
No, sir.
The honor is mine.

521
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:53,876
I would like
to offer you a drink.

522
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:56,209
But I'm all out of bourbon.

523
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,584
And cognac and scotch.

524
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,167
Not now!

525
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,209
Is that a monkey
in your desk?

526
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:14,709
Just for emergencies.

527
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:17,000
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

528
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,792
I probably should tell you...

529
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:21,167
the elephant is not for sale.

530
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,792
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

531
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,167
That's assuming he is real.

532
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,751
See for yourself.

533
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:37,125
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

534
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,709
- Pleasure to meet you...
- Excuse me.

535
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:40,918
Hello there.

536
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,125
So this, uh,
creature of yours...

537
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,834
is supposed to fly?

538
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:55,876
Trade secrets.

539
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,667
Ugh.

540
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,667
Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...

541
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:13,125
where did you
come upon the animal?

542
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,292
He hails
from the far east.

543
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,751
How far?

544
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,125
Far.

545
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:21,083
He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.

546
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,792
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

547
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,792
And you train
flying elephants, too?

548
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,292
Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.

549
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,167
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

550
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,751
Ah, yes.

551
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:42,375
Yeah?

552
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:46,042
And how on earth
did you do that?

553
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,417
With the
scientific method.

554
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,751
One picture, one picture!

555
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,459
Max.

556
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:56,292
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

557
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,959
And the tragedy of it is,

558
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:01,876
is you don't even know
that you have it.

559
00:45:01,876 --> 00:45:04,501
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

560
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,751
No.

561
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:07,042
It's mystique.

562
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,000
Max, I know your type.

563
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,375
Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...

564
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,417
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

565
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:19,000
And I know it comes
from a deep desire

566
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,918
to build something
authentic and true.

567
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,751
I know your game.

568
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:24,083
It's not a game.

569
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:27,417
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

570
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:29,959
It's up your sleeve.

571
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,000
It's in your pocket.

572
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,834
The secret
to show business

573
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,375
is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.

574
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,042
Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.

575
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:49,167
Ownership shares?

576
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,417
Max, look around you.

577
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,876
Your entire way of life
is dying.

578
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,417
The future of the
entertainment business

579
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:56,250
is to bring
the audience to you.

580
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,209
And I've built
that destination.

581
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,834
What I'm lacking...

582
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,959
is a protege.

583
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:09,167
I know
there's no Medici Brothers.

584
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,209
You probably always
wanted one.

585
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:16,000
You're offering me
a partnership?

586
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,167
Yes.

587
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,000
And a home.

588
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,042
For you
and the entire troupe.

589
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:24,125
A home?
For all of us?

590
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,459
Yes. Join me.

591
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,542
Join me and my family.

592
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:31,334
Let me take us all
into the future.

593
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,334
Let me take us all...

594
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,292
to Dreamland!

595
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,000
I wish Momma
could've seen this.

596
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,292
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

597
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,042
Way to work your magic, Max.

598
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:45,167
We hear you, Dumbo!

599
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,626
Why won't you
let him see outside?

600
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:49,125
Remember, young lady...

601
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,334
mystique.

602
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:56,834
Now this is why
I joined the circus.

603
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:03,125
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

604
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,375
All right, sugar plum.

605
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,209
Remember, we got
a job to do here.

606
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:08,918
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

607
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:12,626
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

608
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:15,417
Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.

609
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:19,959
What is it exactly that
we do here, ma cherie?

610
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:23,459
We make
the impossible possible.

611
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:30,167
And that's where
you'll perform.

612
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,459
The Colosseum!

613
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:34,417
Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.

614
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:35,542
Dumbo!

615
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,584
Why aren't we
going with him?

616
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:46,459
Because that
is your new home.

617
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,125
Wow!

618
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:56,167
Look at this place!

619
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,542
A library...

620
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,584
"And the children
shall lead them."

621
00:48:59,584 --> 00:49:01,626
We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

622
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:04,667
Oh, your family's mine.

623
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:10,709
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

624
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:13,000
Kentucky's top trick rider.

625
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,375
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

626
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:17,584
only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...

627
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:18,709
war hero.

628
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,501
One-armed wonder.

629
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,042
National treasure.

630
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,125
Wow!

631
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,417
Well, I still can ride.

632
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,626
Oh, I know you can.

633
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:31,083
And you're going to.

634
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,501
Right after you get
that little elephant

635
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:33,751
off the ground for me.

636
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,542
You mean
once his act's working?

637
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:37,334
You're back in the saddle.

638
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:39,334
We're still working
on the schedule

639
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:40,459
for the rest
of your troupe...

640
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,501
but on Friday...

641
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,209
we premiere
our little Dumbo.

642
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:48,667
I get goose bumps.

643
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:53,417
Why are you
looking at me?

644
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,292
Well, because
the only thing

645
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:58,417
more amazing
than a flying elephant...

646
00:49:58,417 --> 00:49:59,959
is the goddess
who can fly it.

647
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:03,626
Have you lost your mind?

648
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:09,501
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

649
00:50:11,584 --> 00:50:13,584
So, we fly Friday!

650
00:50:13,584 --> 00:50:17,709
Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.

651
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,709
That's why it's become
abundantly clear

652
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:21,709
why we need you.

653
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,375
Dumbo!

654
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,501
Hey, buddy. We missed you.
You all right?

655
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:34,292
Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.

656
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,250
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

657
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:37,709
Holt.

658
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:39,250
Just call me Holt.

659
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,584
I thought you were
a military man.

660
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,042
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

661
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,042
No.

662
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,334
So you better keep
your elephant friend

663
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:50,667
on my good side.

664
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,167
Hiya, Dumbo.

665
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,334
Dumbo, you mind?

666
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:07,459
Can I get my arm?

667
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,250
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

668
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:13,626
Welcome.

669
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:16,209
For the record,
this was not my idea.

670
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:17,667
Dumbo works alone.

671
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,292
So do I.

672
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:22,542
Bonjour, Milly, Joe...

673
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,792
And you...

674
00:51:28,876 --> 00:51:30,417
Hmm, charming.

675
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,709
Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you

676
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,250
without your makeup.

677
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,083
So I gotta
teach you to fly?

678
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:40,459
I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.

679
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:42,751
They taught
Dumbo to fly, no?

680
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,459
So I don't need
your expertise.

681
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,584
All right.

682
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:51,209
Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.

683
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:52,792
It wasn't a good experience.

684
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,751
Show me your secret!

685
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,792
How on earth
does your elephant fly?

686
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:59,209
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

687
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,042
He won't fly
without a feather.

688
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,334
Well then,
neither will I.

689
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,834
Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.

690
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,167
Guys, nets.

691
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,334
Come on, hurry.

692
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:43,250
All right, guys, good.

693
00:52:52,209 --> 00:52:53,667
See, Dumbo?

694
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:56,876
I fly!

695
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,125
See if you can catch me!

696
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,459
Here, Dumbo!

697
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:13,959
Oh, we got some work to do.

698
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:25,042
Friends and colleagues...

699
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,417
let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome

700
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:27,792
to our new executive
vice president...

701
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:28,792
Mr. Max Medici.

702
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:33,792
Anything he needs,
anything at all...

703
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:35,751
make it happen
as you always do.

704
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,292
This is Miss Verna.

705
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:43,667
She will handle
your schedule,

706
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,042
correspondence,
and all your calls.

707
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,792
When you're needed
in meetings,

708
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,375
she'll let you know.

709
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,751
Are there meetings today?

710
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:52,501
I'll let you know!

711
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,626
Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.

712
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,834
Exactly what do I do?

713
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:05,375
So where'd
Vandevere find you?

714
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,918
I was a street performer
in Paris.

715
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,918
He discovered me.

716
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:13,709
And here I am.

717
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,792
A millionaire's girlfriend.

718
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,000
That's a tough break.

719
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:22,751
It's all for show.

720
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:25,417
So you and he,
you're not, uh...

721
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,083
I'm one of many
gems he wears

722
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,626
to reflect the light
back onto him.

723
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:30,918
Huh.

724
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:34,584
Good boy, Dumbo.

725
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:36,375
- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.

726
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,876
I think you are
the lucky one.

727
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:42,000
- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.

728
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,334
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

729
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:49,375
So, how's everything?

730
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,083
- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.

731
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,834
But he ain't
quite ready yet.

732
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:55,584
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

733
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,959
- It's not that simple.
- Ma cherie...

734
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:01,667
we've already sold
all the tickets.

735
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,459
Maybe our little
scientist here

736
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:05,334
can show us
that it's going to work.

737
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,626
Prepare for takeoff.

738
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,792
- Right wing?
- Check!

739
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:23,876
Left wing?

740
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:25,876
Check!

741
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:27,959
Take her up, Dumbo.

742
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:33,626
Let's go.

743
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:35,834
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.

744
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,918
That's it. Come on.

745
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:46,626
Let's try it again.

746
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,375
You got this.
Here you go.

747
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:07,417
You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.

748
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:10,876
You've made me
a child again.

749
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:25,792
Welcome to the Colosseum...

750
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:28,542
where the impossible
is possible.

751
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:15,083
Buonasera. Max Medici.

752
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,542
I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.

753
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:18,876
And basically I said no.

754
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,584
I walked out and that
was the end of that.

755
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:21,918
The flying
elephant's mine.

756
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:22,918
Yeah.

757
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,959
You're the guy!

758
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:28,751
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

759
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:29,959
Max.

760
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,542
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

761
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,834
He's the money man.

762
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:36,125
The J?

763
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,959
Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.

764
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:40,751
How are you?

765
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,083
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

766
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,709
That's why
they're going to send

767
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,125
a man up there
one of these days.

768
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,292
And my bank is
going to be the bank

769
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:50,042
that finances
the expedition.

770
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:51,167
What do you think of that?

771
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,584
Uh-huh.

772
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:53,918
Needless to say, Max...

773
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:55,751
we all have high hopes
for tonight.

774
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:58,751
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

775
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,584
Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,

776
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:02,042
that's one thing.
That's words.

777
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,209
But what we're talking
about here is facts!

778
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:05,542
Plans!

779
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,876
Plans! That takes
a lot of money.

780
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:09,584
Which he hasn't got!

781
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:11,167
So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm

782
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:13,042
comes through
with the goods.

783
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:15,959
Now let's get this show
on the road!

784
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,125
We are looking good!

785
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:27,334
Don't worry, Big D.

786
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:29,125
There's just more room to fly out
there, that's all.

787
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:31,667
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

788
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:34,083
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

789
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,125
About the what?

790
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,667
We made a deal with Dumbo.

791
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,125
We promised we'd buy
his mom back

792
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,751
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

793
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:40,876
That's why he flies.

794
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,626
- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?

795
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:45,876
Yeah.

796
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,834
Okay, let's go.

797
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:56,542
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

798
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,375
Pink elephants?

799
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,834
So?

800
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:02,876
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!

801
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:06,959
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!

802
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:09,083
V.A. Vandevere,

803
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:11,292
in association
with Max Medici...

804
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:15,959
proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...

805
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:18,375
You've seen a horse-fly.

806
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:21,042
You've seen a dragonfly.

807
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:23,959
You've even seen a housefly.

808
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,167
But you haven't
seen anything...

809
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:30,083
until you see
an elephant fly.

810
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:33,042
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

811
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,834
Coming through.

812
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:54,834
Come on.

813
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,250
He can do it.

814
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,083
I know he can.

815
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:24,918
And here to welcome him...

816
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:29,959
our own Queen of the Heavens!

817
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,918
Dumbo.

818
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:27,209
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

819
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:29,834
Nice and easy,
like we practiced.

820
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,209
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

821
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:39,626
Why aren't they
putting up the nets?

822
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,000
Hey, guys?

823
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,334
Guys, what's going on?

824
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:46,501
Your men are supposed
to be out there!

825
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:47,626
Change of plan.
From the top.

826
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:01,125
I can't see the nets.

827
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,501
- They're invisible.
- Hmm.

828
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:06,584
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

829
01:05:08,959 --> 01:05:09,918
Colette!

830
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:11,417
Wait, don't take off!

831
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,459
Dumbo...

832
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:15,501
Oh, boy!

833
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:17,167
...Prince of the Elephants.

834
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,959
I command you
to fly with me.

835
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,167
Colette!

836
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,584
Lower the platform!

837
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Fly, little one!

838
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:53,167
Magic dust!

839
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,250
Where's my show?

840
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:47,751
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

841
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,375
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

842
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:47,792
Dumbo, it's okay.

843
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,667
We're here.

844
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,167
Good evening.

845
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,626
It's Mr. Vandevere.

846
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:54,834
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

847
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:56,167
Everyone having fun?

848
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:57,542
Good.

849
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,292
- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.

850
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:01,125
Fantastic.

851
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,626
Get him outta here.

852
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:05,209
- Yes.
- Over here!

853
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:06,542
- Folks, please.
- Hello.

854
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,334
Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.

855
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:10,375
Come on.

856
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:13,918
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

857
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:16,292
Soldier,
I give the orders here.

858
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:25,459
It's his bedtime.

859
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,751
This attraction is now closed.

860
01:09:36,918 --> 01:09:38,501
Dad?

861
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:39,626
Uh-huh.

862
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,292
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

863
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,292
Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!

864
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:51,751
I want to see Dumbo!

865
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:52,709
I want my money back!

866
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:53,876
I don't understand.

867
01:09:53,876 --> 01:09:56,292
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

868
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,876
I saw a vanishing act.

869
01:09:57,876 --> 01:10:01,501
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

870
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,792
You can't control
your animal.

871
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:05,918
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

872
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:09,459
Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.

873
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,209
What happened up there?

874
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:16,459
You lost control
of the animal.

875
01:10:16,459 --> 01:10:17,459
You're the animal.

876
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:18,792
Where was my net?

877
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:21,250
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

878
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:26,334
Training?
You call that training?

879
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:28,834
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

880
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:30,834
He recognized
that other elephant's call.

881
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:32,918
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

882
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:34,709
It's true.
It's her.

883
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:36,000
She was sold from our
circus two months ago.

884
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,542
Every child
knows its mother.

885
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:40,000
And they say
elephants never forget.

886
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,250
They can be
together now.

887
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:43,959
Why are there children
in my office?

888
01:10:43,959 --> 01:10:47,918
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

889
01:10:47,918 --> 01:10:49,292
Just reunite them,

890
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:50,751
and he'll do
whatever you want.

891
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,876
No, he'll do
whatever she wants.

892
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:55,459
You think
I'd have bought her

893
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,918
if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?

894
01:10:57,918 --> 01:11:00,459
Doesn't help me at all.

895
01:11:04,918 --> 01:11:06,542
You wanna know
the most important thing

896
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,876
about growing up?

897
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:13,751
You've got to learn
to go it alone.

898
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:19,459
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

899
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:20,834
And treat yourself
to some new boots.

900
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,209
But, sir,
you can't just kill her.

901
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:24,876
Why not?

902
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:26,334
Mr. Vandevere.

903
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:28,626
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

904
01:11:28,626 --> 01:11:30,667
Don't do that to my kids.

905
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:33,042
You know, Holt,
when my father left us,

906
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:34,667
it was a blessing really.

907
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:37,667
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

908
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:40,083
Maybe that's what
your children need.

909
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,584
Don't tell me
what my children need.

910
01:11:41,584 --> 01:11:43,000
Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.

911
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,918
Darling...

912
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:51,334
Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.

913
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:53,626
So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...

914
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:55,667
so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.

915
01:11:58,459 --> 01:12:00,876
Milly! Milly!

916
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:14,918
Colette?

917
01:12:16,751 --> 01:12:18,000
I have rehearsal.

918
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:20,751
Max.

919
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,584
Nightmare Island.

920
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:29,375
Milly?

921
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,000
Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.

922
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,667
Sir, park's closing.

923
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:40,918
Milly!

924
01:12:44,918 --> 01:12:45,918
Milly!

925
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:52,876
Did you find her?

926
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:54,667
No.

927
01:12:57,959 --> 01:13:01,792
Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.

928
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,959
She always knew.

929
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:07,501
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

930
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:09,709
They just need you
to believe in them.

931
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,876
That simple, huh?

932
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:22,417
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

933
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:46,209
That's my daughter
all right.

934
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:49,375
The only girl I know who
runs away to go to school.

935
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,167
It's our fault.

936
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:54,667
Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

937
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:57,209
Ah, you showed him
he could fly.

938
01:13:57,209 --> 01:14:00,042
You think
he'd ever trade that?

939
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,042
He would to have
his mom back.

940
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:08,959
I miss Momma.

941
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:12,626
Yeah, so do I.

942
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:19,667
There's something
I want to show you.

943
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:20,918
With advances in both

944
01:14:20,918 --> 01:14:22,834
engineering and medicine...

945
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,209
the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...

946
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:28,709
to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.

947
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:30,834
All kinds
of technological marvels

948
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,918
await us in the 20th century.

949
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,501
You're gonna do
great things.

950
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:38,751
I know it.

951
01:14:49,626 --> 01:14:51,000
Whoa, whoa. What's this?

952
01:14:51,042 --> 01:14:52,667
Oh, give me a break.

953
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:55,542
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

954
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:03,709
Oh, Max, hello!

955
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,751
Good, you brought
the paperwork.

956
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,751
Max...

957
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:10,542
I was reviewing
your troupe...

958
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:12,250
and to be honest with you...

959
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,918
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

960
01:15:14,918 --> 01:15:16,792
So I was thinking,
I don't know,

961
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,584
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

962
01:15:18,584 --> 01:15:19,876
Capisce?

963
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,167
I thought you promised to...

964
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:26,042
Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.

965
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:28,083
It never stipulated
for how long.

966
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:31,209
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

967
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:34,751
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

968
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:37,250
Okay, let's have a heart.

969
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,083
Why don't you tell them?

970
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:54,083
'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

971
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,876
What's going on, guys?

972
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,834
Vandevere's fired them all.

973
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:10,959
They're to leave by tomorrow.

974
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,667
Goodbye, little friend.

975
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,167
Goodbye.

976
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:33,209
We wanted to see him
one last time.

977
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:36,876
One last time
to see him fly.

978
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,209
I don't think
he wants to anymore.

979
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:41,167
Oh, no. But he must.

980
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:43,918
He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!

981
01:16:43,918 --> 01:16:46,751
Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.

982
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:49,042
Mr. Sotheby?

983
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,959
I've come
to clear my conscience.

984
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:54,792
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

985
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,125
What order?

986
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:00,209
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

987
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:02,042
And she's not
meant to survive.

988
01:17:17,876 --> 01:17:20,417
This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.

989
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:22,250
No circus does.

990
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:38,667
Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?

991
01:17:40,959 --> 01:17:42,792
Set Dumbo
and his momma free.

992
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,667
Welcome to the Colosseum,

993
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:16,375
where the impossible
is possible.

994
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:21,417
Okay.
Second time's the charm.

995
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:25,000
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

996
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,375
Here to pick up the elephant

997
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,167
- from Nightmare Island?
- Confirmed.

998
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,792
Unlock the back gates.

999
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:55,417
Dumbo in position!

1000
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:57,250
Soon as he flies,
you run back to his tent

1001
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,876
and I'll find you there.

1002
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:00,209
All right, Big D.

1003
01:19:01,501 --> 01:19:04,334
It's all up to you now.

1004
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:06,792
Come on, Holt!

1005
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,125
To hell with it.

1006
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:24,876
Ready for positions.

1007
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:27,167
We could have used
a little rehearsal.

1008
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:28,834
Rehearsal?

1009
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:31,125
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

1010
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,083
You sure you can do this?

1011
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,918
I fly elephants
all the time.

1012
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:39,542
Are you sure
you can do this?

1013
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,417
With one hand
tied behind my back.

1014
01:19:54,209 --> 01:19:56,834
Wait. What's that?

1015
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,209
Ma'am?

1016
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Ma'am?

1017
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,083
Sorry, ma'am,
attraction's closed.

1018
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:08,292
My dream...
to be a mermaid...

1019
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:10,834
and now
they've taken it away.

1020
01:20:10,834 --> 01:20:13,292
And yet I hear
the water singing.

1021
01:20:13,292 --> 01:20:14,542
I hear them
beckoning me home.

1022
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,459
Lady, just be careful,
okay?

1023
01:20:16,459 --> 01:20:17,876
Return me
to the vast abyss!

1024
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:19,292
Let's go.

1025
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:21,751
- My destiny, the sea!
- Okay.

1026
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,417
We've lost power!

1027
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:13,918
Even the cages?

1028
01:21:13,918 --> 01:21:17,125
But the animals...

1029
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,459
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

1030
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:21,292
And make sure
those cages are locked.

1031
01:21:39,918 --> 01:21:41,334
Ladies and gentlemen,

1032
01:21:41,334 --> 01:21:43,334
boys and girls.

1033
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:47,000
Making his second
Dreamland debut.

1034
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,667
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

1035
01:22:49,709 --> 01:22:50,709
Hey!

1036
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:00,959
It's a trick!
Get back to the...

1037
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:20,751
And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!

1038
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:43,709
You.

1039
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,542
Where is
your circus of freaks?

1040
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:49,792
What's going on?

1041
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:52,292
The elephant's
mother is gone!

1042
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:55,209
His troupe's behind it!

1043
01:23:55,209 --> 01:23:57,751
Alert the tower
and secure the gates.

1044
01:23:57,751 --> 01:23:59,375
Don't let them get out.

1045
01:24:00,626 --> 01:24:02,751
But why would they
only take the one?

1046
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,250
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

1047
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,959
You! Come with us.

1048
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:24,459
There they are!

1049
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:27,542
Hey!

1050
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:39,125
Hey, you!

1051
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,584
What are you
doing up there?

1052
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:42,417
That's private property.

1053
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:44,292
Come on! Get down here!

1054
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:45,542
Now!

1055
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:48,751
Hey, I'm Max Medici,
Vandevere's partner.

1056
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:51,334
He's just a maintenance man
fixing a light!

1057
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:52,626
Get back to your posts!

1058
01:24:52,626 --> 01:24:54,501
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

1059
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:11,459
Let's try this again.

1060
01:25:11,459 --> 01:25:12,751
You and me.

1061
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:29,709
Hey, the kids?

1062
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:30,876
Where are the kids?

1063
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,334
Hey, have you
seen the kids?

1064
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:36,417
Dumbo,
Prince of the Elephants!

1065
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:39,417
I command you
to fly with me.

1066
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:56,792
Dumbo, please fly.

1067
01:25:57,834 --> 01:25:59,542
Do it for your momma.

1068
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:55,751
Where's your father?

1069
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,792
Dumbo!

1070
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:25,167
Hey! Get those kids!

1071
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:29,918
Dumbo!

1072
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:03,542
Come on.

1073
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:05,834
There!

1074
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:24,501
Bonsoir.

1075
01:28:26,792 --> 01:28:28,334
Just passing through!

1076
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:31,292
Hey! You can't do that!

1077
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:35,751
Get the elephant!

1078
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:37,542
You get the elephant!

1079
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,000
Don't worry.
Dad'll be here soon.

1080
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,792
Where's the elephant?

1081
01:29:09,959 --> 01:29:11,709
Why are you
just standing there?

1082
01:29:11,709 --> 01:29:13,000
Get to the tower!

1083
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,334
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

1084
01:29:15,334 --> 01:29:18,959
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

1085
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,667
We seem to be experiencing

1086
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:22,626
some technical difficulties.

1087
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:39,626
What happened to my power?

1088
01:29:39,626 --> 01:29:42,459
What power, mon cheri?

1089
01:29:42,459 --> 01:29:43,959
You ungrateful...

1090
01:29:43,959 --> 01:29:47,834
You were nothing before
I made you my... Uh...

1091
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:50,876
I believe the word
is "queen."

1092
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:53,792
I need lights!

1093
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:58,626
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1094
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,542
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1095
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:01,751
Right now it's impossible!

1096
01:30:01,751 --> 01:30:04,042
Nothing's impossible!

1097
01:30:05,709 --> 01:30:07,542
Mr. Vandevere!

1098
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:14,834
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1099
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:42,125
Milly! Joe!

1100
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:52,792
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1101
01:31:19,459 --> 01:31:20,918
Get everyone out!

1102
01:31:20,918 --> 01:31:22,918
Evacuate the park!

1103
01:31:26,959 --> 01:31:28,709
Milly! Joe!

1104
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:43,042
Hey!

1105
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,042
Where is the elephant?

1106
01:31:51,042 --> 01:31:53,042
Let her go!

1107
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:11,000
Come on!

1108
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,209
Milly! Joe!

1109
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:14,000
Dad!

1110
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,250
- You all right? All right?
- We're fine.

1111
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,959
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1112
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:18,709
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1113
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:19,834
Back!

1114
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,250
Stay close.

1115
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:34,000
Come on, everybody.

1116
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,709
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1117
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:38,834
- Where are the Farriers?
- They must still be inside.

1118
01:33:11,626 --> 01:33:12,626
Dad!

1119
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,709
It's okay, Joe.

1120
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:17,292
Come here. Come here.

1121
01:33:20,209 --> 01:33:21,209
Dumbo!

1122
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,334
Dumbo!

1123
01:33:30,334 --> 01:33:32,292
Come on!

1124
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:35,167
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Jump!

1125
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,751
Come on. Come on.

1126
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:46,125
- All right, let's go.
- Stay close, come on.

1127
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,334
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1128
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:52,751
Come on!

1129
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:54,918
- Dumbo!
- Come on!

1130
01:33:54,918 --> 01:33:56,334
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1131
01:33:56,334 --> 01:33:58,167
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

1132
01:33:58,167 --> 01:33:59,792
Dumbo, let's go!

1133
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:04,918
Go!

1134
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,626
Dumbo!

1135
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:13,292
Get him!

1136
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,792
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1137
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:17,250
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1138
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,334
He lost the feather.

1139
01:34:18,334 --> 01:34:19,792
Feather doesn't do nothin'.

1140
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:21,792
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

1141
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:23,334
Dad, they're coming!

1142
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:25,709
Stand back! Stand back!

1143
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:26,751
Out of my way!

1144
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,042
Dumbo, remember this?

1145
01:34:31,042 --> 01:34:33,042
From my momma?

1146
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:37,918
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1147
01:34:37,918 --> 01:34:39,709
But I don't need
this key to do it.

1148
01:34:39,709 --> 01:34:40,918
And you don't need
the feather.

1149
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:43,125
Come on.

1150
01:34:58,417 --> 01:34:59,667
Dad!

1151
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:00,792
Gotta go. Come on!

1152
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:04,125
What are you doing?

1153
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,876
There ain't room
for the three of us.

1154
01:35:05,876 --> 01:35:07,209
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1155
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:08,626
Go on, Big D.

1156
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,083
Grab 'em!

1157
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,083
Hey!

1158
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,250
Hey!

1159
01:35:26,918 --> 01:35:28,959
That's my elephant!

1160
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:44,292
They're safe.

1161
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:45,918
Come on, let's go!

1162
01:35:48,751 --> 01:35:50,250
Hey! Get back here!

1163
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:55,292
You freak!
What have you done?

1164
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,125
What they pay me for,
mister.

1165
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,751
Put on a hell of a show.

1166
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,834
Hey! Him!

1167
01:36:03,834 --> 01:36:05,751
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1168
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:08,083
Hey, we had a contract,
Medici!

1169
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:11,125
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

1170
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:25,125
Wow. This is a disaster.

1171
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,959
Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.

1172
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:29,876
Sounds good, J.G.

1173
01:37:09,459 --> 01:37:12,000
Last call for cargo!

1174
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,584
All aboard!

1175
01:37:35,834 --> 01:37:37,125
Colette!

1176
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:46,876
Where's your father?

1177
01:37:46,876 --> 01:37:49,042
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1178
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:56,584
Dad!

1179
01:37:56,584 --> 01:37:58,459
I knew you could ride.

1180
01:38:04,876 --> 01:38:06,959
- Pramesh, we have to go.
- Please, hurry.

1181
01:38:08,292 --> 01:38:10,792
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1182
01:38:11,918 --> 01:38:13,042
Come.

1183
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:15,417
Let's go home.

1184
01:38:31,334 --> 01:38:33,375
Hey!

1185
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,292
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1186
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,042
Go on.

1187
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:43,042
Ladies and gentlemen...

1188
01:39:43,042 --> 01:39:47,709
introducing our world-famous
flying elephant.

1189
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,459
Welcome to
the Medici Family circus!

1190
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:00,667
Where we believe
no wild animals

1191
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:03,292
shall be held in captivity.

1192
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:12,584
See Rongo...

1193
01:40:12,584 --> 01:40:16,125
the world's strongest
and most versatile man.

1194
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:21,334
Meet the bewitching
Miss Atlantis...

1195

underwater Shakespeare,

1196

only living merman, Puck!

1197
01:40:33,709 --> 01:40:36,083
And visit

1200
01:40:42,209 --> 01:40:45,125
that are shaping
tomorrow today!

1201
01:41:02,792 --> 01:41:07,083
Marvel at the skills

our cowboy of the future!

1203

And the Pearl of Paris,
Colette.

1204
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,501
Queen of the Heavens!

1205
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:58,709
Friends, young and old,
you have a home at our circus.

1206
01:41:58,709 --> 01:42:02,501
Where anything is possible
and miracles happen.

1207
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:04,167
Believe me, they do.
