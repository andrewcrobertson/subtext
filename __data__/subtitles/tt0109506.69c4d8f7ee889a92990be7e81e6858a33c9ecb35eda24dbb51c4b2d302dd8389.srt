1
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,357
People once believed
that when someone dies,

2
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:57,574
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,925
But sometimes, something so bad happens

4
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,664
that a terrible sadness is carried with it,

5
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:06,715
and the soul can't rest.

6
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:10,604
Then, sometimes, just sometimes,

7
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,705
the crow can bring that soul back

8
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,954
to put the wrong things right.

9
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,571
Over here.

10
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,446
Hey, Sarge!

11
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,008
Yeah?

12
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,765
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.

13
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,767
Wedding was tomorrow night.

14
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,555
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

15
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:19,986
Nobody.

16
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,463
Sir, we got to move her.

17
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:25,794
Do it.

18
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:27,747
All right, guys, let's do it.

19
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,915
Devil's fucking night.
What's the count so far?

20
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,570
Hundred and forty-three fires.

21
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,506
They're slacking off from last year.

22
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:37,476
Three hours to go. Maybe they're
just slow starters.

23
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:38,972
Coming through!

24
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:45,858
You guys just can't come in here

25
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,002
and take her away like this.

26
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,702
There are procedures to stick by.

27
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,666
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

28
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,607
Is this the victim?

29
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:53,557
No, it's Amelia Earhart.

30
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,643
We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.

31
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:56,927
I don't care what her name is.

32
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:59,025
I didn't the give the order to move her.

33
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,584
Jesus, Albrecht, I can see why they
took away your gold shield.

34
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,828
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on, let's go.

35
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,836
All right, clear out of here.

36
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:11,642
Shelly? Stand back, kid.

37
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,828
Where's Eric?

38
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,648
Just don't worry about him.

39
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,570
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

40
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:24,870
Look, I will. You just lie back.
Come on, come on.

41
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,112
Are you Sarah?

42
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,652
Yeah.

43
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:41,067
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

44
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,069
She's not my sister.

45
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,577
Shelly just takes care of me.

46
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,910
She's my friend. Her and Eric.

47
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,750
You lied to her about Eric.

48
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,554
Look, I had to.

49
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,051
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

50
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,560
She's gonna die, isn't she?

51
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,125
Hey...

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,018
Now, come on. Come on.

53
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:15,706
It's okay.

54
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,842
She's gonna be fine.

55
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,913
A building gets torched.

56
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,997
All that is left is ashes.

57
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:45,918
I used to think that was true
about everything.

58
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:49,707
Families, friends, feelings.

59
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:54,630
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real,

60
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,863
two people who are meant to be together,

61
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,683
nothing can keep them apart.

62
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:27,745
Later.

63
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,152
What are you, like the night watchman?

64
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,897
You know, what this place needs

65
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,999
is a good natural catastrophe.

66
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,673
Earthquake, tornado, you know?

67
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:12,268
No, no, no. Mickey, come on, man.

68
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,858
You got to put the mustard
underneath first.

69
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,091
Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

70
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,225
Hey, hey. Hey, come on. Let me do it.

71
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:21,931
There we go.

72
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,098
All right. How about some onions?

73
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,944
Come on, man. Don't cheap
out on me. Lots of onions.

74
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,153
All right, here you go.

75
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,072
Hey! All right.

76
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,239
Now we're talkin'.

77
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,243
Hey. It's the Sarah monster.

78
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,538
How do you steer that thing
on a wet street?

79
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,754
Pure talent. Hi.

80
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:45,169
See, now, Sarah, she's
a genuine hot dogger.

81
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,269
You hungry?

82
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:47,743
You buyin'?

83
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:48,892
I'm buyin'.

84
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,845
No onions, though, okay?

85
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,110
No onions?

86
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,996
They make you fart big time.

87
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,925
You know, Lake Erie actually
caught on fire once

88
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,009
from all the crap floating around in it.

89
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,012
I wish I could have seen that.

90
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:13,994
Fire it up! Yeah!

91
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,301
Fire it up!

92
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,121
We busted their machines!

93
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,412
Shit, guys. T-Bird, cop car, cop car.

94
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,993
Bad people out on the street tonight.

95
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,952
- Damn it!
- My God!

96
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,036
What was that?

97
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:46,383
You wait right here. Be careful.

98
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,138
Mickey, call it in for me!

99
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,420
Gabriel.

100
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,399
Eric?

101
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,006
Department of housing!

102
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,141
Code violations? Safety hazard?

103
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,440
Place looks fine to me.

104
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,541
Let's redecorate.

105
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,236
"Abashed, the Devil stood"

106
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,024
"and felt how awful goodness is."

107
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:50,111
"Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."

108
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,392
It's pornography.

109
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,098
Virtue?

110
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,531
Shelly?

111
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,041
See ya!

112
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,143
No, no, no. Me first.

113
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,152
Eric!

114
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,292
Hey, that's good.

115
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:04,201
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

116
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,105
Look at that. Look at that.

117
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,290
Here's to Devil's Night.

118
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,572
My new favorite holiday.

119
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,513
You need to go over there
and talk to your pals.

120
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,614
You sick fuck!

121
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,651
You're out of your
motherfucking mind, man.

122
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,593
Man, look at that.

123
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,662
Pussies drink last, man.

124
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:39,534
Fuck you, Tin Tin.

125
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:41,634
Hey...

126
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,208
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

127
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,145
This one is.

128
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:53,349
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

129
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:57,469
Hey, fire it up!

130
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,175
Fire it up! Fire it up!

131
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:03,376
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!

132
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,163
Fire it up!

133
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,660
Here's your shooters.

134
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,613
Put your guns away, guys?

135
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,499
How you doing, Pussycat?

136
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,606
Boo.

137
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,238
I love you.

138
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,668
Say that again.

139
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,307
I love you.

140
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,738
Boy.

141
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,609
Restaurant.

142
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,404
Wow, you look great.

143
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,553
Ta-da!

144
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:10,393
Yeah!

145
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,628
Come here! No, no, no!

146
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,630
Couple more rings. That's 24k.

147
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,386
24k? It's 18k.

148
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,355
It's crap. It's probably fake.

149
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,340
Leather purse. Leather.

150
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,343
Geez.

151
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,347
What is this, Tin Tin?
A blood stain that's on here?

152
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,451
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

153
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,882
Now, you take it or leave it.

154
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,556
Right there for ya.

155
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,757
Decisions, decisions.

156
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,681
You cheap-ass, chrome-dome,

157
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:32,766
child-molestin' saprophyte, motherfucker.

158
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:34,583
Close the gate when you go out!

159
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,903
I'll close this up for
you real good, mass a.

160
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:39,576
Fuck you.

161
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,810
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

162
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,850
Lucky I didn't stab your fat ass.

163
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:40,091
What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead?

164
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,738
Halloween ain't till manana.

165
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,675
Come on.

166
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:19,867
I'll cut you!

167
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,847
Fuck, you murderer!

168
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,097
I ain't murdered nobody, man!

169
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:36,581
I don't even fucking know you, man!

170
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:37,902
What the fuck do you want, man?

171
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,953
I want you to tell me a story.

172
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,758
A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.

173
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,068
You're out of your motherfucking mind.

174
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,961
Listen! I'm sure you'll remember.

175
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:51,619
You killed them. On Halloween.

176
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:53,753
Yeah, yeah, okay. Halloween, yeah.

177
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,969
Some dude, some bitch. Whatever, man.

178
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,971
Her name was Shelly.

179
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,711
You cut her. You raped her.

180
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,697
Shelly. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:06,881
I shanked her pink ass and she loved it!

182
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:19,108
Murder, man? Murder?

183
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:21,863
Let me tell you about murder. It's fun.

184
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:23,766
It's easy.

185
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,736
You gonna learn all about it.

186
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,139
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

187
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,175
We never miss.

188
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,907
Try harder. Try again!

189
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:58,999
Victims. Aren't we all?

190
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,192
Look at this mess!
What's the world coming to?

191
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,874
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

192
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:46,079
Get out of my way, you worms!

193
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:49,819
Give me some of that, over there!

194
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,857
Why don't you ladies come
by later, check me out?

195
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,272
Hey, guess what.

196
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,781
Arcade games fell down, went boom.

197
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:01,914
Boom.

198
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:04,229
Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

199
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:06,754
Gather your soldiers.

200
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:09,102
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

201
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,692
Is the man in?

202
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:11,973
He's taking a meeting.

203
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,335
You're thinking about the past.

204
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,012
Dad gave me this.

205
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,817
Fifth birthday.

206
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:57,071
He said,

207
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,856
"Childhood's over the moment
you know you're gonna die."

208
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,267
Is she asleep?

209
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,782
I think we broke her.

210
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:33,120
I love her eyes. Pretty.

211
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:53,041
Hey, kid, get the hell out of the road!

212
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:18,066
I told you to stay out of here.

213
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,052
So, I guess you're not gonna be home

214
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:22,054
till a lot later, Darla?

215
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:23,368
She's busy.

216
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,058
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

217
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,372
I don't have any dolls.

218
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:32,047
Get some food?

219
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:35,083
Somebody already bought
me dinner. The police.

220
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:43,075
"Somebody already bought
me dinner. The police."

221
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:59,272
$20, $40, $60, $80.

222
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,879
Who the fuck is this now?

223
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,982
Hey! Piss off! We're closed!

224
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,198
Cerrado!

225
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,185
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dust head!

226
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:12,890
Unless you want to get mutilated.

227
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,461
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

228
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,971
Hey! Hey!

229
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,655
"Suddenly, I heard a tapping,"

230
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:38,064
"as if someone gently rapping,"

231
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:40,049
"rapping at my chamber door."

232
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:43,921
What are you talking about?

233
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:46,924
You heard me rapping, right?

234
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,289
You're trespassing.

235
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,962
And you owe me a fucking new door!

236
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,132
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

237
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:58,398
Gold.

238
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,103
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

239
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:09,260
Shit. Shit on me!

240
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,132
Shit on me. Shit on me!

241
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,487
Mr. Gideon. You're not paying attention.

242
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,098
No! My hand!

243
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,019
I repeat,

244
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:34,972
a gold engagement ring, yes?

245
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,453
It was pawned here a year ago

246
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:39,504
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

247
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:45,510
He confided in me before
he ran out of breath.

248
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:52,451
Who's this sack of shit?

249
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:56,307
That's Tin Tin, one of T-Bird's
little helpers.

250
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,523
I think you can rule out accidental death.

251
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:02,263
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

252
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,183
This could be a turf hit,

253
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,416
but it doesn't look like
your usual gang crap.

254
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,220
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.

255
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:11,206
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

256
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,274
I'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

257
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,755
Word to the wise...

258
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,245
Watch your fucking mouth.

259
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,314
What the hell do you call that?

260
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,318
I call it blood, Detective.

261
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,321
I suppose you'll write it up as "graffiti."

262
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:31,028
You can leave my crime scene now, okay?

263
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:40,582
Warmer? What are you doing?

264
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,056
Don't you know this game?

265
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,469
What game are you talking about?

266
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,357
Okay, the rings! I'll tell
you about the rings!

267
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,376
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

268
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:54,365
Take it! Take your fucking rings!

269
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,350
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!

270
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:01,589
Look, it goes up to the attic.

271
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:03,159
Okay.

272
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:13,466
No, no.

273
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:16,601
No, no, no.

274
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:23,410
It's beautiful. I don't believe it.

275
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:29,350
Shelly.

276
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,426
I love you.

277
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:49,321
You have one chance to live.

278
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,224
Take anything you want. Thank you.

279
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:52,406
Take anything!

280
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,559
Now you're gonna tell me where to find

281
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,676
the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.

282
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:00,722
The Pit. They all hang out at The Pit.

283
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:03,285
All of T-Birds' little potato-heads
hang out there.

284
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:06,222
Funboy. He lives there upstairs, all right?

285
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:07,685
Funboy.

286
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,720
Baby!

287
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,279
A whole jolly club...

288
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:14,363
Stop! Stop! Please!

289
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,710
With jolly pirate nicknames!

290
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:18,284
Stop! Please! Jesus Christ...

291
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,433
Hold still!

292
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:25,192
Each one of these is a life,

293
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:26,671
a life you helped destroy.

294
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,509
I'm begging you, all right? Don't kill me.

295
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,150
I'm not gonna kill you.

296
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,697
Your job will be to tell the rest of them

297
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:38,172
that death is coming for them...

298
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,387
Tonight.

299
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,698
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

300
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,682
You walk out of here,

301
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,700
they're gonna erase your sorry ass!

302
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,489
You're nothing but
street grease, you hear?

303
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,474
Street grease, you motherfucker!

304
00:31:00,806 --> 00:31:02,493
Is that gasoline I smell?

305
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:05,215
No, man, no! No!

306
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:06,513
No!

307
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:08,713
No!

308
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,237
It's on the house, kiddo, you know that.

309
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:29,503
One root beer.

310
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,607
I can't do anything.

311
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:39,744
Your mom, technically,
she's off right now.

312
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,647
Yeah, way off.

313
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,572
Police! Don't move!

314
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,623
I said, "Don't move!"

315
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,644
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze."

316
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:57,416
Well, I am the police,
and I say don't move, Snow White.

317
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,565
You move, you're dead.

318
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:03,537
And I say I'm dead. And I move.

319
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,310
Not one more step. I'm serious.

320
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:11,776
Then shoot, if you will, Officer Albrecht.

321
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:14,581
What, are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

322
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:16,765
You high?

323
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,354
You don't remember me?

324
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,737
What are you talking about?

325
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:23,788
How about Shelly? Do you
remember Shelly Webster?

326
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,775
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

327
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:28,711
I want you to move over to the curb there.

328
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:31,466
Go on, real nice and easy.
Come on, move it!

329
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,668
Okay, we're gonna wait here for backup.

330
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,374
It's getting too freaking weird for me.

331
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:40,673
It gets better.

332
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:42,873
Do you know someone named T-Bird?

333
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:46,316
He had a friend who shouldn't
have played with knives.

334
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,845
Like the coat?

335
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:49,833
You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.

336
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,816
Hey, check it out.

337
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:53,818
He was already dead.

338
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,295
He died a year ago,
the moment he touched her.

339
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:03,465
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

340
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,863
Get away from there!

341
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,503
Cops! Come on! Get out of here!

342
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,408
Leave it! Leave it! Run!

343
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:19,547
Great.

344
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:21,401
Great.

345
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,437
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell,

346
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,521
and you lose him right out in the open.

347
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:31,345
Well, at least he didn't do that

348
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,446
walking against the wind shit I hate that.

349
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,629
Little early for Devil's Night.

350
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:41,338
You are very restless.

351
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:44,407
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

352
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,657
Be careful of what you ask for.

353
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:48,576
Yeah, I may get it. I know.

354
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,806
There are energies aligning against you.

355
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,758
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

356
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:19,376
Yummy.

357
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:28,913
Gideon's pawnshop just burned
down to the foundation.

358
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,900
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

359
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:33,935
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

360
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,492
I'm sure you must be awful disappointed.

361
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:40,661
I got trouble. One of my crew
got himself perished.

362
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,937
Yeah, and who might that be?

363
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,312
Tin Tin.

364
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:47,701
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.

365
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,978
Well, gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have

366
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:53,410
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.

367
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,811
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

368
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:01,600
Whatever you say, I can do.

369
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,684
Good. That's very reassuring.

370
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:07,523
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

371
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,924
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

372
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,432
Call it my need to know.

373
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:50,731
Hey! Let go, you creep!

374
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:55,868
Nah.

375
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,772
You didn't even slow down, you dickhead!

376
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,761
He couldn't have stopped.

377
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,010
He was a butt face. I could have made it.

378
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:10,850
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

379
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:12,885
Sometimes.

380
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,021
It's more like surfing than skating.

381
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,793
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

382
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,664
It can't rain all the time.

383
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,633
Eric?

384
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,262
Don't thank me.

385
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:46,523
Are we fighting the good fight?

386
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:49,922
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

387
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:53,596
Annie, look at that.

388
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:59,080
"We, the undersigned tenants of 1929
Caulderon Court Apartments."

389
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:00,735
What is this, a petition?

390
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,980
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice
girl who found herself a cause,

391
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,164
and the cause got her killed.

392
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,808
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

393
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:09,596
Shelly Webster

394
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,648
and her nice rock-'n'-roll
boyfriend, Eric Draven.

395
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,668
You know, the last time you went
snooping around on a case

396
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,554
is when you got put back on the beat.

397
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:19,936
Yeah, I know.
Torres keeps reminding me.

398
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,855
I bet he does.

399
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,964
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

400
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:34,504
I'm cool.

401
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:35,946
You didn't get that file from me, okay?

402
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,135
And don't tell me you owe me one.

403
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,793
I owe you one!

404
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:43,107
Yeah, right.

405
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:45,747
Damn.

406
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:15,123
Tomorrow night we can get high,

407
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:18,995
and watch this whole fucking
city burn from that window.

408
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,775
There's a big, fucking bird over there.

409
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,045
It's a squab.

410
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,685
Come here, bird.

411
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:57,786
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

412
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,970
Bird. B-b-birdie.

413
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:02,775
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.

414
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:05,679
Come here, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.

415
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:10,865
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

416
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,835
Here, Funboy.

417
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,120
What the fuck!

418
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,766
No, man! Don't do that!

419
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,949
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

420
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,054
Don't sweat it.

421
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:38,761
It's time for you to take your
bird and leave, freako.

422
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,873
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead-bang.

423
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,697
You are seriously fucked up.

424
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,029
Did you look in the mirror?

425
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:02,048
I mean, you need professional help.

426
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,789
Bingo!

427
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:09,924
He shoots, he scores!

428
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,830
Whoo!

429
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:18,031
Whoo-hoo!

430
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,200
Jesus Christ!

431
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:24,857
Jesus Christ?

432
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,727
Stop me if you heard this one.

433
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,811
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

434
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:37,281
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

435
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:41,153
Don't you ever fucking die?

436
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:43,155
"Can you put me up for the night?"

437
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:50,212
Does that hurt?

438
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:52,901
Fuck. Does it fucking hurt?

439
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:55,772
God.

440
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:59,842
Look what you've done to my sheets.

441
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,000
I've got a gun in my pocket.

442
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,038
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

443
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:52,945
Stay away from me! Stay away from me!

444
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:02,938
Look.

445
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:07,157
"Mother" is the name for God

446
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:09,846
on the lips and hearts of all children.

447
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:11,243
Do you understand?

448
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:14,851
Morphine is bad for you.

449
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,866
Your daughter is out there on
the streets waiting for you.

450
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,082
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

451
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,330
Now fill it up!

452
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:09,923
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

453
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,336
I really need this.

454
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,050
All right.

455
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:25,169
You burn yourself playing with matches?

456
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:26,253
Fuck off.

457
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:27,485
You have an appointment.

458
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:29,090
Well, shit on me.

459
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,255
Drink up.

460
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:33,930
This is a first. Do I bow or do I curtsy?

461
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:36,262
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

462
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,985
Hey, hey, hon!

463
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,366
Hey, good night, Darla.

464
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:47,158
You stay put.

465
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:48,505
Right there.

466
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,088
Get away, steam head.

467
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:21,043
Shh.

468
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:34,139
As you can see, I'm here,

469
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:37,043
on the corner of 27th street
in Washington Place.

470
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:40,178
The site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

471
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:41,513
It was exactly one year ago

472
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,597
that the building you see
across the street from me

473
00:44:43,628 --> 00:44:46,118
was totally demolished by fire.

474
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:48,747
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...

475
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:51,123
But lost the lives of two fire fighters.

476
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:54,126
In fact, if it weren't for
the constant surveillance

477
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,407
by the local police...

478
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:57,146
Freeze!

479
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,511
Jesus! Don't ever do that, man.

480
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:04,152
Fuck.

481
00:45:07,322 --> 00:45:08,470
Good likeness.

482
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:10,422
I saw your body, man.

483
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,292
You died. You got buried.

484
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:14,558
You still have your hat on.

485
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,497
I got to sit down.

486
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:24,568
Shit. Holy shit.

487
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:29,045
Say...

488
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:32,444
Are you some kind of...

489
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:35,051
Ghost?

490
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:36,250
Boo!

491
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,310
I don't know what I am.

492
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:48,592
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

493
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:54,169
You took a six-storey
swan dive out of a window.

494
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:58,157
She, was beaten and raped,

495
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,537
died at the hospital.

496
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,507
Hey, you asked, man.

497
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,476
I mean, come on, read the file.

498
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,448
Shelly Webster held on for
30 hours in intensive care.

499
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:12,352
Her body finally just gave it up.

500
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,421
I saw it, man. I couldn't do jack for her.

501
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,105
Hey. Don't touch me!

502
00:46:32,275 --> 00:46:33,307
Hey.

503
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,460
You okay?

504
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,115
I saw her.

505
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:43,284
I saw her through your eyes.

506
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:46,568
You stayed with her the whole time.

507
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:48,289
Yeah, well...

508
00:46:49,655 --> 00:46:52,227
You got to understand
something, all right?

509
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,427
I was

510
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:57,183
I was hoping she'd
come out of it, you know?

511
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:59,267
Give me something I could work with.

512
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:02,237
Yeah.

513
00:47:04,439 --> 00:47:05,587
Look, I...

514
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,671
Why didn't you do something about it?

515
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:09,750
You think any of those people
in that building,

516
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,329
even the ones who signed the petition,

517
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:13,149
would talk after what happened to you?

518
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,219
I kept asking questions, and...

519
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:20,768
Finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

520
00:47:24,756 --> 00:47:26,327
This your wife?

521
00:47:26,758 --> 00:47:27,624
Yeah, we...

522
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:31,266
Well, not anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

523
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:34,434
It's funny.

524
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:39,373
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

525
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,393
I used to think they were kind of trivial.

526
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:45,346
Believe me, nothing is trivial.

527
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:58,326
You shouldn't smoke these.

528
00:47:58,658 --> 00:47:59,789
They'll kill you.

529
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,600
You gonna vanish into thin air again?

530
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,606
I thought I'd use your front door.

531
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:19,743
Look, man.

532
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:24,517
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

533
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:26,618
Yeah.

534
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:34,824
Yeah.

535
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,382
I got stabbed!

536
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:39,219
I shot the son of a bitch!

537
00:48:39,303 --> 00:48:41,452
I watched the bullet hole close by itself.

538
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:44,240
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

539
00:48:44,902 --> 00:48:46,638
Other than that, my day sucked.

540
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:50,807
Yeah. I saw him, too. He had a guitar.

541
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:52,566
He winked at me

542
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,466
before he jumped out a fourth-floor
window like he had wings.

543
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,714
He winked at you?

544
00:48:57,849 --> 00:48:59,420
Musicians.

545
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:02,000
What else did you see?

546
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:03,507
So far, I haven't heard shit about

547
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:05,311
what you're going to do
about all this crap!

548
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,413
I mean, what do I get?

549
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:09,694
My livelihood got flushed
away and went swirling.

550
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,254
You ain't lost everything.

551
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:17,306
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot, either!

552
00:49:17,572 --> 00:49:18,769
Jesus!

553
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:21,508
Fair enough.

554
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:23,412
Catch.

555
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,809
Jesus!

556
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,829
Say hello to the last fellow who
wouldn't cooperate with me.

557
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:30,891
What, you telling me...
You tellin' me this thing is real?

558
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:34,290
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

559
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:37,557
Sometimes, more useful than
the people who bear them.

560
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:41,297
You're directly out of your fucking mind!

561
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,661
You know that!

562
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:45,730
Yeah.

563
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,501
Eyes see.

564
00:49:48,804 --> 00:49:50,944
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.

565
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:52,820
She's supposed to be your sister?

566
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:56,708
My father's daughter. That's right.

567
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:00,448
What's the matter, you don't
see the resemblance?

568
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,517
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.

569
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:06,487
With a lot of detail. What do you say?

570
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:10,425
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

571
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:14,072
He told me to tell T-Bird
that death was on its way,

572
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:15,925
whatever the fuck that means.

573
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:19,863
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

574
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,734
Want to relax that thing now?

575
00:50:24,003 --> 00:50:26,639
And this bird man, he just happened
to let you live?

576
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:29,791
You sure you ain't making all of this up

577
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,941
just to save your own ass?

578
00:50:32,548 --> 00:50:34,482
I ain't making all this up.

579
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,453
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

580
00:50:41,854 --> 00:50:43,425
All right.

581
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:50,366
A boy and his bird.

582
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:52,896
Awful touching.

583
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,767
Yeah.

584
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,678
For fuck's sake die, will you?

585
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:07,367
Give me that thing.

586
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:14,819
Thanks.

587
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,789
Funboy said he saw a black bird, too.

588
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:19,956
A big one.

589
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:23,564
Then he choked to death on his own blood.

590
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:27,502
I'll have the janitor come on up.

591
00:52:31,997 --> 00:52:33,601
You again?

592
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:35,933
Are you lost or hungry?

593
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:37,671
Hi.

594
00:52:56,692 --> 00:52:58,643
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you.

595
00:52:58,727 --> 00:52:59,908
We're in this together!

596
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:02,630
One part falls, it all falls!

597
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,307
You know how long it took
us to put this together?

598
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:09,032
That piece of rat shit made Tin
Tin into a Fucking voodoo doll.

599
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,573
Tin Tin was a dick.

600
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,641
Tin Tin. Sheesh!

601
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:16,562
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!

602
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:18,729
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!

603
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:20,043
Fire it up!

604
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:25,851
No Funboy?

605
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,069
Probably still banging away on Darla.

606
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:36,961
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.

607
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:40,030
I'm on it.

608
00:54:10,964 --> 00:54:13,965
What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?

609
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,068
I'm your passenger.

610
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:27,110
Drive.

611
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,772
What's all this happy horseshit?

612
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:37,857
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!

613
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,045
Shit!

614
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:45,783
What the fuck's the matter with you?

615
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:48,868
Stupid ass hair! You hit my car!

616
00:54:56,812 --> 00:55:00,979
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

617
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:05,148
We could use you. You did Tin Tin.

618
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:06,952
This is business, right?

619
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:08,822
Faster.

620
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,025
You got that cream stuff?

621
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:18,733
I hate this. They can't even
call it cream legally.

622
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:20,983
What in the crap!

623
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:29,123
Look. Making us popular.

624
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:31,845
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

625
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:40,821
This is Vehicle 48. We got
us a big, old, red hot rod.

626
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:44,924
Turn.

627
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:49,176
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

628
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,766
Right?

629
00:55:56,839 --> 00:55:57,871
Damn! Dead end!

630
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:04,779
Look out!

631
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,950
My God! Get outta the way!

632
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,229
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

633
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:32,939
Shit! Shit!

634
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:43,719
I hate this. This ain't good.

635
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:47,184
T-Bird! I got you, man!

636
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,824
Shit!

637
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,859
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything,
but I don't know what...

638
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:10,141
What? What?

639
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:13,062
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.

640
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:16,197
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

641
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:18,771
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

642
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:21,807
She wasn't going along with our
tenant relocation program.

643
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:23,204
And her idiot boyfriend shows up

644
00:57:23,288 --> 00:57:25,206
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear

645
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,913
into a total cluster fuck!
Who gives a shit?

646
00:57:28,997 --> 00:57:32,130
It's ancient history!
Why? What do you want?

647
00:57:32,363 --> 00:57:35,837
What is it? What? Speak to me. Speak!

648
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,270
Did you send us these complaints?

649
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,765
Come here! "Abashed the Devil stood."

650
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:47,343
Does it get you sweaty?

651
00:57:48,951 --> 00:57:53,135
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

652
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,891
I knew I knew you. But you ain't you.

653
00:57:57,322 --> 00:57:59,911
You can't be you. We put
you through the window.

654
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:01,880
There ain't no coming back.

655
00:58:01,964 --> 00:58:04,949
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

656
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,264
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

657
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:11,807
T-Bird.

658
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:15,103
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

659
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:19,276
T-Bird.

660
00:58:22,886 --> 00:58:25,018
"Abashed, the Devil stood"

661
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,988
"and felt how awful goodness is."

662
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,321
"And felt how awful goodness is."

663
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:47,436
T-Bird. T-Bird.

664
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,291
This is the 7:00 am edition
of Action News.

665
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:43,146
For over a decade,
the night before Halloween

666
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,280
has had a darker and deadlier nickname

667
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,232
in the inner city, "Devil's Night".

668
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:51,104
The name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.

669
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:54,124
Last year, over 200 individual
blazes were reported,

670
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,307
and 11 people lost their lives.

671
00:59:56,738 --> 00:59:57,956
Tonight will be key

672
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,411
of what may become the biggest and
deadliest Devil's Night ever.

673
01:00:02,051 --> 01:00:04,920
The mayor has fire fighters from
all surrounding counties...

674
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,924
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

675
01:00:11,489 --> 01:00:13,962
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

676
01:00:14,162 --> 01:00:16,162
Wait, you loved eggs.

677
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,934
Yeah, when I was five.

678
01:00:19,464 --> 01:00:22,300
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

679
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:26,238
So what did you take to become
mother of the year?

680
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:31,474
It wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

681
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:33,081
Who?

682
01:00:33,577 --> 01:00:36,479
It was nuts.

683
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,939
You're acting weird.

684
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:42,353
Did you win the lottery
or something, Darla?

685
01:00:45,556 --> 01:00:49,492
Forget it. I never was too
good at this mommy shit.

686
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:52,099
Over easy.

687
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:57,973
I like 'em over easy, Mom.

688
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:11,184
Hey, Albrecht.

689
01:01:15,124 --> 01:01:17,438
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

690
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:19,539
We just fished this out of the river.

691
01:01:19,623 --> 01:01:22,591
He's fused to his own car.
We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.

692
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:24,428
His name is T-Bird.

693
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:25,826
Arson was his specialty.

694
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:29,021
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

695
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,401
Case closed.

696
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,403
Bull-fucking shit.

697
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,010
Come here.

698
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:41,214
You're holding out on me.

699
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:43,332
I got a goddamn vigilante killer

700
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,235
knocking off scumbags left and right,

701
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:47,286
and you're covering up for somebody.

702
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:50,520
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

703
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:52,665
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me.

704
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:53,740
Okay.

705
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:55,268
Gideon's blows all to hell and
you're having a chit chat

706
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:59,480
with some weirdo who winds up in T-Bird's
car when it zigs instead of zags.

707
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:02,219
Then you steal one of my
case files from homicide,

708
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,380
and you're saying this is just
a fucking automobile accident?

709
01:02:04,404 --> 01:02:06,091
Come on! Yeah.

710
01:02:06,175 --> 01:02:07,226
Good speech though.

711
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,681
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

712
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:10,491
You gotta write that shit down.

713
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:12,443
All right, smart-ass.

714
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:16,051
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

715
01:02:16,185 --> 01:02:19,071
Welcome to the first day of
the rest of your suspension.

716
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,352
Suspension?

717
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:22,041
For what?

718
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,190
Misconduct.

719
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,129
Yeah, give me the lab.

720
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,430
One for sorrow, two for joy...

721
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:22,565
Come here.

722
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:24,713
Three for a girl, and four for a boy.

723
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:30,455
Dancing.

724
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:05,688
Eric?

725
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:11,463
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

726
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,714
Gabriel.

727
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:18,404
I thought you were dead.

728
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:21,275
You're not dead, are you?

729
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,435
I knew it was you.

730
01:04:52,506 --> 01:04:54,407
Even with the makeup.

731
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:02,250
I remembered your song.

732
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:05,352
You said, "Can't rain all the time."

733
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:08,223
That is from your song, right?

734
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:21,748
Come on, Eric. I know you're here.

735
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:27,638
I miss you and Shelly.

736
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,711
Get so lonely all by myself.

737
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:41,487
The hell with you. I thought you cared.

738
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:44,820
Sarah, I do care.

739
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:58,570
That's him. That's him!

740
01:05:58,737 --> 01:05:59,921
But he looked different.

741
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:02,393
He was all painted up white like
some kind of dead whore.

742
01:06:02,477 --> 01:06:05,561
I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me
in for some road beers, right?

743
01:06:05,645 --> 01:06:07,794
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

744
01:06:07,878 --> 01:06:11,270
And he flash fried T-Bird
to his fucking car!

745
01:06:11,354 --> 01:06:13,816
Aw, T-Bird! Here's to you, buddy.

746
01:06:14,918 --> 01:06:18,491
Maybe we ought to just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.

747
01:06:19,923 --> 01:06:23,348
Fire it up! Fire it up! Fire it up!

748
01:06:23,432 --> 01:06:24,563
You see the grave?

749
01:06:25,368 --> 01:06:26,565
Empty. Fire it...

750
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,897
Grave? What grave?

751
01:06:29,867 --> 01:06:31,504
What about my fucking grave?

752
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:33,622
Three out of four.

753
01:06:33,706 --> 01:06:36,328
He's working his way back to
this speed freak right here.

754
01:06:36,412 --> 01:06:37,758
It's not fair.

755
01:06:37,842 --> 01:06:40,431
It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control.

756
01:06:40,515 --> 01:06:43,434
T-bird, he came in, he says,
"Waste them both."

757
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:45,535
And now this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

758
01:06:49,854 --> 01:06:52,459
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

759
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:55,495
This. Hey.

760
01:06:56,795 --> 01:06:58,630
It ain't no ghost.

761
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:02,420
They have all arrived.

762
01:07:02,504 --> 01:07:03,734
Watch him.

763
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:05,571
We might need him.

764
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:08,673
Ghost gonna kill my...

765
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:24,854
He like his plain or with onions?

766
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:28,627
Fine. Don't talk to me.

767
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:32,928
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

768
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:36,668
That's what I thought.

769
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,523
Are you referring to anyone in particular?

770
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:41,376
You'll just think I'm nuts.

771
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:44,775
Yeah, well, then maybe they'll
have to lock us both up.

772
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:47,415
You see him, too?

773
01:07:48,484 --> 01:07:50,583
I saw somebody.

774
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:53,685
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

775
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,491
Eric didn't come back for me.

776
01:07:57,922 --> 01:08:01,462
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

777
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:05,466
You want a friend to walk you home?

778
01:08:52,746 --> 01:08:54,042
Being crucified.

779
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:40,891
Boys.

780
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:46,485
It seems our friend T-Bird won't
be joining us this evening

781
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:48,049
on account of a slight case of death.

782
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:50,555
You wanna sit down?

783
01:09:54,742 --> 01:09:55,956
Well, well, well.

784
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,908
Devil's Night is upon us again.

785
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:00,862
I thought we'd throw a little party,

786
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,914
start a bunch of fires, make a little profit.

787
01:10:04,587 --> 01:10:06,098
I like the pretty lights.

788
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,956
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

789
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:15,024
That's no reason to quit.

790
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:18,731
Wrong. Best reason to quit.

791
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,063
Only reason to quit.

792
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:24,935
A man has an idea.

793
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,544
The idea attracts others

794
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:31,073
like-minded.

795
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:33,664
The idea expands.

796
01:10:33,748 --> 01:10:36,815
The idea becomes an institution.

797
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:39,983
What was the idea?

798
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,839
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

799
01:10:43,923 --> 01:10:46,644
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself

800
01:10:46,728 --> 01:10:48,827
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

801
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:52,848
You see, gentlemen,

802
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:55,768
greed is for amateurs.

803
01:10:57,739 --> 01:11:01,741
Disorder, chaos, anarchy.

804
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,563
Now, that's fun!

805
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:05,877
What about Devil's Night?

806
01:11:06,044 --> 01:11:07,109
What about it?

807
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,750
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

808
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:14,083
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit heel was imitating me.

809
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:16,855
Do you know what they got now?

810
01:11:18,122 --> 01:11:20,595
Devil's Night greeting cards.

811
01:11:22,225 --> 01:11:24,060
Isn't that precious?

812
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:26,601
Yeah.

813
01:11:27,362 --> 01:11:31,001
The idea has become the institution, boys.

814
01:11:32,136 --> 01:11:33,922
Time to move along.

815
01:11:34,006 --> 01:11:36,743
You don't want us to do "Light My
Fire" time for the whole city?

816
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:38,009
No.

817
01:11:38,944 --> 01:11:41,864
No, I want you to set
a fire so goddamn big

818
01:11:41,948 --> 01:11:44,718
the gods will notice us again.
That's what I'm saying.

819
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:47,837
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye

820
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:52,022
one more time and say,
"Are we having fun or what?"

821
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:54,140
Hey, you! What's your name?

822
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:56,076
Skank! You don't feel that?

823
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,177
I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook.

824
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:02,115
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook."

825
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:05,838
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you!

826
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,910
How the hell did that thing get in here?

827
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:14,276
Gentlemen.

828
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,655
Let me go! Let me go! I gotta go!

829
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:28,124
You're him? The avenger.

830
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:31,061
The killer of killers.

831
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,129
Nice outfit.

832
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:36,099
I'm not sure about the face though.

833
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:38,217
I just want him.

834
01:12:39,907 --> 01:12:41,154
Well, you can't have him.

835
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,810
Well,

836
01:12:47,178 --> 01:12:49,079
I see you have made your decision.

837
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,737
Now let's see you enforce it.

838
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:55,690
Aw, this is already boring the
shit out of me. Kill him!

839
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:04,963
Ooh! That had to hurt.

840
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:09,264
Well, that's that.

841
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:11,904
That guy was crazy.

842
01:13:19,243 --> 01:13:20,814
He's gone.

843
01:13:29,187 --> 01:13:30,252
Get him!

844
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:50,861
Right here! Here, help me!
He's gonna kill me!

845
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:56,916
Jesus Christ!

846
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,802
Hey!

847
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:49,936
You're all going to die.

848
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:46,388
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, Skank?

849
01:15:46,687 --> 01:15:49,930
I'm not Skank. There's Skank right there.

850
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:52,031
Skank's dead.

851
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:54,067
That's right.

852
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,134
No!

853
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:04,406
What the crap!

854
01:16:05,948 --> 01:16:07,145
Don't move! Hold it!

855
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,412
That's all she wrote! Move and we shoot!

856
01:16:20,094 --> 01:16:24,195
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

857
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:28,348
Stop running immediately.

858
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:29,904
Holy shit!

859
01:16:38,145 --> 01:16:42,312
Stop immediately, lie down,
spread your arms and legs.

860
01:17:26,127 --> 01:17:28,061
Come on! Move it!

861
01:17:33,266 --> 01:17:35,497
My advice. Next time duck.

862
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,321
So many cops, you'd think they
were giving away doughnuts.

863
01:17:43,606 --> 01:17:45,276
Shit!

864
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:52,550
I knew you were gonna do that.

865
01:17:54,089 --> 01:17:55,270
Look at that out there.

866
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:58,025
The whole city ought
to be in flames by now.

867
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,094
Sky ought to be red.

868
01:18:01,624 --> 01:18:05,329
So that, I take it, is the late,
great Eric Draven.

869
01:18:05,826 --> 01:18:10,598
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

870
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,205
I like him already.

871
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:19,294
The crow is his link between
the land of the living

872
01:18:19,378 --> 01:18:21,362
and the realm of the dead.

873
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:26,053
So, kill the crow and destroy the man.

874
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:54,411
I'm coming home, Shelly.

875
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:45,479
You're gonna say I shouldn't
be in the cemetery

876
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:46,738
in the middle of the night, right?

877
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:48,564
Safest place in the world to be.

878
01:19:49,633 --> 01:19:52,156
It's 'cause everybody's dead.

879
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,503
I knew you'd come here.

880
01:19:55,507 --> 01:19:57,474
It's really late, Sarah.

881
01:19:57,641 --> 01:19:59,641
You didn't say good-bye.

882
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:04,118
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

883
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:06,714
And you're never coming back.

884
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:17,725
I gave this to Shelly once.

885
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,139
I think she'd like you to have it.

886
01:20:29,673 --> 01:20:31,673
This way you'll always remember her.

887
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:34,148
I'll never take it off.

888
01:20:53,334 --> 01:20:55,400
I better go sneak back in the house.

889
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:04,574
Bye.

890
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:26,728
Shh! Shh!

891
01:21:29,502 --> 01:21:31,337
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.

892
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:58,364
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

893
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,336
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

894
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:12,246
Her eyes are so innocent.

895
01:22:24,557 --> 01:22:25,655
Eric!

896
01:22:26,361 --> 01:22:27,855
Eric, help! Eric!

897
01:23:10,603 --> 01:23:12,570
Quick impression for ya.

898
01:23:12,836 --> 01:23:15,639
Caw! Caw! Bang! Fuck, I'm dead!

899
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,775
Give me the girl and I'll
let you walk out of here.

900
01:23:22,384 --> 01:23:23,668
Well, well.

901
01:23:23,752 --> 01:23:26,518
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that?

902
01:23:36,156 --> 01:23:37,694
Nah. Fuck it.

903
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:47,836
Aw, fuck.

904
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:57,368
Well, well, well.

905
01:23:57,452 --> 01:23:59,733
It does seem to me that our
little life has undergone

906
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:01,960
a rather significant change
in the past few minutes now.

907
01:24:01,984 --> 01:24:03,819
Wouldn't you agree?

908
01:24:07,858 --> 01:24:10,892
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

909
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,766
It's still alive. Well, then kill it!

910
01:24:19,507 --> 01:24:20,572
Bye-bye, birdie.

911
01:25:06,521 --> 01:25:07,817
Shit.

912
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,540
Well, just came by to pay my respects

913
01:25:10,624 --> 01:25:12,426
and here you are
getting all shot up again.

914
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:13,691
They've taken Sarah.

915
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:14,858
How many?

916
01:25:15,057 --> 01:25:16,661
Two more.

917
01:25:17,598 --> 01:25:18,960
I can handle it. Don't worry.

918
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:21,749
I'm not worried. Look, here's the plan.

919
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:22,981
You stay in front,

920
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:24,812
and when they run out of ammo,
I'll arrest 'em.

921
01:25:24,836 --> 01:25:27,969
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

922
01:25:30,842 --> 01:25:33,579
Shit. You're bleeding all over the place.

923
01:25:33,977 --> 01:25:36,582
I thought, you know, you were invincible.

924
01:25:37,013 --> 01:25:39,618
I was. I'm not anymore.

925
01:25:41,889 --> 01:25:44,541
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

926
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:45,789
Come on.

927
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:52,466
You take that.

928
01:26:22,091 --> 01:26:23,910
You were supposed to stay behind me.

929
01:26:23,994 --> 01:26:25,631
I think I messed up.

930
01:26:49,855 --> 01:26:52,592
This is all the power you ever had.

931
01:26:53,595 --> 01:26:54,924
Now it is mine.

932
01:26:56,026 --> 01:26:58,631
Pity there's not more time

933
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:01,634
for us.

934
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:22,556
Help, Eric! I'm scared!

935
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,791
Let me go!

936
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,803
Let her go!

937
01:27:41,676 --> 01:27:44,611
You can have me. I won't fight you.

938
01:27:45,977 --> 01:27:47,631
All right.

939
01:27:47,715 --> 01:27:48,780
No!

940
01:28:34,828 --> 01:28:36,025
Eric!

941
01:28:56,047 --> 01:28:57,047
Sarah?

942
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:59,180
Look out!

943
01:29:04,957 --> 01:29:06,055
Eric!

944
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,032
You know, my daddy used to say.

945
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:18,183
"Every man's got a devil"

946
01:29:18,267 --> 01:29:20,806
"and you can't rest till you find him."

947
01:29:21,072 --> 01:29:23,710
What happened back there with
you and your girlfriend.

948
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,240
I cleared that building.

949
01:29:26,847 --> 01:29:29,683
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.

950
01:29:30,312 --> 01:29:32,917
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

951
01:29:33,788 --> 01:29:35,887
But if it's any consolation to you,

952
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:38,989
you have put a smile on my face.

953
01:29:40,058 --> 01:29:41,992
You got a lot of spirit, son.

954
01:29:42,995 --> 01:29:44,225
I am going to miss you.

955
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:47,063
I have something to give you.

956
01:29:47,901 --> 01:29:49,901
I don't want it anymore.

957
01:29:54,006 --> 01:29:55,742
Thirty hours of pain!

958
01:29:59,814 --> 01:30:01,209
All at once!

959
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:05,884
All for you.

960
01:30:31,142 --> 01:30:32,273
Yeah.

961
01:30:41,284 --> 01:30:42,855
Go help him.

962
01:30:47,961 --> 01:30:49,290
Are you alive?

963
01:30:53,296 --> 01:30:55,263
God, I need a cigarette.

964
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:03,090
Everybody else dead?

965
01:31:03,174 --> 01:31:04,877
You helped me.

966
01:31:06,078 --> 01:31:08,177
What you kept in here saved me.

967
01:31:09,015 --> 01:31:10,883
Thanks. Don't mention it.

968
01:31:11,886 --> 01:31:13,566
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

969
01:31:19,894 --> 01:31:21,058
Yuck.

970
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:26,800
I'm quitting as of now, if I live.

971
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:39,043
Stay with him until help comes.

972
01:31:40,112 --> 01:31:41,980
He'll be okay, right?

973
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:45,016
Eric?

974
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:50,120
He does that a lot.

975
01:32:06,974 --> 01:32:08,006
Shelly.

976
01:32:27,258 --> 01:32:29,110
At least it stopped raining?

977
01:32:29,194 --> 01:32:30,309
It can't rain all the time.

978
01:32:30,393 --> 01:32:31,915
No, I don't believe it.

979
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:34,131
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

980
01:32:34,331 --> 01:32:35,886
Look, you go on home.

981
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,266
I'm okay. Okay.

982
01:32:37,466 --> 01:32:38,922
Want to tell me what's going on?

983
01:32:39,006 --> 01:32:40,940
Your vigilante's up on the roof.

984
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:44,911
You missed it.

985
01:32:45,276 --> 01:32:46,473
Get him outta here!

986
01:33:52,046 --> 01:33:53,144
Thanks.

987
01:33:59,152 --> 01:34:02,269
If the people we love are stolen from us,

988
01:34:02,353 --> 01:34:06,322
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

989
01:34:07,094 --> 01:34:10,079
Buildings burn, people die,

990
01:34:10,163 --> 01:34:12,064
but real love is forever.
