1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,968
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer in...

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,933
In Sumeria.

3
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,602
And what happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

4
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,520
Jesus' disciples performed miracles.
When Simon Magus saw the miracles

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,278
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

6
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,197
And how did Peter respond?

7
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,075
John Rossi?

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,371
Stand up.

9
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,712
Answer my question, John Rossi.

10
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,174
That's not my name.

11
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:36,803
You and all the other bastards
lucky enough to be here,

12
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,471
children of sin, spawn of the damned,
are all named for saints!

13
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,897
Saints who were disciplined.

14
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,899
Saints who were chaste.

15
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,987
You were named
for John Baptist Rossi,

16
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:56,823
a Capuchin priest who gave away
all his possessions.

17
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,871
A man who had nothing, like you.

18
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:07,455
Now what is your name,
you ungrateful cur?

19
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,349
Your name, boy!

20
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:28,893
Have you lost your tongue?
What is your name?

21
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,864
All the girls will remain
locked in their dormitory

22
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,621
and no food will be served
to any boy

23
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,789
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

24
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,901
Food, food, food!

25
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,746
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

26
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,708
No. Simon Templar.

27
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,679
Agnes!

28
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,974
Agnes!

29
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,358
Agnes!

30
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,744
-What are you doing?
-Agnes!

31
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,170
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

32
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,547
It won't happen,
because we're leaving tonight,

33
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,217
this hardy brotherhood,
on a crusade.

34
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:06,429
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love, to bid you farewell.

35
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,725
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss, can I?

36
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,894
Hey, watch this.

37
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,830
We've lost some girls!
The girls are missing!

38
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,334
There are girls missing!
Come on, boys, hurry up.

39
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,003
Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!

40
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,179
Wait, John Rossi, my kiss.

41
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:55,687
There he is! Get him!

42
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,210
October 3rd, entering
foyer of Tretiak Industries.

43
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:22,964
Heavy security in the elevators.
Guards in uniform.

44
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,760
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate pass key.

45
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,390
Maybe use stairs. No traffic there.

46
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:36,478
October 4th. Personal tidbits.

47
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,232
Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.

48
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,194
It left Tretiak the sole owner
of gas and oil empire.

49
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,491
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

50
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,327
Who are you?

51
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,955
Vehicle was driven
by younger son, llya, now 27.

52
00:06:56,123 --> 00:07:00,085
Wife now lives in Geneva following
an assassination attempt in 1996.

53
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,297
-I'm Ivan Ivanovich.
-No other children.

54
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,922
October 5th. llya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado with Bandido buddies.

55
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,555
Gangster rap coffee
flirting with teenage girls.

56
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,683
Small firearms in coats,
machine pistols in cars.

57
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,437
...compulsory military service.

58
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,858
Family company employs all four
as fix-it guys...

59
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,679
There were three great
empires that dominated the world,

60
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,437
both culturally and militarily:

61
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,526
Rome, Constantinople and Russia.

62
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,193
All three have fallen.
Only one can be restored.

63
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:56,701
And only one man can restore it:

64
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,372
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

65
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:28,145
Friends. Countrymen. Russians!

66
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,911
You people here in this room...

67
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,165
are the cream of Russia.

68
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:48,249
And the whole nation
is listening with us.

69
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:52,048
But why do you all listen to me rave?

70
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:56,716
Set aside my oil company,
forget about my best-selling book,

71
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:01,429
And all I am is a lunatic
haunted by the fantasy

72
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,436
of an empire that reclaims
her former might, her former size.

73
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,571
All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of Russia

74
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,869
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth!

75
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:31,921
Not ridiculed, but revered!

76
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:38,215
No, more than revered. Feared!

77
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:52,104
But who am I to dazzle you
with this dream? All I've done...

78
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:57,818
How does it look for the leader's son
to walk out when the leader speaks?

79
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:03,532
You'd prefer the leader's son
to piss his pants on live TV?

80
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:09,542
And still the people
freeze to death!

81
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,396
I love this country.

82
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,323
I don't speak Russian.

83
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:50,407
In that case, stand up,
put your hands behind your head

84
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,664
and turn around slowly.

85
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,380
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

86
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:12,471
Listen, if I give this to you,
you're gonna give it to your daddy.

87
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:17,230
And what's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

88
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:20,316
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me a million dollars.

89
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,819
If we partner,
we'll split 50-50,

90
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,738
that's half a million
in hard currency.

91
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:27,573
Think of the drugs
you could buy with that much cake.

92
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,577
You'll be discoing for a decade
in Moscow, mate.

93
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:35,290
I don't need your small change.
That's your first problem.

94
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,792
Here is your second.

95
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,587
Microchip, please.

96
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,302
-Freeze!
-Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

97
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,805
Suck me sideways.

98
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,926
My eyes!

99
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,031
Give it up!

100
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,914
You've got no place to go!

101
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,763
A goddamn button!

102
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,483
Back of the building! Come on!

103
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:42,249
-Where's the body?
-No body. Just some guy in rags.

104
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,776
As the bitter chill of
winter descends on Moscow,

105
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,363
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric

106
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,906
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

107
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:00,536
Now, a billionaire oil magnate
and leader of his own political party,

108
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,207
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia

109
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,753
will only worsen unless reformist
President Karpov can overcome

110
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:13,337
the heating oil shortage that has
already killed scores of Russians.

111
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,887
In his speech today, Tretiak called
on elements of the Russian army

112
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,807
who are opposed to the elected
government, to seize control

113
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,102
and end the heating oil crisis...

114
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:25,645
What beautiful work.

115
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:29,816
...angry siege
at the American embassy.

116
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:34,483
Fired by Tretiak's attacks on U.S.
foreign policy, the protesters...

117
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,533
Cloisonneé. It is old.

118
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,494
Yes. It belonged to my grandmother.

119
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,249
Please.

120
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:55,007
Tonight I feel like the oldest person
on this plane.

121
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,970
My husband,
he's sending me to England

122
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,639
to live until things change.

123
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:05,100
You are married not even a year

124
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,646
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend!

125
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,192
I'm sorry, it's not my business.

126
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,448
<i>How come you know
SO much about me?</i>

127
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,616
It is a gift.

128
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,371
I am Martin de Porres.

129
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,541
I'm from Spain, but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint

130
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,125
who could cure the sick
or the injured by the laying of hands.

131
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,480
He's the same build as the description
the Russians gave us,

132
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,648
but he doesn't sound
like an Aussie.

133
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,446
He could be faking it.

134
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:10,207
X-rays are clear, he hasn't
swallowed the microchip. Anything?

135
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,170
You English with your fish and chips.
On the plane I have chicken.

136
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:18,837
Van Gogh theft, Netherlands,
last year. Same eyes.

137
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,385
Different chin.

138
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,221
Halcyon Hotel, sir.

139
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,568
Stand up! What is your name?

140
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,570
Answer the question!

141
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,366
What is your name... Name... Name...

142
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:34,375
Hey, Lou. The microchip arrived.
I put the dough in your Swiss account.

143
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,294
Sorry I didn't get back to you
about the diamonds.

144
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:38,045
But Moscow's like Dodge City now.

145
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,381
All them greedy commies have turned
into capitalists.

146
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,300
It's disgusting.
It's made them sloppy.

147
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,345
One or two more easy score,
I top 50 mill, I'm out of the game.

148
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,597
-Yeah, I heard that before.
-Not from me.

149
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,517
I don't know nothing. If you don't
believe me, try and find me.

150
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,519
-Fuck you, Lou!
-Cheers.

151
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,902
I can't seem to break 50.

152
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,873
"One million U.S. dollars,
non-refundable...

153
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,540
"reserves you a quiet table
at a romantic little spot in Berlin

154
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:05,504
"called Templehof,
which has a cozy transit lounge.

155
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,928
"To get inside, you walk through
the metal detectors,

156
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:11,138
“and I walk through
the metal detectors.

157
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,268
"And since you know I'm not armed

"we can both fall in love
and nobody gets hurt."”

159
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,371
-I can't see him.
-Then look for him.

160
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,539
You have a long, beautiful cane.
Along with your beautiful eyes.

161
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,841
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

162
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,885
-Who are you?
-My name is Bruno Hautenfaust.

163
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,222
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

164
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:56,850
Had the wine, the women, the songs,
and then, inexplicably,

165
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,395
took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit

166
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,482
went off to live in the forest,
in the nude.

167
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,233
Please leave.

168
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,320
I represent
the professional you hired.

169
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,866
I'm his business manager.
I speak for him.

170
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,120
We don't deal with underlings.
Come on, Father, let's go.

171
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,916
Wait, sit down. Listen and learn.

172
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,502
Youth.

173
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:31,631
Who runs this thief?
CIA? MI-67? Libya?

174
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,890
He's not a race car, nobody runs him.
He's an independent contractor.

175
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,434
Good. Then no one will mind
if I kill him.

176
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:44,811
Yes, I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that.

177
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,904
Even with metal detectors.
Even in this transit lounge.

178
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:57,036
It's so early. You guys want
to get some coffee or something?

179
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,955
Sure.

180
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,419
Be quiet.

181
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,130
What is it you request
of my employer?

182
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:12,050
-Do you know what cold fusion is?
-Of course.

183
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,805
It's the theory of nuclear fusion
at room temperature.

184
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,725
-Free energy forever.
-Yes.

185
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:27,191
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

186
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,318
Those who claim
to have achieved it,

187
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,612
have never been able to duplicate it.

188
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,238
Until now.

189
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:38,660
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

190
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:43,578
We believe that this good lady
made a breakthrough in cold fusion.

191
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,337
Your employer will obtain
the formula for me.

192
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:51,715
He's very busy.
And you're very boring.

193
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,051
Your offer must inspire him.

194
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:56,929
This woman has repeatedly avoided

195
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,307
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

196
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,060
She's cagey, difficult.

197
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:06,897
Maybe your agents are stupid.

198
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:15,114
I think this inspiration
would cost you three million dollars.

199
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,367
-Ridiculous.
-Why?

200
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,621
You'll have the world market
in energy.

201
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:25,999
Cost you a nickel for every million
you make. His deposit should go...

202
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:30,295
It is not for me.
It is for Mother Russia.

203
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:34,299
But you want Mother Russia too,
Mr. Tretiak.

204
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,846
Three million on deposit
in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?

205
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:41,724
Yes.

206
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,975
And how long to get
your employer's agreement?

207
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:48,772
I'll ask.

208
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:06,790
Your offer has inspired her.
I'll do it.

209
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,295
Bank account number in Zurich.

210
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,507
-Bye, sonny.
-Bye-bye.

211
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:19,553
I really love this guy.

212
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,229
-Too bad we have to kill him.
-Yeah, too bad.

213
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,619
When the electro-chemists Hans
and Fleischman announced in 1989

214
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:51,501
that they had discovered cold fusion,

215
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,464
a revolutionary process
of generating energy,

216
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,719
They were at first
acclaimed as geniuses,

217
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,430
and then condemned as charlatans.

218
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,641
The protocols of cold fusion...

219
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,852
What are those? Drugs?

220
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,482
Can I have one? My head is pounding.
She's boring the life out of me.

221
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,152
They're for my heart.

222
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,533
You have very pretty eyes.
Pretty lady.

223
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,326
-Who are you?
-Me?

224
00:28:24,493 --> 00:28:26,912
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

225
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,623
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

226
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,293
You don't put any stock in this
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

227
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,879
-Actually, I do.
-Really?

228
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,673
Dr. Emma Russell!

229
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:55,645
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

230
00:28:57,443 --> 00:29:00,821
I'm more interested
in what questions you all have

231
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,323
about cold fusion.

232
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,118
So I thought we would start
with those. Any questions?

233
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,166
-Please?
-Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.

234
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,250
Can you explain the actual process
of fusion? You know, the theory?

235
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,299
Yes. There it is.

236
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,719
This is the apparatus.

237
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,891
And very simply,
when positively charged deuterons

238
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,477
are attracted
to the palladium cathode,

239
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,521
they cram together.

240
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:38,104
There are millions and millions
of them getting closer and closer,

241
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,776
and then they fuse. And they create
energy in the form of helium.

242
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:47,326
But I read that the experiment
couldn't be replicated. So...

243
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,372
-How do we know it works?
-Well, we don't.

244
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,708
Not yet.

245
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:59,167
But if you remember, Einstein knew
the theory of relativity to be true

246
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,216
long before he could prove it.
He felt the truth.

247
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:08,305
And some of us feel the same way
about cold fusion.

248
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,724
Because it's there, it's in nature,

249
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:15,270
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

250
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,938
And when we ignite
that cold fusion fire,

251
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:22,694
I mean, just imagine...

252
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:27,157
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of sea water

253
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,328
than in all the known
oil reserves on Earth.

254
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:35,453
You could drive your car 55 million
miles on a gallon of heavy water.

255
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,960
It would be the end of pollution.
Warmth for the whole world.

256
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,553
So why don't I demonstrate for you

257
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:51,890
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

258
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,977
They use very complex...

259
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,190
November 17th, 11.30 a.m.

260
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,778
Entering flat of Dr. Emma Russell,
High Street, Oxford.

261
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,239
No alarms on outer doors. Strange.

262
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,324
No messages.

263
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,040
Shelley monument.

264
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,126
Entering bathroom.

265
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,212
Books.

266
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,425
More books.

267
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,764
<i>Walls covered with reminder notes.</i>

268
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,143
Poetry.

269
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,201
Dad.

270
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:28,858
"Stop and talk to Shelley every day.
How can I love a man named Percy?

271
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:37,246
"Isn't there someone in the world
who can consume me like that?

272
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,708
"Magic. Romantic."

273
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,886
No recent applications.
Cold fusion notes.

274
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,482
"Although I pass
the Shelley monument every day,

275
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:08,026
"its sadness strikes me every time.

276
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:12,280
"For some reason, I feel a very
personal loss when I look at it.

277
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,741
"So much pain and so much passion."

278
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:22,582
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness,

279
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,210
"and in the shadow of death.

280
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,672
"Luke 1, Verse 79."

281
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:32,092
Tretiak's wrong, she's not cagey.

282
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,180
She's not difficult,
she's just eccentric.

283
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,683
She's innocent.

284
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:48,400
Maybe it's in her head.

285
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,570
She needs a poet.

286
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,530
An artist.

287
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:59,198
Someone who understands truth.

288
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,337
She needs Thomas Moore.

289
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,385
Do you like it?

290
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,725
-What?
-The sculpture. Do you like it?

291
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,480
Yes.

292
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:10,982
What do you love about it?

293
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:24,867
The way it... glows.

294
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:31,124
And how the light
holds him in silence,

295
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,549
taking care of him.

296
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,595
Yeah, that's what I like about it.

297
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,809
-Are you an artist?
-No.

298
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,480
Just a traveler
searching for purity.

299
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,192
-What do you search for?
-Energy.

300
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,569
Yes.

301
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,741
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

302
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,494
No, not really.

303
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,334
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home in Africa.

304
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,210
You should experience the energy
of where all life began.

305
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,973
Sorry, I'm not very good with people.

306
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,896
Me neither.

307
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:02,385
"I see my angel for the first time.

308
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,847
"Know my purpose, feel my birth.

309
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,144
Then distinctly,

310
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,730
"The sweet strains of our union,

311
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:17,483
"Our love heats up the cold universe

312
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:20,654
"And gives my tired,
desperate heart..."

313
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,160
...are eternally healed.

314
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,706
-Do you like it?
-Who did you write it for?

315
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,792
You.

316
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,629
You're following me or it's destiny.

317
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:42,133
-Either way, it's weird.
-Very weird.

318
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,971
Destiny, then.

319
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,942
This must look strange.

320
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,406
It's something that I'm working on.

321
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,490
A formula for creating energy.

322
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,915
That you carry around
in your underwear?

323
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:17,669
Yeah. I do.

324
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,726
How did you do that?

325
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,562
Magic.

326
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:37,856
Give it back.

327
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,777
- It looks like Sanskrit.
-Give it back.

328
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,365
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

329
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,997
-What else do you keep in there?
-Nothing.

330
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:55,915
That's not true.

331
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,795
Can I get you anything else?

332
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,423
Drink your wine.

333
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,467
Latour '57.

334
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:11,848
The Latour, sir,
is 400 pounds a bottle.

335
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,188
Then we'll have two bottles.

336
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,402
There, you count it.

337
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,036
All these little tubes and microbes.

338
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,622
-And molecules.
-Those too.

339
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:41,290
-Can I tell you something?
-What? You must. Everything.

340
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:45,339
-It's a secret.
-What?

341
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,718
I'm done.

342
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:55,058
My energy research, I'm finished.

343
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,894
I still have some sequencing
to work out

344
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:02,106
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

345
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,527
It's been you
against the whole world, hasn't it?

346
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,655
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

347
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,074
The gift of faith.

348
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,953
To see...

349
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:20,788
Well, to believe in something
that's all around us

350
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:25,088
but hidden from our sight.

351
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:28,382
It's a beautiful thought.

352
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,635
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

353
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,764
I don't even know your name.

354
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:36,766
My name is...

355
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:41,396
I don't want to tell you my name.
No, I don't want to do that.

356
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,401
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

357
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:51,864
-What's your name?
-Emma.

358
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,785
Emma. Now I know
everything about you.

359
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,997
You're a genius.

360
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,419
You have a weak heart.

361
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,925
You have beautiful dreams.

362
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,927
Great courage.

363
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,138
Unafraid in this world.

364
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:17,348
You get that from your father.

365
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:22,270
You can't cook to save your life.

366
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,897
And you love fish.

367
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,110
I do love fish.

368
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:31,571
That's weird.

369
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:34,740
-I want to try that.
-No.

370
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:38,036
-Yes.
-I don't want you to. Drink your wine.

371
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,042
Yes, I do.
What's your name?

372
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,753
My name is Thomas Moore.

373
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:51,549
I was named after a saint...

374
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,471
who died for his faith.

375
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,058
Okay.

376
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,854
Your work...

377
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,567
is very dangerous and alive.

378
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:13,696
And I love your poems.
They move me.

379
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,159
But that's not who you really are.

380
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,619
You're running away
from your past and your pain

381
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,254
and yet you keep it so close to you.

382
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,843
You don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

383
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:39,806
because you're beautiful.

384
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,741
What are you doing?

385
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:02,134
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
What happened?

386
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,930
I don't know,
I was weeping and I slipped.

387
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,188
I was thinking of you,
I don't know...

388
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:14,400
Well, I live right down the street,
I could clean you up.

389
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:17,570
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

390
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,280
-I don't know.
-Wait.

391
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,160
I'm glad that it stopped bleeding.
You don't need stitches.

392
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,215
We have to disinfect it, though.

393
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:39,926
You really are an angel.

394
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,596
You are.

395
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,266
This is gonna hurt.

396
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,104
I'm sorry.

397
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:57,027
-I'm sorry. Are you all right?
-Yeah.

398
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,655
I'm sorry, I was just joking.

399
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,493
- I should go.
-No.

400
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,079
Yes, you... I...

401
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:12,249
-Take off your pants.
-Pardon?

402
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:14,210
I mean, your sweater.

403
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:20,508
There's blood on it. I'll wash it.

404
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,848
You're very domestic.

405
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:32,103
There's blood on your blouse
as well.

406
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,107
I'll wash it.

407
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,123
Do you have any wine?

408
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:09,140
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

409
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,268
How could I not?

410
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,230
You make me feel so good.

411
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,941
I wish...

412
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,027
I wish you could understand.

413
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,864
I want you to know who I am.

414
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,259
Oh, my heart.

415
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,096
Don't disappear, I'll be right back.

416
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,172
You can't do this.
She's so great.

417
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,218
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.

418
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,538
Hi.

419
00:48:12,263 --> 00:48:16,763
"To Spider. Must fly.
Have better offer."

420
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,521
Greedy Westerner.
Wants more money.

421
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:24,566
Who cares?
Can't spend hard currency in hell.

422
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,320
Send this message:
"Fly. Don't buzz off.

423
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,620
"I'll double your fee.

424
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:41,413
"Or send my own boys
to take care of the woman."

425
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,884
Are you okay?

426
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,474
I just want to lie here.

427
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,856
Can we just be like this tonight?

428
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,859
Is that what you want?

429
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,403
It's so magic.

430
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:17,411
It just feels so perfect.

431
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,611
It's 7:00 a.m.
and here are the news headlines...

432
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,288
Thomas?

433
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:22,036
-Lev Naumovitch! It's here.
-It's revolutionary, sir.

434
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:25,164
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas.

435
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:28,876
But I think the formula
is incomplete. It will take months...

436
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:30,377
But that won't do.

437
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:33,297
Now that the people
are beginning to freeze,

438
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:37,134
Tretiak must swoop in from the wings
with a miracle to save them.

439
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,388
-How high do you want it?
-To the top.

440
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:43,098
-Good morning, Yuri.
-Good morning.

441
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,895
Perhaps I can confirm the validity
of this formula more quickly

442
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:51,565
if I dispense
with certain protocols. But...

443
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,945
How long, Dr. Botvin, since you
received your last salary check

444
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,698
from Moscow University?

445
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,867
Ukrainian Independence Day.

446
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,286
Last August.

447
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:08,957
Ivan, he's online.

448
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,420
Do it.

449
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:20,678
"To Spider. You've got the recipe..."

450
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:24,390
-"Where's my dough?"
-"To Human Fly.

451
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,850
"Recipe incomplete.
The cake won't rise.

452
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,816
"Hence, no dough."

453
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:45,244
-"I'm not the baker."
-"Don't make me the butcher."

454
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,415
I like this guy.

455
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,547
"No play, no pay.

456
00:52:56,714 --> 00:53:00,175
“I'm certain you kept the cookbook."

457
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,977
Holland Park.

458
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,080
I'll check that for you. Yes,
that seems to be fine. One moment.

459
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:41,550
He's keeping me online.

460
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,062
You wait here.

461
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:39,316
You! Beside the car!

462
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,779
Now turn around!
Step away from the vehicle!

463
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:45,280
He's armed!

464
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,972
Come on, drive!

465
00:55:19,273 --> 00:55:21,650
Go the other way! Go!

466
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,956
What about him?

467
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,008
What about this one?

468
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:52,597
Yeah, that...

469
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:56,059
You see, we believe
they're all the same villain.

470
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:02,357
Oh, my God.

471
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:08,196
-They're all him?
-We believe so.

472
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:11,950
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

473
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,913
Then he fled the UK out of Heathrow.

474
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,624
We've got a handful of
false identities used on

475
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:21,376
visas, passports, leases...

476
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,631
Nicholas Owen.
Louis Guanella.

477
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:27,591
Peter Damian.

478
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:30,469
Charles Borromeo.

479
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:33,305
Of course.

480
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:38,556
Thomas Moore.
All the names of Catholic saints.

481
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:46,731
Can you access Heathrow's passenger
lists for the last... eight hours?

482
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,240
- I think it might be possible.
-Good.

483
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:21,353
Yes!

484
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,199
Yes!

485
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,961
See, my friends,
you back the biggest rat.

486
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:20,328
Out! Out! Freeloaders, out!

487
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,291
I want to drink alone.
Close the curtain!

488
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:49,107
-What?
-What?

489
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,611
Don't look down.

490
00:58:53,779 --> 00:58:57,115
-Do you know who I am?
-No.

491
00:58:57,908 --> 00:59:00,619
I'm the thief you tried to cheat.

492
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:03,914
And this is your accountant.

493
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,877
Talk to him.

494
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:13,506
The phone goes the other way,
you moron.

495
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:20,097
Hello? Tretiak speaking.

496
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:25,185
That money to Zurich, send it now.

497
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,313
I said now.

498
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,898
Yeah.

499
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:33,944
Thank you.

500
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:38,198
Do you know what the hardest part
about being you is?

501
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,535
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

502
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,539
You son of a bitch!

503
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:48,750
There is an impostor in there!
Get him out!

504
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,337
Hey, hey. Hey.

505
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:55,174
Take your hands off me, you idiots!

506
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:59,841
Are you crazy? It's me!
Go! Get him! Go!

507
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,556
Ilya, get the bastard!

508
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:27,372
Fifty million. I'm out.

509
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:34,087
Mr. Ferrer, checking out.

510
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,100
I'll have one too.

511
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,062
-Emma

512
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,733
I am... I'm overwhelmed.

513
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,196
-You found me.
-It wasn't very hard.

514
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,659
Two men with saints' names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

515
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:08,330
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African.

516
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:10,498
Whereas Vincent Ferrer...

517
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,001
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

518
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,920
How could you do it?

519
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:20,258
Emma, I had to.

520
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:24,721
-I'm a thief.
-I want my cards back.

521
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,599
You flew all this way
because you want your cards?

522
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:30,936
-Yes, I did.
-No. It's because you're in love.

523
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,734
-I rest my case.
-Who are you?

524
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,237
No one has a clue, least of all me.

525
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:45,738
And why would you steal
cold fusion? It's free.

526
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,204
Why would you do that?

527
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:54,918
-Eight million reasons.
-Eight million? Is that all?

528
01:01:56,837 --> 01:02:01,337
I would have given them to you
if you'd only asked.

529
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,849
You've got to get away from me.

530
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:13,228
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why you lied to me.

531
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,939
-You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

532
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,692
You almost got me killed. The guy
I stole it for says it doesn't work.

533
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:22,446
-Well, screw him!
- I don't think you'd enjoy that.

534
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:25,448
Yeah, you're right,
I don't think I would.

535
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:35,834
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

536
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:51,015
-They took my pills.
-No, I palmed them from your purse.

537
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:55,850
I need one or two, I need...
I have a bad heart and...

538
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:59,649
-I know.
-It's starting to pound.

539
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:04,317
It's okay, I've got your pills.
I've got two in my hand.

540
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:08,283
-I'm gonna pass out.
-Sit down on the floor.

541
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:13,163
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

542
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,708
That's right, eat two out of my hand.
That's right.

543
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,669
Okay?

544
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:21,296
While you're down there...

545
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:26,384
Get the pocketknife out of my boot.

546
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:32,349
This formula makes
certain assumptions

547
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:36,644
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes.

548
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:41,312
Testing at any level becomes futile
without any further information.

549
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:42,775
Mr. Tretiak.

550
01:03:42,943 --> 01:03:47,443
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.
Help is here.

551
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:01,002
The two came very quietly.

552
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:12,514
And they left even more quietly.

553
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,185
Close the city. Kill him.

554
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:20,605
And bring her alive.

555
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,790
Why are they after me?

556
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:42,043
Tretiak, the guy I worked for,
owns this city. Cops and all.

557
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,839
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

558
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:48,591
What do you want from me?

559
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,143
-Everything's on those cards?
-Yes.

560
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,105
-So the formula works?
-Kiss me again.

561
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:07,485
-No.
-Make up your mind.

562
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:12,153
I... I have to figure out the order
before the formula works.

563
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,786
-I'm not gonna give it to him.
-Tretiak will find you.

564
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,081
-No.
-He found me, and that's very hard.

565
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,709
- I found you.
-Yes, you did.

566
01:05:24,044 --> 01:05:25,545
What do you need?

567
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,511
I need some time, and I need...

568
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:36,848
I need a place to work.

569
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:44,272
-Where's everyone going?
-To their country relatives.

570
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:48,067
To cut firewood.
There's no heat in this city.

571
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,413
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

572
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,873
I don't know.

573
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:06,294
-Two hours maybe. I don't know.
-It should be enough time...

574
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:10,256
to get our passports together
and for us to get married.

575
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,010
-We're getting married?
-Yes.

576
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:18,014
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

577
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:24,396
-You're not Martin.
-No.

578
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,441
Who are you?

579
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,070
I don't have a name.

580
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,114
Sad.

581
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:39,369
-Will you have one when we get home?
-I don't have a home.

582
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:43,331
When we get back, you do
the science, I'll do the math.

583
01:06:43,415 --> 01:06:47,377
We'll market your formula around
the world, we'll make a fortune.

584
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:51,464
And then... we'll see.

585
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,061
Emma!

586
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,706
No trouble, okay?

587
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:31,087
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

588
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:39,590
I've got you.

589
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:46,848
Come on.

590
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,021
Here we go.

591
01:09:56,608 --> 01:09:58,651
Now we've got to get you warm.

592
01:10:07,327 --> 01:10:09,037
Come on, almost there.

593
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:36,815
Come on, come on.

594
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,241
You'll wait
till Christ comes to Moscow.

595
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:51,288
Elevator was made of mahogany.
Tenants used it for firewood.

596
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:55,955
We need your help.
He fell in the river. He's freezing.

597
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:59,504
-We're just people who...
-You're not people.

598
01:11:00,338 --> 01:11:02,882
-You're Americans.
-Yes.

599
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:05,718
But we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

600
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:41,504
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys.

601
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:48,177
No heat for sale, but these clothes
will make you warm.

602
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:58,563
I said "Mashenka, go back to bed."
She's always puttering around.

603
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,903
It's here. Built to escape...

604
01:12:05,737 --> 01:12:08,239
the Secret Police. In you go.

605
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,464
You've got hypothermia.

606
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,717
We've have to get
these wet clothes off...

607
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,178
and keep you warm.

608
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,264
They must be
in one of these buildings.

609
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,016
Check every apartment.

610
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,271
How are you doing?
Talk to me.

611
01:12:40,438 --> 01:12:42,731
Snug as a bug in a rug.

612
01:12:52,617 --> 01:12:57,117
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature falls

613
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:01,375
below 95 degrees.

614
01:13:14,347 --> 01:13:17,266
Two kids talking about foreigners.

615
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:28,570
Listen to me, tenants!

616
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:33,404
Show me where the Americans are.
You'll be paid in American dollars.

617
01:13:35,118 --> 01:13:38,246
Five hundred bucks reward.

618
01:13:40,373 --> 01:13:43,417
Have you seen by chance
two Americans?

619
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:48,085
Just one American and one polar bear.
Do I get 2507

620
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,404
We'll check upstairs.

621
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,668
What's your name?

622
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:30,215
Who are you really?

623
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,761
-Simon.
-Simon?

624
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:39,887
-So you were named for a saint.
-No, Simon the magician.

625
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,687
I did tricks. Tricks for Agnes.

626
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:49,025
That's how I got things.
Priests took everything.

627
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,859
Took Agnes. Dog's too big... Teeth...

628
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:59,702
She fell. I escaped.

629
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,747
I always escape.

630
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:06,042
I don't believe in magic anymore.

631
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:09,253
I do.

632
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,342
I've never felt like this before.

633
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,136
How?

634
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,680
I'm freezing.

635
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:28,648
These are here!
These Americans are here!

636
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,819
These are here!

637
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:37,239
We've got to get out of here.
Are you okay? They're coming.

638
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,037
The Americans are here!

639
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:44,538
Hurry, put this on.

640
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,963
Here they are!

641
01:16:05,226 --> 01:16:06,518
Upstairs!

642
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,539
Maybe we can jump.

643
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:28,708
Let's jump.

644
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:34,588
Run!

645
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,510
We need her alive, idiot!

646
01:17:23,179 --> 01:17:25,181
The embassy's east of here.

647
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:48,496
You're late. Where have you been?
I've been waiting two hours.

648
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:53,163
I've got some beautiful paintings
for you to buy. In here, come on.

649
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:01,801
Don't fret,
it's just my curator, Toli.

650
01:18:02,093 --> 01:18:03,552
I'm Alexa Frankievitch.

651
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,722
But being you're Americans,
you can call me Frankie.

652
01:18:06,806 --> 01:18:10,351
-Okay, I've got money. We want...
- I know.

653
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:13,020
The icon of the Virgin of the Don.

654
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,398
-Are those maps of the tunnels?
-Yes.

655
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:18,317
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American embassy.

656
01:18:18,484 --> 01:18:21,862
Right. I need 10,000 dollars up front.

657
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:22,947
No.

658
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:27,368
Okay, 7,000, and not a penny less.

659
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,089
-Police?
-No. Tretiak's goons.

660
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:53,394
-Wait!
-Sasha, go east, to the embassy.

661
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,605
-Are we lost?
-What's wrong?

662
01:18:55,688 --> 01:18:58,774
You're in Russia.
Everything's complicated.

663
01:18:59,108 --> 01:19:02,236
-But you know the way?
-Like the face of a...

664
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:04,363
Bulgari chronograph.

665
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:15,875
I remember. This way.

666
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:25,130
At last, water main. They shut it
down each afternoon in winter.

667
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:30,431
-What time do they turn it back on?
-You have five minutes.

668
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:32,474
-Plus or minus.
-Plus or minus?

669
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:35,227
It means several minutes
earlier or later.

670
01:19:35,311 --> 01:19:38,647
Don't worry.
Third opening is under your embassy.

671
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:58,250
Quick, someone's coming.

672
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,926
Come on, come on.

673
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,813
Here's the second one.
Embassy's next.

674
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:25,736
-About two more minutes.
-Yeah, unless it's minus.

675
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:32,660
Damn! It's sealed.

676
01:20:33,244 --> 01:20:36,872
-We'll have to go back.
-Come on.

677
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,940
Hurry!

678
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:13,617
Up you go!

679
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,652
The embassy's only
about a hundred yards away.

680
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,028
There's a car right above us.

681
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:51,864
Watch your head.

682
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:29,606
I'll create a diversion. Should take
you ten seconds to run to the gates.

683
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:31,820
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

684
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,825
-Okay, I can do that.
-You can do it.

685
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:40,579
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

686
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:43,415
I'll find you. You found me.

687
01:22:43,499 --> 01:22:45,042
Yeah, I did.

688
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:51,650
I'm an American! Open the gate!
Open the gate.

689
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:57,114
Back off from the gate! Back off!

690
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,617
I said back off!

691
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:03,412
Stand back from the gate.

692
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,583
I said back off!

693
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:23,224
She out-ran you? How humiliating.

694
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,814
One shot left.

695
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:36,653
Can't come all the way to Russia
and not play Russian roulette.

696
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,658
Before you shoot me, don't you want
to know where all the money's hidden?

697
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:44,494
-Whose money?
-Tretiak's, yours.

698
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,206
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

699
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:51,043
-What are you saying?
-Your father's stashed billions.

700
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:54,004
And I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

701
01:24:55,464 --> 01:24:57,966
Where are all those hidden billions?

702
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,177
I know.

703
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,180
But I don't think I'm gonna tell you.

704
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:39,383
You're worse than all the others.
However, the burns will heal.

705
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:44,676
Maybe a little chance of scarring.
But I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

706
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:50,390
Lucky?
Look at me, I'm a damn devil.

707
01:25:56,942 --> 01:26:01,321
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula,

708
01:26:01,405 --> 01:26:05,905
and must conclude that it is not
merely incomplete, but impossible.

709
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:12,374
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.

710
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,335
I invest millions,

711
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:19,882
and you can't make it work!

712
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:26,305
What are you doing with my money?

713
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:33,308
Do you think it comes so easy? No!

714
01:26:34,438 --> 01:26:38,938
Sir, I have been working
for nearly two weeks without sleep.

715
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:45,449
At first blush, the theorem appears
quite impressive. Convincing.

716
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,034
It does?

717
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:55,792
Yes, it does.

718
01:26:56,627 --> 01:27:00,547
Good man. We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

719
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:05,803
Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.

720
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,806
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press.

721
01:27:08,889 --> 01:27:13,389
From here to the airport are three
army checkpoints, all loyal to us.

722
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:19,062
Make sure they all get the message.
She doesn't leave Moscow alive.

723
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:26,532
Mr. President, as former
Vice Minister of Energy and Power,

724
01:27:27,032 --> 01:27:31,532
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

725
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,915
And as our countrymen
freeze to death,

726
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:39,002
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology,

727
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:43,670
about which I'm hopelessly out of
my league from a scientific viewpoint.

728
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:47,844
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here,

729
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:51,348
Dr. Lev Botvin
from the University of Moscow.

730
01:27:51,515 --> 01:27:56,015
Before we are dazzled by the good
news, let's dispense with the bad.

731
01:27:56,896 --> 01:27:58,981
What is the price of this marvel?

732
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:02,484
The cost of research
and development are there,

733
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,945
which is all
you are asked to defray.

734
01:28:11,243 --> 01:28:14,037
Ten billion in hard currency?

735
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:18,291
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

736
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:27,884
Where are you heading?

737
01:28:28,385 --> 01:28:31,596
I thought we'd drink some vodka
to get warmer.

738
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:40,685
Like the miracle of socialism,
our miracle of cold fusion failed.

739
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:46,858
But no matter. We have sold
cold fusion to President Karpov.

740
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:51,408
We will use the scandal
of his failure to destroy him.

741
01:28:51,575 --> 01:28:54,244
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

742
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:57,998
You're in a hurry, Ivan Petrovich.
That's one day.

743
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:00,459
Not now, old witch, we're working.

744
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:06,127
Think of it. In one day you can be
proud again to be a Russian general.

745
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:12,763
With a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

746
01:29:13,722 --> 01:29:15,890
You have to fill out a form
before we put you on a flight.

747
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:17,851
Medical problems, that sort of thing.

748
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:21,980
-I have a heart condition.
-Do you need any medication?

749
01:29:23,023 --> 01:29:27,193
Well, I haven't needed a pill.
That's strange.

750
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:30,530
Get a form from down the corridor.
I'll be back in ten.

751
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,201
-I'll be by your side to the airport.
-Thank you.

752
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,497
...where overnight a mob attacked

753
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,375
several companies
with ties to America.

754
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:45,379
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were badly injured in the attack.

755
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:49,925
I'm told that American citizens are
asked to report to the U.S. embassy

756
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:52,677
for immediate evacuation...

757
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:56,598
-Excuse me, lady, you look lost.
-No, I'm fine.

758
01:29:56,765 --> 01:30:01,265
May I help you? Allow me to introduce
myself. My name is August Christopher,

759
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:06,066
I was named after Saint Augustin,
who coined my favorite phrase:

760
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:10,320
"Give me chastity and constancy,
but do not give it yet."

761
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:18,620
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

762
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:20,622
Are you coming with me?

763
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:23,500
No. But they are.

764
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:33,719
I need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

765
01:30:33,802 --> 01:30:38,302
Find a quiet room, finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

766
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,434
My number's on the back.

767
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:44,562
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

768
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:48,025
We've got to do a deal with
the Russians or you'll never be safe.

769
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:49,902
Be good at school.

770
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:52,362
Wait!

771
01:30:54,156 --> 01:30:56,950
-Don't you trust me, darling?
-Trust who?

772
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:01,080
-That hurts, Emma.
-I'm serious.

773
01:31:01,246 --> 01:31:05,124
-What's your name?
-My name is August Christopher.

774
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:08,169
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

775
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:10,421
I mean, Vincent Ferrer.

776
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:12,799
I mean, Martin de Porres.

777
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:15,803
Thomas Moore.

778
01:31:17,012 --> 01:31:19,848
After all, you are my personal saint.

779
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:25,266
You have to be very good and usually
very dead to become a saint.

780
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:29,191
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

781
01:31:29,858 --> 01:31:33,945
Now get to work.
Who's that man?

782
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,199
You're leaving on the transport
at 9 o'clock, ma'am?

783
01:31:37,449 --> 01:31:41,494
Probably your last chance
out of here. Hurry, it's leaving.

784
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:46,625
The troops will depose the President

785
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:49,920
and install Ivan Tretiak as leader
of Russia.

786
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:54,341
Moscow must be ringed with tanks
by early evening.

787
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:59,217
Don't worry, the people will follow
me. They'll be crying for revolution.

788
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,723
Still no one's guessed

789
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:04,935
the simple truth
of where the heating oil went.

790
01:32:08,772 --> 01:32:13,272
Who would believe the sea of oil was
hidden under this very building?

791
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:19,116
Yuri, I understand your Natalia is...

792
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:21,660
Francis, you devil.

793
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:23,995
I heard you came down here
and you didn't call me.

794
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,457
Give me a ring, Charles...

795
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:30,502
Lou, I've heard
on the grapevine

796
01:32:30,627 --> 01:32:33,713
that you're brokering
a revolutionary new energy source.

797
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,092
If it's as good as
it's cracked up to be,

798
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:40,053
I have friends
who can double your best offer.

799
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:44,929
On deposit, in Zurich, within one
hour of delivery and confirmation.

800
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:47,727
I'll be waiting.

801
01:33:08,665 --> 01:33:12,460
The work could be here.
This machine could work, couldn't it?

802
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,840
Who are you?

803
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:20,343
-A friend of Dr. Russell's.
-Dr. Russell...

804
01:33:22,387 --> 01:33:25,973
What's this equation?
It's so simple, it's...

805
01:33:27,559 --> 01:33:31,020
-The key to Dr. Russell's formula.
-Yes.

806
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:35,150
The alarm! You had better go.

807
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:39,195
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

808
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:45,406
-But Mr. Tretiak's rally is tonight.
-Can you make it work? Make it work.

809
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,919
-What is wrong here?
-It's the alarm.

810
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:01,885
I tripped.

811
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:12,395
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

812
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,651
You are Nikolai Protrovich...
Petrovich.

813
01:34:28,078 --> 01:34:30,580
Tunnel built by KGB.

814
01:34:32,624 --> 01:34:34,876
Leads to machine room in Kremlin.

815
01:34:35,043 --> 01:34:38,463
Great. Do you happen to know
where the President's quarters are?

816
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:43,176
President Karpov is... there.

817
01:34:43,802 --> 01:34:46,262
But there are many guards.

818
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:49,349
-So I suggest...
-An alternate route?

819
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:52,352
Money. Now.

820
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:56,231
Oh, ye of little faith.

821
01:34:59,776 --> 01:35:04,276
Russia stands tonight
on the brink of a second revolution

822
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,117
as the number of deaths
from freezing mounts,

823
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:10,745
hundreds of thousands of protestors
have taken to the streets.

824
01:35:10,913 --> 01:35:14,875
Even as Russian President Karpov
is promising a mysterious solution

825
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,044
to the crippling heating oil shortage,

826
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:21,548
troops opposed to the elected
government led by General Leo Sklarov,

827
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:24,426
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

828
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,553
Angry, frightened citizens

829
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:29,264
are gathering outside the Kremlin
in Red Square.

830
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:33,351
But they're not braving the cold
for yet another a political rally.

831
01:35:33,518 --> 01:35:36,604
They've been drawn here
by the promise of a revelation,

832
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,190
whatever that may be,

833
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:40,567
in what's become
a life and death struggle

834
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:43,820
for the future of democracy
in Russia.

835
01:36:59,813 --> 01:37:03,149
-Mr. President, I'm your friend.
-What do you want?

836
01:37:05,902 --> 01:37:10,402
I want to help you to destroy Tretiak.
I need you to listen for 30 seconds.

837
01:37:13,076 --> 01:37:15,536
I'm all right! Stay outside.

838
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,789
Please, continue.

839
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:21,084
Tonight you're going to stand trial
on Red Square before the world.

840
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,504
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

841
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:29,463
-Agree with this criminal?
-If you want to destroy Tretiak, yes.

842
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:50,446
Gruschev, take Mr. Karpov downstairs.
The wife stays here.

843
01:37:51,823 --> 01:37:55,535
Hands off!
What you are doing is illegal.

844
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:59,163
-The people won't stand for it!
-They are too cold to stop it.

845
01:37:59,247 --> 01:38:00,831
Who are you?

846
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:37,698
Friends! Countrymen! Russians!

847
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:53,426
You heard about this morning's
sensational event.

848
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:58,093
Shocking documents were recovered
from the president's secret files,

849
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,643
locked within his private safe.

850
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:06,606
The documents, which will be
published in today's papers,

851
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:11,190
prove that the traitor Karpov
was about to steal

852
01:39:13,363 --> 01:39:17,617
over 40 trillion
of our precious Russian rubles

853
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:21,413
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

854
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:26,997
To add insult, millions of dollars
were to be paid

855
01:39:28,044 --> 01:39:30,421
to this international criminal!

856
01:39:37,971 --> 01:39:42,471
And for what was your president hoping
to bankrupt our national treasury?

857
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:48,519
What you see is the fairy tale
called cold fusion.

858
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:54,321
You pass electric current
into the machine,

859
01:39:54,404 --> 01:39:58,449
and there is supposed to be
a chemical reaction!

860
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:03,033
Waltch! It can't even light up
a tiny light-bulb!

861
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:06,540
Do you dare deny this, Mr. Karpov?

862
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:10,879
Absolutely not. I proudly admit it!

863
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:16,171
But enough puny failure!
Failure is in the past!

864
01:40:16,968 --> 01:40:19,887
Begging is behind us!

865
01:40:20,263 --> 01:40:23,766
The balance of power
is about to shift!

866
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:59,010
Miracle one.

867
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:08,311
Karpov! Karpov! Karpov!

868
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:34,920
-Ilya!
-Go! Go, go, go!

869
01:41:37,632 --> 01:41:41,802
I order all troops
loyal to Mother Russia

870
01:41:41,886 --> 01:41:45,264
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

871
01:41:50,937 --> 01:41:52,647
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

872
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:55,984
There was a miscommunication
somewhere in the chain of command.

873
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:03,491
Miracle two.

874
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:08,826
The billionaire industrialist and his
son llya were taken to Lubyanka prison

875
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:14,164
where they await trial along with
fellow conspirator General Sklarov.

876
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:17,755
Moscow woke today
to the forgotten sensation of warmth,

877
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:19,840
as millions of gallons of heating oil

878
01:42:19,924 --> 01:42:24,011
flowed from a storage depot discovered
beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.

879
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:28,391
-He made no threat to contact you?
-He never had the chance.

880
01:42:28,558 --> 01:42:31,143
-You'll tell us if he does?
-Yes.

881
01:42:31,227 --> 01:42:35,356
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue, you see.

882
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:39,443
He charms women,
this so-called saint.

883
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:42,405
It seems it's his stock-in-trade.
No offense.

884
01:42:42,572 --> 01:42:47,072
I am offended. All I got from this
saint was near-death experiences.

885
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:50,580
Count yourself lucky.

886
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:54,083
I have an important conference
to prepare for.

887
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,252
We understand. You have a life.

888
01:42:57,295 --> 01:43:00,298
-We appreciate you taking the time.
-No problem.

889
01:43:07,013 --> 01:43:08,764
She's in love with him.

890
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:21,295
I wanted to call
and tell you everything.

891
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:25,592
- It just hasn't been safe.
- I couldn't stop thinking about you.

892
01:44:27,927 --> 01:44:32,427
So, have you... been busy?

893
01:44:33,016 --> 01:44:37,228
Yeah, I've been working real hard.
Thank God I have my cards back.

894
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:41,524
You don't believe in that
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

895
01:44:42,233 --> 01:44:44,360
You're a very pretty lady.

896
01:44:44,736 --> 01:44:48,322
Oh, my God! That was you?

897
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,784
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

898
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:55,371
I thought you were an old biddy,

899
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:58,124
not a gorgeous
soon-to-be trillionaire.

900
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:01,627
You know you're gonna be
the richest woman in the world?

901
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:05,214
-I am?
-Why do you think I'm hanging around?

902
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,681
-Emma?
-Yeah?

903
01:45:13,848 --> 01:45:15,724
My life is very strange.

904
01:45:16,392 --> 01:45:17,768
I just...

905
01:45:21,856 --> 01:45:25,025
I don't do anything normal.
I... I can't...

906
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:26,944
I know.

907
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:29,322
I Know you.

908
01:45:30,156 --> 01:45:31,866
I know your life.

909
01:45:32,617 --> 01:45:35,536
-What do you want?
-I want you.

910
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:39,248
-For how long?
-It doesn't matter.

911
01:45:46,381 --> 01:45:47,882
Tell me you love me.

912
01:45:50,301 --> 01:45:51,635
I love you.

913
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,221
Simon...

914
01:45:55,181 --> 01:45:57,349
I love you, Simon.

915
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,353
Miracle three.

916
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:28,752
Dear Simon, the pin is something
I've kept for years, God knows why.

917
01:46:30,174 --> 01:46:32,843
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

918
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:35,346
But don't worry,
you don't have to wear it.

919
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:39,850
I just wanted you to have
something I loved.

920
01:46:40,351 --> 01:46:43,270
Simon, I've seen it requires
three miracles,

921
01:46:43,354 --> 01:46:45,898
then I'd say, you've made it, my love.

922
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:48,484
And so I hope you'll understand.

923
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:52,363
Last night, it became clear to me
what I have to do this morning.

924
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:55,575
You see, I'm going to
give cold fusion to the world.

925
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:58,453
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again,

926
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:01,706
that I'll know it's for you
and you'll know it's for me.

927
01:47:02,373 --> 01:47:06,835
If cold fusion is free, then you
and I, Simon, will be free too.

928
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:10,548
Listen. If you think giving away
everything in front of the world,

929
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:14,677
preventing us from making a fortune,
will accomplish anything,

930
01:47:16,095 --> 01:47:17,763
you're absolutely right.

931
01:47:19,682 --> 01:47:21,642
Simon, what are you doing here?

932
01:47:22,852 --> 01:47:27,314
-There are police everywhere.
-I wouldn't miss it for the world.

933
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:31,026
-You wore the pin.
-Of course.

934
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:36,907
You'd better go.

935
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,089
How am I gonna find you?

936
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:56,135
I'll find you. You found me.

937
01:48:23,538 --> 01:48:27,083
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction

938
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:30,586
after last week's
Moscow fireworks,

939
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:35,675
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell...

940
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:38,427
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

941
01:48:40,179 --> 01:48:41,638
No.

942
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:44,559
Dr. Russell.

943
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:57,363
You don't believe in this
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

944
01:48:58,072 --> 01:48:59,073
No.

945
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:04,199
Well, we all know that cold fusion
has had a difficult childhood.

946
01:49:06,998 --> 01:49:11,252
Those of us in the field are orphans,
bastards at best.

947
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:15,881
But difficult childhoods, I believe,
make the most interesting adults.

948
01:49:18,468 --> 01:49:21,387
I know that most of you thought...

949
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:24,974
I'm her biggest fan.
I think she's a fox.

950
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:31,226
Some may feel that its practical
application is still speculative.

951
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:37,566
But I want to share with you how
that dream is slowly becoming reality.

952
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:43,868
Look at the time. Got to go.

953
01:49:46,788 --> 01:49:50,166
With your help, we can all
work towards making the...

954
01:49:52,043 --> 01:49:56,338
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

955
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:30,873
Got you, you slippery son of a...

956
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:32,416
What's going on here?

957
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,091
Damn!

958
01:50:46,722 --> 01:50:49,683
Donations totaling three billion
dollars were made today to

959
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:54,267
the Red Cross, The Salvation Army, and
the United Nations' Children's Fund.

960
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,942
The funds were wired from the account
of jailed Russian tycoon Ivan Tretiak.

961
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:03,155
In other philanthropic news,
a non-profit research foundation

962
01:51:03,322 --> 01:51:07,326
has been established
to develop cold fusion technology,

963
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:09,662
funded with an anonymous donation

964
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:13,291
and to be headed by Russian physicist,
Dr. Lev Botvin.

965
01:51:13,749 --> 01:51:16,168
The E.J. Russell Foundation...
