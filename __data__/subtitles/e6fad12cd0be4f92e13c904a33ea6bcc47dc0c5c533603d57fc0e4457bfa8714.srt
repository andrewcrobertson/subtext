1
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:47,639
There are no fucking rules!

2
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:50,470
Fight!

3
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,012
Sir, Tiger, sir.

4
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:55,707
King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

5
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,573
Tiger, I love you!

6
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,240
King Kobra! King Kobra!

7
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:05,959
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

8
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,650
Whoo!

9
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,721
Good evening.

10
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,999
That's what I'm talking about.

11
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,243
Welcome to Tiger's Temple.

12
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,935
This is a sacred space.

13
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:19,559
Because some of us here
are Muslim.

14
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,146
Some of us are Hindu.

15
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:22,838
Fuck, maybe there's
a closet Christian

16
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,116
hiding somewhere there
under the rafters.

17
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:32,088
But we here all worship one god:

18
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:34,056
the Indian rupee!

19
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:45,032
The winner,
the killer of the beast,

20
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,209
King Kobra!

21
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:52,108
Look at this maderchod.
Look at this.

22
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,318
That's the smell of victory
right there.

23
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,735
Do you smell it?

24
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,185
'Cause I fucking smell it!

25
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,291
This is a champion. This is...

26
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,092
Fucking hell, guys.
What a night, eh?

27
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:23,337
You hear that?
They fucking hate you.

28
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,615
It's incredible.

29
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,065
What a night.

30
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,964
Sarishan,
what's this fucking stomach?

31
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,793
Too many samosas.
You're the Lizard King,

32
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,830
not the fucking
Samosa King, okay?

33
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,486
This fucking tap!

34
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:37,213
Aziz, the fucking tap came off
in my hands again, man.

35
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,249
Come here.

36
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,940
Look here. What's that?

37
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,091
That fucking stays on. You know
what my water bill is for that?

38
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:43,235
Fix the fucking tap. Please.

39
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,612
I ask just for a little bit
of fucking cleanliness.

40
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:48,466
A little bit of
personal hygiene. Yes, what?

41
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,434
Yeah. All right.

42
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,575
Don't spend it all at once, eh?

43
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,751
Tiger. Tiger, this is half.

44
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,339
What? That's what
you got last time.

45
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:01,755
What, are you saving
for a better place to live?

46
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,239
You want another 50%, you bleed.

47
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,828
That's why it's called
the bleed bonus.

48
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,383
I need that money.

49
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,215
Then dance.

50
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:15,527
Don't look at me like that.

51
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:16,839
You chose the name.

52
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,297
You're like those
little monkeys,

53
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,980
you know, in the marketplace
that go...

54
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,717
with a little pink skirt.

55
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,018
That's you.

56
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,329
Put on a show, get the money.

57
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,867
There's hundreds
of folks out there

58
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,401
that'll do this, eh... hundreds...

59
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,336
waiting to take your place
if this isn't for you.

60
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,312
<i>Baba Shakti.</i>

61
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,349
<i>Guru, man of peace,
the nation's lion.</i>

62
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,076
<i>Born to poverty
but not held captive by it.</i>

63
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:49,665
<i>Indeed, Baba Shakti is now
likely to be seen</i>

64
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,218
<i>in the temples of the elite</i>

65
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,048
<i>than at the temples of the gods,</i>

66
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,291
<i>rubbing shoulders
with the rich and powerful.</i>

67
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:58,053
<i>Are these the simple actions
of a man made good...</i>

68
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,365
I leave politics
to the politicians.

69
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:02,619
<i>or the start
of a push for political power</i>

70
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,369
<i>through his endorsement
of the controversial</i>

71
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:05,681
<i>Sovereign Party?</i>

72
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,683
If I see a God-fearing man

73
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,375
who is doing good for India,
I will support him.

74
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,964
<i>He has dismissed
rumors that his factory...</i>

75
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,830
First class, bro.

76
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,317
Eh! Make it a double.

77
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:23,872
So?

78
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,916
Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.

79
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,890
This is who you want.

80
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,789
Queenie Kapoor,
the queen of Kings.

81
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:48,103
Friday afternoon,
she had a massage

82
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:51,002
and pedicure at Body Tonic.

83
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,486
Most of the mornings,

84
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:55,041
she stops at a Café d'Italia
for coffee.

85
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,766
- D'Italia?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:59,286
She'll be there tomorrow.

87
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,685
- Ayurvedic wisdom
- Okay.

88
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,229
- Is thousands of years old.
- Good job.

89
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:14,508
Who are we to question the gods?

90
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:23,621
Yes.
On the dinner table, it was like

91
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,312
a verbal contract.

92
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,730
I don't have any mail.

93
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,596
Please, please, madam.

94
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,599
Please, please, madam.

95
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:38,819
I'm... Ow!

96
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,260
Oh, my God. How can you allow
these guys here?

97
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,262

Yeah?

125
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,518
Where did you find this?

126
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:46,833
Some men were fighting
over it next to, uh, JV Road

127
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,628
near Café d'Italia.

128
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:52,149
I tried to rush in,
and, uh, um...

129
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,392
they fought back and, uh...

130
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,015
- Take this.
- I-I...

131
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,224
I don't...
I don't want charity.

132
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:02,159
Wh-What I need is a... is a job.

133
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:03,574
This is Kings.

134
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,403
We just don't hire
off the street.

135
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,784
Where's your references?

136
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:10,512
Your CV? Hmm?

137
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,859
Look, I don't have time
for all this.

138
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,760
This.

139
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,040
There's my CV.

140
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,558
That's bleach.

141
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,596
Chemical, oil.

142
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,358
Give me the job
no one wants to do.

143
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:31,981
I'll do it.

144
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,225
No complaint.

145
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,332
This is all I know.

146
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:53,244
Yeah.

147
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,246
No. Uh, no, no. Listen.

148
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,318
I actually liked this one
from Indonesia.

149
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,769
Is she broken in?

150
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:04,152
No, th-that's fine, but I just
want to know if, uh...

151
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,877
How quickly
can we get her papers?

152
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,190
Hmm?

153
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:26,174
Anyone who talks
outside these walls,

154
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,728
anyone who forgets their place,

155
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:31,317
it doesn't turn out well
for them.

156
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,527
Understood?

157
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,737
Understood.

158
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:49,774
New guy, huh?

159
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,812
What's your name?

160
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,126
Bobby.

161
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:58,473
Hmm.

162
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,448
Wear your cap properly.

163
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:11,486
We don't want one of your pubes
in the curry...

164
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:15,110
Bobby.

165
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,870
I think we met before, right?

166
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,252
I-I don't think so.

167
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:22,635
You like tequila, huh, Bobby?

168
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:27,329
Patrón, Don Julio, the one with
George Clooney in the photo?

169
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,158
I just want to clean
the dishes, okay?

170
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:30,884
Coke? Morphine? MDMA?

171
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,887
Oi, Alphonso, eh,
I've told you many times

172
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,234
to stop hassling my staff.

173
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,477
Quality control, man.

174
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,411
You're gonna thank me
for this one day.

175
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,519
Stay cool, Bobby.

176
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,797
Stay cool, hmm?

177
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:51,250
Watch my fucking leg, man.

178
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,482
Paan.

179
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:42,533
Is this all you got?

180
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,294
Yeah.

181
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,923
Are you sure?

182
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:57,099
'Cause I got an answer
to every prayer.

183
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,103
You like <i>John Wick?</i>
'Cause this just came in.

184
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,383
Yeah.

185
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,385
The TTI.

186
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:08,490
Same gun from the movie.

187
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,941
But made in China.

188
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:14,634
Boom.

189
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:19,121
I want something small
but effective.

190
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,538
38 caliber revolver.

191
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:25,265
It's a little bit heavy,
but it's got a lot of thump.

192
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,544
You need to be pretty close.

193
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,892
Close is good.

194
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:36,484
I'll take it.

195
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:41,868
Staff entrance. Copy.

196
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,181
Copy. Staff entrance secured.

197
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,740
Huh?

198
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,749
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

199
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,135
Yeah?

200
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:09,862
You're fucking killing me,
Rahul.

201
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,278
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

202
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,728
Listen to me...

203
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,178
You call Evgeni
and tell that motherfucker

204
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,802
to find another source.

205
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,266
They're fuck all. Fuck all.

206
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,119
Fuck all.
You understand "fuck all"?

207
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,984
No, no, no. No, no.
Listen, listen.

208
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:31,366
I have a reputation to protect,
understand?

209
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,712
What the fuck is your problem?

210
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,300
How many times
do I have to tell you

211
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,518
fucking knock on the door
and enter...

212
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:37,959
Sorry.
Nishit said you needed me.

213
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:39,737
I need you
to learn some manners,

214
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,238
you inbred little goat fucker.

215
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,172
Rahul,
I'll have to call you back.

216
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,794
Listen, go to Naqeeb

217
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,289
and pick up some
Kashmiri snowflake.

218
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:49,936
Good stuff, okay?
None of that cheap shit.

219
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:52,234
But the problem is, uh,
quality control, it's no good.

220
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,113
Naqeeb has some issue with me,
you know?

221
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,022
I don't know whether it's
the Christian-Muslim thing

222
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,426
- or what, but...
- Hey.

223
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,533
You. Face the wall.

224
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,884
What the fuck
are you talking about?

225
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,931
Tell Naqeeb, if the maal is good,

226
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:11,648
we'll buy some more
for Chief Rana.

227
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,443
Get it sorted by the weekend.

228
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,653
He is coming with his boys.

229
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,344
- Hey, Alphonso.
- Hmm?

230
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,633
Only the best to serve the VIPs.

231
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:22,797
Yeah. Got it.

232
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,559
Alphonso. Alphonso.

233
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:30,218
Hey, uh, good job with Queenie,
huh? She really respects you.

234
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:31,356
What do you want?

235
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,843
Um, look, if you... if you...

236
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,661
Look, if you need any help
with the VIPs...

237
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,508
Look, I'm just saying,
if you need someone to go in

238
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:45,934
- and do the job...
- Does it look like

239
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,383
I need some help
from someone like you?

240
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:48,443
- Hey.
- Is there so...

241
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
What the fuck, man?

242
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,997
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

243
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:54,104
Look, you want to make
some money?

244
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:56,520
Guaranteed?

245
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:58,211
- Go on.
- Okay.

246
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:00,800
Uh...

247
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:03,423
come to this place tonight.

248
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,877
Bet on Khan.
You'll make a killing.

249
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,745
How the fuck do you know?

250
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,990
I-I'll be fighting him.

251
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,618
Fuck off.

252
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:28,172
The monkey will win
the first two rounds

253
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,761
and go down in the third.

254
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:32,625
What's in it for you?

255
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,109

That's Mr. Takahata.

309

to please every king. Look.

313
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,723
He's about to receive
a gift from heaven.

314
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,969
Here she is... Sylvia.

315
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,109
Former Miss Lithuania.

316
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:31,286
She's come down
to guide him to the afterlife.

317
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,392
Come on.

318
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,703
That's Mirza.

319
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,222
The boss of the bosses.

320
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,224
He runs everything
in this town, man.

321
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:40,709
Drugs, property, import, export.

322
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,642
You name it.

323
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,230
What about the cops?

324
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,267
They're the dirtiest fuckers.

Isn't she beautiful?

330
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,399

00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,510
They don't even see us.

358
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:38,241
They're all up there living,
and we're stuck here in this.

359
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,829
That's no life, bro.

360
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,110
So, what are you gonna do
about this, Monkey Man? Huh?

361
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,948
Bought myself a bit
of land over here down south.

362
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:58,157
- You like that?
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:01,195
Mate.

364
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,644
What are you doing?

365
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:05,509
That's red wine.

366
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,097
Yes, sir.

367
00:27:07,235 --> 00:27:09,444
Well, that's a white wine glass.

368
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:13,138
Who is this guy, huh?

369
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,013
Can we get somebody
over here who knows...

370
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,039
Tell me more
about your trip, baby.

371
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,939
No.

372
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,665
No, no, no, no, no.

373
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,391
I, uh...

374
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:27,946
I want to know about you.

375
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,018
What's this?

376
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,020
Little birdie?

377
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,988
- It's a sparrow.
- Want to fly away, do you?

378
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,025
Queenie was right.

379
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:41,856
You are not like
the other girls.

380
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,271
I'll treat you like an angel.

381
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,205
My Indian princess.

382
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,043
We can fuck right here.

383
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:58,252
Not here, baby.

384
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,664
Ma!

385
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:12,257
Ma!

386
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,549
How did you get in?

387
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,327
No, no. Come.

388
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:24,605
Come, come. Good girl.

389
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:28,195
There you go.
There you go. Good girl.

390
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,335
You like that?

391
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,411
That's good. You like that?

392
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,275
She'd better.

393
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,656
It's 4,000 rupees a plate.

394
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,360
This is not the place to work

395
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,569
if you can't handle
that sort of stuff.

396
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:08,890
It's not a sparrow.

397
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,584
Your tattoo.

398
00:31:13,895 --> 00:31:14,931
It's a koel.

399
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,488
I grew up in the forest.

400
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:25,355
Every day, I would wake up
to them singing.

401
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:36,953
Stop feeding that dog.

402
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:40,301
It's gonna keep coming back
expecting more.

403
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,511
Just gives her hope.

404
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:09,365
Next.

405
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,026
Sit. Sit. Sit.

406
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,308
What the fuck you doing, man?

407
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:24,380
- For the dog.
- Come on, man. Let's boogie.

408
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:33,492
Sit.

409
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:49,991
<i>Baba Shakti today
held a public prayer</i>

410
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,131

<i>You're supposed to be a monkey.</i>

418
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,948
Do you know that a chimpanzee

419
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:17,916
can rip a fucking
human being's face off?

420
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:21,471

422
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,423

423
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:18,770
There you go.

424
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:21,359
Good girl.

425
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:43,622
Where the fuck you been, man?

426
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
I nearly finished it all
waiting for you.

427
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:46,625
You ready?

428
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:51,630

00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,157

431
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:03,055

00:56:14,015 --> 00:56:15,361
Who are you?

540
00:56:15,499 --> 00:56:20,331
I'm Alpha,
the keeper of the temple.

541
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,095
Careful! Careful!

542
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:34,967
Why did you help me?

543
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:38,349
You should've died
from those injuries.

544
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:42,733
The gods must have
a greater plan for you.

545
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:47,911
We all have scars.

546
00:56:52,018 --> 00:56:53,951
I should go.

547
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:56,057
No. I wouldn't do that.

548
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:58,404
The police are looking for you.

549
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,164
All over town.

550
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:02,477
But not here.

551
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:05,963
They find us too...

552
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:09,242
unsettling.

553
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,315
Stay with us.

554
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,283
Rest.

555
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:18,148
You need to heal.

556
00:57:21,392 --> 00:57:24,326
Maybe she'll speak to you.

557
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:34,509
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

558
00:57:34,647 --> 00:57:38,513
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

559
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:41,619
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

560
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:45,520
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

561
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:48,178
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

562
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:53,355
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!
Shakti! Shakti!

563
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:12,202
Who is he?

564
00:58:13,444 --> 00:58:15,239
He's a nobody.

565
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:18,518
Just some crazy kid
from the gutter.

566
00:58:18,656 --> 00:58:21,659
People once said that about me.

567
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,800
And now look at you.

568
00:58:23,938 --> 00:58:26,457
You're the nation's lion.

569
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:31,117
You said he spoke of his mother.

570
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:40,609
Rana...

571
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:45,062
in the great tapestry of life,

572
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,964
just one small ember
can burn down everything.

573
00:58:50,965 --> 00:58:53,795
The very idea of him

574
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,177
has to be extinguished.

575
00:58:57,903 --> 00:58:59,352
Find him.

576
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,425
Before your nobody
becomes a somebody.

577
00:59:09,776 --> 00:59:12,365
The trail of destruction
started with a murder attempt

578
00:59:12,503 --> 00:59:15,679
on Yatana's chief of police,
Rana Singh,

579
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:18,475
by a terrorist
posing as a member of staff.

580
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:21,098
A citywide manhunt is underway
for the terrorist

581
00:59:21,236 --> 00:59:23,687
and his known associates.

582
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:26,517
Security has been raised
for the upcoming elections,

583
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:30,314
which are occurring on the
country's most auspicious day.

584
01:00:05,073 --> 01:00:07,317
- Thank you.
- So, uh...

585
01:00:33,515 --> 01:00:36,139
Now they are okay.

586
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:41,247
But...

587
01:00:52,534 --> 01:00:55,744
And that is why
she ran away with the priest.

588
01:01:08,136 --> 01:01:10,035
Funny, huh?

589
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:33,782
Still can't sleep?

590
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:37,752
I never sleep.

591
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:41,273
Voices in your head?

592
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:44,517
Just one.

593
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,177
Her scream.

594
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:54,389
It's been inside me
my whole life.

595
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:01,155
Come with me.

596
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:35,810
We were warriors before
they drove us into exile here.

597
01:02:37,812 --> 01:02:40,470
The Vedas speak of a tree

598
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:43,611
that was supposedly planted
by Lord Shiva,

599
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:48,098
the destroyer of worlds.

600
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:12,226
I was once like you.

601
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,814
A broken man.

602
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:19,543
A slave to childhood terrors.

603
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:25,825
I learned that you need
to destroy in order to grow.

604
01:03:26,964 --> 01:03:29,346
To create space for new life.

605
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:39,425
Mm. Here we go.

606
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:43,636
Within its root lies
a potent toxin.

607
01:03:43,774 --> 01:03:47,468
We call it Trishul
after Shiva's trident.

608
01:03:48,883 --> 01:03:51,299
It will cut you open.

609
01:03:52,783 --> 01:03:58,272
Only a weakened man
can benefit from this.

610
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:02,862
Only a strong man
can survive it.

611
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,488
Are you ready?

612
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:10,629
Yes.

613
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:29,544
The pain...

614
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:34,549
It will leave you once
it's finished teaching you.

615
01:13:06,302 --> 01:13:08,166
I failed her.

616
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:12,480
No.

617
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:16,346
You tried to save her.

618
01:13:20,385 --> 01:13:22,283
You see scars.

619
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:28,911
I see the courage of a child
fighting to save his mother.

620
01:13:30,153 --> 01:13:34,019
These are the hands of a warrior

621
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:37,643
who's destined
to challenge the gods.

622
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:42,648
All your life, you've been
fighting to feel pain.

623
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:46,273
You need to fight for a purpose.

624
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:51,692
Fight... for all of us.

625
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:56,870
It's time to remember
who you are.

626
01:14:04,463 --> 01:14:06,155
<i>As the Sovereign Party</i>

627
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:08,502
<i>climbs in the polls,
allegations have surfaced</i>

628
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,194
<i>that you destroyed
200 acres of forestland</i>

629
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:13,541
<i>to build your mega factory.</i>

630
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:14,991
It's not a factory.

631
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:16,406
It's a commune.

632
01:14:16,544 --> 01:14:18,201
<i>And what about the farmers</i>

633
01:14:18,339 --> 01:14:20,203
<i>that have been displaced?</i>

634
01:14:20,341 --> 01:14:21,895
<i>Ah.</i>

635
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:24,552
<i>The land was barren and empty.</i>

636
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:28,384
Few families who lived there
have joined the cause.

637
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:30,662
<i>And workers who complain</i>

638
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,560
<i>of horrible working conditions?</i>

639
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:34,631
<i>They aren't workers.</i>

640
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,910
<i>They are my disciples.</i>

641
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:22,256
Yeah.

642
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,000
Hmm.

643
01:16:49,387 --> 01:16:51,078
Ah.

644
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:21,660
Get up.

645
01:17:25,526 --> 01:17:28,426
A surge of sectarian violence
has exploded around the country

646
01:17:28,564 --> 01:17:32,050
<i>after divisive remarks
made by Adesh Joshi.</i>

647
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:35,295
<i>International leaders
have condemned the violence</i>

648
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:37,953
<i>against minorities
but have stopped short</i>

649
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:42,060
<i>of criticizing the candidate
as he climbs in the polls.</i>

650
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:15,956
<i>Close your eyes,</i>

651
01:18:16,094 --> 01:18:19,270
<i>and you will find yourself</i>

652
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:22,859
<i>sitting atop a mighty tree.</i>

653
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:26,001
<i>This is your home.</i>

654
01:18:26,139 --> 01:18:28,624
<i>You are a beast.</i>

655
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:32,283
<i>Look beneath the surface,</i>

656
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:36,459
<i>and you will see roots
deep under the soil,</i>

657
01:18:36,597 --> 01:18:38,599
<i>reaching far and wide.</i>

658
01:18:38,737 --> 01:18:41,982
<i>These are the roots
of your ancestors,</i>

659
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,984
<i>the soul of your mother.</i>

660
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:46,124
<i>Listen to her.</i>

661
01:18:46,987 --> 01:18:48,954
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

662
01:18:49,093 --> 01:18:51,716
<i>You've been here for time.</i>

663
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:07,283
People of Yatana...

664
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:10,183
Baba Shakti!

665
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:12,357
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

666
01:19:12,495 --> 01:19:15,809
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

667
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:18,363
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

668
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:20,848
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

669
01:19:20,986 --> 01:19:22,678
I am nobody.

670
01:19:23,334 --> 01:19:24,990
I am nothing.

671
01:19:25,129 --> 01:19:26,716
I didn't choose this path.

672
01:19:26,854 --> 01:19:30,203
You chose it for me.

673
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:33,516
Change never comes
without a fight.

674
01:19:34,724 --> 01:19:39,833
I want you to choose
another of God's men.

675
01:19:40,903 --> 01:19:44,976
He's one of us.
He is Adesh Joshi,

676
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,221
leader of Sovereign Party.

677
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:54,089
He will fight with us,
for us, for you.

678
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:59,956
The working man,
the poor, the sick.

679
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,856
<i>Shower him with your love</i>

680
01:20:02,994 --> 01:20:05,824
<i>and let our voice be heard</i>

681
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:08,344
<i>throughout the nation.</i>

682
01:20:14,488 --> 01:20:15,972
<i>They have destroyed</i>

683
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,389
<i>our sacred values.</i>

684
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,668
<i>They have stolen our homes,</i>

685
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:24,567
<i>poisoned our children's minds.</i>

686
01:20:25,844 --> 01:20:28,778
<i>They have polluted us
with their symbols,</i>

687
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,471
<i>their false idols.</i>

688
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:33,783
<i>We have been blinded.</i>

689
01:20:34,474 --> 01:20:36,579
<i>Will you stand with us?</i>

690
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,168
<i>Will you bleed with us?</i>

691
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,275
<i>Will you?</i>

692
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:43,861
<i>Will you?</i>

693
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:22,832
Lakshmi!

694
01:21:25,766 --> 01:21:27,837
Tell me what happened
to Lakshmi.

695
01:21:27,975 --> 01:21:29,667
- Lakshmi!
- Lakshmi!

696
01:21:29,805 --> 01:21:31,669
- Lakshmi.
- Are you okay, Lakshmi?

697
01:21:31,807 --> 01:21:33,188
What happened? What happened?

698
01:21:33,326 --> 01:21:35,673
These men put a notice
on the door.

699
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:38,158
She tried to take it down,
but they beat her.

700
01:21:38,296 --> 01:21:40,678
She's not breathing.
Breathe, Lakshmi, breathe.

701
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:42,414
Did you see?
Did you see who it was?

702
01:21:42,438 --> 01:21:43,750
Shakti's men.

703
01:21:43,888 --> 01:21:46,339
They said the temple
never belonged to us.

704
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:48,789
Alpha, where will we go?

705
01:21:48,927 --> 01:21:51,620
If we don't have money,
they will keep doing this.

706
01:21:51,758 --> 01:21:55,279
We cannot pay off some thugs.

707
01:21:56,107 --> 01:21:58,005
We all must pray.

708
01:21:58,143 --> 01:21:59,835
Lakshmi!

709
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:01,906
God has a plan.

710
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:58,201
We have the
election results due to break

711
01:22:58,238 --> 01:22:59,619
during Diwali festival.

712
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:01,493
Sovereign Party supporters
are flooding the streets

713
01:23:01,517 --> 01:23:04,382
with the party expecting
a landslide victory.

of my mother Africa...

743
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:30,295
I hunted him down.

744
01:24:30,434 --> 01:24:32,401
I...

745
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:34,645
darted him myself,

746
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:37,337
and I brought him
all the way here

747
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:39,650
for your entertainment.

748
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,169
He's evil.

749
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:44,724
He's ferocious.

750
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:48,279
He's a dark destroyer.

751
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:51,800

756
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,129
King Kobra! King Kobra!

757
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:16,376
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

758
01:25:16,514 --> 01:25:18,102
Ooh, I smell it.

759
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,311
I smell it.

760
01:25:26,386 --> 01:25:28,077
- Hey.
- What's going on?

761
01:25:31,564 --> 01:25:32,841
Did he fucking knock him out?

762
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:35,637
Kobra, get up.

763
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:39,779
You get him fucking up

01:25:42,402 --> 01:25:43,645
I will fuck...

765
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:47,683
Grab his arms and take him off.

766
01:26:00,627 --> 01:26:03,181
Wow, eh?

767
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:06,564
Wow.

768
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:11,086
That was a surprise.

769
01:26:15,608 --> 01:26:19,853
Fucking lucky kick, eh?

770
01:26:21,303 --> 01:26:24,064
Looks like we got
a cheeky little monkey

771
01:26:24,202 --> 01:26:25,721
on our hands tonight.

772
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:27,343
Kill the beast!

773
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:30,277
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!

774
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:35,524
Ladies and gentlemen...

775
01:26:35,662 --> 01:26:41,047
I give you the biggest,
the baddest,

776
01:26:41,185 --> 01:26:44,326

777
01:26:44,464 --> 01:26:48,572
Bhalu the Bear!

778
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:56,787
Fuck him up.

Fucking smash his head in, okay?

780
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,204
Get in there

01:27:00,342 --> 01:27:01,585
Go. Go.

01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:03,725
Fuck him up.

Take a look.

816
01:29:51,996 --> 01:29:54,205
What is that?

817
01:29:56,345 --> 01:29:58,382
Take a look.

818
01:30:00,556 --> 01:30:02,869
- There's a note.
- There's a note.

819
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:05,907
Oh, my God.

820

Oh, my, my.

01:30:07,563 --> 01:30:09,565
I mean, look at this.

822
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:11,636
Whoa.

823
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:13,604
- Who sent us this?
- Wow.

824
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,089
It's money.

825
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:09,556
Baba!

826
01:31:09,694 --> 01:31:12,801

Listen up, everyone,
if anybody fucks up tonight,

832
01:32:25,632 --> 01:32:28,877
if anybody messes up,
if I get a single complaint,

833
01:32:29,015 --> 01:32:30,672
I'll fuck your happiness.

843
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:09,124

Staff entrance.

845
01:33:27,453 --> 01:33:31,215
We will rid Mother India
of her scars

846
01:33:31,353 --> 01:33:34,356

once more.

Finally out of your tree, huh?

Get up.

884
01:42:56,193 --> 01:43:00,543
Did your mother
send you back for more, huh?

885
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,874
Welcome, Queenie.

886
01:48:30,665 --> 01:48:32,322
So, you are the one?

887
01:48:39,916 --> 01:48:42,229
Look at them all.

888
01:48:42,367 --> 01:48:43,540
Diwali.

889
01:48:43,678 --> 01:48:47,821
The triumph of light
over darkness.

890
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,997
The defeat of Ravan.

891
01:48:52,618 --> 01:48:55,518
But Ravan was no demon.

892
01:48:55,656 --> 01:48:58,279
He was a scholar.

893
01:48:58,417 --> 01:49:00,385
A visionary.

894
01:49:02,318 --> 01:49:05,355
He built an empire from nothing.

895
01:49:17,471 --> 01:49:23,097
Why not end this cycle
of violence?

896
01:49:24,512 --> 01:49:28,965
Or we will be trapped in it
for generations.

897
01:49:31,519 --> 01:49:34,384
Do you even know
my mother's name?

898
01:49:38,423 --> 01:49:41,046
Do you know any of their names?

899
01:49:44,187 --> 01:49:48,053
Anger will not quiet
your soul, my son.

900
01:49:54,163 --> 01:49:56,303
Don't call me "son."

901
01:50:02,516 --> 01:50:06,589
These were carved
by a devout follower

902
01:50:07,762 --> 01:50:09,903
who wore them
to prevent his feet

903
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:12,664
from harming any small creature.

904
01:50:12,802 --> 01:50:17,082
On the side here,
there's an old prayer:

905
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:21,190
"Forgive me, Mother Earth,
for the sin of injury

906
01:50:21,328 --> 01:50:24,848
which I inflict with each step."

907
01:50:27,782 --> 01:50:29,715
My chariot is here.

908
01:51:19,938 --> 01:51:23,700
You can't.
These people need me.

909
01:51:23,838 --> 01:51:24,978
Please.

910
01:51:25,116 --> 01:51:27,359
I'll give you what you want.

911
01:51:27,497 --> 01:51:29,879
I'll do anything.

912
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:31,329
Forgive me.

913
01:51:31,467 --> 01:51:34,953
Ha-Ha-Have mercy, please.

914
01:51:35,091 --> 01:51:37,714
Only God can forgive you now.
