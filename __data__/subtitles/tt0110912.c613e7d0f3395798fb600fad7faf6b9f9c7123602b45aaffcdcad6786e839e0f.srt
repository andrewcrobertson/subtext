Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:29,819
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,684
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,425
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,966
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,968
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:41,470
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:43,734
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,139
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,268
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,302
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,280
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,078
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,345
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:56,784
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:57,819
After tonight.

17
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:00,049
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,657
Can I get anyone more coffee?

19
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,988
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,520
You're welcome.

21
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:11,328
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:14,302
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:16,362
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

24

ain't supposed to stop you...

25

26

They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

27
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:24,071
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

28
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:25,580

this one bloke...

29
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,515
He walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

30
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,107
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,652
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:31,710
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,215
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,911
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:37,419
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!

a fucking finger.

40
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:46,956
Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:49,966
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,366
The point of the story isn't the girl.
The point of the story is...

43
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,199
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:55,864
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,734
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:01,276
No more liquor stores?

48
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:03,939
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:05,481
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50

I don't want to kill anybody,
either.

put us in a situation...

You got the idea
taking their wallets.

99
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,271
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.

100

Thank you.

101
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,443
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

102
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:08,044
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come into restaurants.

I've seen 'em do it, man.

171
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,388
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

172
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,091
Yuck.

173
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,502
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

174
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:53,603
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

175
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,611
That's counting our guy?

176
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,340
I'm not sure.

177
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,814
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

178
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,612
It's possible.

179
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,744
We should have fucking shotguns.

180
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,879
- What's her name?
- Mia.

181
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,924
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

182
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,189
I don't know.
However people meet people.

183
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,855
She used to be an actress.

184
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,331
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

185
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,267
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

186
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:20,792
Pilot? What's a pilot?

187
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,998
Well, you know the shows on TV?

188
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,506
I don't watch TV.

189
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,338
Yeah, but you are aware...

190
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,071
that there's an invention
called television...

191
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,341
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

192
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,472
Yeah.

193
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:34,449
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

194
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:35,951
That show's called a pilot.

195
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,317
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

196
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:39,855
and on the strength
of that one show...

197
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,686
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

198
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:44,352
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

199
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:47,055
Some don't, become nothing.

200
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:49,963
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

201
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:54,231
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

202
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,465
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

203
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,133
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

204
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,005
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

205
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,442
I mean, he got a weight problem.

206
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:02,944
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

207
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:05,072
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

208
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,344
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

209
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:08,850
Word around the campfire is...

210
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:11,149
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

211
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,710
[Elevator dings]

212
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:19,719
[Elevator motor engages]

213
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:21,388
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

214
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:23,797
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

215
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,460
Well, then, what, then?

216
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,366
Gave her a foot massage.

217
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:34,004
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:36,273
Then what did Marsellus do?

219
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:38,075
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

220
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:41,277
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

221
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:43,342
Nigger fell four stories.

222
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,286
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

223
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:47,550
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

224
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:49,854
Nigger fell through that.

225
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,918
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

226
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,920
That's a damn shame.

227
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,364
[Elevator dings]

228
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,305
But still, I have to say...

229
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,102
you play with matches,
you get burned.

230
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,301
What do you mean?

231
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,469
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

232
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:09,876
a foot massage.

233
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:11,539
You don't think he overreacted?

234
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,947
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

235
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:17,475
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

236
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,680
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

237
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,280
I give my mother a foot massage.

238
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,348
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

239
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:25,121
on Marsellus' new wife.

240
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,789
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

241
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,128
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

242
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,656
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

243
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,794
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

244
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,303
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

245
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:36,999
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

246
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,065
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

247
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:42,202
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

248
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,008
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

249
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,810
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

250
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:48,476
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

251
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,076
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

252
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,349
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

253
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,390
Have you ever given
a foot massage?

254
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:57,393
[Chuckles] Don't be telling me
about foot massages.

255
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:58,951
I'm the foot fucking master.

256
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,962
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.

257
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,497
Got my technique down
and everything.

258
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,261
I don't be tickling or nothing.

259
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,768
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

260
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:10,129
Fuck you.

261
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:14,074
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

262
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,577
You know, I'm kind of tired.

263
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,078
I could use
a foot massage myself.

264
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,580
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

265
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,172
I'm getting
a little pissed here.

266
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,179
- This is the door.
- There it is.

267
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,889
What time you got?

268
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:32,324
7:22 in the AM.

269
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,956
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

270
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,601
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

271
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,836
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

272
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,208
to throw Antwan
off a building...

273
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,712
into a glass
motherfucking house...

274
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,272
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

275
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,716
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass...

276
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,151
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

277
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,177
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

278
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,019
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

279
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,547
and I'm saying it does.

280
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,458
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

281
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:07,156
and they all meant something.

282
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,187
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

283
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,063
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

284
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,660
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

285
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:16,604
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

286
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,402
Fucking Marsellus knew it...

287
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:21,535
and Antwan should've fucking
better known better.

288
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:23,340
I mean,
that's his fucking wife, man.

289
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,075
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

290
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:27,605
You know what I'm saying?

291
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,086
It's an interesting point.

292
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:33,247
Come on.
Let's get into character.

293
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,895
What's her name again?

294
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,727
- Mia.
- Mia.

295
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:44,995
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

296
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,729
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida...

297
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:50,398
and he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

298
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:53,602
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

299
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:57,670
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

300
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,409
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

301
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,576
It is not a date.

302
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,610
It's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife...

303
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,212
to a movie or something.

304
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,281
It's just good company,
that's all.

305
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,825
[Jules sighs]

306
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:18,127
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

307
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,725
[Jules sighs]

308
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:30,168
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

309
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,703
Hey, keep chilling.

310
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:40,889
You know who we are?

311
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,550
We're associates
of your business partner...

312
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,322
Marsellus Wallace.

313
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:49,058
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

314
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,294
Let me take a wild guess here.

315
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,769
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

316
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,401
I thought so.

317
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,004
You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace...

318
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:06,241
don't you, Brett?

319
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,749
Yeah, I remember him.

320
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,182
Good.

321
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:12,016
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

322
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:14,488
Sorry about that.
What you having?

323
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,360
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

324
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:21,089
The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

325
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,257
What kind of hamburgers?

326
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,267
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

327
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,769
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

328
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,271
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

329
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,604
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

330
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:35,543
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

331
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,671
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

332
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:39,806
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

333
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,384
They're good.

334
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:45,285
You mind if I try one of yours?

335
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:47,822
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

336
00:15:55,698 --> 00:16:00,368
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.

337
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,031
Vincent, you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger?

338
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:06,741
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

339
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,038

[Sniffs] Just over three years.

732

What was it?

738
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,218
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

739
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,122
called "Fox Force Five."

740
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,787
- What?
- "Fox Force Five."

There was a blond one...

The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

was a demolition expert.

748

754
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,426
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

755
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:30,297
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

756

00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:54,879
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

852
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,587
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

853
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,029
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

854
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:03,055
and yet even another way
is to say...

855
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,228
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

856
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,738
Is that a fact?

857
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,706
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

858
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,642
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

859
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,610
They.

860
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,409
They talk a lot, don't they?

861
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,540
[Chuckles]

862
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,346
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

863
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,354
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

864
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,221
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

865
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,418
Did it involve the "F" word?

866
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:30,926
No. No, no, no.

867
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,452
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

868
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:38,659
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

869
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:44,095
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

870
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,371
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

871
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,139
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

872
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,511
[Chuckles] Well, I mean...

873
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,812
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

874
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,683
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

875
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,382
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

876
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,705
No, it seemed excessive...

877
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,792
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

878
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,295
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

879
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,562
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

880
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,398
A husband
almost killing another man...

881
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,802
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

882
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,703
But did it happen?

883
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,503
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

884
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:23,445
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

885
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,913
Really?

886
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,916
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

887
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,474
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

888
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,747
except Marsellus and Tony.

889
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,846

get together...

890

my husband, your boss...

told you to take me out

- It's got to be exact?
- Yeah, exact.

either. I ain't startin' now.

an injection of adrenaline...

straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

1165

You've got to
pierce through that.

1166
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:53,071
You gotta bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

1167
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:54,806
I gotta stab her three times?

1168
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,677
No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

1169

her breastplate into her heart.

you press down on the plunger.

about that myself.

- No, no!

out of it like that.

1199
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:45,651
that if Marsellus

Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

on the day he set sail
for Paris.

grandfather's war watch...

Dane Coolidge...

gave this watch...

wasn't as good as his old man's.

at the Battle of Wake Island.

had any illusions...

that island alive...

01:06:26,037 --> 01:06:29,097
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

on an Air Force transport...

before in his life...

was on your daddy's wrist...

when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1305
01:07:11,516 --> 01:07:15,043
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1306
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:19,147
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1307
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,623
they'd confiscate it...

1308
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:21,920

1309
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:26,521
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1310
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:29,260
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1311
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,528
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

this watch up his ass.

he give me the watch.

1365
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:28,739
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1366
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:30,474
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1367
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:32,004
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1368
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:34,916
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1369
01:10:34,952 --> 01:10:36,886
I will take care of it.

1370
01:10:37,254 --> 01:10:39,245
[Car driving]

1371
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:48,163
[Colombian accent]
Mister?

1372
01:10:52,203 --> 01:10:53,602
ESMARELDA: Hey, mister?

1373
01:10:53,637 --> 01:10:54,604
What?

1374
01:10:54,638 --> 01:10:56,469
You were in that fight.

1375
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:59,476
ESMARELDA:
The fight on the radio.

1376
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,977
You're the fighter?

1377
01:11:01,012 --> 01:11:02,912
Now, what gave you that idea?

1378
01:11:02,947 --> 01:11:06,474
No, ho, come on.

1379
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:07,745
You're him.

1380
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:10,310
I know you're him.

1381
01:11:11,956 --> 01:11:13,890
Tell me you're him.

1382
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:16,688
I'm him.

1383
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:19,321
You killed
the other boxing man.

1384
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:25,225
He's dead?

1385
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:27,634
The radio said he was dead.

1386
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,604
[Sighs, sniffs]

1387
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:32,700
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1388
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:34,108
[Butch sniffs]

1389
01:11:34,145 --> 01:11:35,578
What does it feel like?

1390
01:11:35,613 --> 01:11:37,808
What does what feel like?

1391
01:11:37,848 --> 01:11:39,782
Killing a man.

1392
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:46,918
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1393
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:48,618
Are you a weirdo?

1394
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:50,217
[Chuckles]
No.

1395
01:11:50,261 --> 01:11:52,821
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1396
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:57,600
You are the first person
I've met...

1397
01:11:57,635 --> 01:11:59,364
who has killed somebody.

1398
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:03,872
So...

1399
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:06,877
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1400
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,879
[Sniffs, exhales]
I'll tell you what.

1401
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:11,814
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1402
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:13,680
and I'll tell you all about it.

1403
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:32,326
[Butch sighs]

1404
01:12:32,403 --> 01:12:34,098
So...

1405
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,867
Esmarelda...

1406
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:39,137
Villalobos.

1407
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:40,336
Is that Mexican?

1408
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:43,642
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1409
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:45,342
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1410
01:12:45,382 --> 01:12:47,316
Thank you.

1411
01:12:47,351 --> 01:12:49,012
And what is your name?

1412
01:12:49,053 --> 01:12:53,255
Butch.

1413
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,723
What does it mean?

1414
01:12:54,758 --> 01:12:58,626
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1415
01:12:58,662 --> 01:13:03,065
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1416
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:05,159
What is it you wanna know?

1417
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:08,603
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1418
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,106
I couldn't tell ya.

1419
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:20,310
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1420
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,319
Now that I know he's dead...

1421
01:13:22,353 --> 01:13:25,345
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1422
01:13:29,093 --> 01:13:32,085
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1423
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:39,769
[Speech inaudible]

1424
01:13:43,307 --> 01:13:45,366
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1425
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:47,809
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1426
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,813
the odds went through the roof.

1427
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:51,508
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1428
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:53,016
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1429
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,348
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1430
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:56,614
He never laced up his gloves...

1431
01:13:56,654 --> 01:13:58,349
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1432
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:00,323
he'd still be alive.

1433
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:01,585
[Spits]

1434
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,559
Yeah, well...

1435
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:05,687
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1436
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:08,323
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1437
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,163
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1438
01:14:12,436 --> 01:14:15,303
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1439
01:14:15,339 --> 01:14:16,806
All eight?

1440
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,831
How long to collect?

1441
01:14:18,909 --> 01:14:21,707
[Sniffs] So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1442
01:14:21,745 --> 01:14:24,077
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1443
01:14:24,114 --> 01:14:25,911
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1444
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,145
that is great news, man.

1445
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:29,709
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1446
01:14:29,753 --> 01:14:32,483
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1447
01:14:32,523 --> 01:14:35,686
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1448
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,455
OK, my brother.

1449
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:38,893
[Chuckles]

1450
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:42,160
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1451
01:14:42,233 --> 01:14:43,291
All right, Scotty.

1452
01:14:43,367 --> 01:14:45,767
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1453
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:47,236
Be cool, brother.

1454
01:14:57,448 --> 01:14:58,938
[Tires squeal]

1455
01:14:58,983 --> 01:15:00,974
[Engine running]

1456
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:05,214
45.60.

1457
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:13,324
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1458
01:15:13,364 --> 01:15:14,524
Now...

1459
01:15:14,565 --> 01:15:17,432
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1460
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:18,559
what are you gonna say?

1461
01:15:18,636 --> 01:15:19,967
The truth.

1462
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:23,838
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1463
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:28,443
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1464
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:30,947
<i>Buenas noches, Butch.</i>

1465
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:44,089
[Sighs]

1466
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:47,393
FABIENNE: [French accent]
Keep the light off.

1467
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:49,422
Is that better,
sugar pop?

1468
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,467
Oui.

1469
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:56,869
Hard day at the office?

1470
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:58,807
Pretty hard.

1471
01:15:58,842 --> 01:16:01,178
I got in a fight.

1472
01:16:01,213 --> 01:16:03,510
Poor baby.

1473
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:05,310
Can we make spoons?

1474
01:16:05,349 --> 01:16:07,977
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1475
01:16:08,018 --> 01:16:09,713
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1476
01:16:09,753 --> 01:16:13,189
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1477
01:16:13,223 --> 01:16:15,123
Let me take this jacket off.

1478
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:19,989
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1479
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:21,361
Uh-huh.

1480
01:16:21,398 --> 01:16:23,889
I wish I had a pot.

1481
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:26,299
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1482
01:16:26,337 --> 01:16:28,032
and you wish you had some pot?

1483
01:16:28,105 --> 01:16:30,039
A pot.

1484
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:32,099
A pot belly.

1485
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:34,303
Pot bellies are sexy.

1486
01:16:34,345 --> 01:16:37,280
Well, you should be happy...

1487
01:16:37,314 --> 01:16:38,804
'cause you have one.

1488
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,214
[Chuckling]
Shut up, fatso!

1489
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,275
I don't have a pot.

1490
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:44,082
I have a bit of a tummy...

1491
01:16:44,121 --> 01:16:46,021
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1492
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:47,546
It's not the same thing.

1493
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:49,354
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1494
01:16:49,393 --> 01:16:51,361
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1495
01:16:51,395 --> 01:16:53,989
The difference is huge.

1496
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,328
[Kisses]

1497
01:16:55,366 --> 01:16:57,630
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1498
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:00,568
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1499
01:17:00,604 --> 01:17:03,368
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1500
01:17:03,407 --> 01:17:07,434
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1501
01:17:07,478 --> 01:17:08,809
The rest of you is normal.

1502
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:13,180
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1503
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:17,517
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1504
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:19,988
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1505
01:17:20,023 --> 01:17:21,650
to accentuate it.

1506
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:24,661
You think men
would find that attractive?

1507
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:27,664
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1508
01:17:27,698 --> 01:17:30,132
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1509
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,500
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1510
01:17:34,538 --> 01:17:36,301
[Sighs]

1511
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,308
If you had a pot belly...

1512
01:17:38,342 --> 01:17:40,310
I would punch you in it.

1513
01:17:40,344 --> 01:17:42,869
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1514
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:44,938
Ah! I'd smother you.

1515
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:48,440
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1516
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:49,474
[Butch laughing]

1517
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,487
You'd do that?

1518
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:52,079
Yes. Yes.

1519
01:17:52,122 --> 01:17:53,282
[Moans]

1520
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:55,848
[Moaning]

1521
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:01,654
[Both moan, both laugh]

1522
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:08,769
Did you get everything?

1523
01:18:08,806 --> 01:18:10,330
Yes, I did.

1524
01:18:10,407 --> 01:18:12,568
Good job, sugar pop.

1525
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,803
Did everything go as planned?

1526
01:18:13,844 --> 01:18:15,971
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1527
01:18:16,013 --> 01:18:17,412
[Fabienne chuckles]

1528
01:18:17,448 --> 01:18:18,608
You didn't listen to the radio?

1529
01:18:18,649 --> 01:18:20,640
I never listen to your fights.

1530
01:18:20,684 --> 01:18:21,981
Were you the winner?

1531
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:24,385
I won, all right.

1532
01:18:24,421 --> 01:18:26,048
Are you still retiring?

1533
01:18:26,089 --> 01:18:27,386
Sure am.

1534
01:18:27,424 --> 01:18:29,824
So, it all worked out
in the finish?

1535
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,318
We're not at the finish yet,
baby.

1536
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,026
Mmm.

1537
01:18:42,773 --> 01:18:45,367
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1538
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:49,708
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1539
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:54,481
But they won't find us,

01:52:54,208 --> 01:52:57,075
JULES: Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

2076
01:52:57,111 --> 01:52:58,305
VINCENT: Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

2077
01:52:58,345 --> 01:52:59,812
He's getting on my nerves.

2078
01:52:59,847 --> 01:53:02,042
JULES: Marvin. Marvin!

2079
01:53:02,083 --> 01:53:03,914
I'd knock that shit off
if I was you.

2080
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:04,918
[Door opens]

2081
01:53:04,952 --> 01:53:08,080
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

2082
01:53:08,155 --> 01:53:10,487
[Gun clicking]

2083
01:53:36,484 --> 01:53:39,647
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

2084
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,153
Slip your mind?

2085
01:53:41,188 --> 01:53:44,715
You forget someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-cannon?

2086
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:46,760
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

2087
01:53:46,827 --> 01:53:49,295
It was bigger than him.

2088
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:56,329
We should be fucking dead, man.

2089
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:58,304
VINCENT:
I know. We was lucky.

2090
01:53:58,339 --> 01:54:01,433
JULES: No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

2091
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:02,772
Yeah, maybe.

2092
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:05,677
This was divine intervention.

2093
01:54:05,713 --> 01:54:07,681
You know what
divine intervention is?

2094
01:54:14,188 --> 01:54:16,019
I think so.

2095
01:54:16,181 --> 01:54:17,614
That means that God
came down from Heaven...

2096
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:19,049
and stopped the bullets.

2097
01:54:19,084 --> 01:54:21,575
JULES: That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

2098
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:22,882
God came down from Heaven...

2099
01:54:22,921 --> 01:54:24,684
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets.

2100
01:54:25,891 --> 01:54:28,072
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

2101
01:54:28,107 --> 01:54:30,326
Don't do that. Don't
fucking blow this shit off.

2102
01:54:30,362 --> 01:54:32,557
JULES: What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

2103
01:54:32,598 --> 01:54:34,395
VINCENT: Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.

2104
01:54:34,433 --> 01:54:37,231
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

2105
01:54:37,269 --> 01:54:39,430
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion...

2106
01:54:39,471 --> 01:54:43,066
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

2107
01:54:43,108 --> 01:54:44,973
We should be fucking dead,
my friend.

2108
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:47,945
JULES: What happened here
was a miracle...

2109
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:50,278
and I want you to fucking
acknowledge it.

2110
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:53,513
All right, it was a miracle.

2111
01:54:53,552 --> 01:54:55,042
Can we go now?

2112
01:55:02,161 --> 01:55:03,822
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

2113
01:55:03,862 --> 01:55:05,352
Shit.

2114
01:55:08,267 --> 01:55:09,757
VINCENT: You ever seen
that show "Cops"?

2115
01:55:09,802 --> 01:55:11,929
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on...

2116
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:13,699
and he was talking
about this gunfight...

2117
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,730
he had in a hallway
with this guy, right?

2118
01:55:15,774 --> 01:55:17,742
And he just unloaded
on this guy...

2119
01:55:17,776 --> 01:55:19,607
and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.

2120
01:55:19,678 --> 01:55:22,169
OK? It was just him
and this guy.

2121
01:55:22,247 --> 01:55:23,874
I mean, you know...

2122
01:55:23,949 --> 01:55:26,008
it's freaky, but it happens.

2123
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:28,576
You want to play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

2124
01:55:28,654 --> 01:55:31,054
but me, my eyes
are wide fucking open.

2125
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:32,853
What the fuck does that mean?

2126
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:34,620
It means that's it for me.

2127
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,821
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

2128
01:55:36,862 --> 01:55:38,727
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

2129
01:55:38,764 --> 01:55:40,561
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.

2130
01:55:40,599 --> 01:55:42,191
Why are you fucking
freaking out on us?

2131
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:44,168
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.

2132
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:45,329
I'm through.

2133
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:46,929
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

2134
01:55:46,972 --> 01:55:48,234
Don't worry. I will.

2135
01:55:48,273 --> 01:55:49,501
VINCENT: Yeah,
and I'll bet you $ 10,000...

2136
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:50,667
he laughs his ass off.

2137
01:55:50,709 --> 01:55:52,404
I don't give a damn
if he does.

2138
01:55:52,478 --> 01:55:56,380
Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

2139
01:55:56,415 --> 01:55:58,076
MARVIN: Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

2140
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,777
You got to have an opinion.

2141
01:55:59,818 --> 01:56:02,343
Do you think that God came down
from Heaven and stopped...

2142
01:56:02,388 --> 01:56:03,514
[Gunshot]

2143
01:56:03,555 --> 01:56:06,547
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!

2144
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:08,025
VINCENT: Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.

2145
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:09,357
Why the fuck did you do that?

2146
01:56:09,395 --> 01:56:10,828
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

2147
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:13,957
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time...

2148
01:56:13,999 --> 01:56:15,398
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

2149
01:56:15,434 --> 01:56:17,163
You probably... You went over
a bump or something.

2150
01:56:17,202 --> 01:56:18,897
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

2151
01:56:18,937 --> 01:56:21,497
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

2152
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,939
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

2153
01:56:22,975 --> 01:56:24,442
Well, look at
this fucking mess, man!

2154
01:56:24,476 --> 01:56:26,068
We're on a city street
in broad daylight.

2155
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:27,112
I can't believe it, man.

2156
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:28,306
Well, believe it now,
motherfucker.

2157
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:29,574
We got to get this car
off the road.

2158
01:56:29,648 --> 01:56:31,013
You know,
cops tend to notice shit...

2159
01:56:31,049 --> 01:56:33,108
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

2160
01:56:33,185 --> 01:56:34,675
Just take it
to a friendly place, that's all.

2161
01:56:34,753 --> 01:56:35,981
This is the Valley, Vincent.

2162
01:56:36,021 --> 01:56:37,318
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

2163
01:56:37,356 --> 01:56:39,517
Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

2164
01:56:39,558 --> 01:56:42,152
- Shit!
- What you doing?

2165
01:56:42,194 --> 01:56:43,559
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

2166
01:56:43,595 --> 01:56:45,085
Where's Toluca Lake?

2167
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:47,030
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank Studios.

2168
01:56:47,065 --> 01:56:48,760
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...

2169
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:50,291
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man...

2170
01:56:50,335 --> 01:56:53,361
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

2171
01:56:53,405 --> 01:56:54,702
Jimmie, yo,
how you doing, man?

2172
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:57,208
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.

2173
01:56:57,242 --> 01:56:59,233
Me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit, man.

2174
01:56:59,311 --> 01:57:01,211
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

2175
01:57:01,246 --> 01:57:03,339
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

2176
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,341
JULES: We got to be
real fucking delicate...

2177
01:57:06,418 --> 01:57:07,885
with this Jimmie situation.

2178
01:57:07,953 --> 01:57:10,353
He's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door.

2179
01:57:10,389 --> 01:57:11,515
VINCENT:
If he does, what do we do?

2180
01:57:11,557 --> 01:57:14,185
JULES: We ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls...

2181
01:57:14,226 --> 01:57:15,784
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

2182
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:16,852
Jimmie's a friend.

2183
01:57:16,895 --> 01:57:18,021
You don't come
into your friend's house...

2184
01:57:18,063 --> 01:57:19,530
and start telling him
what's what.

2185
01:57:19,565 --> 01:57:21,533
VINCENT: Just tell him not
to be abusive, that's all.

2186
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:24,593
He kind of freaked out
back there when he saw Marvin.

2187
01:57:24,636 --> 01:57:25,762
JULES: Well, put yourself
in his position.

2188
01:57:25,804 --> 01:57:27,032
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2189
01:57:27,072 --> 01:57:29,472
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

2190
01:57:29,508 --> 01:57:32,375
Shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

2191
01:57:32,444 --> 01:57:34,275
VINCENT: If that favor means
that I got to take shit...

2192
01:57:34,346 --> 01:57:36,940
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass.

2193
01:57:37,015 --> 01:57:39,575
JULES: Nigger, what the fuck
did you just do to his towel?

2194
01:57:39,651 --> 01:57:40,777
VINCENT:
I was drying my hands.

2195
01:57:40,819 --> 01:57:42,081
JULES: You're supposed
to wash them first.

2196
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:43,246
You watched me wash them.

2197
01:57:43,288 --> 01:57:44,755
I watched you get them wet.

2198
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:47,350
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

2199
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,360
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.

2200
01:57:49,394 --> 01:57:50,861
I used the same
fucking soap you did...

2201
01:57:50,896 --> 01:57:53,865
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

2202
01:57:53,899 --> 01:57:56,424
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

2203
01:57:56,468 --> 01:57:58,629
It's shit like this
that'll bring this situation...

2204
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:00,661
to a head, man.

2205
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,432
Look...

2206
01:58:03,475 --> 01:58:05,204
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

2207
01:58:05,277 --> 01:58:07,177
You know I respect you
and all...

2208
01:58:07,212 --> 01:58:09,703
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

2209
01:58:09,781 --> 01:58:12,682
All right. Fine. Fine.

2210
01:58:12,718 --> 01:58:15,551
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

2211
01:58:15,587 --> 01:58:18,385
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

2212
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:23,125
JULES: Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.

2213
01:58:23,161 --> 01:58:25,129
This is some
serious gourmet shit.

2214
01:58:25,163 --> 01:58:27,063
JULES: Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

2215
01:58:27,099 --> 01:58:30,068
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

2216
01:58:30,102 --> 01:58:33,868
Heh! And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

2217
01:58:33,906 --> 01:58:34,964
What flavor is this?

2218
01:58:35,007 --> 01:58:36,304
Knock it off, Julie.

2219
01:58:36,341 --> 01:58:37,672
What?

2220
01:58:37,709 --> 01:58:40,576
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is.

2221
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:42,773
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

2222
01:58:42,848 --> 01:58:44,975
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

2223
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:46,745
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff...

2224
01:58:46,785 --> 01:58:48,878
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

2225
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:50,548
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

2226
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:52,819
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

2227
01:58:52,858 --> 01:58:54,951
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

2228
01:58:54,993 --> 01:58:56,756
Oh, Jimmie,
don't even worry about it.

2229
01:58:56,795 --> 01:58:59,161
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

2230
01:58:59,197 --> 01:59:00,664
When you came pulling in here...

2231
01:59:00,699 --> 01:59:02,398
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house

2232
01:59:02,433 --> 01:59:03,658
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2233
01:59:03,702 --> 01:59:05,465
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

2234
01:59:05,504 --> 01:59:07,301
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house...

2235
01:59:07,339 --> 01:59:09,170
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2236
01:59:09,207 --> 01:59:12,404
No. I didn't.

2237
01:59:12,477 --> 01:59:13,774
JIMMIE: You know why
you didn't see that sign?

2238
01:59:13,845 --> 01:59:14,971
Why?

2239
01:59:15,047 --> 01:59:16,480
'Cause it ain't there...

2240
01:59:16,515 --> 01:59:19,575
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

2241
01:59:19,651 --> 01:59:21,050
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker.

2242
01:59:21,086 --> 01:59:24,522
Don't you fucking realize, man,
that if Bonnie comes home...

2243
01:59:24,556 --> 01:59:27,218
and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?

2244
01:59:27,259 --> 01:59:28,920
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

2245
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:31,020
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, OK?

2246
01:59:31,063 --> 01:59:33,861
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

2247
01:59:33,899 --> 01:59:36,527
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you...

2248
01:59:36,568 --> 01:59:38,934
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

2249
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:41,098
Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

2250
01:59:41,139 --> 01:59:43,164
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!

2251
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:45,540
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.

2252
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:47,943
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget...

2253
01:59:48,013 --> 01:59:50,174
that I love my wife, is there?

2254
01:59:52,284 --> 01:59:53,581
Look, you know...

2255
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:57,282
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

2256
01:59:57,322 --> 01:59:59,722
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

2257
01:59:59,758 --> 02:00:01,851
You got to make
some phone calls?

2258
02:00:01,893 --> 02:00:03,485
You got to call some people?

2259
02:00:03,528 --> 02:00:05,826
Well, then do it, and get
the fuck out of my house...

2260
02:00:05,864 --> 02:00:07,764
before she gets here.

2261
02:00:07,799 --> 02:00:08,857
That's Kool and the Gang.

2262
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:10,299
We don't want
to fuck your shit up.

2263
02:00:10,335 --> 02:00:13,236
I want to call my people,
get them to bring us in.

2264
02:00:13,271 --> 02:00:16,263
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

2265
02:00:16,308 --> 02:00:19,175
You'll fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

2266
02:00:19,244 --> 02:00:20,734
So just do me that favor,
all right?

2267
02:00:20,812 --> 02:00:22,973
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

2268
02:00:23,048 --> 02:00:26,245
Well, say she comes home.

2269
02:00:26,284 --> 02:00:30,050
What do you think she'll do?

2270
02:00:30,088 --> 02:00:32,556
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

2271
02:00:32,591 --> 02:00:34,684
That ain't no kind of answer.

2272
02:00:34,726 --> 02:00:36,023
I mean, you know, I don't.

2273
02:00:36,061 --> 02:00:37,858
How much?
A lot or a little?

2274
02:00:37,896 --> 02:00:41,093
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

2275
02:00:41,133 --> 02:00:42,794
this Bonnie situation is.

2276
02:00:42,834 --> 02:00:45,098
JULES: I mean, if she comes
home from a hard day's work...

2277
02:00:45,137 --> 02:00:46,604
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen...

2278
02:00:46,638 --> 02:00:48,663
doing a bunch
of gangster shit...

2279
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:52,143
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

2280
02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:54,041
[Gasps]

2281
02:00:54,112 --> 02:00:56,706
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

2282
02:00:56,782 --> 02:00:58,750
All I'm doing
is contemplating the "ifs."

2283
02:00:58,784 --> 02:01:01,116
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking "ifs."

2284
02:01:01,153 --> 02:01:02,518
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

2285
02:01:02,554 --> 02:01:05,318
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

2286
02:01:05,357 --> 02:01:06,790
"Go back in there,
chill them niggers out...

2287
02:01:06,825 --> 02:01:09,919
"and wait for the cavalry,
which will be coming directly."

2288
02:01:09,961 --> 02:01:13,328
MARSELLUS: You ain't
got no problem, Jules.

2289
02:01:13,365 --> 02:01:15,458
I'm on the motherfucker.

2290
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:18,094
Go back in there
and chill them niggers out...

2291
02:01:18,136 --> 02:01:20,536
and wait for The Wolf,
who should be coming directly.

2292
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,000
You're sending The Wolf?

2293
02:01:23,041 --> 02:01:25,271
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

2294
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:30,805
Shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

2295
02:01:30,882 --> 02:01:34,249
WOLF:
Is she the hysterical type?

2296
02:01:34,286 --> 02:01:36,254
When is she due?

2297
02:01:37,622 --> 02:01:39,522
Mm-hmm.

2298
02:01:39,558 --> 02:01:42,550
Give me the principals'
names again.

2299
02:01:44,529 --> 02:01:46,929
Jules.

2300
02:01:46,965 --> 02:01:48,023
Mm-hmm.

2301
02:01:48,066 --> 02:01:50,864
Vincent.

2302
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,469
Jimmie.

2303
02:01:58,176 --> 02:02:00,076
Bonnie.

2304
02:02:00,145 --> 02:02:01,112
Mm-hmm.

2305
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:06,645
It's thirty minutes away.

2306
02:02:06,685 --> 02:02:08,448
I'll be there in ten.

2307
02:02:21,767 --> 02:02:23,496
[Doorbell rings]

2308
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,371
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

2309
02:02:28,406 --> 02:02:29,373
JIMMIE: Sure is.

2310
02:02:29,407 --> 02:02:32,137
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

2311
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:33,336
JIMMIE: Good. We got one.

2312
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:34,878
So I heard. May I come in?

2313
02:02:34,913 --> 02:02:37,006
JIMMIE: Yeah, please do.

2314
02:02:37,082 --> 02:02:39,073
WOLF: You must be Jules...

2315
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:40,948
which would make you Vincent.

2316
02:02:40,986 --> 02:02:42,954
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

2317
02:02:42,988 --> 02:02:44,319
If I was informed correctly...

2318
02:02:44,356 --> 02:02:45,323
the clock is ticking,
is that right, Jimmie?

2319
02:02:45,357 --> 02:02:47,257
JIMMIE:100%

2320
02:02:47,292 --> 02:02:49,021
WOLF: Your wife Bonnie...

2321
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:50,857
comes home at 9:30 in the a. m.,
is that correct?

2322
02:02:50,896 --> 02:02:52,227
JIMMIE: Uh-huh.

2323
02:02:52,264 --> 02:02:55,062
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here...

2324
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:56,863
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

2325
02:02:56,902 --> 02:02:58,369
JIMMIE:
She wouldn't at that.

2326
02:02:58,403 --> 02:03:01,236
That gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of Dodge...

2327
02:03:01,273 --> 02:03:04,401
which, if you do what I say
when I say it, should be plenty.

2328
02:03:04,442 --> 02:03:06,808
Now, you got a corpse
in a car...

2329
02:03:06,878 --> 02:03:09,108
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

2330
02:03:13,518 --> 02:03:15,486
[Sighs]

2331
02:03:16,888 --> 02:03:19,186
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.

2332
02:03:19,224 --> 02:03:20,623
Do me a favor, will you?

2333
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:21,921
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

2334
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,258
Would you make me a cup?

2335
02:03:24,296 --> 02:03:25,923
JIMMIE: Yeah, sure.

2336
02:03:27,799 --> 02:03:30,267
JIMMIE:
Oh, how do you take it?

2337
02:03:30,302 --> 02:03:33,294
WOLF: Lots of cream,
lots of sugar.

2338
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:37,007
About the car... is there
anything I need to know?

2339
02:03:37,042 --> 02:03:39,374
Does it stall, smoke,
make a lot of noise?

2340
02:03:39,444 --> 02:03:41,036
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

2341
02:03:41,112 --> 02:03:43,945
JULES: Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

2342
02:03:43,982 --> 02:03:45,916
WOLF: Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road...

2343
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:47,612
I find out
the brake lights don't work.

2344
02:03:47,652 --> 02:03:51,247
JULES: Man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tiptop.

2345
02:03:51,289 --> 02:03:53,223
WOLF: Good enough.

2346
02:03:53,258 --> 02:03:55,123
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2347
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,825
[Sighs]

2348
02:04:00,866 --> 02:04:01,924
JIMMIE:
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2349
02:04:01,967 --> 02:04:03,491
WOLF: Thank you, Jimmie.

2350
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:10,230
Mmm.

2351
02:04:11,443 --> 02:04:13,104
WOLF: OK, first thing...

2352
02:04:13,178 --> 02:04:15,772
you two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2353
02:04:15,847 --> 02:04:18,645
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2354
02:04:18,683 --> 02:04:20,082
That would lead me to believe
that in the garage...

2355
02:04:20,118 --> 02:04:22,450
or under the sink, you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit?

2356
02:04:22,487 --> 02:04:23,545
JIMMIE: Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

2357
02:04:23,588 --> 02:04:25,556
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do...

2358
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:28,354
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car.

2359
02:04:28,393 --> 02:04:30,384
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2360
02:04:30,428 --> 02:04:31,861
Go in the back seat...

2361
02:04:31,897 --> 02:04:35,162
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

2362
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,225
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2363
02:04:37,269 --> 02:04:39,567
Now, it don't need
to be spick-and-span.

2364
02:04:39,604 --> 02:04:42,698
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.

2365
02:04:42,741 --> 02:04:45,505
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2366
02:04:45,543 --> 02:04:47,010
The pools of blood
that have collected...

2367
02:04:47,078 --> 02:04:48,670
you got to soak that shit up.

2368
02:04:48,747 --> 02:04:51,875
Now, Jimmie, we need to raid
your linen closet.

2369
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:53,383
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

2370
02:04:53,418 --> 02:04:55,386
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

2371
02:04:55,453 --> 02:04:57,011
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2372
02:04:57,055 --> 02:04:58,989
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2373
02:04:59,024 --> 02:05:01,288
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2374
02:05:01,326 --> 02:05:02,953
We're going to line
the front seat and back seat...

2375
02:05:02,994 --> 02:05:05,929
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets.

2376
02:05:05,964 --> 02:05:08,660
So if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car...

2377
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:10,292
the subterfuge won't last...

2378
02:05:10,335 --> 02:05:13,202
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

2379
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:15,297
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

2380
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:18,468
VINCENT:
"Please" would be nice.

2381
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:19,477
WOLF: Come again?

2382
02:05:19,544 --> 02:05:21,569
I said
a "please" would be nice.

2383
02:05:23,481 --> 02:05:25,745
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2384
02:05:25,784 --> 02:05:28,048
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2385
02:05:28,086 --> 02:05:30,953
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

2386
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:34,425
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

2387
02:05:34,459 --> 02:05:35,756
I'm here to help.

2388
02:05:35,794 --> 02:05:38,524
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2389
02:05:38,563 --> 02:05:40,087
JULES: No, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

2390
02:05:40,131 --> 02:05:41,189
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

2391
02:05:41,232 --> 02:05:42,927
VINCENT: Mr. Wolf, listen.

2392
02:05:42,968 --> 02:05:45,402
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.

2393
02:05:45,437 --> 02:05:47,803
I don't like people barking
orders at me, that's all.

2394
02:05:47,839 --> 02:05:50,706
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2395
02:05:50,742 --> 02:05:52,676
I think fast, I talk fast...

2396
02:05:52,744 --> 02:05:55,838
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this...

2397
02:05:55,914 --> 02:05:57,814
so pretty please
with sugar on top...

2398
02:05:57,849 --> 02:05:59,817
clean the fucking car.

2399
02:06:03,722 --> 02:06:05,280
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2400
02:06:05,323 --> 02:06:07,814
I can feel your look.

2401
02:06:09,961 --> 02:06:12,395
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

2402
02:06:14,699 --> 02:06:16,189
Green.

2403
02:06:18,336 --> 02:06:21,328
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

2404
02:06:23,608 --> 02:06:25,769
Mmm, about twenty minutes.

2405
02:06:27,545 --> 02:06:29,513
Nobody who'll be missed.

2406
02:06:31,549 --> 02:06:35,041
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

2407
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,587
How we coming, Jimmie?

2408
02:06:36,621 --> 02:06:38,748
JIMMIE: Pretty good.
I got it all here...

2409
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:41,020
but, uh...

2410
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:42,185
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

2411
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:44,320
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.

2412
02:06:44,362 --> 02:06:47,991
JIMMIE: You got to understand
something now, Winston.

2413
02:06:48,033 --> 02:06:49,898
Uh, no, thank you.

2414
02:06:49,934 --> 02:06:53,165
This is our best linen here...

2415
02:06:53,204 --> 02:06:55,832
and it was a wedding present...

2416
02:06:55,874 --> 02:06:57,535
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny...

2417
02:06:57,575 --> 02:06:58,906
and they're not with us anymore.

2418
02:06:58,943 --> 02:07:00,410
I really want
to help you guys out...

2419
02:07:00,478 --> 02:07:03,038
WOLF: Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie...

2420
02:07:03,114 --> 02:07:04,081
if you don't mind.

2421
02:07:04,115 --> 02:07:07,642
JIMMIE:
No, please, go ahead.

2422
02:07:07,719 --> 02:07:11,120
WOLF: Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny...

2423
02:07:11,156 --> 02:07:13,420
were they millionaires?

2424
02:07:13,458 --> 02:07:15,187
JIMMIE: No.

2425
02:07:15,226 --> 02:07:18,059
WOLF: Well,
your Uncle Marsellus is...

2426
02:07:18,096 --> 02:07:21,497
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

2427
02:07:21,655 --> 02:07:24,317
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

2428
02:07:24,357 --> 02:07:28,726
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

2429
02:07:28,762 --> 02:07:32,755
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2430
02:07:35,802 --> 02:07:37,064
I like oak myself.

2431
02:07:37,137 --> 02:07:40,800
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

2432
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:44,003
How about you, Jimmie?

2433
02:07:44,044 --> 02:07:46,035
You an oak man?

2434
02:07:47,047 --> 02:07:48,537
Oak's nice.

2435
02:07:55,021 --> 02:07:56,386
JULES: Oh, man.

2436
02:07:56,423 --> 02:07:58,721
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

2437
02:07:58,758 --> 02:08:00,521
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

2438
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,289
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy...

2439
02:08:02,329 --> 02:08:04,194
that once a man admits
that he is wrong...

2440
02:08:04,231 --> 02:08:07,359
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2441
02:08:07,434 --> 02:08:09,595
JULES: Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

2442
02:08:09,669 --> 02:08:11,694
The motherfucker said that shit
never had to pick up...

2443
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:14,103
itty-bitty pieces of skull
on account of your dumb ass.

2444
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,505
VINCENT:
I got a threshold, Jules.

2445
02:08:15,542 --> 02:08:17,567
I got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take.

2446
02:08:17,611 --> 02:08:19,272
Right now, I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

2447
02:08:19,312 --> 02:08:20,609
And you got me in the red.

2448
02:08:20,647 --> 02:08:23,207
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous...

2449
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:25,218
to have a race car
in the fucking red, that's all.

2450
02:08:25,252 --> 02:08:27,152
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?

2451
02:08:27,187 --> 02:08:28,745
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2452
02:08:28,788 --> 02:08:31,848
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2453
02:08:31,891 --> 02:08:34,519
Every time my fingers touch
brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."

2454
02:08:34,561 --> 02:08:36,859
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."

2455
02:08:36,896 --> 02:08:39,160
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2456
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:41,667
You the motherfucker
who should be on brain detail.

2457
02:08:41,701 --> 02:08:43,669
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows...

2458
02:08:43,703 --> 02:08:45,432
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

2459
02:08:55,548 --> 02:08:57,106
WOLF: Fine job, gentlemen.

2460
02:08:58,618 --> 02:09:00,483
We may get out of this yet.

2461
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:03,045
JIMMIE: I can't believe
this is the same car.

2462
02:09:03,089 --> 02:09:06,752
WOLF: Let's not start sucking
each other's dicks quite yet.

2463
02:09:06,793 --> 02:09:08,226
Phase one is complete...
clean the car...

2464
02:09:08,261 --> 02:09:10,092
which moves us right
along to phase two...

2465
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:11,620
clean you two.

2466
02:09:13,933 --> 02:09:15,833
Strip.

2467
02:09:15,869 --> 02:09:17,359
All the way?

2468
02:09:17,437 --> 02:09:19,667
WOLF: To your bare ass.

2469
02:09:19,706 --> 02:09:21,333
Quickly, gentlemen.

2470
02:09:21,374 --> 02:09:22,864
WOLF:
We got about fifteen minutes...

2471
02:09:22,942 --> 02:09:26,036
before Jimmie's better half
pulls into the driveway.

2472
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:28,411
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2473
02:09:28,448 --> 02:09:30,416
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

2474
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:31,917
You know what you two
look like?

2475
02:09:31,951 --> 02:09:33,475
VINCENT: What?

2476
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,283
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

2477
02:09:36,823 --> 02:09:39,883
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2478
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:46,121
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2479
02:09:46,166 --> 02:09:47,724
JULES:
Don't do nothing stupid...

2480
02:09:47,801 --> 02:09:49,996
like leaving this shit out front
for Otto the Garbageman...

2481
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:51,037
you know what I'm saying?

2482
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:53,039
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

2483
02:09:53,073 --> 02:09:55,473
Jim, the soap.

2484
02:09:56,810 --> 02:09:58,835
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen...

2485
02:09:58,878 --> 02:10:01,369
you've both been
to County before I'm sure.

2486
02:10:01,414 --> 02:10:02,346
Here it comes.

2487
02:10:02,382 --> 02:10:04,942
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.

2488
02:10:04,984 --> 02:10:06,747
WOLF: Better you
than me, gentlemen.

2489
02:10:06,786 --> 02:10:09,050
Ha ha ha!

2490
02:10:09,089 --> 02:10:10,647
Don't be afraid
of the soap.

2491
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:11,623
Spread it around.

2492
02:10:11,658 --> 02:10:12,590
Get him up there
a little bit.

2493
02:10:12,625 --> 02:10:14,820
JIMMIE: Vincent's hair.

2494
02:10:14,861 --> 02:10:16,590
JULES: Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!

2495
02:10:16,629 --> 02:10:18,722
Uh, uh...

2496
02:10:18,765 --> 02:10:20,255
Towel 'em.

2497
02:10:31,378 --> 02:10:34,472
WOLF: They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2498

[Wolf laughs]

2499
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,644
Perfect.

2500
02:10:37,684 --> 02:10:41,279
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2501
02:10:41,321 --> 02:10:43,653
You guys look like...

2502
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:45,885
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2503
02:10:45,925 --> 02:10:46,949
Dorks.

a couple of dorks.

2507
02:10:50,363 --> 02:10:52,888
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

2508
02:10:52,966 --> 02:10:54,092
Come on, gentlemen.

2509
02:10:54,167 --> 02:10:55,725
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

2510
02:10:55,802 --> 02:10:57,736
Don't make me beg.

2511
02:11:00,874 --> 02:11:04,173
OK, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

2512
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:06,701
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

2513
02:11:06,746 --> 02:11:09,306
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel...

2514
02:11:09,349 --> 02:11:10,816
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2515
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:12,943
The place is North Hollywood...

2516
02:11:12,986 --> 02:11:16,786
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

2517
02:11:16,823 --> 02:11:20,281
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

2518
02:11:21,761 --> 02:11:23,592
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

2519
02:11:23,630 --> 02:11:27,794
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

2520
02:11:27,867 --> 02:11:29,664
nobody does a fucking thing
till I do something.

2521
02:11:29,736 --> 02:11:30,794
- Right.
- What did I say?

2522
02:11:32,071 --> 02:11:33,663
Don't do shit unless...

2523
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,140
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

2524
02:11:36,176 --> 02:11:38,576
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2525
02:11:38,611 --> 02:11:39,771
How about you, Lash LaRue?

2526
02:11:39,813 --> 02:11:42,281
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2527
02:11:42,315 --> 02:11:43,839
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

2528
02:11:43,883 --> 02:11:45,111
I don't why.

2529
02:11:45,151 --> 02:11:46,311
I'm cool. I promise you.

2530
02:11:46,352 --> 02:11:49,844
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fucking fast, so keep up.

2531
02:11:49,889 --> 02:11:52,119
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it...

2532
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:54,888
Monster Joe's going to be
disposing of two bodies.

Someday, all this will be hers.

Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2540

a volleyball game or something?

I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

very much, Mr. Wolf.

Because you are a character...

that you have character.

as English Bob.

No, man. I don't eat pork.

Naw, I ain't Jewish.

that's all.

Why not?

2581

Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

Yeah, but bacon tastes good.

Pork chops taste good.

may taste like pumpkin pie...

the filthy motherfuckers.

How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces.

2593

But do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

2594
02:14:15,334 --> 02:14:17,325
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy...

2595
02:14:17,402 --> 02:14:19,529

2596

But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

Ah, so by that rationale...

2598

if a pig had
a better personality...

2599
02:14:26,278 --> 02:14:28,178
he would cease to be
a filthy animal.

2615
02:15:01,647 --> 02:15:02,875
An act of God.

possible.

I don't think qualifies.

Don't you see?
That shit don't matter.

2622
02:15:19,898 --> 02:15:21,388
You're judging this shit
the wrong way.

2625

You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

2627
02:15:31,402 --> 02:15:33,870
was an "According to Hoyle"
miracle...

2628
02:15:33,904 --> 02:15:35,269
is insignificant...

2629
02:15:35,306 --> 02:15:39,572
but what is significant
is I felt the touch of God.

02:15:39,610 --> 02:15:40,975

going to walk the earth.

Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

2647
02:16:18,349 --> 02:16:20,476
Till God puts me
where he wants me to be.

2648

And what if he don't do that?

2649

If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

02:20:34,228 --> 02:20:35,525
What's in the case?

2745
02:20:35,563 --> 02:20:37,155
My boss's dirty laundry.

2746
02:20:37,198 --> 02:20:38,665
Your boss makes you
do his laundry?

2747
02:20:38,699 --> 02:20:39,666
JULES:
When he wants it clean.

2748
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:40,758
Sounds like a shit job.

2749
02:20:40,801 --> 02:20:42,530
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

2750
02:20:42,570 --> 02:20:43,594
Open it.

2751
02:20:43,637 --> 02:20:45,571
Afraid I can't do that.

2752
02:20:47,208 --> 02:20:48,505
I didn't hear you.

2753
02:20:48,542 --> 02:20:49,941
Yes, you did.

2754
02:20:51,078 --> 02:20:52,340
HONEY BUNNY:
What's going on?

2755
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:55,349
PUMPKIN: Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

2756
02:20:55,383 --> 02:20:57,010
HONEY BUNNY:
Shoot him in the face.

2757
02:20:57,084 --> 02:20:59,109
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time...

2758
02:20:59,186 --> 02:21:00,676
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2759
02:21:00,755 --> 02:21:03,121
You don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2760
02:21:03,157 --> 02:21:05,318
MANAGER: Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2761
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:06,986
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of there!

2762
02:21:07,028 --> 02:21:08,325
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2763
02:21:08,362 --> 02:21:09,624
This ain't none
of your goddamn business.

2764
02:21:11,665 --> 02:21:13,724
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.

2765
02:21:13,768 --> 02:21:15,759
It's no problem.
I got it under control.

2766
02:21:17,505 --> 02:21:19,370
Now I'm going to count to three.

2767
02:21:21,042 --> 02:21:22,771
If you don't open that case...

2768
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:26,974
I'm going to unload
in your fucking face.

2769
02:21:29,283 --> 02:21:30,773
We clear?

2770
02:21:34,321 --> 02:21:35,288
One...

2771
02:21:39,126 --> 02:21:40,252
two...

2772
02:21:41,562 --> 02:21:42,824
- three.
- OK, Ringo.

2773
02:21:42,863 --> 02:21:45,195
You win.

2774
02:21:45,232 --> 02:21:46,722
It's yours.

2775
02:21:51,972 --> 02:21:53,769
Open it.

2776
02:21:57,511 --> 02:21:59,843
HONEY BUNNY:
What is it?

2777
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:02,178
What is it?

2778
02:22:02,249 --> 02:22:04,843
Is that what I think it is?

2779
02:22:04,919 --> 02:22:06,648
Mm-hmm.

2780
02:22:09,523 --> 02:22:10,922
It's beautiful.

2781
02:22:10,958 --> 02:22:13,984
HONEY BUNNY:
God damn it, what is it?

2782
02:22:15,696 --> 02:22:19,427
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2783
02:22:19,467 --> 02:22:21,435
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2784
02:22:21,469 --> 02:22:23,266
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2785
02:22:23,304 --> 02:22:24,794
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2786
02:22:24,839 --> 02:22:26,170
Tell that fuckin' bitch
to chill!

2787
02:22:26,207 --> 02:22:27,731
PUMPKIN:
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2788
02:22:27,775 --> 02:22:30,209
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2789
02:22:30,244 --> 02:22:32,075
- Let go of him!
- JULES: Chill!

2790
02:22:32,113 --> 02:22:33,273
Tell her it's
going to be all right.

2791
02:22:33,347 --> 02:22:34,314
It's going to be all right.

2792
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:35,643
- Promise her!
- I promise!

2793
02:22:35,716 --> 02:22:37,445
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2794
02:22:37,518 --> 02:22:38,985
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2795
02:22:39,019 --> 02:22:40,714
All right, now, Yolanda!

2796
02:22:40,754 --> 02:22:42,722
JULES: We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2797
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:44,223
Don't you hurt him!

2798
02:22:44,258 --> 02:22:45,486
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2799
02:22:45,526 --> 02:22:47,994
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.

2800
02:22:48,028 --> 02:22:49,928
And what's Fonzie like?

2801
02:22:49,964 --> 02:22:52,262
JULES: Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?!

2802
02:22:52,299 --> 02:22:53,391
He's cool?

2803
02:22:53,434 --> 02:22:54,867
- JULES: What?
- Cool.

2804
02:22:54,902 --> 02:22:56,233
Correctamundo!

2805
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:59,797
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2806
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:04,777
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2807
02:23:04,812 --> 02:23:06,780
And when I count three...

2808
02:23:06,814 --> 02:23:09,146
I want you to let go
of your gun...

2809
02:23:09,216 --> 02:23:11,707
put your palms
flat on the table...

2810
02:23:11,785 --> 02:23:14,379
and sit your ass down.

2811
02:23:14,455 --> 02:23:18,789
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

2812
02:23:18,826 --> 02:23:19,986
You ready?

2813
02:23:21,395 --> 02:23:23,420
One...

2814
02:23:23,464 --> 02:23:25,591
two...

2815
02:23:25,633 --> 02:23:26,930
three.

2816
02:23:34,508 --> 02:23:36,976
OK, now you let him go!

2817
02:23:37,011 --> 02:23:39,206
JULES: Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

2818
02:23:39,246 --> 02:23:41,339
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2819
02:23:41,415 --> 02:23:43,508
JULES: And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

2820
02:23:43,584 --> 02:23:45,449
And when motherfuckers
get scared...

2821
02:23:45,486 --> 02:23:49,115
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2822
02:23:49,156 --> 02:23:52,717
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2823
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:56,355
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2824
02:23:56,397 --> 02:24:00,163
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that...

2825
02:24:00,201 --> 02:24:03,068
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2826
02:24:03,103 --> 02:24:05,094
So let's see what we can do.

2827
02:24:05,139 --> 02:24:07,437
JULES: Now...

2828
02:24:07,474 --> 02:24:11,171
here's the situation.

2829
02:24:11,212 --> 02:24:12,577
Normally both your asses...

2830
02:24:12,613 --> 02:24:14,638
would be dead
as fuckin' fried chicken...

2831
02:24:14,715 --> 02:24:15,909
but you happened
to pull this shit...

2832
02:24:15,983 --> 02:24:17,314
while I'm in
a transitional period...

2833
02:24:17,351 --> 02:24:20,184
and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.

2834
02:24:20,221 --> 02:24:24,885
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2835
02:24:24,925 --> 02:24:28,224
Besides, I been through
too much shit over this case...

2836
02:24:28,262 --> 02:24:31,527
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2837
02:24:31,565 --> 02:24:33,157
Vincent!

2838
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:34,758
Be cool!

2839
02:24:34,802 --> 02:24:37,828
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

2840
02:24:37,871 --> 02:24:39,065
We still just talking!

2841
02:24:39,106 --> 02:24:40,733
Come on, point the gun at me!

2842
02:24:40,774 --> 02:24:42,674
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

2843
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:47,374
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2844
02:24:47,448 --> 02:24:50,144
Tell her we're still cool.

2845
02:24:50,217 --> 02:24:51,684
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

2846
02:24:51,752 --> 02:24:53,743
How we doing, baby?

2847
02:24:53,821 --> 02:24:57,052
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.

2848
02:24:57,091 --> 02:24:58,649
JULES:
Just hang in there, baby.

2849
02:24:58,692 --> 02:25:00,216
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

2850
02:25:00,261 --> 02:25:01,523
And Ringo's proud of you.

2851
02:25:01,562 --> 02:25:03,291
It's almost over.

2852
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:05,298
Tell her you're proud of her.

2853
02:25:05,332 --> 02:25:06,629
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

2854
02:25:06,667 --> 02:25:08,464
I love you.

2855
02:25:08,502 --> 02:25:10,163
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

2856
02:25:10,204 --> 02:25:15,335
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2857
02:25:17,911 --> 02:25:19,378
Which one is it?

2858
02:25:19,413 --> 02:25:21,745
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2859
02:25:36,887 --> 02:25:38,548
JULES: That's it.

2860
02:25:38,589 --> 02:25:40,056
That's my Bad Motherfucker.

2861
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:42,651
Open it up. Take out the money.

2862
02:25:48,365 --> 02:25:49,889
JULES: Count it.

2863
02:25:56,307 --> 02:25:58,775
How much is there?

2864
02:26:01,078 --> 02:26:02,477
About $1,500.

2865
02:26:02,546 --> 02:26:05,777
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2866
02:26:05,816 --> 02:26:08,751
With the rest of those wallets
and the register...

2867
02:26:08,786 --> 02:26:10,720
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

2868
02:26:10,755 --> 02:26:13,349
VINCENT: Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $ 1,500...

2869
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:15,187
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2870
02:26:15,226 --> 02:26:16,318
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2871
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:18,487
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

2872
02:26:18,529 --> 02:26:20,190
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2873
02:26:20,231 --> 02:26:21,823
Shut up!

2874
02:26:21,866 --> 02:26:23,800
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

2875
02:26:23,834 --> 02:26:27,964
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.

2876
02:26:28,038 --> 02:26:29,801
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

2877
02:26:29,874 --> 02:26:33,366
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?

2878
02:26:33,444 --> 02:26:34,502
What?

2879
02:26:34,578 --> 02:26:35,738
Your life.

2880
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:37,407
I'm givin' you that money...

2881
02:26:37,448 --> 02:26:40,281
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

2882
02:26:40,317 --> 02:26:42,797
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2883
02:26:42,832 --> 02:26:44,493
Not regularly, no.

2884
02:26:44,534 --> 02:26:46,968
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2885
02:26:47,003 --> 02:26:50,666
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

2886
02:26:50,706 --> 02:26:53,834
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2887
02:26:53,876 --> 02:26:55,673
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

2888
02:26:55,711 --> 02:26:57,508
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2889
02:26:57,547 --> 02:27:01,108
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

2890
02:27:01,184 --> 02:27:03,482
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

2891
02:27:03,553 --> 02:27:05,020
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

2892
02:27:05,087 --> 02:27:07,715
"and the finder
of lost children.

2893
02:27:07,790 --> 02:27:09,724
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

2894
02:27:09,759 --> 02:27:12,091
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2895
02:27:12,128 --> 02:27:15,154
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2896
02:27:15,198 --> 02:27:18,224
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

2897
02:27:18,267 --> 02:27:21,896
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2898
02:27:21,938 --> 02:27:25,237
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

2899
02:27:25,274 --> 02:27:29,768
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2900
02:27:29,812 --> 02:27:31,643
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2901
02:27:31,681 --> 02:27:33,308
I just thought
it was some cold-blooded shit...

2902
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:36,978
to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.

2903
02:27:37,053 --> 02:27:40,682
But I saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice.

2904
02:27:40,756 --> 02:27:42,883
See, now I'm thinkin'...

2905
02:27:42,925 --> 02:27:46,622
maybe it means
you're the evil man...

2906
02:27:46,662 --> 02:27:48,630
and I'm the righteous man...

2907
02:27:48,664 --> 02:27:50,757
and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...

2908
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,734
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass...

2909
02:27:52,768 --> 02:27:55,362
in the Valley of Darkness.

2910
02:27:55,404 --> 02:27:57,338
Or it could mean...

2911
02:27:57,373 --> 02:28:00,604
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

2912
02:28:00,643 --> 02:28:04,773
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2913
02:28:04,814 --> 02:28:07,112
Now, I'd like that.

2914
02:28:07,149 --> 02:28:10,084
But that shit ain't the truth.

2915
02:28:10,119 --> 02:28:11,848
The truth is...

2916
02:28:13,222 --> 02:28:16,248
you're the weak...

2917
02:28:16,325 --> 02:28:19,783
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

2918
02:28:19,829 --> 02:28:24,027
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2919
02:28:24,066 --> 02:28:29,663
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2920
02:28:45,087 --> 02:28:46,281
JULES: Go on.

2921
02:29:03,272 --> 02:29:04,933
[Sighs]

2922
02:29:04,974 --> 02:29:07,670
I think we should
be leaving now.

2923
02:29:07,710 --> 02:29:09,735
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.

2924
