1
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,979
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

2
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,049
<i>Beth.</i>

3
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,886
Keenish.

4
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,422
Herr... Konish?

5
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,458
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

6
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,326
<i>'Ö.' "Herr König."</i>

7
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,562
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

8
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:16,999
<i>Gretchen and the movers
are right behind us.</i>

9
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,736
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

10
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,374
No, she's Beth.

11
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,279
Ah, okay.

12
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,215
And what is going on
with your sister?

13
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,617
She deaf or something?

14
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:37,653
<i>-No.</i>

15
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,456
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

16
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:01,810
You okay, honey?

17
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:05,781
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

18
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:08,784
Oh!

19
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,300
Ah, very good, Luis!

20
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,136
You've been practicing, huh?

21
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:29,338
How was your journey?

22
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,006
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

23
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:33,242
<i>We almost forgot
how beautiful it is here.</i>

24
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:35,878
<i>Ah, we almost forgot how
beautiful you are, Beth.</i>

25
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,279
<i>-Oh, stop!</i>

26
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,981
Keep going!

27
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,850
Gretchen, come say hi.

28
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,121
Gretchen.

29
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,824
- What's up?
- Oh, Jesus.

30
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,093
<i>Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.</i>

31
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:52,127
Thank you.

32
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,461
No, thank you, Beth.

33
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,831
We are so glad to have you back.

34
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:59,467
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

35
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,736
I completely understand.

36
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,872
<i>We have something
for you.</i>

37
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,407
It's...

38
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,278
The original sketch.

39
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,446
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

40
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,249
the land you acquired.

41
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,318
Beth, that is...

42
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:21,323
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

43
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,159
- Oh!
<i>- You know, you two lovebirds</i>

44
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:29,097
stumbled into my nest almost
eight years ago to the day.

45
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:30,899
<i>And I believe there were more</i>

46
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,669
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

47
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,904
<i>Hello, Alma.</i>

48
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,813
Your German is already
better than your father's, huh?

49
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,085
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

50
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:57,125
<i>Hey, Gretchen.
How are you holding up?</i>

51
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,771
<i>I wish we could
have spent a little</i>

52
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,429
<i>more time together
after the funeral,</i>

53
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,064
<i>but I get it.</i>

54
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:05,533
<i>You're all over Europe
with your dad's family, huh?</i>

55
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,704
<i>Don't forget you have a band
that needs your voice.</i>

56
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:10,706
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you
the new mix.</i>

57
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:12,841
<i>I knew your mom
would have loved it.</i>

58
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,255
Beth? It's occupied.

59
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,387
Gretchen, let's go!

60
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:34,656
<i>Herr König is taking us
to the new house.</i>

61
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:36,625
<i>Can you sit with Alma
this time?</i>

62
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:42,924
Car? What?
Car what?

63
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:16,626
What?

64
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,135
<i>Hello there!</i>

65
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:39,681
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

66
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,217
I have my hands full.

67
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,919
Oh, me too.

68
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,689
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

69
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:49,491
No, I'm a daughter.

70
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,126
Oh, really?

71
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,861
Haven't heard about you.

72
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,297
Are you from England as well?

73
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:56,598
No, I'm not.

74
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,867
Why would you have heard
about me?

75
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,502
I told...

76
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,870
Jesus.

77
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,438
Forgive me, my dear.

78
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,942
Didn't mean to startle you.

79
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,477
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

80
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:10,961
Dr. Bonomo is the medical

81
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,981
superintendent of
the local hospital

82
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:16,885
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

83
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:19,120
which I am also funding.

84
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,990
<i>This is Gretchen.</i>

85
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,325
Gretchen.

86
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:25,661
Yeah.

87
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:29,197
Gretchen is from
the United States.

88
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,301
It has been decided that she
is moving in with her father.

89
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:38,506
What a pleasant surprise.

90
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:48,750
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

91
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,052
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

92
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,555
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

93
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:55,991
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

94
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:00,895
Hi, mom.

95
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,969
I know this is weird, um...

96
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,806
But it's good to hear
your voice.

97
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,947
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

98
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,518
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

99
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:36,766
<i>I know it's been tough.</i>

100
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:39,134
<i>But we are very happy
you're here.</i>

101
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,504
Excuse me.

102
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,440
Gretchen, my dear.

103
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,743
I, uh...

104
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:52,314
<i>I've been thinking,
for a young woman like you</i>

105
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,961
there's... not so
many things to do

106
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:57,385
here during the
summer, and so...

107
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,855
I have a little idea.

108
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,927
<i>A proposal. How would you like to
come work for me at the resort?</i>

109
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,630
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

110
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,197
<i>Well,
it's an easy job,</i>

111
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,099
<i>and it will give you
something to do</i>

112
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,034
<i>while your parents build
the new resort for me.</i>

113
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,904
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

114
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,839
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

115
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,809
I would pay you an
appropriate salary, of course.

116
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,210
<i>I don't...</i>
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

117
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,851
Oh.

118
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,353
Schön.

119
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:32,987
<i>Wonderful.</i>

120
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,957
<i>Come by the reception tomorrow.</i>

121
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,061
<i>Here's your ID badge,
sir.</i>

122
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,931
<i>Would you like to pay
with cash or credit card?</i>

123
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,136
Cash, or credit?

124
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:51,139
Cash.

125
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,509
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

126
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,546
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

127
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,686
Oh, and this is Beatrice

128
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:06,087
and I am Gretchen.

129
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:16,752
<i>You have to be
polite and friendly,</i>

130
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>even if the guest is rude.</i>

131
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,403
<i>And remember to put up the sign
if you go to the bathroom.</i>

132
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,973
But if you have any real
trouble, just call the boss.

133
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,510
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

134
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,213
He lives in a vacation
bungalow?

135
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:35,651
No, he has a villa way up there.

136
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:38,186
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

137
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:41,055
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

138
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,558
Weird, right?

139
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:44,760
Super.

140
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,206
This happens
sometimes.

141
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,978
How's your first day, my dear?

142
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,050
Can't complain.

143
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:11,687
And how is your German
coming along?

144
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:14,422
Not good.

145
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:16,826
This is okay.

146
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:19,728
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

147
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,931
over the border, in Italy.

148
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:31,272
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

149
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:35,410
Oh, I have my bike.

150
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,511
Oh?

151
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:38,279
No.

152
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,048
No, no, no.

153
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:44,486
<i>No, it will be too dark
on the country roads by then.</i>

154
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,055
<i>This is why you
will not work late.</i>

155
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:50,492
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

156
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,026
What?

157
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:54,996
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

158
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:57,967
<i>-You have a car.</i>

159
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,602
<i>-I have a life, too.</i>

160
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,839
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

161
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,340
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

162
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,009
<i>-No. Every time I raise
an issue with you,</i>

163
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,945
<i>there is something
you have to say about it.</i>

164
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,113
<i>- I do everything you ask!
- No.</i>

165
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,716
<i>-What? I work every day
late shifts!</i>

166
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,517
<i>-You're blasting your
Scheisse music on the car radio</i>

167
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:16,785
<i>on your way to work.</i>

168
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,821
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

169
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,388
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

170
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,857
<i>and you are disturbing
the wildlife</i>

171
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,591
<i>with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

172
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:55,824
They can dance on the carpet...

173
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,122
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

174
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:28,182
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

175
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:54,610
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

176
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,210
Alma?

177
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:59,882
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

178
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:08,023
<i>What happened
to your face?</i>

179
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:12,795
My father's daughter
scratched me.

180
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,196
Your sister?

181
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,666
- She's not my sister.
<i>- Oh.</i>

182
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,001
Come on now.

183
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,303
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

184
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,411
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

185
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:37,518
<i>It's called vanishing twin
syndrome.</i>

186
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,256
It's when one fetus dies in the
early stages of the pregnancy

187
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,695
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

188
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,464
<i>I always thought
it was kind of badass.</i>

189
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,868
But yeah, she's a bitch.

190
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:56,404
Okay.

191
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,710
Another reason to not have kids.

192
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,445
<i>Thanks for finishing my shift.</i>

193
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,482
<i>Erik and I haven't been
on a date in ages.</i>

194
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,283
Here's my master key.

195
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:11,787
There's only one. Don't lose it.

196
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:15,991
And at 10 p.m. sharp you lock
everything up like I showed you.

197
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,326
And boss doesn't
need to know.

198
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:19,962
It's fine.

199
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:20,896
Okay.

200
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,537
Uh-huh.

201
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:04,539
Can I get a room?

202
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:08,977
May I see your ID or passport?

203
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,746
You can't just ask for my name?

204
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,353
Uhm...

205
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,256
Is it just you...

206
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,492
or are you here with a partner?

207
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,528
We have special rates
and amenities

208
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:30,766
for couples and newlyweds.

209
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,804
For now, just me.

210
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:37,906
Okay.

211
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:43,712
I'm Ed.

212
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:48,016
<i>What's your name?</i>

213
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:50,953
I'm Gretchen.

214
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,791
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

215
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,762
I won't be here
for long anyways.

216
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,469
<i>-You like music?</i>

217
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,609
Sure.

218
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:20,048
Then you should come to Paris.

219
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,555
Okay.

220
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:40,777
Hey!

221
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,516
Is this normal?

222
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:49,853
It's only my second day.

223
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,521
<i>-Better go check on her.</i>

224
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:53,724
Uh-huh.

225
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,301
Resort Alpschatten...

226
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:10,741
<i>Gretchen?</i>

227
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:12,976
- Yes.
<i>- Where's Beatrix?</i>

228
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:16,245
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

229
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,982
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

230
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,382
<i>Gretchen.</i>

231
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:22,452
<i>I want you to lock the doors
and wait for me,</i>

232
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:24,588
<i>I will come pick you up
right now.</i>

233
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:25,555
Uh...

234
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:29,459
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

235
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,896
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

236
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:36,199
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

237
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:37,567
<i>Gretchen, listen to me
carefully.</i>

238
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,268
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

239
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,403
<i>Fuck no.</i>

240
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:44,060
<i>Gretchen?</i>

241
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,675
Hello!

242
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,745
Please let me in!

243
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,616
Please let me in right now!
Please!

244
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,666
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

245
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,004
<i>The woman stood there
until the police arrived.</i>

246
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:43,441
-I was chased.

247
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,141
Fuck!

248
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,826
It's really important that your

249
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:50,380
statement is as
accurate as possible.

250
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:53,068
The receptionist,
she stated that she

251
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,885
did not see any
woman in the parking lot.

252
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,389
May I suggest...

253
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:03,026
we change the last part into...

254
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:08,665
"The woman stood there until Mrs.
So-and-so entered the room..."

255
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,367
"Then the police arrived."

256
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:16,840
That is so much better.

257
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,309
I think...

258
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:22,580
you are the victim of a prank.

259
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,616
<i>Everybody
is very nice here, honey.</i>

260
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,618
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

261
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,887
<i>but this is actually
very common.</i>

262
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:35,391
- Dad.
- Gretchen?

263
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:36,993
What happened?

264
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,061
Did you fall?

265
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:39,996
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

266
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:42,265
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

267
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:43,766
<i>We need to get her checked out.</i>

268
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:45,702
Dad, I was attacked.

269
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:46,651
By who?

270
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:49,473
I don't know, the cops
think it was a prank...

271
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,408
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

272
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,910
No, I fell, but...
<i>- Gretchen?</i>

273
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,950
She fell, it's okay.

274
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,688
<i>We are going
to do an MRI...</i>

275
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:23,373
It might be childhood epilepsy.

276
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,176
Epilepsy?

277
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,243
<i>It might be?</i>

278
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:28,546
It means it might be genetic

279
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:30,180
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

280
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,983
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

281
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:36,620
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

282
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:40,223
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

283
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:43,193
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

284
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:47,897
What's causing the seizures?

285
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,435
<i>-There are many possible triggers
for a seizure in a child.</i>

286
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:53,169
<i>Fever. Certain lights.</i>

287
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,540
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

288
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:58,642
But Alma is too young for that.

289
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,843
<i>Has there been
a stressful event</i>

290
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:03,246
<i>or disruption
in your family lately?</i>

291
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,026
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

292
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:19,395
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

293
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:21,965
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

294
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:24,734
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

295
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:27,438
<i>Mom, this place
is completely fucked.</i>

296
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,713
<i>Alma keeps
freaking out, and they</i>

297
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,774
<i>say she has
epilepsy or something.</i>

298
00:30:33,477 --> 00:30:35,512
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

299
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,982
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

300
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,150
<i>I got the money.</i>

301
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,926
- <i>What happened to you?</i>
- Jesus.

302
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,931
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

303
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:04,974
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

304
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:08,878
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

305
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,048
incident last night.

306
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,258
Which one?

307
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:25,328
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

308
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,635
I don't wanna talk to you.

309
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,169
Excuse me?

310
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,938
Um... excuse me.

311
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:38,509
There's another guest waiting.

312
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:49,018
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

313
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:52,855
Could you come see me
when you're done?

314
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:55,391
Fine.

315
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:10,039
I'm checking out.

316
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,543
Oh.

317
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,578
Okay.

318
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:27,256
You didn't charge me.

319
00:32:27,357 --> 00:32:29,892
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

320
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:33,062
Um...

321
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,865
No, you don't.

322
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,375
Do you smoke?

323
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:02,325
You coming?

324
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:07,063
Yeah, just give me a minute.

325
00:33:23,438 --> 00:33:25,272
<i>I have a house
back in the States.</i>

326
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,307
<i>I just need to get
to an airport.</i>

327
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,143
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

328
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,615
<i>We have one of these in Paris.</i>

329
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,562
<i>And then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.</i>

330
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,163
I wasn't going in there.

331
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:56,169
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

332
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:09,450
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

333
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,520
<i>I wasn't going in there.</i>

334
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,625
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

335
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:31,371
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

336
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:34,509
I wasn't going in
there.

337
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:43,083
Watch out!

338
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,496
<i>Do you smell this?</i>

339
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:39,567
Yes.

340
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:51,277
Or are those molecules binding to
a receptor in your nasal cavity?

341
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:57,283
Got me.

342
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,767
And are you...

343
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,538
right now, in this moment...

344
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:25,780
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

345
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,387
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

346
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:35,556
Hm?

347
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:38,959
<i>If I were you...</i>

348
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,898
<i>I would stay home
until my body was done</i>

349
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:46,667
<i>growing back those cells.</i>

350
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:51,672
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

351
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:55,476
<i>As if I was stuck in a loop.</i>

352
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,212
<i>Can you... do this?</i>

353
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:05,251
Good.

354
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,627
Apology accepted.

355
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:17,765
Luis.

356
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,047
What are you doing?

357
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,715
I'm getting my stuff.

358
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,284
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

359
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:40,087
I mean, they said we can...

360
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,256
-I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

361
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:47,495
<i>Beth has been watching Alma while
I've been here looking after you.</i>

362
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:50,030
I have to go home
and give her a break.

363
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,300
- Please don't leave.
- You'll be fine.

364
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:55,736
There are people here
all the time.

365
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,072
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

366
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,508
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

367
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:04,745
What if she comes back?

368
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,213
Gretchen, stop it!

369
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:07,882
But why? I'm not making this up!

370
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:10,918
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

371
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,021
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

372
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:23,329
I wasn't high.

373
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,199
Oh, you were!

374
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:27,001
You were tested.

375
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,303
You stole money from Herr König

376
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,174
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

377
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,109
I can't force you
to do anything.

378
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,511
You are almost eighteen
years old.

379
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,513
But you don't have a job anymore

380
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:42,817
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

381
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,719
If you wanna run away,

382
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,789
then take your fucking bicycle.

383
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,603
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

384
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:05,005
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

385
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,541
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

386
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:10,444
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

387
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:14,515
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

388
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:17,051
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

389
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,788
<i>It's really bad.</i>

390
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,727
<i>I just wanna come home.</i>

391
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,933
Where's Gretchen?

392
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,035
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

393
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:36,637
Where's Gretchen?

394
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:39,573
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

395
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:55,073
<i>I told you
to come see me.</i>

396
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:59,643
<i>I saved your life.</i>

397
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:03,214
I saw the woman.

398
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,686
You saw her?

399
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:13,124
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

400
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:16,394
I need you to help me
find that woman.

401
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:19,864
<i>She's wanted for murder.</i>

402
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:22,901
<i>And I expect her
to come for you again.</i>

403
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:27,105
I can protect you.

404
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,608
If we find her...

405
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:36,681
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

406
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:41,386
<i>Does Alma
listen to music often?</i>

407
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:44,822
<i>She loves music, especially
since Gretchen moved in with us.</i>

408
00:41:44,923 --> 00:41:46,524
<i>Now...</i>

409
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:49,027
<i>And this is extremely
important.</i>

410
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:53,064
<i>Nobody must know
about this investigation.</i>

411
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:55,867
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

412
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,036
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

413
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,672
in people with Alma's condition.

414
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:03,875
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

415
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:07,212
It's just music.

416
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:08,980
<i>You going out?</i>

417
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:31,736
<i>A month ago,
a married couple on vacation</i>

418
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,838
had rented this cabin.

419
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,541
<i>A cabin not far from here.</i>

420
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:39,777
<i>The husband told the police
that in the evening</i>

421
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:41,946
<i>he'd lost consciousness.</i>

422
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:45,550
When he woke up...

423
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:50,788
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

424
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:56,261
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

425
00:42:56,561 --> 00:43:01,432
<i>The blonde woman's voice
had a hypnotic effect on the man.</i>

426
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,671
<i>He chased the woman into
the woods, but she got away.</i>

427
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,873
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

428
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,511
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

429
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:18,549
Jesus.

430
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:27,792
Dude...

431
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:32,731
The other night, a half-naked
woman came into the reception,

432
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,933
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

433
00:43:41,674 --> 00:43:44,375
Where was she staying?

434
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:55,520
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

435
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:12,070
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

436
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:26,551
<i>I didn't know stakeouts
were gonna be so boring.</i>

437
00:44:28,754 --> 00:44:31,055
When are we gonna see
some action?

438
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:33,024
<i>Almost 11.</i>

439
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:36,427
<i>Be on the lookout and listen
for anything strange.</i>

440
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:15,266
<i>She'll choke.</i>

441
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:20,371
<i>Last time I was too late.</i>

442
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:45,229
<i>Gretchen?</i>

443
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,233
Did we wake you?

444
00:50:56,407 --> 00:51:00,712
<i>All the owls
have individual calls</i>

445
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:04,482
<i>so that they can understand
each other over long distances.</i>

446
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,650
<i>And maybe we
can make a secret call</i>

447
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:09,721
so that we
can understand each other.

448
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:12,824
Now, I brought you something.

449
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:14,993
I know that you will like this.

450
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:25,937
Gretchen, come sit with us.

451
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:27,172
Gretchen?

452
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:29,507
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

453
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:33,410
No.

454
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:36,480
Okay, good. Please join us.

455
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:39,550
I went out last night.

456
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:42,754
Where did you go?

457
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:44,656
<i>The resort.</i>

458
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,894
What were you doing there?

459
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:50,729
I was with Trixie.

460
00:51:51,328 --> 00:51:52,596
<i>-Hm.</i>

461
00:51:53,064 --> 00:51:56,768
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

462
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:59,070
<i>-She wasn't.</i>

463
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:02,140
She was really confused.

464
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,742
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

465
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:06,111
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

466
00:52:06,377 --> 00:52:09,147
Hm. I will look into this.

467
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,483
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

468
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:16,221
<i>Seems like a lot of people
need assistance after ten.</i>

469
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:18,522
It doesn't make sense
economically.

470
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:21,159
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
<i>- Gretchen!</i>

471
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:22,393
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

472
00:52:22,493 --> 00:52:24,095
It's not so interesting, but...

473
00:52:24,196 --> 00:52:25,764
Maybe another time.

474
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:29,433
It's quite the place
you got here.

475
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,069
-Gretchen, what's the matter?

476
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:32,804
Why did you bring us here?

477
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,247
Your parents are planning a...

478
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:43,815
A new resort, I know.

479
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:47,853
Why do we have to live here?

480
00:52:47,953 --> 00:52:48,753
<i>Gretchen!</i>

481
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:50,521
Because it's pretty outside?

482
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:52,858
Calm down, right now.

483
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:14,145
You are here because your family
belongs here.

484
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,752
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

485
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:23,029
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?

486
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:23,822
<i>- I don't know dad!</i>

487
00:53:23,922 --> 00:53:26,490
I'm just reflecting on this very
fucking weird living situation

488
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,592
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

489
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:29,694
Out!

490
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:30,962
<i>Now!</i>

491
00:53:32,596 --> 00:53:34,666
- Great.
<i>- No, no, Luis.</i>

492
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:36,801
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

493
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:38,670
You need some family time,
I understand.

494
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,638
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

495
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,606
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

496
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:45,010
and I wish you a good evening.
- I'm very sorry.

497
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,411
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

498
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:49,915
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

499
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:54,319
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

500
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,487
don't be afraid to...

501
00:53:57,255 --> 00:53:58,823
talk to me.

502
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,862
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

503
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:07,766
Oh... it was a surprise.

504
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:10,068
I was not supposed
to say anything.

505
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:11,202
I am so sorry.

506
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:12,737
What package?

507
00:54:14,105 --> 00:54:17,108
What package?
- It has your family name on it.

508
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,891
It was your mother's stuff.

509
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:36,493
<i>The small stuff, at least.</i>

510
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,629
I received it this morning.

511
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,498
<i>I... your father should perhaps
change the address</i>

512
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:42,968
<i>on the counter...</i>

513
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,070
What is it doing here, dad?

514
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:51,977
I sold the old house.

515
00:54:57,382 --> 00:55:00,452
It was... still my house.

516
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:02,954
<i>And I put the money
in an account for you.</i>

517
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:09,327
<i>I... I didn't want you
to get worked up again...</i>

518
00:55:18,502 --> 00:55:21,172
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

519
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:23,942
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

520
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,510
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

521
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,713
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

522
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:32,117
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

523
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:35,420
<i>It's really bad.</i>

524
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,558
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

525
00:55:46,765 --> 00:55:48,233
<i>What do you think?</i>

526
00:55:53,438 --> 00:55:55,507
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

527
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:58,575
<i>What's your take
on that, mom?</i>

528
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:18,129
<i>Next message.</i>

529
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:23,634
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,
my name is Alma.</i>

530
00:56:23,935 --> 00:56:26,603
<i>I'm calling you
because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

531
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:29,240
<i>Gretchen calls you
when she feels bad,</i>

532
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,142
<i>but you never answer.</i>

533
00:56:31,342 --> 00:56:33,144
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

534
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:35,113
<i>I'm worried.</i>

535
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,647
<i>If you get my message,</i>

536
00:56:36,848 --> 00:56:39,250
<i>I want you to call Gretchen
back on the phone.</i>

537
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,053
<i>You can tell her
that you love her.</i>

538
00:56:42,454 --> 00:56:44,055
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

539
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:46,458
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

540
00:56:46,825 --> 00:56:49,527
<i>If you'd like to,
you can come visit us.</i>

541
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:51,996
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

542
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,052
Good, you're packed.

543
00:57:15,652 --> 00:57:17,655
Do you even know how to drive?

544
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:20,624
Where is everybody?

545
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,797
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

546
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:29,067
Alma had a very strong seizure.

547
00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:33,204
<i>It's your fault, Gretchen.
You know that.</i>

548
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,173
<i>You terrified her.</i>

549
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:41,346
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

550
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:44,582
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

551
00:57:44,682 --> 00:57:46,484
and I'll drive you
to the station.

552
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:48,652
The last train leaves
in one hour.

553
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:07,438
Bring your bike.

554
00:58:36,502 --> 00:58:37,703
You like it?

555
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:39,972
Sure.

556
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:43,142
<i>You know it? A common cuckoo.</i>

557
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:46,145
<i>A magnificent creature.</i>

558
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,714
<i>-Common.</i>

559
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:54,186
Ah. But its behavior is not.

560
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:57,323
Its nature is quite remarkable.

561
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:02,595
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

562
00:59:02,928 --> 00:59:07,767
<i>Some species need our help
to survive and reproduce.</i>

563
00:59:09,835 --> 00:59:12,304
I'm a preservationist, you know?

564
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:34,093
<i>Oh, come along now.</i>

565
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:38,864
<i>I want you to understand
who you got involved with.</i>

566
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:43,369
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

567
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,604
<i>with an illegal firearm.</i>

568
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:47,474
What are you doing?

569
00:59:47,573 --> 00:59:48,874
He's a cop.

570
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:52,344
No, he's not.

571
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:54,514
Not anymore.

572
00:59:54,747 --> 00:59:56,949
<i>You see, Erik here...</i>

573
00:59:57,216 --> 00:59:59,118
is actually a policeman.

574
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,688
He has access to police files.

575
01:00:03,089 --> 01:00:06,592
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

576
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:09,929
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

577
01:00:10,062 --> 01:00:14,100
<i>one that he is personally
involved with.</i>

578
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:16,270
Okay, Erik. I
think it is time to

579
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:18,604
take Herr Lando
to the police station.

580
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,906
Gretchen, let's get your money.

581
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:27,146
<i>This way, please.</i>

582
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,748
Come along, now.

583
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:33,279
<i>You are a liability, Gretchen.
I can't let you out.</i>

584
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,749
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

585
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:38,684
<i>-Just pheromones.</i>

586
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,387
<i>I am giving you the chance
to be of great use</i>

587
01:01:41,488 --> 01:01:43,689
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

588
01:01:44,156 --> 01:01:46,725
<i>The adolescent
needs to be trained.</i>

589
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,464
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

590
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:03,309
It's a mild sedative.

591
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:04,710
What?

592
01:02:04,877 --> 01:02:07,346
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

593
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,787
I'm staying here tonight.

594
01:02:17,856 --> 01:02:21,727
<i>These creatures can't speak
like you or I.</i>

595
01:02:21,894 --> 01:02:23,329
<i>But when trained,</i>

596
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:27,701
<i>their song can be dizzyingly
persuasive.</i>

597
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:57,216
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

598
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,322
Something
is not right.

599
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,745
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

600
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:27,279
with those construction plans.

601
01:05:27,379 --> 01:05:30,149
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

602
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,687
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

603
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:37,457
<i>What happened
to Herr Lando's wife</i>

604
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:39,626
<i>must not repeat itself.</i>

605
01:05:42,762 --> 01:05:46,533
<i>I'm very sorry for what happened
to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

606
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:53,138
But this one's mother wandered
off my area of authority.

607
01:05:53,238 --> 01:05:57,577
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

608
01:05:57,744 --> 01:05:59,978
<i>before we had another offspring</i>

609
01:06:00,078 --> 01:06:01,481
ready to replace her.

610
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:05,350
<i>There were family matters
prolonging my endeavor.</i>

611
01:06:10,422 --> 01:06:11,957
Actually...

612
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:15,961
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

613
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:20,265
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

614
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:21,333
Wow.

615
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:25,472
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

616
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:28,641
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

617
01:06:29,007 --> 01:06:34,747
<i>A sacred process that keeps an
ancient creature alive and well.</i>

618
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:38,217
<i>A magnificent creature
whose approach to family</i>

619
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:41,488
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

620
01:06:44,122 --> 01:06:46,091
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

621
01:06:46,191 --> 01:06:49,061
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

622
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:52,599
<i>Consider your mishap last night
a dry run.</i>

623
01:06:58,303 --> 01:06:59,438
Erik?

624
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,555
Shh...

625
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:24,062
Oh.

626
01:07:26,164 --> 01:07:27,867
No, no, no, no.

627
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,836
<i>You should be on your side.</i>

628
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:31,671
<i>You could choke, my dear.</i>

629
01:08:03,503 --> 01:08:05,705
<i>Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?</i>

630
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:07,640
I don't feel so good.

631
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:10,710
Take this.

632
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,106
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

633
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:12,739
After my mom died,

634
01:09:13,138 --> 01:09:15,642
I accidentally called
our house...

635
01:09:17,242 --> 01:09:20,345
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

636
01:09:23,215 --> 01:09:25,518
It kind of helped,

637
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:28,721
so I kept calling.

638
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:33,826
Maybe you can do that too.

639
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:21,641
<i>Do you know what this bird
is famous for?</i>

640
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:30,183
This bird lays its eggs in
the nests of other bird species

641
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:35,220
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

642
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:40,225
No! Not in here!

643
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,526
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

644
01:11:24,302 --> 01:11:27,006
How old is your sister?

645
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:33,980
Gretchen?

646
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:37,250
Yes, I am fine.

647
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,986
<i>We are in the treatment center
by the hospital.</i>

648
01:11:40,153 --> 01:11:41,353
-If you come back
in the morning,

649
01:11:41,788 --> 01:11:43,756
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

650
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:46,259
<i>Alma is going
to stay here for the evening.</i>

651
01:11:46,358 --> 01:11:48,761
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor
her sleep.</i>

652
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:49,629
<i>Dad?</i>

653
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:51,197
<i>-Beth and I are coming home.</i>

654
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:53,431
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about...

655
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,335
<i>-What is it, Gretchen?</i>

656
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:00,506
We can't trust them.

657
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,942
<i>-Gretchen, we can talk
when we're home.</i>

658
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:05,878
<i>I told you
I will protect you.</i>

659
01:12:09,749 --> 01:12:11,050
<i>Get ready.</i>

660
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:13,052
What's wrong with Beth?

661
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:31,904
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

662
01:12:33,606 --> 01:12:37,944
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

663
01:12:38,744 --> 01:12:43,216
<i>Astonishing resemblance
to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

664
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:47,620
<i>The surrogate mother's distress
grows in close proximity</i>

665
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:49,655
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

666
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:53,993
<i>Thus both host parents have
been removed from the premises.</i>

667
01:12:56,762 --> 01:12:59,799
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

668
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:04,871
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

669
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:09,374
<i>Instead of leaving their
offspring in the care of a host,</i>

670
01:13:09,475 --> 01:13:13,713
<i>homo-cuculidae returns
to claim their young.</i>

671
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,015
Contact with the biological
mother

672
01:13:16,115 --> 01:13:19,752
speeds up the process of the
offspring's physical development

673
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:23,456
<i>and its abilities
significantly.</i>

674
01:13:26,893 --> 01:13:32,198
We are about to initiate the
first close-distance encounter

675
01:13:32,498 --> 01:13:34,600
with the biological mother.

676
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:56,421
Brood parasites.

677
01:13:59,058 --> 01:14:00,893
<i>They don't impregnate.</i>

678
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,629
They implant eggs.

679
01:14:05,865 --> 01:14:08,935
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

680
01:14:11,537 --> 01:14:15,074
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

681
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,512
Like your father...

682
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,248
<i>on his honeymoon.</i>

683
01:14:24,517 --> 01:14:26,519
<i>And then what do they do?</i>

684
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,189
Release them into the wild.

685
01:14:32,358 --> 01:14:34,961
When the mother shows up...

686
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:37,196
I end this experiment.

687
01:14:39,065 --> 01:14:41,133
What about my sister?

688
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:46,839
That is not your sister.

689
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,875
Two.

690
01:14:50,042 --> 01:14:52,178
<i>Yeah, the sister
of the young one</i>

691
01:14:52,278 --> 01:14:54,513
and a rogue police detective.

692
01:14:55,047 --> 01:14:57,081
<i>Yeah, I am afraid
we must commence</i>

693
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:59,018
<i>definitive measures immediately.</i>

694
01:14:59,585 --> 01:15:00,853
<i>She's dead.</i>

695
01:15:02,054 --> 01:15:04,090
The feather
I wrote my name with.

696
01:15:05,091 --> 01:15:07,593
<i>The plumage
of the apportioners.</i>

697
01:15:29,248 --> 01:15:30,249
Yeah.

698
01:15:57,643 --> 01:15:58,978
No! No!

699
01:16:07,953 --> 01:16:09,822
I'm not going to hurt you.

700
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:47,293
Alma. Alma?

701
01:16:47,593 --> 01:16:49,595
Alma, we have to go.

702
01:16:49,762 --> 01:16:51,664
We have to go now.

703
01:17:19,225 --> 01:17:20,659
Just stay right here.

704
01:18:12,278 --> 01:18:14,780
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

705
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:01,927
Alma?

706
01:26:51,296 --> 01:26:52,832
She's dead!

707
01:26:53,633 --> 01:26:55,168
Mom is dead!

708
01:26:55,735 --> 01:27:00,205
<i>Where's your machine gun,
my dear?</i>

709
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:02,642
Is it under your cast, huh?

710
01:27:05,778 --> 01:27:06,746
Why me?

711
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:09,615
It's not about you,
you little brat.

712
01:27:10,415 --> 01:27:13,086
This is nature.

713
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,555
<i>She is supposed
to be focusing...</i>

714
01:27:15,655 --> 01:27:19,257
<i>on reproduction and breeding.</i>

715
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:25,832
And you are competing for
resources with her offspring.

716
01:27:26,099 --> 01:27:28,601
<i>Our process here ensures</i>

717
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,537
<i>that each new generation
we breed</i>

718
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:34,439
<i>is more powerful than the last.</i>

719
01:27:34,607 --> 01:27:37,977
<i>And my dear,
when I am done with you</i>

720
01:27:38,276 --> 01:27:40,947
<i>and reunite Alma with...</i>

721
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,947
Stay away
from her, Alma.

722
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,640
No.

723
01:30:21,941 --> 01:30:25,177
S-She... can't.

724
01:30:27,313 --> 01:30:32,485
But she says thank you.

725
01:30:31,818 --> 01:30:33,988
Thank you, Alma.

726
01:31:04,985 --> 01:31:07,054
Thank you, Alma.

727
01:31:14,695 --> 01:31:16,997
I really need your help.

728
01:31:29,744 --> 01:31:31,545
<i>Henry!</i>

729
01:31:32,046 --> 01:31:34,315
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

730
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:39,220
I stand by it.

731
01:31:39,653 --> 01:31:42,556
<i>-Did you ever tell your wife
you'd protect her?</i>

732
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:48,396
What?

733
01:31:50,197 --> 01:31:54,235
<i>Did you tell her
you'd protect her?</i>

734
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:00,474
<i>Did you?</i>

735
01:32:04,745 --> 01:32:07,148
Yes!

736
01:32:07,248 --> 01:32:09,917
<i>-Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

737
01:32:35,576 --> 01:32:37,044
Alma!

738
01:32:37,411 --> 01:32:40,347
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

739
01:32:42,249 --> 01:32:44,385
<i>What are you doing?</i>

740
01:32:44,485 --> 01:32:45,753
She's one of them!

741
01:32:45,986 --> 01:32:47,822
<i>Alma!</i>

742
01:32:47,923 --> 01:32:49,223
I don't think so.

743
01:32:49,423 --> 01:32:50,391
<i>-Come to me.</i>

744
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:53,160
She will be.

745
01:32:53,427 --> 01:32:55,463
She will become!

746
01:32:56,063 --> 01:32:58,599
- I don't think so.
<i>- Alma!</i>

747
01:32:58,766 --> 01:33:00,968
<i>We need to find out
how many there are.</i>

748
01:33:01,068 --> 01:33:04,405
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

749
01:33:05,105 --> 01:33:07,374
- Stop!
- Let her go.

750
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,912
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

751
01:33:11,011 --> 01:33:12,746
She is not your sister!

752
01:33:12,847 --> 01:33:14,081
They stopped reproducing before.

753
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:16,450
They will go extinct
without preservation.

754
01:33:16,617 --> 01:33:18,152
Oh, they will go extinct.

755
01:33:18,252 --> 01:33:20,221
<i>-Hundreds of years of research.</i>

756
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:22,423
<i>This is the will
of the apportioners.</i>

757
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,091
<i>Let her go.</i>

758
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,494
You don't know
what you're doing!
