This is the apparatus.

291
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,892
And very simply,
when positively charged deuterons

292
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,478
are attracted
to the palladium cathode,

293
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,521
they cram together.

294
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,109
There are millions and millions
of them getting closer and closer,

295
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:43,114
and then they fuse. And they create
energy in the form of helium.

296
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:47,285
But I read that the experiment
couldn't be replicated. So...

- Well, we don't.

Not yet.

299
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,547
But if you remember, Einstein, he knew
the theory of relativity to be true

300
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,218
long before he could prove it.
He felt the truth.

301
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:08,306
And some of us feel the same way
about cold fusion.

302
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,725

304

And when we ignite
that cold fusion fire,

305
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,696
I mean, just imagine...

306
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,158

in one cubic mile of sea water
