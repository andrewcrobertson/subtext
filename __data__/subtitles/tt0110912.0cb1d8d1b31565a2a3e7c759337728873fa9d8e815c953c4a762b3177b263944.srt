1
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:32,201
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:34,745
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:37,748
“I'm through, never again, too dangerous.”

4
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,084
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:43,796
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,673
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,175
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,136
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,680
Quack, quack, quack.

10
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:54,848
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:58,394
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:01,730
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:06,110
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

14
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,489
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:15,536
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'
the same risk as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,664
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:21,542
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:26,046
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,425
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,553
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says...

21
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:36,265
“We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give
him all your money, we're gonna kill her.”

22
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,142
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.

23
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,895
That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead
walks into a bank with a telephone...

24
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,065
not a pistol, not a shotgun,
a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,526
Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.

26
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,737
Did they hurt the little girl?

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,532
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

28
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,577
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,622
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

30
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:02,124
I'm illustrating if we did,
it'd be easier than what we've been doing.

31
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,542
No more liquor stores?

32
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,378
What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

33
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,423
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

34
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,759
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

35
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:14,178
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what you're talkin' about.

36
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,763
They make it too personal.

37
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:17,765
We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.

38
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:21,477
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- I don't want to kill anybody either.

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,521
But they'll probably put us in
a situation where it's us or them.

40
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,148
And if it's not the gooks...

41
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,234
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

42
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,739
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

43
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,741
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

44
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,743
See how far that gets you. Forget it.

45
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,746
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

46
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,873
- Not in this life.
- What then?

47
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,211
<i>Garcon,</i> coffee!

48
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,962
This place.

49
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,925
<i>Garcon</i> means boy.

50
00:02:57,388 --> 00:03:00,057
This place? <i>A</i> coffee shop?

51
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,725
What's wrong with that?

52
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:06,855
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?

53
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:10,234
Bars, liquor stores...

54
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:14,029
gas stations; you get your head blown off
stickin' up one of them.

55
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:17,533
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

56
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:20,994
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

57
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:25,040
I bet you could cut down
on the hero factor in a place like this.

58
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,125
Correct.

59
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,461
Same as banks, these places are insured.

60
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,880
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

61
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,800
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

62
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,846
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

63
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:41,849
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

64
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,435
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

65
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,604
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

66
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:49,314
One minute,
they're havin' a Denver omelet...

67
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:52,359
the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

68
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:57,489
See, I got the idea the last liquor store
we stuck up, remember?

69
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:00,242
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:04,163
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

71
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,456
Thank you.

72
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,624
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

73
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,002
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

74
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,670
A lot of wallets.

75
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:13,756
Pretty smart, huh?

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,841
Pretty smart.

77
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,387
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

78
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:24,975
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

79
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,811
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

80
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,236
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

81
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,907
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

82
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,868
Any of you fucking pricks move...

83
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,747
and I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you.

84
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,569
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>

85
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,821
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get it on</i>

86
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:45,073
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>

87
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:47,367
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get it on</i>

88
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,703
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get up with the boogie</i>

89
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,872
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get up with the get down</i>

90
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,207
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Get down and boogie</i>

91
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,793
- <i>Jungle boogie</i>
- <i>Shake it around</i>

92
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,347
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

93
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,224
- Hash is legal there, right?
- Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

94
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:15,938
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

95
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,358
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

96
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,069
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

97
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:24,488
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

98
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,741
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

99
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:32,245
It's illegal to carry it, but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

100
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:36,750
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

101
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,169
I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.

102
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:42,881
Oh, man! I'm goin'.
That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

103
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,050
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

104
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,470
But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?

105
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,847
- What?
- It's the little differences.

106
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,183
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here...

107
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,269
- but it's just there, it's a little different.
- Example.

108
00:07:56,353 --> 00:08:00,023
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

109
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:03,735
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

110
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,697
And in Paris, you can buy a beer
in McDonald's.

111
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,201
You know what they call
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

112
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,453
They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

113
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:16,331
They got the metric system. They wouldn't
know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

114
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:20,293
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

115
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,295
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

116
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,839
What do they call a Big Mac?

117
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:27,217
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

118
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,885
Le Big Mac.

119
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,014
What do they call a Whopper?

120
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,516
I don't know. I didn't go
into Burger King.

121
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,227
You know what they put on french fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?

122
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,311
What?

123
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,231
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

124
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,942
I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.

125
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,610
Yuck.

126
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,199
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

127
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,330
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

128
00:08:57,414 --> 00:09:01,001
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

129
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,670
So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?

130
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:06,923
- It's possible.
- We should have fuckin' shotguns.

131
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,634
- What's her name?
- Mia.

132
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:13,889
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

133
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:17,559
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

134
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,145
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

135
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,898
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

136
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,649
Pilot? What's a pilot?

137
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,236
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,698
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television...

139
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,034
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

140
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:35,118
Yeah.

141
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:39,581
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

142
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:42,292
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

143
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,587
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.

144
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,300
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

145
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,470
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

146
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,306
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

147
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:00,227
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him “Tony Rocky Horror.”

148
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,770
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

149
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,688
I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

150
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:06,566
He got a weight problem. I mean, what's
a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

151
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,693
I think I know who you mean.
What about him?

152
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:11,071
Marsellus fucked him up good.

153
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:15,408
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

154
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:27,587
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

155
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:31,174
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

156
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,721
A foot massage?
That's it?

157
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,975
Then what'd Marsellus do?

158
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:43,228
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

159
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,232
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

160
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:51,361
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

161
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,697
Nigger fell through that.

162
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,700
Since then, he kind of developed
a speech impediment.

163
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,786
That's a damn shame.

164
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,670
But still, you play with matches,
you get burned.

165
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,255
What do you mean?

166
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:13,633
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

167
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,178
You don't think he overreacted?

168
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:21,141
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the
way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

169
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:25,353
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

170
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,982
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

171
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:33,945
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

172
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,530
Stop right there.

173
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:38,783
Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot
massage ain't even the same fucking thing.

174
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:42,787
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

175
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,790
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

176
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:49,628
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies...

177
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:53,965
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the
same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

178
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,928
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

179
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,515
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
I'm the foot fuckin' master.

180
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,100
You given a lot of them?

181
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:08,104
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

182
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,565
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

183
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,860
Fuck you.

184
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:18,114
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

185
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,909
You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.

186
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,870
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

187
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,874
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

188
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,671
What time you got?

189
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,966
7:22 in the am.

190
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:39,636
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

191
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,939
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right...

192
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:54,234
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off
a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...

193
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:57,028
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

194
00:12:57,112 --> 00:13:01,324
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

195
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:06,371
I ain't ea yin' it's right, but you ea yin' a foot
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm ea yin' it does.

196
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:11,084
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

197
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,879
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

198
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,048
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

199
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,343
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

200
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:25,473
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

201
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:29,936
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man
with a sense of humor about this shit.

202
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,646
You know what I'm ea yin'?

203
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,816
It's an interestin' point.

204
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,860
Come on. Let's get into character.

205
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,785
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

206
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,872
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

207
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:54,169
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

208
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:58,214
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

209
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:01,634
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

210
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:04,262
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

211
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,973
It is not a date.

212
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:11,144
It's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

213
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,438
It's just good company, that's all.

214
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:22,447
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

215
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:33,750
Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?

216
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,502
Hey, keep chillin'.

217
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,469
You know who we are?

218
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,516
We're associates of your business partner,
Marsellus Wallace.

219
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,602
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

220
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,065
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

221
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,321
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,156
I thought so.

223
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,868
You remember your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?

224
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:11,371
Yeah, I remember.

225
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:15,750
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

226
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,461
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?

227
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,505
Hamburgers.

228
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:24,676
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

229
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,095
What kind of hamburgers?

230
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,140
- Cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

231
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:33,309
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?

232
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:36,187
- Where?
- Big Kahuna Burger.

233
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:39,399
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

234
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:43,445
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

235
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,657
- They're good.
- You mind if I try one of yours?

236
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,369
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,674
This is a tasty burger! Vincent!

238
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,302
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?

239
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,806
- Want a bite? They're real tasty.
- I ain't hungry.

240
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,309
Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

241
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:18,229
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...

242
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:21,441
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

243
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,068
But I do love the taste
of a good burger.

244
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,740
You know what they call
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?

245
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,409
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

246
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:35,497
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

247
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,540
You know why they call it that?

248
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,212
Because of the metric system?

249
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,549
Check out the big brain on Brett!

250
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:50,011
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

251
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:54,432
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

252
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,850
Sprite. Good.

253
00:16:55,934 --> 00:17:00,396
You mind if I have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down with?

254
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:02,649
Go right ahead.

255
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,246
That hit the spot.

256
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:20,750
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

257
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:24,003
Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid at.

258
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:25,338
It's over-

259
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:29,050
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

260
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,514
You were ea yin'?

261
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,641
It's in the cupboard.

262
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,854
No, the one by your knees.

263
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:04,794
We happy?

264
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,505
Vincent?

265
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,301
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

266
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:17,640
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't get your name.

267
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:20,893
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
But I never got yours.

268
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:24,689
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't
talkin' your way outta this shit.

269
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,316
No, no, no.

270
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,236
I just want you to know how—

271
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:36,868
I just want you to know how sorry we are
that things got so fucked up...

272
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,120
with us and Mr. Wallace.

273
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:43,708
We got into this thing
with the best intentions. Really. I never—

274
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:47,170
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break
your concentration?

275
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,839
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

276
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:55,136
Continue. You were saying something
about “best intentions.”

277
00:18:56,512 --> 00:19:00,391
What's the matter? Oh, you were finished!

278
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:03,186
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

279
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,734
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?

280
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,028
What?

281
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,323
- What country you from?
- What?

282
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,201
“What” ain't no country I ever heard of.
They speak English in What?

283
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,661
What?

284
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,455
- English, Motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

285
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,207
- Then you know what I'm ea yin'!
- Yes.

286
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,710
Describe what
Marsellus Wallace looks like!

287
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,421
- What? I—
- Say “what” again!

288
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:34,425
Say “what” again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

289
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,388
- Say “what” one more goddamn time!
- He's black.

290
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:40,807
- Go on!
- He's bald!

291
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,601
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

292
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:49,357
Does he look... like a bitch?

293
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,441
No!

294
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,652
Then why you tr yin'
to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

295
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,364
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

296
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,616
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

297
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,955
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

298
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:07,083
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

299
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:11,713
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

300
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:14,132
Ezekiel 25:17.

301
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,510
“The path of the righteous man...

302
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:21,514
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

303
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,517
and the tyranny of evil men.

304
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,522
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill...

305
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,734
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

306
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,486
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

307
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,115
and the finder of lost children.

308
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:45,037
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger...

309
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:49,751
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers!

310
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,671
And you will know my name is the Lord...

311
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:57,133
when I lay my vengeance upon thee!”

312
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,072
I think you gonna find,
when all this shit is over and done—

313
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,953
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

314
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,874
The thing is, Butch...

315
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,295
right now... you got ability.

316
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:41,344
But painful as it may be,
ability... don't last.

317
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:45,932
And your days are just about over.

318
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,853
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

319
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,983
But that's a fact of life your ass is
gonna have to get realistic about.

320
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:03,366
You see, this business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers.

321
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,704
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

322
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:14,126
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

323
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:19,173
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

324
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,802
Besides, Butch...

325
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,640
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

326
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,270
Two?

327
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,774
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

328
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:41,571
You came close, but you never made it.

329
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,325
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

330
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,303
You my nigger?

331
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,518
Certainly appears so.

332
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:23,195
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

333
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:29,285
That's pride fuckin' with you.

334
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,955
Fuck pride!

335
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,959
Pride only hurts.

336
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,212
It never helps.

337
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:43,674
You fight through that shit.

338
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:50,056
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...

339
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:54,644
you gonna say to yourself,
“Marsellus Wallace was right.”

340
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,148
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

341
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:05,279
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

342
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,701
Say it.

343
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,790
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

344
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,420
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

345
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,967
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

346
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,302
Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?

347
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:29,887
You don't even want to know.

348
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,224
Where's the big man?

349
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,060
The big man's right over
there takin' care of some business.

350
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:40,773
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, just go on over.

351
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,736
How ya been?

352
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,905
I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

353
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,740
All right.

354
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,203
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

355
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,083
At Marsellus's request.

356
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,379
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

357
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:06,632
What's so fuckin' funny?

358
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:09,301
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

359
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:13,639
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?
It's the big man's wife.

360
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:16,392
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed...

361
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,436
laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

362
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:21,647
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

363
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:25,526
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for? Asshole.

364
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:35,786
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

365
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,288
No.

366
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:44,045
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

367
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,134
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

368
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,803
Vincent Vega's in the house?

369
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,848
My nigger, get your ass over here.

370
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:06,525
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

371
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:08,778
You shouldn't worry about it.

372
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,822
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

373
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,868
And some matches.

374
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,207
Thanks.

375
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:27,880
It's as if it turns every part of
your body into the tip of a penis.

376
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,258
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

377
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:36,347
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't
use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

378
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,267
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

379
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:45,231
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

380
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:48,776
Five in each ear, one through the nipple
of my left breast...

381
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,987
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow...

382
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,907
one in my belly, one in my lip,
one in my clit...

383
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,452
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

384
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,454
I was just curious...

385
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:04,416
but... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

386
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,962
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

387
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,549
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

388
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,851
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

389
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:25,354
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

390
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,357
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

391
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,862
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

392
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,906
But this one is a little more expensive.

393
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,367
This is 500 a gram.

394
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,829
But, when you shoot it,
you will know where that extra money went.

395
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:46,000
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

396
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,669
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

397
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,590
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

398
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,676
Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No.

399
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,929
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

400
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,974
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

401
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,436
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

402
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,814
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

403
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:12,735
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

404
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:16,822
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

405
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:19,742
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

406
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:25,497
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

407
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,001
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

408
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,837
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya...

409
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:36,091
but I'm givin' you
some out of my own private stash.

410
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,093
That is what a nice guy I am.

411
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:43,515
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

412
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,559
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

413
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:50,564
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and twistix from the kitchen?

414
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:52,233
Okay.

415
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:55,694
Hey, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

416
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:59,573
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

417
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:03,827
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

418
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,788
That's my wife.

419
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,001
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

420
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:14,672
- No, I can't. I gotta be some place.
- All right, no <i>problemo.</i>

421
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,507
I'll take a rain check.

422
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,136
Thank you, Jody.

423
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,389
Still got your Malibu?

424
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,685
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

425
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,687
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

426
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,357
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

427
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,110
I had it in storage for three years.

428
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:40,531
It was out five days, and some dickless
piece of shit fucked with it.

429
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:45,035
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

430
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,832
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd
have given anything to catch that asshole.

431
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,918
It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.

432
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:54,628
What a fucker!

433
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:57,506
What's more chicken-shit than
fuckin' with a man's automobile?

434
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:00,467
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

435
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,928
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

436
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:04,513
Thank you.

437
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,058
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi <i>casa es su casa.</i>

438
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:58,460
<i>Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open.</i>

439
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,755
<i>Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.</i>

440
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,975
Hello?

441
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,686
<i>Billy Raye was a preacher's son</i>

442
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,188
<i>And when his daddy would visit
he'd come along</i>

443
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,441
Vincent.

444
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,945
<i>Vincent.</i>

445
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,947
<i>I'm on the intercom.</i>

446
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,658
Where is— Where is the intercom?

447
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:33,078
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

448
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:35,247
<i>To your right.</i>

449
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,501
<i>Warm.</i>

450
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:41,962
<i>Warmer.</i>

451
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,715
<i>Disco.</i>

452
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,133
Hello?

453
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,803
<i>Push the button if you want to talk.</i>

454
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,931
Hello?

455
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,852
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down
in two shakes of a Iamb's tail.

456
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,521
<i>The bar's by the fireplace.</i>

457
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,233
Okay.

458
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,737
<i>When he started
sweet talkin' to me</i>

459
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,406
<i>He come and tell me
everything is all right</i>

460
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,284
<i>He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right</i>

461
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,286
<i>Can I get away again tonight</i>

462
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,997
<i>The only one
who could ever reach me</i>

463
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,666
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

464
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,794
<i>The only boy
who could ever teach me</i>

465
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:25,839
<i>Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was</i>

466
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:28,217
<i>He was</i>

467
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,928
- <i>Lord he knows he was</i>
- <i>Yes, he was</i>

468
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,974
<i>How well I remember</i>

469
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,810
<i>The look that was in his eyes</i>

470
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,355
<i>Stealing kisses from me
on the sly</i>

471
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,024
<i>Taking time to make time</i>

472
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,610
<i>Telling me that he's all mine</i>

473
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,695
<i>Learning from each other's knowin'</i>

474
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,031
<i>Looking to see
how much we've grown</i>

475
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:54,326
<i>And the only one
who could ever reach me</i>

476
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,662
<i>Was the son of a preacher man</i>

477
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,665
<i>The only boy
who could ever teach me</i>

478
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,125
<i>Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was</i>

479
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,003
- <i>Was, was</i>
- <i>He was</i>

480
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,130
<i>Oh, yes, he was</i>

481
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,591
Let's go.

482
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,224
What the fuck is this place?

483
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,643
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

484
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,938
An Elvis man should love it.

485
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:27,484
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, Daddy-O.

486
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,111
Don't be a—

487
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,698
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

488
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:57,055
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

489
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,725
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

490
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,936
We reserved a car.

491
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,065
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

492
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,987
<i>School gal, baby
gonna tell you some news</i>

493
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,239
<i>Sure do look good
in them baby-doll shoes</i>

494
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:19,077
<i>It's one, two, buckle the shoes
three, four, get out on the floor</i>

495
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:24,082
<i>Five, six, come get your kicks down at
the corner of Lincoln and 46th, yeah</i>

496
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,296
<i>All right</i>

497
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,801
<i>I've been waitin' in school
all daylong</i>

498
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,970
<i>Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home</i>

499
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,556
<i>Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone</i>

500
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,641
<i>Come on, baby</i>

501
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,225
- Coffee, please? Decaf.
- Just a minute.

502
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,102
<i>Heading down to the drugstore
to get a soda pop</i>

503
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,521
<i>Throw a nickel in the jukebox
then we start to rock</i>

504
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,649
<i>School gal baby
gonna tell you some news</i>

505
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,776
<i>You sure do look good
in them baby-doll shoes</i>

506
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,528
<i>Well, it's one, two
buckle the shoes</i>

507
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,947
<i>Three, four
get out on the floor</i>

508
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:59,910
<i>Five, six, come get your kicks down
at the corner of Lincoln and 46th</i>

509
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,751
<i>Gonna rock all night
just wait and see</i>

510
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,879
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

511
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:16,259
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

512
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,053
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

513
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,721
Vincent!

514
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,978
Just to let you all know, Ricky will be
back in the second half of our show...

515
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:31,650
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

516
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,318
Thank you.

517
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:36,405
Call for...

518
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:40,492
Phil-lip Mor-ris.

519
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,285
What do you think?

520
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:46,498
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

521
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,542
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?

522
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:57,843
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah,
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

523
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,428
I'll have that.

524
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,180
How do you want that cooked?
Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?

525
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:05,434
Bloody as hell, and—
Oh, yeah, look at this— vanilla coke.

526
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:08,937
What about you, Peggy Sue?

527
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,819
I'll have the...
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

528
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,699
And... a five-dollar shake.

529
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,493
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

530
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:27,748
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

531
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:34,004
- That's a shake? That's milk and ice cream?
- Last I heard.

532
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,549
That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

533
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,968
- No.
- Just checking.

534
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,720
I'll be right back with your drinks.

535
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,014
<i>To lonesome town</i>

536
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:48,810
<i>To cry my troubles away</i>

537
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:54,483
Could you...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

538
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,402
You can have this one, cowgirl.

539
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,528
Thanks.

540
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,865
<i>The streets are filled with regret</i>

541
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,619
Think nothin' of it.

542
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:10,081
<i>Lay me down
in lonesome town</i>

543
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,668
- <i>I can learn to forget</i>
- So...

544
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,838
Marsellus said you just
got back from Amsterdam.

545
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,050
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

546
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,677
Just over three years.

547
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,016
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

548
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:31,311
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

549
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,856
Why would you?

550
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:41,029
I heard you did a pilot.

551
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,783
That was my 15 minutes.

552
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,409
What was it?

553
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:51,164
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force <i>Five.</i>

554
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,959
- What?
- <i>Fox Force Five.</i>

555
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,294
Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.

556
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,839
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

557
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,675
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

558
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:05,470
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

559
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,640
The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.

560
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:12,811
The black girl was a demolition expert.

561
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,730
French Fox's specialty was sex.

562
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,399
What was your specialty?

563
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,568
Knives.

564
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,279
The character I played, Raven McCoy...

565
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:26,199
her background was she grew up raised
by circus performers.

566
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:30,537
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

567
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,373
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

568
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:37,586
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

569
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,964
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

570
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,926
where every show
I would've told another joke.

571
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,889
You know any of them old jokes?

572
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:52,684
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

573
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,312
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

574
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,315
Don't be that way. Tell me.

575
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,942
No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

576
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:06,072
You'd be embarr— You told 50 million
people, and you can't tell me?

577
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:10,035
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

578
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,412
That's not what I meant. You know it.

579
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:15,916
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

580
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,709
What a gyp.

581
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,130
Martin and Lewis.

582
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,593
Vanilla coke.

583
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:35,268
Yummy.

584
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,312
You think I could have a sip of that?

585
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,025
Be my guest.

586
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,736
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

587
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,239
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

588
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,117
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties I can handle.

589
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,162
All right.

590
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:04,506
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake!

591
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:05,590
Told ya.

592
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,677
I don't know if it was worth five dollars,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

593
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:45,380
Don't you hate that?

594
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,132
Hate what?

595
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,551
Uncomfortable silences.

596
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:56,057
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

597
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,352
I don't know. That's a good question.

598
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:03,898
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

599
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:09,654
When you can just shut the fuck up
for a minute and comfortably share silence.

600
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:13,408
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

601
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,953
I'll tell you what.

602
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:21,791
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

603
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,086
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

604
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:27,714
I'll do that.

605
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,552
Okay.

606
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,954
I said goddamn!

607
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,208
Goddamn! Goddamn.

608
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:07,420
I need some hair spray.

609
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:18,556
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom...

610
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,642
to find your food waiting for you?

611
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:22,936
We're lucky we got anything at all.

612
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:25,396
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

613
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:28,525
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

614
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:31,653
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

615
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,696
That is Marilyn Monroe.

616
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,867
That is Mamie Van Doren.

617
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:42,872
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

618
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,376
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

619
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,253
So did you think of somethin' to say?

620
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,338
Actually, I did.

621
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:53,925
However...

622
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,139
you seem like a really nice person, and I—

623
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,723
I don't want to offend you.

624
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:07,313
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,
boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

625
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,816
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

626
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:12,360
Well, well, I do. I do.

627
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:17,448
- But you have to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

628
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:21,619
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

629
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:23,580
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...

630
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:26,124
and my natural response could be
to get offended.

631
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,127
Then through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

632
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,880
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

633
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:36,009
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

634
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,303
- Is that a fact?
- And besides...

635
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:41,806
isn't it more exciting
when you don't have permission?

636
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,391
All right, all right.

637
00:44:43,474 --> 00:44:45,393
Well, here goes.

638
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:49,355
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

639
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,859
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

640
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:54,444
He fell out of a window.

641
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:58,114
Well, that is one way to say it.

642
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,950
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

643
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:04,162
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

644
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,830
Yet, even another way...

645
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:09,375
is to say he was thrown out of
a window by Marsellus because of you.

646
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,878
- Is that a fact?
- No.

647
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:15,089
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.
That's just what I heard.

648
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:17,675
- Who told you?
- They.

649
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:20,595
“They” talk a lot, don't they?

650
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:25,433
They certainly do. They certainly do.

651
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:27,518
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did “they” say?

652
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:29,270
I'm not shy.

653
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:32,523
Did it involve the “F” word?

654
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:36,611
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

655
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:41,366
- And?
- And nothin'. That's it.

656
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:48,039
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window...

657
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,708
for giving me a foot massage?

658
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,293
And you believe that?

659
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,881
Well, at the time I was told
it sounded reasonable.

660
00:45:56,965 --> 00:46:00,051
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

661
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:02,512
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?

662
00:46:02,595 --> 00:46:05,932
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

663
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:09,477
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

664
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,148
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

665
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:17,986
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

666
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:20,071
But did it happen?

667
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:25,576
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

668
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:27,996
Really?

669
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,582
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw
Tony out that window...

670
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,543
except Marsellus and Tony.

671
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:37,839
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

672
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:42,468
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

673
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:47,181
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

674
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:54,314
Now, this is where one lucky couple...

675
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:58,860
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

676
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:02,488
Now, who will be our first contestants?

677
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,866
- Right here!
- All right!

678
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,952
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,749
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss...

680
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:15,752
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

681
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:20,006
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

682
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:22,675
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

683
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:24,594
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

684
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,810
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening.

685
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:35,480
Young lady, what is your name?

686
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:37,648
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

687
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:40,360
And how 'bout your fella here?

688
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,153
Vincent Vega.

689
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:45,782
All right, let's see what
you can do. Take it away!

690
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:48,117
- Go for it.
- Come on!

691
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:11,057
<i>It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well</i>

692
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:17,021
<i>You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle</i>

693
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:23,194
<i>And now the young monsieur and madame
have rung the chapel bell</i>

694
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:29,450
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell</i>

695
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:35,498
<i>They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale</i>

696
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:41,671
<i>The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale</i>

697
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:47,468
<i>But when Pierre found work
the little money comin' worked out well</i>

698
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:53,808
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell</i>

699
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:59,897
<i>They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast</i>

700
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:06,195
<i>Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz</i>

701
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:12,034
<i>But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell</i>

702
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:19,000
<i>C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell</i>

703
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:48,738
<i>They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well</i>

704
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,744
<i>You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle</i>

705
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:33,157
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

706
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:35,535
I don't know what you call that.

707
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:39,288
Drinks! Music!

708
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:41,832
I'm gonna take a piss.

709
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:47,588
That's a little bit more information than
I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.

710
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,520
<i>Girl</i>

711
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,272
<i>Bomp, bomp, bom</i>

712
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:08,067
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

713
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:13,698
<i>I love you so much
Can't count all the ways</i>

714
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:16,742
<i>I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is</i>

715
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:18,828
<i>He's not your kind</i>

716
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:25,209
<i>You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around</i>

717
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,753
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

718
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:30,840
<i>Don't let them
make up your mind</i>

719
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:34,385
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

720
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:39,890
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

721
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,893
One drink, and that's it.

722
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:46,981
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

723
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,985
Say good night... and go home.

724
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:57,533
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

725
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:00,828
<i>Soon</i>

726
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:05,333
<i>You'll need a man</i>

727
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:08,919
<i>I've been misunderstood
for all of my life</i>

728
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:12,214
<i>But what they're n', girl
it cuts like a knife</i>

729
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:13,799
<i>The boy's no good</i>

730
00:52:14,717 --> 00:52:17,428
<i>Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for</i>

731
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:20,306
<i>But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure</i>

732
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,891
<i>Sure they would</i>

733
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:24,685
<i>Baby, I've done all I could</i>

734
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:29,398
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

735
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:32,735
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

736
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:36,113
Because... being loyal is very important.

737
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:40,785
<i>You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around</i>

738
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:43,454
<i>What I'm gonna find</i>

739
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:47,500
<i>Don't let them
make up your mind</i>

740
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,419
<i>Don't you know, girl</i>

741
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:55,883
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

742
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,345
<i>Please</i>

743
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,724
<i>Come take my hand</i>

744
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:07,770
<i>Girl</i>

745
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:13,067
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

746
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:16,404
<i>Please</i>

747
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:20,616
<i>Come take my hand</i>

748
00:53:22,326 --> 00:53:24,245
- Hello.
- <i>Girl</i>

749
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:28,749
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say...

750
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,127
“Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening.”

751
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,550
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,
jerk off and that's all you gonna do.

752
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:45,266
<i>Now it's up to you, girl</i>

753
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:50,980
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

754
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:53,566
<i>Please</i>

755
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:58,279
<i>Come take my hand</i>

756
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:02,199
<i>Girl</i>

757
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:07,913
<i>You'll be a woman soon</i>

758
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:11,584
<i>Soon</i>

759
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:15,963
<i>You'll need a man</i>

760
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,891
All right, Mia.

761
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:30,811
So listen, I gotta go, all right?

762
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:37,276
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

763
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,070
You fu— Oh, Jesus Christ!

764
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:42,448
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!

765
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:46,410
Oh— Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta
here. We gotta walk now.

766
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:00,007
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

767
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:02,551
Fuck!

768
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:11,268
Answer.

769
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:13,771
<i>Have you got the ring?</i>

770
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:17,691
- <i>Why, certainly.</i>
- <i>join hands, you two lovebirds.</i>

771
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:20,152
<i>Please! Please!</i>

772
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,905
<i>Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.</i>

773
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,372
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

774
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:38,337
<i>Now what do you say?</i>

775
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,172
<i>I give up! I'll marry you!</i>

776
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:46,095
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

777
00:55:47,805 --> 00:55:49,473
I can hear it.

778
00:55:49,557 --> 00:55:52,726
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes
never to call here this late!

779
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,311
Yeah, I told them.

780
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:57,648
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell
this fucking asshole right now.

781
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,945
- <i>Don't you dare strike me!</i>
- Hello.

782
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:05,322
Lance! Vincent.

783
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:08,284
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

784
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,454
Hold your horses, man.
What's the problem?

785
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:15,791
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' Odin' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

786
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,835
I'm not even joking with you!

787
00:56:17,918 --> 00:56:20,212
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

788
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:22,339
- No choice.
- She's Odin'?

789
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:25,634
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
<i>- just dandy.</i>

790
00:56:25,718 --> 00:56:29,889
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

791
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:32,391
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

792
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:35,185
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

793
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:39,106
Are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

794
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:41,609
I don't know you. Who is this?
Don't come here!

795
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:43,861
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

796
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:56,040
What the hell was that?

797
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,712
Have you lost your fucking mind? You were
talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!

798
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:03,422
Lance, help me.

799
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:05,925
- You crashed your car into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

800
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:09,929
Are you deaf? You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

801
00:57:10,012 --> 00:57:12,431
This “fucked-up bitch” is
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

802
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,558
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

803
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:17,436
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

804
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:23,108
I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and let her die on your lawn.

805
00:57:23,192 --> 00:57:25,653
Now, come on,
help me, help me. Pick her up.

806
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,656
Shit.

807
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,576
Lance!

808
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:35,079
Shit.

809
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:38,082
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

810
00:57:38,165 --> 00:57:40,250
What the fuck's going on out here?

811
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,462
Who's she?

812
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:46,465
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenaline shot.

813
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:48,592
- What's wrong with her?
- She's ODing!

814
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:50,761
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

815
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:54,348
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

816
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,975
Just keep talking to her, all right?

817
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:58,852
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go
get my little black medical book.

818
00:57:58,936 --> 00:58:00,938
What the fuck you need a medical book for?

819
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:03,440
I've never had to give
an adrenaline shot before!

820
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:06,944
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

821
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:09,446
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

822
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,949
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

823
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,951
- Get the shot!
- All right!

824
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:21,125
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

825
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,668
What's he looking for?

826
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:26,046
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

827
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,549
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

828
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:33,220
My little black medical book!
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

829
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:36,223
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

830
00:58:36,306 --> 00:58:38,600
If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot?

831
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:40,269
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!

832
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:42,980
While you're looking, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet.

833
00:58:43,063 --> 00:58:44,732
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

834
00:58:44,815 --> 00:58:46,984
I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!

835
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,194
Lance, get in here!

836
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:51,780
- Right?
- Get the fuck outta my way.

837
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:53,490
Pig.

838
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:55,743
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.

839
00:58:55,826 --> 00:58:58,912
While I'm doing this,
you take off her shirt and find her heart.

840
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,999
- Does it gotta be exact?
- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.

841
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:04,293
We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

842
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:06,545
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's right here.

843
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:08,130
- That's it.
- This it?

844
00:59:08,213 --> 00:59:10,799
All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

845
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:12,801
- You got it?
- What?

846
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:15,554
A magic marker. A felt pen!

847
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,265
A fuckin' black magic marker! Christ.

848
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:23,437
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

849
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:29,068
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

850
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,071
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

851
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:34,073
I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.

852
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:36,116
I never done this either!
I ain't starting now!

853
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,035
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

854
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:40,621
The day I bring an ODing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

855
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:43,624
- Give her the shot.
- Give it to me. Give me that.

856
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,627
All right, tell me what to do.

857
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,214
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.

858
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:52,674
But she's got a breastplate—
you gotta pierce through that.

859
00:59:52,758 --> 00:59:55,719
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

860
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:59,223
- I gotta stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

861
00:59:59,306 --> 01:00:02,726
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

862
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,729
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

863
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:08,273
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

864
01:00:08,357 --> 01:00:11,276
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

865
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,237
She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's—

866
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,780
All right, count to three.

867
01:00:14,863 --> 01:00:17,032
- All right. Ready?
- One.

868
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:23,872
Two.

869
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,173
Three!

870
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:51,692
If you're all right, then say something.

871
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:54,278
Something.

872
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,114
That was fuckin' trippy.

873
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:01,702
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

874
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:29,313
Mia. Mia.

875
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:32,900
What's—

876
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:38,405
What's your thoughts on— on—
on how to handle this?

877
01:01:39,364 --> 01:01:40,908
What's yours?

878
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:48,248
Well, I'm of the opinion that
if Marsellus lived his whole life...

879
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:50,792
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

880
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:56,965
If Marsellus knew about this incident,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

881
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:58,926
I seriously doubt that.

882
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:02,262
I can keep a secret if you can.

883
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:06,099
Shake on it?

884
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:14,024
Mum's the word?

885
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:16,068
Cool.

886
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:19,446
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to
go home and have a heart attack.

887
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:24,117
Vincent.

888
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:29,998
Do you wanna hear my Fox <i>Force Five</i> joke?

889
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:32,292
Sure.

890
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:36,088
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

891
01:02:36,171 --> 01:02:39,091
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

892
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:41,510
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

893
01:02:42,302 --> 01:02:44,805
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

894
01:02:44,888 --> 01:02:47,224
Three tomatoes are
walkin' down the street.

895
01:02:47,307 --> 01:02:49,726
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

896
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:54,439
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

897
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:58,568
Goes back and squishes him and says,
“Ketchup.”

898
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:03,907
Ketchup.

899
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:10,163
See you around.

900
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:35,439
<i>Oh, that paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.</i>

901
01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:38,525
<i>He think totem pole alive!</i>

902
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,320
<i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>

903
01:03:43,071 --> 01:03:45,449
<i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>

904
01:03:45,532 --> 01:03:46,992
Butch?

905
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:49,911
<i>One more thing, and we'll start for—</i>

906
01:03:49,995 --> 01:03:52,914
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

907
01:03:52,998 --> 01:03:56,626
- You've got a special visitor.
- <i>Stand up. Stand up.</i>

908
01:03:58,795 --> 01:04:03,091
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a POW camp?

909
01:04:04,384 --> 01:04:08,138
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

910
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:10,349
He was in the POW camp with Daddy.

911
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:21,568
Hello, little man.
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

912
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:25,072
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

913
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:30,535
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell
together, over five years.

914
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:32,954
Hopefully...

915
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:36,249
you'll never have to
experience this yourself...

916
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:40,003
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

917
01:04:40,087 --> 01:04:42,881
for as long as we were...

918
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:45,884
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

919
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,970
If it'd been me who'd—

920
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:56,937
not made it, Major Coolidge'd
be talking right now to my son Jim.

921
01:04:57,813 --> 01:05:00,607
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

922
01:05:02,025 --> 01:05:03,443
Butch...

923
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:07,030
I got something for ya.

924
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:16,039
This watch I got here...

925
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:20,877
was first purchased by your
great-grandfather during the First World War.

926
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:25,382
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

927
01:05:25,465 --> 01:05:29,261
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

928
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:32,097
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

929
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:35,517
It was bought by
Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

930
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,395
on the day he set sail for Paris.

931
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:40,772
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch...

932
01:05:40,856 --> 01:05:44,443
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

933
01:05:44,526 --> 01:05:48,071
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother...

934
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:52,576
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

935
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:56,872
until your grandad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

936
01:05:56,955 --> 01:06:00,876
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

937
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:03,044
This time they called it World War II.

938
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:08,508
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your grandad for good luck.

939
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:12,554
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.

940
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:15,557
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...

941
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,351
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

942
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:21,688
Your grandad was facing death.

943
01:06:22,731 --> 01:06:24,441
He knew it.

944
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:28,653
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive...

945
01:06:28,737 --> 01:06:31,948
so three days before
the Japanese took the island...

946
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:37,245
your grandad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki—

947
01:06:37,329 --> 01:06:40,248
a man he'd never met before in his life—

948
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:43,293
to deliver to his infant son...

949
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:47,964
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

950
01:06:48,048 --> 01:06:52,385
Three days later, your grandad was dead,
but Winocki kept his word.

951
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:56,681
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother...

952
01:06:56,765 --> 01:07:01,019
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

953
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:03,021
This watch.

954
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:14,324
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

955
01:07:14,407 --> 01:07:17,827
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

956
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:21,957
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...

957
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,834
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

958
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:29,339
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

959
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:33,134
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...

960
01:07:33,218 --> 01:07:37,347
so he hid it in one place
he knew he could hide something— his ass.

961
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,850
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

962
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:45,105
Then he died of dysentery—
He give me the watch.

963
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:49,025
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

964
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:51,027
<i>Then...</i>

965
01:07:51,111 --> 01:07:55,198
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

966
01:07:55,282 --> 01:07:56,700
now...

967
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:02,581
little man, I give the watch to you.

968
01:08:25,437 --> 01:08:27,355
It's time, Butch.

969
01:08:35,113 --> 01:08:38,033
<i>In the lightweight division...</i>

970
01:08:38,116 --> 01:08:41,244
<i>in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks...</i>

971
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:44,581
<i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>

972
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:47,834
<i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>

973
01:08:50,879 --> 01:08:53,381
<i>It's official. It's official.
Wilson is dead!</i>

974
01:08:53,465 --> 01:08:55,300
<i>Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...</i>

975
01:08:55,383 --> 01:08:57,802
<i>and hands down, the most brutal
fight this city's ever seen.</i>

976
01:08:57,886 --> 01:09:01,222
<i>Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.</i>

977
01:09:01,306 --> 01:09:03,975
- <i>Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?</i>
- <i>My guess would be yes.</i>

978
01:09:04,059 --> 01:09:08,480
<i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way
to the realization of what he was doing.</i>

979
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:10,440
<i>I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.</i>

980
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:13,485
<i>Do you feel this tragedy
is gonna affect the world of boxing?</i>

981
01:09:13,568 --> 01:09:17,489
<i>A tragedy like this can't help but shake
the world of boxing to its very foundations.</i>

982
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:21,451
<i>It's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain—</i>

983
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:59,155
Man, you know I didn't—

984
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:02,158
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

985
01:10:02,242 --> 01:10:04,160
I didn't do it.

986
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:06,746
- How you doing?
- Great.

987
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,748
I never thanked you for dinner.

988
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,086
- What you got?
- He booked.

989
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:16,506
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

990
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:19,759
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna think.

991
01:10:19,843 --> 01:10:23,430
We wanna know. Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

992
01:10:23,513 --> 01:10:26,349
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

993
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:28,226
Butch's search— how do you want it done?

994
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:31,604
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

995
01:10:31,688 --> 01:10:34,941
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

996
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:39,779
- ready to pop a cap in his ass.
- I will take care of it.

997
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:50,999
Mister.

998
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:57,380
- Hey, mister.
- What?

999
01:10:57,464 --> 01:11:02,260
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

1000
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:05,805
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

1001
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:08,600
No, come on.

1002
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:10,643
You're him.

1003
01:11:10,727 --> 01:11:13,146
I know you're him.

1004
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:16,775
Tell me you're him.

1005
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:18,777
I'm him.

1006
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:21,988
You killed the other boxing man.

1007
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,036
He's dead?

1008
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:30,538
The radio said he was dead.

1009
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,543
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1010
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:39,339
What does it feel like?

1011
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:41,341
What does what feel like?

1012
01:11:41,424 --> 01:11:42,926
Killing a man.

1013
01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:49,182
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1014
01:11:49,766 --> 01:11:51,351
What are you, a weirdo?

1015
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:56,022
No. It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1016
01:11:58,274 --> 01:12:01,945
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

1017
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:06,157
So?

1018
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,994
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1019
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:13,206
I'll tell you what.

1020
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:16,751
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up
there and I'll tell you all about it.

1021
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:38,481
So, Esmarelda...

1022
01:12:39,816 --> 01:12:43,194
Villa Lobos— is that Mexican?

1023
01:12:43,278 --> 01:12:46,489
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

1024
01:12:46,573 --> 01:12:49,826
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

1025
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:51,870
And what is your name?

1026
01:12:51,953 --> 01:12:53,621
Butch.

1027
01:12:54,289 --> 01:12:55,498
Butch.

1028
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:57,584
What does it mean?

1029
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,169
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1030
01:13:01,588 --> 01:13:05,717
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda...

1031
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,094
what is it you want to know?

1032
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:13,057
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1033
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:21,649
I didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1034
01:13:23,443 --> 01:13:26,279
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1035
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:34,287
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1036
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:47,967
What the fuck'd I tell ya?

1037
01:13:48,676 --> 01:13:52,597
As soon as the word got out the fix was
in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1038
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,891
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1039
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:58,394
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better
boxer, he'd still be alive.

1040
01:13:58,478 --> 01:13:59,938
If he never laced up his gloves...

1041
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:02,899
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1042
01:14:04,484 --> 01:14:08,571
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1043
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:11,324
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1044
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:14,077
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1045
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,330
How many bookies did you lay it around on?

1046
01:14:18,414 --> 01:14:20,959
All eight? How long to collect?

1047
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:25,421
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand.

1048
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:28,633
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1049
01:14:28,716 --> 01:14:30,927
That is great news, man.

1050
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,430
Yeah. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1051
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:38,559
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1052
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:40,353
Okay, my brother.

1053
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:43,982
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1054
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:48,569
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1055
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:50,154
Cool, brother.

1056
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,047
$45.60.

1057
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:16,848
And... here's a little something
for the effort.

1058
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:21,477
Now... if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1059
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:22,979
The truth.

1060
01:15:23,062 --> 01:15:26,858
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1061
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:31,320
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1062
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:33,948
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Butch.

1063
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:46,961
Whew.

1064
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:50,339
Keep the light off.

1065
01:15:50,423 --> 01:15:53,384
- Is that better, sugar pop?
- Owl

1066
01:15:57,847 --> 01:15:59,766
Hard day at the office?

1067
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:01,768
Pretty hard.

1068
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:03,478
Got in a fight.

1069
01:16:04,145 --> 01:16:06,314
Poor baby.

1070
01:16:06,397 --> 01:16:08,941
Can you make spoons?

1071
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:11,110
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1072
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:14,947
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1073
01:16:16,032 --> 01:16:17,950
Let me take this jacket off.

1074
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:24,165
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1075
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:26,167
I wish I had a pot.

1076
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,963
You were looking at yourself in the mirror
and you wish you had some pot?

1077
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:34,092
A pot. A pot belly.

1078
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:37,095
Pot bellies are sexy.

1079
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:39,472
Well, you should be happy...

1080
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:41,891
'cause you have one.

1081
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:45,019
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1082
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:48,940
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did “Lucky Star.”

1083
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,733
It's not the same thing.

1084
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:53,945
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1085
01:16:54,028 --> 01:16:55,947
The difference is huge.

1086
01:16:58,032 --> 01:17:00,451
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1087
01:17:00,535 --> 01:17:02,203
No.

1088
01:17:02,286 --> 01:17:06,624
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1089
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:10,128
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1090
01:17:10,211 --> 01:17:15,633
The rest of you is normal— normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass—

1091
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:19,762
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1092
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:24,559
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1093
01:17:24,642 --> 01:17:27,270
You think men would find that attractive?

1094
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:30,523
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1095
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:34,068
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1096
01:17:34,152 --> 01:17:36,070
is seldom the same.

1097
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:43,077
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1098
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:46,080
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1099
01:17:46,164 --> 01:17:48,082
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1100
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:52,086
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1101
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,088
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1102
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:56,090
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1103
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,606
Did you get everything?

1104
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:14,650
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, sugar pop.

1105
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:16,652
Did everything go as planned?

1106
01:18:16,736 --> 01:18:19,488
You didn't listen to the— Ow!

1107
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:21,449
You didn't listen to the radio?

1108
01:18:21,532 --> 01:18:24,827
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1109
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:27,205
I won, all right.

1110
01:18:27,288 --> 01:18:30,249
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1111
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,710
So it all worked out in the finish.

1112
01:18:34,128 --> 01:18:35,922
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1113
01:18:45,514 --> 01:18:47,934
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1114
01:18:49,936 --> 01:18:52,396
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

1115
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:56,901
But they won't find us, will they?

1116
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,990
Do you still want me to go with you?

1117
01:19:05,284 --> 01:19:08,955
I don't want to be
a burden or a nuisance. It's—

1118
01:19:15,586 --> 01:19:17,088
Say it.

1119
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:22,677
Fabienne,
I want you to be with me.

1120
01:19:23,886 --> 01:19:26,889
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1121
01:19:29,016 --> 01:19:30,977
Do you love me?

1122
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,062
Very, very much.

1123
01:19:38,776 --> 01:19:41,320
- Butch.
- Yes?

1124
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,366
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1125
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:48,828
Will you kiss it?

1126
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:52,915
But you first.

1127
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,334
- Okay.
- Okay.

1128
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:07,305
Butch.

1129
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:29,827
I think I cracked a rib.

1130
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:33,331
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1131
01:20:33,414 --> 01:20:36,834
- Don't call me retard.
- My name is Fabby.

1132
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:39,420
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1133
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:41,005
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi—

1134
01:20:41,088 --> 01:20:44,425
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1135
01:20:44,508 --> 01:20:47,595
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1136
01:20:47,678 --> 01:20:49,597
I take it back.

1137
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,519
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1138
01:20:55,603 --> 01:20:59,523
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1139
01:20:59,607 --> 01:21:02,026
Tulip is much better than mongoloid.

1140
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:05,029
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1141
01:21:05,112 --> 01:21:07,239
And I took it back.

1142
01:21:07,323 --> 01:21:09,408
Butch?

1143
01:21:09,492 --> 01:21:11,410
Yes, lemon pie?

1144
01:21:11,494 --> 01:21:14,914
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1145
01:21:14,997 --> 01:21:17,124
Wherever you want.

1146
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,126
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this...

1147
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:21,379
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...

1148
01:21:21,462 --> 01:21:24,799
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1149
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:29,637
I was thinking maybe we could go down
some place in the South Pacific.

1150
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:33,140
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1151
01:21:33,224 --> 01:21:36,143
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1152
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:39,647
And if after a while you didn't dig that,
we could go some place else.

1153
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:42,149
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1154
01:21:42,233 --> 01:21:44,151
But I do not speak Spanish.

1155
01:21:44,235 --> 01:21:47,196
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1156
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:48,906
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1157
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,245
- What does that mean?
- Where is the shoe store?

1158
01:21:55,246 --> 01:21:56,414
Spit, please.

1159
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:01,585
Excellent pronunciation.

1160
01:22:03,754 --> 01:22:06,006
You'll be my little <i>mamacita</i> in no time.

1161
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:11,887
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1162
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:13,472
Time for bed.

1163
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,600
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1164
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:25,734
Butch?

1165
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:33,576
Never mind.

1166
01:22:43,752 --> 01:22:47,840
<i>Merde!</i> You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1167
01:22:58,267 --> 01:23:00,019
What is this you're watching?

1168
01:23:01,103 --> 01:23:04,523
A motorcycle movie.
I'm not sure the name.

1169
01:23:06,442 --> 01:23:09,528
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1170
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:14,742
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1171
01:23:17,995 --> 01:23:19,455
What was it about?

1172
01:23:19,538 --> 01:23:22,708
How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1173
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:26,795
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1174
01:23:26,879 --> 01:23:28,797
I don't remember.

1175
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:31,759
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1176
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:34,136
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1177
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:39,600
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1178
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:41,393
One more kiss and I'll get up.

1179
01:23:44,688 --> 01:23:47,816
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1180
01:23:49,026 --> 01:23:52,029
Get up, lazy bones!

1181
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:54,573
God.

1182
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:59,370
- What time is it?
- Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1183
01:23:59,453 --> 01:24:03,207
- What time does our train arrive?
- 11:00.

1184
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:06,585
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
- What, lemon pie?

1185
01:24:07,753 --> 01:24:13,842
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...

1186
01:24:13,926 --> 01:24:17,346
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1187
01:24:17,429 --> 01:24:19,640
Anything to drink with that?

1188
01:24:19,723 --> 01:24:22,101
Wow, that looks nice.

1189
01:24:23,435 --> 01:24:29,275
To drink— a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1190
01:24:29,358 --> 01:24:33,904
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1191
01:24:33,988 --> 01:24:37,283
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1192
01:24:37,992 --> 01:24:40,452
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1193
01:24:40,536 --> 01:24:43,998
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1194
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:46,000
Where's my watch?

1195
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:52,715
It's there.

1196
01:24:52,798 --> 01:24:55,926
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1197
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:58,762
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1198
01:24:59,805 --> 01:25:01,932
You sure you got it?

1199
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:04,310
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1200
01:25:04,393 --> 01:25:07,521
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1201
01:25:07,605 --> 01:25:10,816
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1202
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:13,694
Well, it should be.

1203
01:25:13,777 --> 01:25:17,615
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1204
01:25:23,162 --> 01:25:26,624
Fabienne, where's my father's
fucking watch?

1205
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:31,837
Do you have any idea what he had to go
through to get me that watch?

1206
01:25:32,379 --> 01:25:35,215
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1207
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:38,886
All this other shit you could've set on
fire, but I specifically reminded you...

1208
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:42,514
not to forget the fucking watch!
Now think.

1209
01:25:42,598 --> 01:25:46,101
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1210
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:49,480
You believe 50? What the fuck does that
mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1211
01:25:50,856 --> 01:25:52,816
Then I did.

1212
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:56,070
Are you sure?

1213
01:25:57,696 --> 01:25:59,156
No.

1214
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,160
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1215
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:05,579
Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'—

1216
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:10,292
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1217
01:26:10,376 --> 01:26:12,336
No!

1218
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:16,882
It's not your fault.

1219
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,139
You left it at the apartment.

1220
01:26:29,895 --> 01:26:32,481
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1221
01:26:35,234 --> 01:26:37,111
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1222
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:42,074
I reminded you about it...

1223
01:26:42,157 --> 01:26:45,953
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1224
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:50,332
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,
I shoulda told you that.

1225
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,919
You're not a mind reader.

1226
01:26:54,002 --> 01:26:55,504
Are you?

1227
01:27:06,932 --> 01:27:07,975
I'm sorry.

1228
01:27:08,058 --> 01:27:11,645
Don't be. Just means I can't have
breakfast with you.

1229
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,440
Why does it mean that?

1230
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:20,320
Because I gotta go back
to my apartment and get my watch.

1231
01:27:21,572 --> 01:27:24,074
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1232
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,244
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1233
01:27:28,495 --> 01:27:32,750
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it, then I'll split.

1234
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:38,130
I saw your watch.
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1235
01:27:44,052 --> 01:27:46,430
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1236
01:27:46,513 --> 01:27:48,390
Have a nice breakfast.

1237
01:27:48,474 --> 01:27:51,226
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before
you can say blueberry pie.

1238
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:52,811
Blueberry pie.

1239
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,607
Maybe not that fast.

1240
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:59,902
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1241
01:27:59,985 --> 01:28:02,279
- Bye.
- Bye.

1242
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:04,948
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget...

1243
01:28:05,032 --> 01:28:07,034
she forgets my father's watch!

1244
01:28:07,117 --> 01:28:08,786
I specifically reminded her—

1245
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:11,497
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1246
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:14,833
I said the words:
“Don't forget my father's watch.”

1247
01:28:30,349 --> 01:28:33,769
<i>Visit the jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...</i>

1248
01:30:51,782 --> 01:30:53,700
Lookin' good, Butch.

1249
01:33:42,828 --> 01:33:44,871
<i>If I were walkin'
in your shoes</i>

1250
01:33:44,955 --> 01:33:46,998
<i>I wouldn't worry much</i>

1251
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:56,716
<i>Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all</i>

1252
01:33:57,926 --> 01:34:02,347
<i>Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of 51</i>

1253
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:05,350
That's how you're gonna beat <i>'em,</i> Butch.

1254
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:08,645
They keep underestimatin' ya.

1255
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:10,689
<i>Now don't tell me</i>

1256
01:34:12,232 --> 01:34:15,694
<i>Countin' flowers on the wall</i>

1257
01:34:15,777 --> 01:34:18,238
<i>That don't bother me at all</i>

1258
01:34:19,322 --> 01:34:24,828
<i>Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of 51</i>

1259
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:29,624
<i>Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo</i>

1260
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:32,627
<i>Now don't tell me</i>

1261
01:34:32,711 --> 01:34:35,130
<i>I've nothin' to do</i>

1262
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:37,465
<i>It's good to see you
I must go</i>

1263
01:34:37,549 --> 01:34:39,593
<i>I know I look a fright</i>

1264
01:34:39,676 --> 01:34:42,137
<i>Anyway my eyes
-</i> Motherfucker.

1265
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,598
<i>- Are not accustomed—</i>
- Uhh!

1266
01:34:52,772 --> 01:34:55,192
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1267
01:34:55,275 --> 01:34:57,527
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1268
01:35:07,412 --> 01:35:11,333
If you need someone to go to court, I'll be
glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.

1269
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:14,336
He hit you, then he crashed into that car.

1270
01:35:14,419 --> 01:35:16,296
- Who?
- Him.

1271
01:35:20,425 --> 01:35:22,594
I'll be damned.

1272
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:41,071
I'm shot!

1273
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:49,621
Sally! Sally!

1274
01:35:58,546 --> 01:36:00,465
Motherfucker!

1275
01:36:03,134 --> 01:36:06,554
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1276
01:36:06,638 --> 01:36:09,557
Now you just wait a goddamn minute, now!

1277
01:36:09,641 --> 01:36:11,601
What the fuck you up to?

1278
01:36:11,685 --> 01:36:14,312
Come here, motherfucker!

1279
01:36:14,396 --> 01:36:17,274
You feel that sting, huh, big boy?

1280
01:36:17,357 --> 01:36:19,276
That's pride fuckin' with you, see?

1281
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:21,319
You gotta fight through that shit!

1282
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:25,865
- You'd better kill me—
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1283
01:36:25,949 --> 01:36:28,493
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to—

1284
01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:31,079
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1285
01:36:31,162 --> 01:36:34,916
- This ain't none of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1286
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,711
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1287
01:36:37,794 --> 01:36:39,838
Toss the weapon.

1288
01:36:41,423 --> 01:36:45,051
<i>It's time</i>

1289
01:36:45,135 --> 01:36:47,846
- <i>To find love</i>
- Take your foot off the nigger.

1290
01:36:47,929 --> 01:36:49,848
Put your hand behind your head...

1291
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:51,975
approach the counter right now.

1292
01:36:52,058 --> 01:36:54,853
This motherfucker's trying to
kill me.

1293
01:36:55,353 --> 01:36:59,357
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1294
01:37:00,859 --> 01:37:04,362
<i>If love</i>

1295
01:37:04,446 --> 01:37:06,364
<i>Is shelter</i>

1296
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:26,009
Zed. Maynard.

1297
01:37:27,052 --> 01:37:29,929
Yeah, the spider just
caught a couple flies.

1298
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:33,475
<i>Whoa, my angel</i>

1299
01:37:36,061 --> 01:37:39,189
<i>Down to you</i>

1300
01:38:17,811 --> 01:38:21,773
Nobody kills anybody in my place
of business except me or Zed.

1301
01:38:26,027 --> 01:38:27,695
That's Zed.

1302
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:43,545
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1303
01:38:48,842 --> 01:38:51,302
Then how come they're all beat up?

1304
01:38:52,512 --> 01:38:55,598
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1305
01:38:55,682 --> 01:38:57,767
Now, this 'un right here...

1306
01:38:57,851 --> 01:39:00,770
- he was gonna shoot that one.
- Is that right?

1307
01:39:00,854 --> 01:39:03,481
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1308
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:11,197
Hey, is Grace all right out front?

1309
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:14,492
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1310
01:39:14,576 --> 01:39:16,244
She oughta be fine.

1311
01:39:19,664 --> 01:39:22,917
Well, bring out the gimp.

1312
01:39:24,002 --> 01:39:26,754
I think the gimp's sleepin'.

1313
01:39:26,838 --> 01:39:29,674
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1314
01:40:09,881 --> 01:40:11,799
Get up.

1315
01:40:25,063 --> 01:40:27,023
Get down.

1316
01:40:37,325 --> 01:40:39,494
Which one of 'em you wanna do first?

1317
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:43,331
I ain't for sure yet.

1318
01:40:47,377 --> 01:40:50,004
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo...

1319
01:40:50,088 --> 01:40:52,674
catch a nigger...

1320
01:40:52,757 --> 01:40:55,343
by his toe.

1321
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:59,180
If he hollers, let him go.

1322
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,434
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1323
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:09,315
My mother said...

1324
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:12,986
pick the perfect one...

1325
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:16,072
and... you... are...

1326
01:41:18,074 --> 01:41:19,450
it.

1327
01:41:21,786 --> 01:41:24,831
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1328
01:41:28,918 --> 01:41:30,378
You wanna do it in here?

1329
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:33,715
No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1330
01:41:33,798 --> 01:41:36,509
Sounds good to me.

1331
01:41:59,782 --> 01:42:01,743
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1332
01:42:32,065 --> 01:42:33,524
Yeah!

1333
01:42:36,569 --> 01:42:39,739
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1334
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:41,532
Now, motherfucker!

1335
01:42:43,368 --> 01:42:47,747
Come on! Yeah!

1336
01:42:55,463 --> 01:42:57,048
Yeah!

1337
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:05,932
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1338
01:43:08,935 --> 01:43:10,812
Yeah! Yeah!

1339
01:43:13,314 --> 01:43:16,234
Yeee! Yeeee-hah!

1340
01:43:36,921 --> 01:43:38,339
Yeah!

1341
01:44:06,451 --> 01:44:10,246
Come on! Get down there!

1342
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:16,127
Do it! Yeah!

1343
01:44:33,227 --> 01:44:35,229
Yeah! Yeah!

1344
01:44:51,162 --> 01:44:52,789
Shut the fuck up!

1345
01:44:56,918 --> 01:44:58,336
Fuck him!

1346
01:45:01,005 --> 01:45:02,965
Come on!

1347
01:45:06,552 --> 01:45:09,514
Fuck him. Yeah.

1348
01:45:40,795 --> 01:45:43,047
You want that gun, don't ya, Zed?

1349
01:45:47,635 --> 01:45:49,554
Go ahead and pick it up.

1350
01:45:51,973 --> 01:45:54,267
Go ahead, pick it up.

1351
01:45:56,561 --> 01:45:59,063
Come on— Thatta boy!

1352
01:46:00,648 --> 01:46:04,735
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1353
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:12,076
Step aside, Butch.

1354
01:46:24,297 --> 01:46:26,048
Fuck!

1355
01:46:29,927 --> 01:46:31,512
You okay?

1356
01:46:34,265 --> 01:46:36,434
No, man.

1357
01:46:37,018 --> 01:46:39,937
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1358
01:46:51,115 --> 01:46:53,534
What now?

1359
01:46:55,870 --> 01:46:57,788
What now?

1360
01:46:59,165 --> 01:47:01,125
Let me tell you what now.

1361
01:47:02,668 --> 01:47:05,588
I'm gonna calla couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1362
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:08,341
to go to work on the homes here...

1363
01:47:08,424 --> 01:47:11,135
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1364
01:47:13,596 --> 01:47:16,307
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?

1365
01:47:17,558 --> 01:47:20,102
I ain't through with you by a damn sight!

1366
01:47:20,186 --> 01:47:22,647
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1367
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,320
I meant what now between me and you.

1368
01:47:34,408 --> 01:47:36,327
Oh, that what now.

1369
01:47:38,245 --> 01:47:40,957
I tell you what now between me and you.

1370
01:47:43,751 --> 01:47:46,671
There is no me and you.

1371
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,049
Not no more.

1372
01:47:53,135 --> 01:47:55,054
So, are we cool?

1373
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:58,099
Yeah, we cool.

1374
01:47:59,433 --> 01:48:00,935
Two things.

1375
01:48:02,687 --> 01:48:05,648
Don't tell nobody about this.

1376
01:48:07,108 --> 01:48:10,736
This shit is between me, you...

1377
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:15,282
and Mr. “Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest
of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain”...

1378
01:48:15,366 --> 01:48:17,284
rapist here.

1379
01:48:18,577 --> 01:48:21,330
It ain't nobody else's business.

1380
01:48:21,414 --> 01:48:23,332
Two—

1381
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:26,919
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1382
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:31,882
And when you gone,
you stay gone...

1383
01:48:31,966 --> 01:48:33,884
or you be gone.

1384
01:48:34,885 --> 01:48:37,680
You lost all your LA privileges. Deal?

1385
01:48:39,932 --> 01:48:41,267
Deal.

1386
01:48:43,102 --> 01:48:45,062
Get your ass outta here.

1387
01:49:11,505 --> 01:49:13,424
Oh, shit.

1388
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:48,501
Fabienne!

1389
01:49:50,294 --> 01:49:51,712
Fabienne!

1390
01:49:54,632 --> 01:49:56,717
Fabienne! Come on, baby.

1391
01:49:56,801 --> 01:49:58,677
Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.

1392
01:49:58,761 --> 01:50:00,387
I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1393
01:50:00,471 --> 01:50:02,723
Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1394
01:50:02,807 --> 01:50:05,726
- Come on, I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1395
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:09,438
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1396
01:50:13,067 --> 01:50:14,652
Come on, honey!

1397
01:50:17,738 --> 01:50:19,657
Where did you get this motorcycle?

1398
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:22,201
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.

1399
01:50:22,284 --> 01:50:24,245
What happened to my Honda?

1400
01:50:24,328 --> 01:50:28,082
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that
Honda. Will you come on now, please?

1401
01:50:28,165 --> 01:50:30,626
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1402
01:50:35,131 --> 01:50:36,090
You're hurt?

1403
01:50:36,173 --> 01:50:38,592
No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1404
01:50:38,676 --> 01:50:41,595
Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we—

1405
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:44,473
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1406
01:50:46,308 --> 01:50:50,437
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here. I'm sorry.

1407
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:53,232
I'm so sorry.

1408
01:50:53,315 --> 01:50:55,734
You were gone so long,
I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1409
01:50:55,818 --> 01:50:58,737
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1410
01:50:58,821 --> 01:51:00,739
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1411
01:51:00,823 --> 01:51:02,741
Did you get the blueberry pancakes?

1412
01:51:02,825 --> 01:51:05,744
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1413
01:51:05,828 --> 01:51:08,747
Since I left you, this has been,
without a doubt...

1414
01:51:08,831 --> 01:51:13,043
the single weirdest fuckin' day
of my life— I'll tell you all about it.

1415
01:51:13,127 --> 01:51:14,920
Gotta go. Come on.

1416
01:51:15,004 --> 01:51:17,798
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1417
01:51:17,882 --> 01:51:20,467
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1418
01:51:20,551 --> 01:51:22,469
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1419
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:25,472
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1420
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,574
Yes, you did, Brett!

1421
01:51:43,657 --> 01:51:47,161
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus
Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1422
01:51:47,244 --> 01:51:49,663
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1423
01:51:49,747 --> 01:51:52,833
- Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1424
01:51:52,917 --> 01:51:56,337
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1425
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,589
Sorta fits the occasion.

1426
01:51:58,672 --> 01:52:01,967
Ezekiel 25:17.

1427
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:06,347
“The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1428
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:11,644
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

1429
01:52:11,727 --> 01:52:16,565
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will...

1430
01:52:16,649 --> 01:52:19,693
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

1431
01:52:19,777 --> 01:52:22,279
for he is truly his brother's keeper...

1432
01:52:22,363 --> 01:52:25,074
and the finder of lost children.

1433
01:52:25,157 --> 01:52:31,664
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger...

1434
01:52:31,747 --> 01:52:36,126
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

1435
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:40,047
And you will know my name is the Lord...

1436
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:43,509
when I lay my vengeance upon thee.”

1437
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,061
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1438
01:52:54,144 --> 01:52:57,064
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1439
01:52:57,147 --> 01:52:59,733
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1440
01:52:59,817 --> 01:53:01,568
Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.

1441
01:53:01,652 --> 01:53:04,446
Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!

1442
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:06,824
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1443
01:53:07,408 --> 01:53:10,577
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1444
01:53:38,731 --> 01:53:42,151
Why the fuck didn't you
tell us somebody was in the bathroom?

1445
01:53:42,234 --> 01:53:45,112
Slip your mind? Did you forget that
someone was in there...

1446
01:53:45,195 --> 01:53:47,072
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1447
01:53:47,156 --> 01:53:50,367
You see the size of that gun
he fired at us? It was bigger than him.

1448
01:53:55,873 --> 01:53:58,584
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1449
01:53:58,667 --> 01:54:00,586
I know. We was lucky.

1450
01:54:00,669 --> 01:54:03,756
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1451
01:54:03,839 --> 01:54:05,174
Yeah, maybe.

1452
01:54:05,257 --> 01:54:08,052
This was divine intervention.

1453
01:54:08,135 --> 01:54:10,054
You know what divine intervention is?

1454
01:54:15,934 --> 01:54:17,853
I think so.

1455
01:54:17,936 --> 01:54:21,357
That means that God came down from heaven
and stopped the bullets.

1456
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,859
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1457
01:54:23,942 --> 01:54:26,904
God came down from heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1458
01:54:28,155 --> 01:54:30,115
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1459
01:54:30,199 --> 01:54:32,576
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1460
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:34,745
What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!

1461
01:54:34,828 --> 01:54:36,622
Chill. This shit happens.

1462
01:54:36,705 --> 01:54:39,458
Wrong! Wrong. This shit
doesn't just happen.

1463
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:42,961
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1464
01:54:43,045 --> 01:54:45,506
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1465
01:54:45,589 --> 01:54:47,257
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!

1466
01:54:48,092 --> 01:54:52,471
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1467
01:54:52,554 --> 01:54:56,809
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1468
01:55:04,274 --> 01:55:07,361
Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.

1469
01:55:09,405 --> 01:55:11,365
You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>

1470
01:55:11,448 --> 01:55:14,368
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on...

1471
01:55:14,451 --> 01:55:18,372
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1472
01:55:18,455 --> 01:55:21,875
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1473
01:55:21,959 --> 01:55:24,503
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1474
01:55:24,586 --> 01:55:28,298
I mean, you know,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1475
01:55:28,382 --> 01:55:30,759
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

1476
01:55:30,843 --> 01:55:33,303
but me, my eyes
are wide fuckin' open.

1477
01:55:33,387 --> 01:55:35,097
What the fuck does that mean?

1478
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,682
It means that's it for me.

1479
01:55:36,765 --> 01:55:39,059
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1480
01:55:39,143 --> 01:55:41,311
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1481
01:55:41,395 --> 01:55:44,440
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1482
01:55:44,523 --> 01:55:47,568
Look, I'm tellin'
Marsellus today— I'm through.

1483
01:55:47,651 --> 01:55:50,571
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1484
01:55:50,654 --> 01:55:54,658
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1485
01:55:55,409 --> 01:55:57,828
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1486
01:55:57,911 --> 01:56:00,330
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1487
01:56:00,414 --> 01:56:04,668
You gotta have an opinion. You think God
came down from heaven and stopped—

1488
01:56:05,335 --> 01:56:06,920
What the fuck's happenin'?

1489
01:56:07,004 --> 01:56:08,714
- Shit, man!
- Man!

1490
01:56:08,797 --> 01:56:11,717
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1491
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,427
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1492
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,971
Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this—

1493
01:56:16,054 --> 01:56:19,725
Chill out, man! It was an accident.
We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1494
01:56:19,808 --> 01:56:21,727
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1495
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:25,105
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1496
01:56:25,189 --> 01:56:28,609
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a city
street in broad daylight here!

1497
01:56:28,692 --> 01:56:30,611
- I don't believe it!
- We", believe it now, motherfucker!

1498
01:56:30,694 --> 01:56:35,157
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1499
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:38,160
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1500
01:56:38,243 --> 01:56:40,662
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1501
01:56:40,746 --> 01:56:43,165
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1502
01:56:43,248 --> 01:56:45,667
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1503
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:49,254
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1504
01:56:49,922 --> 01:56:52,799
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...

1505
01:56:52,883 --> 01:56:55,302
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1506
01:56:55,385 --> 01:56:59,306
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1507
01:56:59,389 --> 01:57:03,310
Me and my homeboy are in a car,
and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1508
01:57:03,393 --> 01:57:05,562
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1509
01:57:07,064 --> 01:57:09,983
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1510
01:57:10,067 --> 01:57:12,694
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1511
01:57:12,778 --> 01:57:16,698
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...

1512
01:57:16,782 --> 01:57:19,701
but I don't want it to reach that pitch—
Jimmie's a friend.

1513
01:57:19,785 --> 01:57:21,912
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1514
01:57:21,995 --> 01:57:24,206
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1515
01:57:24,289 --> 01:57:26,708
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1516
01:57:26,792 --> 01:57:29,962
Put yourself in his position—
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1517
01:57:30,045 --> 01:57:31,964
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1518
01:57:32,047 --> 01:57:34,967
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1519
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:38,887
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1520
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:41,390
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?

1521
01:57:41,473 --> 01:57:42,975
I was dryin' my hands!

1522
01:57:43,058 --> 01:57:45,978
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1523
01:57:46,061 --> 01:57:49,314
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1524
01:57:49,398 --> 01:57:51,608
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1525
01:57:51,692 --> 01:57:53,610
I used the same fuckin' soap you did...

1526
01:57:53,694 --> 01:57:56,613
and when I finished, the towel didn't look
like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1527
01:57:56,697 --> 01:57:58,865
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1528
01:57:58,949 --> 01:58:02,244
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1529
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:07,291
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1530
01:58:07,374 --> 01:58:11,837
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1531
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,590
All right. Fine. Fine.

1532
01:58:14,673 --> 01:58:16,842
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1533
01:58:17,676 --> 01:58:20,637
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1534
01:58:23,473 --> 01:58:25,225
Goddamn, Jimmie!

1535
01:58:25,309 --> 01:58:27,352
This some serious gourmet shit.

1536
01:58:27,436 --> 01:58:31,398
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied
with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1537
01:58:31,481 --> 01:58:35,902
Right? And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1538
01:58:35,986 --> 01:58:38,530
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1539
01:58:38,614 --> 01:58:39,573
What?

1540
01:58:39,656 --> 01:58:42,659
I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1541
01:58:42,743 --> 01:58:45,245
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1542
01:58:45,329 --> 01:58:47,205
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1543
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:50,917
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff
'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1544
01:58:51,001 --> 01:58:54,921
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1545
01:58:55,005 --> 01:58:57,174
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1546
01:58:57,257 --> 01:58:58,967
Jimmie, don't even worry—

1547
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:01,094
Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1548
01:59:01,178 --> 01:59:02,679
When you came pulling in here...

1549
01:59:02,763 --> 01:59:05,932
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?

1550
01:59:06,016 --> 01:59:07,726
You know I ain't seen no—

1551
01:59:07,809 --> 01:59:11,480
Did you notice the sign on the front of
my house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?

1552
01:59:12,147 --> 01:59:14,274
No. I didn't.

1553
01:59:14,358 --> 01:59:17,235
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1554
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:21,865
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1555
01:59:21,948 --> 01:59:24,868
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker—
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1556
01:59:24,951 --> 01:59:29,373
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1557
01:59:29,456 --> 01:59:32,668
No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1558
01:59:32,751 --> 01:59:36,088
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1559
01:59:36,171 --> 01:59:41,176
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1560
01:59:41,259 --> 01:59:43,345
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.

1561
01:59:43,428 --> 01:59:47,349
Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me,
Jules! Okay? Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me.

1562
01:59:47,432 --> 01:59:51,395
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1563
01:59:53,939 --> 01:59:59,194
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1564
01:59:59,277 --> 02:00:01,905
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1565
02:00:01,988 --> 02:00:05,492
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1566
02:00:05,575 --> 02:00:09,496
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1567
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:12,416
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1568
02:00:12,499 --> 02:00:15,502
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1569
02:00:15,585 --> 02:00:18,505
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1570
02:00:18,588 --> 02:00:21,675
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1571
02:00:21,758 --> 02:00:25,262
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1572
02:00:25,345 --> 02:00:28,265
Well, say she comes home.

1573
02:00:28,348 --> 02:00:29,975
What do you think she'll do?

1574
02:00:32,269 --> 02:00:34,688
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1575
02:00:34,771 --> 02:00:36,982
That ain't no kinda answer.

1576
02:00:37,065 --> 02:00:40,110
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1577
02:00:40,193 --> 02:00:45,031
You got to appreciate what an explosive
element this Bonnie situation is.

1578
02:00:45,115 --> 02:00:49,035
<i>She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>

1579
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:51,037
<i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>

1580
02:00:51,121 --> 02:00:54,207
<i>there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.</i>

1581
02:00:56,376 --> 02:00:58,295
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1582
02:00:58,378 --> 02:01:00,964
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1583
02:01:01,047 --> 02:01:03,091
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1584
02:01:03,175 --> 02:01:04,843
All I want to hear from your ass is...

1585
02:01:04,926 --> 02:01:07,971
“You ain't got no problem, Jules,
I'm on the motherfucker.

1586
02:01:08,054 --> 02:01:12,184
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be coming directly.”

1587
02:01:12,267 --> 02:01:15,437
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1588
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,647
I'm on the motherfucker.

1589
02:01:17,731 --> 02:01:22,819
Chill them niggers out and wait for the
Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1590
02:01:23,528 --> 02:01:25,280
You sendin' the Wolf?

1591
02:01:25,363 --> 02:01:27,532
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?

1592
02:01:27,616 --> 02:01:29,910
Shit, negro!

1593
02:01:29,993 --> 02:01:32,120
That's all you had to say!

1594
02:01:33,163 --> 02:01:35,165
She the hysterical type?

1595
02:01:36,458 --> 02:01:38,001
When is she due?

1596
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:43,548
Give me the principals' names again.

1597
02:01:43,632 --> 02:01:45,550
Place your bets.

1598
02:01:46,635 --> 02:01:49,012
- Jules.
- Cards, please.

1599
02:01:50,347 --> 02:01:52,307
Vincent.

1600
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:58,522
Jimmie.

1601
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:01,566
Bonnie.

1602
02:02:07,739 --> 02:02:10,700
It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.

1603
02:02:27,676 --> 02:02:30,595
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1604
02:02:30,679 --> 02:02:34,307
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1605
02:02:34,391 --> 02:02:37,310
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1606
02:02:37,394 --> 02:02:39,271
Yeah. Please do.

1607
02:02:39,354 --> 02:02:43,024
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1608
02:02:43,108 --> 02:02:45,527
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1609
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:48,321
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1610
02:02:48,405 --> 02:02:49,865
One hundred percent.

1611
02:02:49,948 --> 02:02:53,368
Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?

1612
02:02:53,451 --> 02:02:54,536
Uh-huh.

1613
02:02:54,619 --> 02:02:59,124
I was led to believe if she comes home and
finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1614
02:02:59,207 --> 02:03:00,667
She wouldn't at that.

1615
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:03,461
That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge...

1616
02:03:03,545 --> 02:03:07,007
which, if you do what I say, when I say it,
should be plenty.

1617
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:11,428
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1618
02:03:19,144 --> 02:03:21,062
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1619
02:03:21,146 --> 02:03:24,190
Do me a favor, will ya?
Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1620
02:03:24,274 --> 02:03:28,111
- Would you make me a cup?
- Yeah, sure.

1621
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:32,490
Oh, how do you take it?

1622
02:03:32,574 --> 02:03:34,117
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1623
02:03:37,495 --> 02:03:40,248
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1624
02:03:40,332 --> 02:03:43,627
Does it smoke? Does it
make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1625
02:03:43,710 --> 02:03:47,339
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
- Positive?

1626
02:03:47,422 --> 02:03:50,133
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1627
02:03:50,216 --> 02:03:53,303
As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.

1628
02:03:53,386 --> 02:03:55,263
Good enough.

1629
02:03:55,347 --> 02:03:57,349
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1630
02:04:03,021 --> 02:04:05,482
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1631
02:04:13,823 --> 02:04:15,909
Okay, first thing. You two.

1632
02:04:15,992 --> 02:04:18,370
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1633
02:04:18,453 --> 02:04:21,122
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1634
02:04:21,206 --> 02:04:24,584
That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.

1635
02:04:24,668 --> 02:04:25,752
Yeah. Under the sink.

1636
02:04:25,835 --> 02:04:29,255
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is
take those cleaning products...

1637
02:04:29,339 --> 02:04:33,343
and clean the inside
of the car— I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1638
02:04:33,426 --> 02:04:37,347
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.

1639
02:04:37,430 --> 02:04:39,849
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1640
02:04:39,933 --> 02:04:43,353
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1641
02:04:43,436 --> 02:04:47,774
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1642
02:04:47,857 --> 02:04:51,945
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1643
02:04:52,028 --> 02:04:54,447
We need to raid your linen closet.

1644
02:04:54,531 --> 02:04:57,450
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1645
02:04:57,534 --> 02:05:01,162
The thicker the better, the darker
the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1646
02:05:01,246 --> 02:05:06,543
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1647
02:05:06,626 --> 02:05:08,545
with quilts and blankets...

1648
02:05:08,628 --> 02:05:12,549
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last...

1649
02:05:12,632 --> 02:05:15,468
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1650
02:05:15,552 --> 02:05:17,595
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

1651
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,431
Please would be nice.

1652
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:23,893
- Come again?
- I said, a please would be nice.

1653
02:05:25,729 --> 02:05:29,607
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say
please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1654
02:05:31,401 --> 02:05:33,528
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

1655
02:05:33,611 --> 02:05:36,322
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1656
02:05:36,406 --> 02:05:40,785
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1657
02:05:40,869 --> 02:05:43,663
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1658
02:05:43,747 --> 02:05:47,167
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1659
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:50,086
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1660
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:53,173
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1661
02:05:53,256 --> 02:05:57,886
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1662
02:05:57,969 --> 02:06:01,431
So pretty please,
with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1663
02:06:05,935 --> 02:06:09,064
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1664
02:06:12,317 --> 02:06:14,986
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1665
02:06:17,072 --> 02:06:18,490
Green.

1666
02:06:20,617 --> 02:06:22,786
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1667
02:06:25,747 --> 02:06:28,166
About 20 minutes.

1668
02:06:29,667 --> 02:06:31,628
Nobody who'll be missed.

1669
02:06:33,671 --> 02:06:36,633
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1670
02:06:37,717 --> 02:06:41,638
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good. I got it all here, but...

1671
02:06:42,972 --> 02:06:44,599
Mr. Wolf, you gotta
understand something.

1672
02:06:44,682 --> 02:06:46,392
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1673
02:06:46,476 --> 02:06:49,979
Okay. You gotta understand
something, Winston.

1674
02:06:50,063 --> 02:06:51,981
No, thank you.

1675
02:06:52,065 --> 02:06:55,193
This is our best linen here...

1676
02:06:55,276 --> 02:07:00,365
and it was a wedding present
from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1677
02:07:00,448 --> 02:07:02,784
They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help—

1678
02:07:02,867 --> 02:07:06,454
Let me ask you a question.
If you don't mind.

1679
02:07:06,538 --> 02:07:08,206
No, no, please. Go ahead.

1680
02:07:09,791 --> 02:07:14,671
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1681
02:07:15,839 --> 02:07:17,340
No.

1682
02:07:17,423 --> 02:07:20,260
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1683
02:07:20,343 --> 02:07:23,763
And I'm positive
that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1684
02:07:23,847 --> 02:07:26,266
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

1685
02:07:26,349 --> 02:07:30,603
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

1686
02:07:30,687 --> 02:07:33,857
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1687
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:41,739
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1688
02:07:42,866 --> 02:07:44,826
How about you, Jimmie?

1689
02:07:46,035 --> 02:07:47,996
You an oak man?

1690
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,040
Oak's nice.

1691
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:00,717
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1692
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,219
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1693
02:08:03,303 --> 02:08:06,723
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong...

1694
02:08:06,806 --> 02:08:09,726
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1695
02:08:09,809 --> 02:08:12,228
Get the fuck out my face with that shit!

1696
02:08:12,312 --> 02:08:15,148
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1697
02:08:15,231 --> 02:08:16,649
on account of your dumb ass.

1698
02:08:16,733 --> 02:08:19,485
I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1699
02:08:19,569 --> 02:08:22,822
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1700
02:08:22,906 --> 02:08:26,659
I'm just ea yin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1701
02:08:26,743 --> 02:08:28,661
That's all. I could blow.

1702
02:08:28,745 --> 02:08:30,663
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1703
02:08:30,747 --> 02:08:33,666
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1704
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:36,669
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly TNT.

1705
02:08:36,753 --> 02:08:38,671
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1706
02:08:38,755 --> 02:08:41,174
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1707
02:08:41,257 --> 02:08:45,011
You're the motherfucker should be on brain
detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1708
02:08:45,094 --> 02:08:47,555
I'm washin' windows,
you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1709
02:08:57,273 --> 02:08:59,234
Fine job, gentlemen.

1710
02:09:00,568 --> 02:09:02,487
You may get out of this yet.

1711
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:04,989
I can't believe this is the same car.

1712
02:09:05,073 --> 02:09:08,701
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1713
02:09:08,785 --> 02:09:12,330
Phase one is complete— clean the car—
which moves us right along to phase two:

1714
02:09:12,413 --> 02:09:14,499
clean you two.

1715
02:09:16,084 --> 02:09:17,961
Strip.

1716
02:09:18,044 --> 02:09:20,755
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1717
02:09:21,881 --> 02:09:24,926
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1718
02:09:25,009 --> 02:09:27,929
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1719
02:09:28,012 --> 02:09:30,515
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1720
02:09:30,598 --> 02:09:32,517
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

1721
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,019
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1722
02:09:35,103 --> 02:09:37,438
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1723
02:09:38,606 --> 02:09:41,985
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1724
02:09:46,281 --> 02:09:48,116
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1725
02:09:48,199 --> 02:09:53,246
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit
out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1726
02:09:53,329 --> 02:09:57,542
Don't worry,
we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.

1727
02:09:59,002 --> 02:10:00,920
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1728
02:10:01,004 --> 02:10:04,507
You both been to county before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1729
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:07,468
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1730
02:10:07,552 --> 02:10:10,763
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1731
02:10:10,847 --> 02:10:13,766
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1732
02:10:13,850 --> 02:10:16,728
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1733
02:10:16,811 --> 02:10:19,689
Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!

1734
02:10:20,773 --> 02:10:22,191
Towel.

1735
02:10:33,202 --> 02:10:36,372
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1736
02:10:37,957 --> 02:10:39,751
Perfect.

1737
02:10:39,834 --> 02:10:42,253
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1738
02:10:43,338 --> 02:10:45,256
You guys look like—

1739
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,759
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1740
02:10:47,842 --> 02:10:51,554
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1741
02:10:52,513 --> 02:10:55,016
Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

1742
02:10:55,099 --> 02:10:57,810
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1743
02:10:57,894 --> 02:10:59,854
Don't make me beg.

1744
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:06,319
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules of the road straight.

1745
02:11:06,402 --> 02:11:08,905
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1746
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:12,950
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1747
02:11:13,034 --> 02:11:14,911
The place is North Hollywood...

1748
02:11:14,994 --> 02:11:18,998
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1749
02:11:19,082 --> 02:11:22,418
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1750
02:11:23,795 --> 02:11:25,755
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1751
02:11:25,838 --> 02:11:29,717
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

1752
02:11:29,801 --> 02:11:32,929
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
- Right.

1753
02:11:33,012 --> 02:11:35,890
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1754
02:11:35,973 --> 02:11:38,267
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1755
02:11:38,351 --> 02:11:40,728
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1756
02:11:40,812 --> 02:11:44,232
How about you, Lash La Rue? Can you keep
your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1757
02:11:44,315 --> 02:11:48,444
The gun went off.
I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you.

1758
02:11:48,528 --> 02:11:51,447
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1759
02:11:51,531 --> 02:11:54,033
If I get my car back any
different than I gave it...

1760
02:11:54,117 --> 02:11:56,994
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1761
02:12:00,873 --> 02:12:02,583
Outta my way, Rex.

1762
02:12:04,127 --> 02:12:06,546
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1763
02:12:06,629 --> 02:12:10,383
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1764
02:12:10,466 --> 02:12:13,094
Someday all this will be hers.

1765
02:12:13,177 --> 02:12:16,013
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1766
02:12:16,097 --> 02:12:18,474
You guys going to a volleyball game
or something?

1767
02:12:20,643 --> 02:12:22,562
I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.

1768
02:12:22,645 --> 02:12:24,856
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1769
02:12:24,939 --> 02:12:26,315
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1770
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:29,819
It's your future.

1771
02:12:29,902 --> 02:12:32,655
I see a cab ride.

1772
02:12:32,738 --> 02:12:35,700
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1773
02:12:35,783 --> 02:12:38,703
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1774
02:12:38,786 --> 02:12:40,413
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1775
02:12:40,496 --> 02:12:44,208
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1776
02:12:44,292 --> 02:12:46,961
Yeah, really. And thank
you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1777
02:12:48,296 --> 02:12:50,214
Call me Winston.

1778
02:12:51,799 --> 02:12:54,719
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1779
02:12:54,802 --> 02:12:58,973
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

1780
02:12:59,056 --> 02:13:03,060
Because you are a character doesn't
mean that you have character.

1781
02:13:10,651 --> 02:13:12,612
Wanna share a cab?

1782
02:13:12,695 --> 02:13:16,949
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1783
02:13:17,033 --> 02:13:18,326
Cool.

1784
02:13:23,831 --> 02:13:26,959
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1785
02:13:27,043 --> 02:13:29,128
Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.

1786
02:13:29,212 --> 02:13:31,464
- I know that now.
- But was he cool or what?

1787
02:13:31,547 --> 02:13:35,468
- Thank you.
- Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1788
02:13:35,551 --> 02:13:39,597
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1789
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:42,266
Want some bacon?

1790
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:45,102
- No, man, I don't eat pork.
- Are you Jewish?

1791
02:13:45,186 --> 02:13:47,772
I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1792
02:13:47,855 --> 02:13:50,775
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1793
02:13:50,858 --> 02:13:52,777
I don't eat filthy animals.

1794
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:56,280
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1795
02:13:56,364 --> 02:13:59,283
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1796
02:13:59,367 --> 02:14:01,118
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1797
02:14:02,370 --> 02:14:05,289
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1798
02:14:05,373 --> 02:14:09,043
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own feces.

1799
02:14:09,126 --> 02:14:11,671
How about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.

1800
02:14:11,754 --> 02:14:13,673
I don't eat dog either.

1801
02:14:13,756 --> 02:14:17,093
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1802
02:14:17,176 --> 02:14:19,804
I wouldn't go so far
as to calla dog filthy...

1803
02:14:19,887 --> 02:14:21,681
but they're definitely dirty.

1804
02:14:21,764 --> 02:14:24,725
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

1805
02:14:24,809 --> 02:14:26,310
So, by that rationale...

1806
02:14:26,394 --> 02:14:30,731
if a pig had a better personality, he would
cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?

1807
02:14:30,815 --> 02:14:33,943
We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1808
02:14:34,026 --> 02:14:38,072
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more
charming than that Arnold on <i>Green Acres.</i>

1809
02:14:43,661 --> 02:14:45,788
Oh, man, that's good.

1810
02:14:45,871 --> 02:14:49,458
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1811
02:14:49,542 --> 02:14:51,961
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1812
02:14:52,044 --> 02:14:55,006
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1813
02:14:55,089 --> 02:14:56,549
About the miracle we witnessed.

1814
02:14:56,632 --> 02:14:59,927
Miracle you witnessed.
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

1815
02:15:00,011 --> 02:15:01,345
What is a miracle, Vincent?

1816
02:15:03,306 --> 02:15:06,475
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1817
02:15:09,979 --> 02:15:13,816
When God makes
the impossible possible.

1818
02:15:14,817 --> 02:15:16,736
But this morning...

1819
02:15:16,819 --> 02:15:19,530
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1820
02:15:19,614 --> 02:15:23,326
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1821
02:15:23,409 --> 02:15:28,331
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1822
02:15:28,414 --> 02:15:31,375
You don't judge shit
like this based on merit.

1823
02:15:31,459 --> 02:15:33,919
Now, whether or not what we experienced...

1824
02:15:34,003 --> 02:15:37,131
was an According-to-Hoyle
miracle is insignificant.

1825
02:15:37,214 --> 02:15:40,968
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1826
02:15:41,052 --> 02:15:42,970
God got involved.

1827
02:15:43,054 --> 02:15:44,764
But why?

1828
02:15:44,847 --> 02:15:47,892
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1829
02:15:47,975 --> 02:15:50,936
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1830
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:52,897
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1831
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:55,650
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1832
02:15:55,733 --> 02:15:59,070
Fuck. What you gonna do then?

1833
02:16:00,404 --> 02:16:04,617
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1834
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:08,287
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1835
02:16:08,371 --> 02:16:11,457
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the earth.

1836
02:16:11,540 --> 02:16:14,960
- What you mean, “Walk the earth”?
- Like Caine in <i>Kung Fu</i>.

1837
02:16:15,044 --> 02:16:18,005
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1838
02:16:18,089 --> 02:16:20,341
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

1839
02:16:20,424 --> 02:16:23,719
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
- What if he don't do that?

1840
02:16:23,803 --> 02:16:26,180
If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.

1841
02:16:26,263 --> 02:16:28,724
So you decided to be a bum.

1842
02:16:28,808 --> 02:16:32,436
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1843
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:34,480
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...

1844
02:16:34,563 --> 02:16:37,858
just like all those pieces of shit out
there who beg for change...

1845
02:16:37,942 --> 02:16:40,861
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1846
02:16:40,945 --> 02:16:43,906
They got a name for that, Jules—
It's called a bum.

1847
02:16:43,989 --> 02:16:47,660
And without a job, a residence or legal
tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1848
02:16:47,743 --> 02:16:49,620
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1849
02:16:49,704 --> 02:16:52,623
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1850
02:16:52,707 --> 02:16:55,543
Garcon! Coffee!

1851
02:16:55,626 --> 02:17:00,131
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1852
02:17:00,214 --> 02:17:03,300
- But water into wine, I—
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1853
02:17:03,384 --> 02:17:06,512
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you...

1854
02:17:06,595 --> 02:17:09,140
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1855
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:13,978
I'm gonna take a shit.

1856
02:17:17,857 --> 02:17:19,400
Let me ask you something.

1857
02:17:19,483 --> 02:17:22,862
When did you make this decision, when you
were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1858
02:17:22,945 --> 02:17:26,866
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin,
drinkin' my coffee...

1859
02:17:26,949 --> 02:17:28,868
replayin' the incident in my head...

1860
02:17:28,951 --> 02:17:32,788
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1861
02:17:33,414 --> 02:17:35,958
Fuck. To be continued.

1862
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:50,931
- I love you, pumpkin.
- I love you, honey bunny.

1863
02:17:52,516 --> 02:17:54,602
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1864
02:17:54,685 --> 02:17:57,313
Any one of you fucking pricks move...

1865
02:17:57,396 --> 02:18:00,524
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1866
02:18:00,608 --> 02:18:03,986
You got that?
You just be quiet over there!

1867
02:18:04,069 --> 02:18:07,114
Get on the fuckin'— get the fuck down!

1868
02:18:07,198 --> 02:18:11,911
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames
over to that booth, on the count of ten!

1869
02:18:11,994 --> 02:18:16,540
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8—

1870
02:18:16,624 --> 02:18:19,710
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1871
02:18:19,794 --> 02:18:22,254
- Get down!
- Th row those bags!

1872
02:18:22,338 --> 02:18:24,840
Fucking move! Move!

1873
02:18:24,924 --> 02:18:27,176
Move! Get the fuck—

1874
02:18:27,259 --> 02:18:30,262
Get down on the fucking floor!

1875
02:18:30,346 --> 02:18:32,264
Grandpa! Down!

1876
02:18:32,348 --> 02:18:35,726
I'm the manager here,
and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1877
02:18:35,810 --> 02:18:38,729
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1878
02:18:38,813 --> 02:18:42,817
Thought you said you were gonna give me
a fucking problem!

1879
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:47,571
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1880
02:18:48,197 --> 02:18:49,949
I am not a hero.

1881
02:18:50,032 --> 02:18:52,701
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1882
02:18:52,785 --> 02:18:54,537
The restaurant's ours!

1883
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:57,540
Just take whatever you want.

1884
02:18:57,623 --> 02:18:59,542
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1885
02:18:59,625 --> 02:19:02,753
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1886
02:19:02,837 --> 02:19:04,797
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1887
02:19:07,091 --> 02:19:10,970
Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate...

1888
02:19:11,053 --> 02:19:13,973
and this'll all be over in a minute!

1889
02:19:14,056 --> 02:19:16,058
Get the fuck down! Well done.

1890
02:19:28,362 --> 02:19:31,824
All right, now, people, gonna come around
and collect your wallets!

1891
02:19:31,907 --> 02:19:35,327
You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em
in the bag! Are we clear?

1892
02:19:35,411 --> 02:19:37,663
I said, are we fucking clear?

1893
02:19:37,746 --> 02:19:39,623
Good! Now, wallets out!

1894
02:19:41,333 --> 02:19:44,336
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1895
02:19:44,420 --> 02:19:47,339
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1896
02:19:47,423 --> 02:19:49,258
In the bag.

1897
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:52,261
What am I waiting for? In the fucking bag.

1898
02:19:52,344 --> 02:19:55,264
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1899
02:19:56,098 --> 02:19:57,558
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1900
02:19:57,641 --> 02:19:59,184
In the fucking bag.

1901
02:20:01,145 --> 02:20:04,607
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1902
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:07,109
In the bag. In the bag.

1903
02:20:19,288 --> 02:20:21,248
In the bag.

1904
02:20:36,347 --> 02:20:39,266
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty laundry.

1905
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:41,894
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1906
02:20:41,977 --> 02:20:44,647
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1907
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:47,650
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1908
02:20:49,693 --> 02:20:52,029
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1909
02:20:53,155 --> 02:20:55,449
What's going on?

1910
02:20:55,532 --> 02:20:57,409
Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

1911
02:20:57,493 --> 02:20:58,994
Shoot him in the face!

1912
02:20:59,078 --> 02:21:02,790
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1913
02:21:02,873 --> 02:21:05,250
If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

1914
02:21:05,334 --> 02:21:06,585
Stop causing problems!

1915
02:21:06,669 --> 02:21:09,129
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em what
you got and get 'em outta here!

1916
02:21:09,213 --> 02:21:13,425
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your goddamn business!

1917
02:21:13,509 --> 02:21:15,761
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

1918
02:21:15,844 --> 02:21:17,888
No problem. I got it under control.

1919
02:21:19,515 --> 02:21:21,517
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1920
02:21:23,102 --> 02:21:27,022
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1921
02:21:31,443 --> 02:21:32,861
We clear?

1922
02:21:36,532 --> 02:21:38,450
One.

1923
02:21:40,285 --> 02:21:42,788
Two.

1924
02:21:42,871 --> 02:21:44,915
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1925
02:21:44,999 --> 02:21:47,084
You win.

1926
02:21:47,167 --> 02:21:49,086
It's yours.

1927
02:21:54,133 --> 02:21:55,884
Open it.

1928
02:21:59,722 --> 02:22:01,932
Hey, what is it?

1929
02:22:02,016 --> 02:22:04,351
What is it?

1930
02:22:04,435 --> 02:22:07,062
Is that what I think it is?

1931
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,485
It's beautiful.

1932
02:22:13,569 --> 02:22:16,113
Goddamn it, what is it?

1933
02:22:17,614 --> 02:22:20,534
You let him go! You let him go!

1934
02:22:20,617 --> 02:22:23,579
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1935
02:22:23,662 --> 02:22:26,582
- Say, “Bitch, be cool!” Say, “Bitch, be cool!”
- Be cool! Be cool!

1936
02:22:26,665 --> 02:22:29,376
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1937
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:32,337
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1938
02:22:32,421 --> 02:22:34,214
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1939
02:22:34,298 --> 02:22:37,217
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1940
02:22:37,301 --> 02:22:39,178
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

1941
02:22:39,261 --> 02:22:41,180
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1942
02:22:41,263 --> 02:22:44,683
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

1943
02:22:44,767 --> 02:22:47,686
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1944
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:51,273
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1945
02:22:51,356 --> 02:22:55,027
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1946
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:56,987
- What?
- Cool.

1947
02:22:57,071 --> 02:22:59,907
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1948
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:01,909
We're gonna be cool.

1949
02:23:01,992 --> 02:23:06,872
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1950
02:23:06,955 --> 02:23:09,041
And when I count three...

1951
02:23:09,124 --> 02:23:12,044
I want you to let go of your gun...

1952
02:23:12,127 --> 02:23:15,631
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1953
02:23:16,673 --> 02:23:18,717
And when you do it...

1954
02:23:18,801 --> 02:23:20,886
you do it cool.

1955
02:23:20,969 --> 02:23:23,263
You ready?

1956
02:23:23,347 --> 02:23:25,432
One...

1957
02:23:25,516 --> 02:23:27,726
two...

1958
02:23:27,810 --> 02:23:29,728
three.

1959
02:23:36,693 --> 02:23:39,822
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1960
02:23:39,905 --> 02:23:43,492
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1961
02:23:43,575 --> 02:23:45,661
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1962
02:23:45,744 --> 02:23:49,540
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when
motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1963
02:23:51,208 --> 02:23:54,837
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1964
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:58,298
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1965
02:23:58,382 --> 02:24:00,300
But I don't want that.

1966
02:24:00,384 --> 02:24:02,302
And you don't want that.

1967
02:24:02,386 --> 02:24:05,097
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1968
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:07,307
So let's see what we can do.

1969
02:24:09,101 --> 02:24:12,938
Now... here's the situation.

1970
02:24:13,021 --> 02:24:16,859
Normally both your asses
would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...

1971
02:24:16,942 --> 02:24:19,862
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period...

1972
02:24:19,945 --> 02:24:22,364
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1973
02:24:22,447 --> 02:24:27,202
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1974
02:24:27,286 --> 02:24:30,372
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1975
02:24:30,455 --> 02:24:33,375
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1976
02:24:33,458 --> 02:24:35,294
Vincent!

1977
02:24:35,377 --> 02:24:38,297
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1978
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:41,091
It's cool! We still just talkin'.

1979
02:24:41,175 --> 02:24:44,595
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me.

1980
02:24:44,678 --> 02:24:47,472
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1981
02:24:47,556 --> 02:24:49,474
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1982
02:24:49,558 --> 02:24:51,476
Tell her it's still cool.

1983
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:54,438
- It's still cool, honey bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1984
02:24:55,898 --> 02:24:58,525
I gotta go pee.

1985
02:24:58,609 --> 02:25:00,527
I wanna go home.

1986
02:25:00,611 --> 02:25:04,198
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1987
02:25:04,281 --> 02:25:07,201
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1988
02:25:07,284 --> 02:25:10,621
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

1989
02:25:10,704 --> 02:25:12,581
I love you too, honey bunny.

1990
02:25:12,664 --> 02:25:17,920
Now, I want you to go
in that bag and find my wallet.

1991
02:25:20,422 --> 02:25:23,967
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says bad motherfucker.

1992
02:25:38,649 --> 02:25:42,027
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

1993
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:44,404
Open it up. Take out the money.

1994
02:25:49,952 --> 02:25:51,620
Count it.

1995
02:25:57,918 --> 02:26:00,462
How much is there?

1996
02:26:02,339 --> 02:26:04,258
About 1,500 dollars.

1997
02:26:04,341 --> 02:26:07,511
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

1998
02:26:07,594 --> 02:26:10,806
Now, with the rest of those wallets
and the register...

1999
02:26:10,889 --> 02:26:12,975
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2000
02:26:13,058 --> 02:26:15,185
Jules, you give that
fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...

2001
02:26:15,269 --> 02:26:16,937
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2002
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:19,940
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2003
02:26:20,023 --> 02:26:22,609
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2004
02:26:22,693 --> 02:26:26,571
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2005
02:26:26,655 --> 02:26:29,574
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.

2006
02:26:29,658 --> 02:26:31,535
I'm bu yin' something for my money.

2007
02:26:32,828 --> 02:26:35,998
- Wanna know what I'm bu yin', Ringo?
- What?

2008
02:26:36,081 --> 02:26:40,794
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2009
02:26:40,877 --> 02:26:43,547
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2010
02:26:44,673 --> 02:26:46,591
Not regularly, no.

2011
02:26:46,675 --> 02:26:49,052
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2012
02:26:49,136 --> 02:26:52,681
Ezekiel 25:17.

2013
02:26:52,764 --> 02:26:56,018
“The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2014
02:26:56,101 --> 02:26:59,563
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

2015
02:26:59,646 --> 02:27:03,025
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will...

2016
02:27:03,108 --> 02:27:05,527
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness...

2017
02:27:05,610 --> 02:27:09,698
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2018
02:27:09,781 --> 02:27:14,077
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2019
02:27:14,161 --> 02:27:17,205
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2020
02:27:17,289 --> 02:27:20,292
And you will know I am the Lord...

2021
02:27:20,375 --> 02:27:23,045
when I lay my vengeance upon you.”

2022
02:27:25,047 --> 02:27:27,466
I been ea yin' that shit for years...

2023
02:27:27,549 --> 02:27:30,677
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2024
02:27:30,761 --> 02:27:33,680
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2025
02:27:33,764 --> 02:27:36,683
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2026
02:27:36,767 --> 02:27:39,186
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2027
02:27:39,269 --> 02:27:41,688
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2028
02:27:42,773 --> 02:27:45,692
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...

2029
02:27:45,776 --> 02:27:50,655
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man...

2030
02:27:50,739 --> 02:27:53,658
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2031
02:27:53,742 --> 02:27:57,287
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2032
02:27:57,371 --> 02:27:59,289
Or it could mean...

2033
02:27:59,373 --> 02:28:02,793
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd...

2034
02:28:02,876 --> 02:28:06,797
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2035
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,132
Yeah, I'd like that.

2036
02:28:09,216 --> 02:28:12,094
But that shit ain't the truth.

2037
02:28:12,177 --> 02:28:14,054
The truth is...

2038
02:28:15,097 --> 02:28:17,766
you're the weak...

2039
02:28:18,433 --> 02:28:21,812
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2040
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:25,190
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2041
02:28:26,441 --> 02:28:31,113
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2042
02:28:47,045 --> 02:28:48,964
Go.

2043
02:29:07,149 --> 02:29:09,109
I think we should be leaving now.

2044
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,611
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
