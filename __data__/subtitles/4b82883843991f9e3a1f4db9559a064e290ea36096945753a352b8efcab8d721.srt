00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,106
<i>You lost your adolescent already?</i>

4
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,317
<i>This will complicate matters...</i>

5
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>A young one is on the way,</i>

6
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:38,534
<i>but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.</i>

7
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,036
Mr. König.

8
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,483
Good afternoon.

9
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,071
Good afternoon, Mr. König.

10
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm sorry.

11
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,482
<i>Hello. It's nice to meet you.</i>

12
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,692
The pleasure is all mine.

13
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,031
<i>Yes.</i>
- "Yes", she says!

14
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,553
Can I go now?

15
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,554
No.

16
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,142
You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.

17
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,016
I'm so sorry.

18
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,851
No problem.

19
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,682
Good luck tonight!

20
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,394
<i>Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?
I can see the light from...</i>

21
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,661
Yes, okay. Call me back.

22
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,209
Damn it.

23
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,755
Shit.

24
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,844
Where are you?

25
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,682
Where are you? Come here.

26
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,128
<i>Yes?</i>

27
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,132
<i>Yes, yes, I'm coming.</i>

28
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,442
<i>I told you I'm coming!</i>

29
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,873
That's very cool.

30
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,087
No, it's not.

31
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,755
What are you doing here?

32
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,924
What do you think? You imbecile!

33
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,552
We can't, not here.
We're leaving. Now!

34
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,722
Why? I'm cleaning
this fuck-pad all the time!

35
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,565
I beg you!

36
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,737
You'll have to make it up to me.

37
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,073
I promise.

38
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,496
Okay, fine.

39
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,375
Let me dry my hair, then we can go.

40
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,432
I know how you can make it up to me!

41
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:03,047
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

42
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,980
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

43
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,878
<i>No, no! Stay focused!</i>

44
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,666
That's enough for today.

45
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,647
Come here.

46
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:11,134
It is always something of a confirmation
of my dreams and good intentions.

47
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,570
I told him, not in the house.

48
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,218
Stay here.

49
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,614
No!

50
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,111
Everything's fine.

51
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,365
Everything's fine.

52
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:05,103
We're in the middle of an experiment.

53
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,605
<i>What happened? You're bleeding.</i>

54
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,234
The recordings you made
behind my back...

55
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,612
Are they still under the staircase
at your house?

56
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,873
I'm sorry, Danielle.

57
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,173
Mr. König!

58
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:53,847
I'm sorry.

59
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:05,109
I would never hurt you.

60
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:17,996
We have to leave now.

61
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,767
My mom called.

62
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:52,156
She got your message.

63
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,791
Will she come to visit?
