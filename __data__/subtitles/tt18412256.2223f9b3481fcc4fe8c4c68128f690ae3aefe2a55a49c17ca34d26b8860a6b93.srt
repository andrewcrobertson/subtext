to get us to Yvaga.

179
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,600
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

180
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,010
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

181
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,550
Decommissioned ships
still carry

182
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,810
tons of functional equipment.

183
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,240
And the hyperlink shows

184
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,410
that ship
still has a few pods left.

186
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,320
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

187
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,920
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

188
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,430
Before someone else does.

-Well, of course we are.
-[man] No. No, we're not.

what do you need me for?

-Andy?

[Bjorn] Mm-hmm.

198
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,850
[man] He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

199
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,250
He can access
a terminal on the ship

200
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,950
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

201
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
It's the only way to get in.

202
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,490
Okay,
but what if we get caught?

203
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,390
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

204

Right, Rain's not comin'.

205

Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

206
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

207
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,560
He's not your
brother though, is he?

208
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

210
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,530
that your dad
found in the trash.

211
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,980
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

-[Bjorn] What?

-I didn't say anything.
-[man] Rain, wait.

215
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,650
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

216
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,780

all right?

217
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,610
But he is right
about something.

218
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,620
You need to wake up.

219
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Because this company,

220
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,120
they're not gonna
give us anything.

221
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,960
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,430
[Tyler] The signal's
coming from in here.

527
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,510
[Rain] Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

528
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,310
[Tyler] Yeah.

529
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,510
[Rain]<i> Doesn't look</i>
<i> decommissioned to me.</i>

530
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,780
[Tyler] No, it doesn't.

531
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,010
But it's definitely deserted.

-[Taser powering up]
-Hey, Andy, look at this.

533
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,320
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

534
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,620
if I just amp up the juices.

535
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,750
[crackling]

536
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,600
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

537
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,820
[Tyler] All right, enough.

538
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,990
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

539
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,900
[gasping] It's a joke.
I was joking.

540
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,200
What the fuck?

541
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,630
Watch out.

542
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,350
[Tyler]<i> Shit.</i>

543
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,310
It's only a synthetic.

Fuck. [exhales]

546
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,190

there for a second.

[Navarro]
<i> What happened in there?</i>

548
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,030
[Tyler] Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

549
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,100
The fuel must be in that room.

550
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,760
Let's grab it
and get the fuck out of here.

551

[Tyler] Bjorn,
take the torch please.

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,790
[Bjorn] I don't think
there's any pods in here.

556
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,170
[Tyler] Nah,
just cooling equipment.

557
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,240
Uses the same type of fuel,
though.

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,470

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,550
-Ready?
-[Bjorn] Uh-huh.

[alarm blares]

571
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,640
I can't feel my fingers.

-What's happening?
-[Bjorn]<i> Fuck.</i>

574
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,380
[Tyler] Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

575
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,050
Andy, the door.

576
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,760
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

577
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,150
What does that mean?

578
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,500
[Tyler] Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

579
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,360
So you're trying
to tell me that

580
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,820
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

581
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,900
but can't open
a random fucking door

582
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,130
to a random room?

583
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,400
Well, obviously,
that's no random room.

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,570

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,400
[Navarro] Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

588
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,360
If Andy
can't open those doors,

589
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,440
I doubt
we'll have better luck.

590
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,760
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic

591
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,910
and we're just trespassing.

593
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,040
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

Hey, what are you doing?

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,860
If this module
is still working,

601
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,500
I can try to transfer
its credentials to Andy.

602
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,770
A higher clearance
should open that door.

1228

01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,510
All right.
Aim it towards Andy.

1232
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,740
Pull the trigger halfway.

1233

Aiming assistance.

1237
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,320
If that thing
comes towards you,

1238
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,890
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

1239

-Uh...

Games and magazines.

1241
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,660
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

1242

450 rounds.

1243
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,300
[Andy] And you mustn't fire
a single one.

1244
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:12,300
Acid for blood. Remember?

1245
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,040
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

1246
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,870
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

1247
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,240
You shoot that creature

1248
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:21,040
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

1249
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:22,620
And we all die.

1250
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,980
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

1251
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,980
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

1252
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,560
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

1253
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,390
Maybe.

1254
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,660

So you do something.

What choice do I have?

We take her back to the hauler

1312

and we put her
in the cryo-pod. Okay?

1313
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,850
That will keep her alive
