about railways

to watch the dickey bird.

23
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,457

- Yes.

That's not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

32

Yes!

33
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,457
It's still not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

34
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,999
YES!

35
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,665
Yes, I certainly do!

36
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,499
Mmm, it smells gorgeous.

37
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,624
It's fabulous,
absolutely fabulous.

00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,665
Now altogether... one, two, three.

39
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,832
Well done!

40
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,374
Happy Christmas!

41
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,374

00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,999
Dad... it's perfect.

48
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,082
It's more perfect
than any one could ever dream of.

49
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,499
Thank you, Dad.

50
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,040

came quite suddenly. '

51
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,624
You heaving brute!

52
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,040
'And that was the last we saw
of poor Potts. '

53
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,499
What a wreck!

54
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,249
- Is there any hope?
- Hope?

55
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:37,249
Of course, it'll want hope yes,
and a new valve.

56
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,832
I'll tell you what, I'll give up
Saturday afternoon to it.

57
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,457
Yes, and you can help me.

58
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,999
I hate doing a job like this
especially at Christmas.

59
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,665
Who on earth is that?

60
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,749
An Englishman's house is his castle, but
I wish they had moats and drawbridges!

61
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,624
Come in.

62
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,249
Yes?

63
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,999
Please, sir. There are two gentlemen
wish to see you.

64
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,790
I've shown them into the study, sir,
I hope that was all right?

65
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,165
Excuse me.

66
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,915
I wish we did have
a moat and drawbridge.

67
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,665
Then if we didn't want anyone to...

68
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,332
I've never heard anything
so preposterous. When? Who?

69
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,582
- Why's Daddy shouting?
- I don't know, dear.

70
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,124
Come in.

71
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,082
Yes, Ruth?

72
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,249
What is it?

73
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:46,040
Please, ma'am, the Master wants you
to just step into the study.

74
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:07,665
Look, I'm not going to say a thing!

75
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,332
Come in.

76
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,040
I will not!

77
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,624
All right, cabby,
Scotland Yard.

78
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,207
It's bed-time.

79
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,290
Ruth will put you to bed.

80
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,165
But you promised we could stay up late.
Daddy was going to play with us.

81
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,790
Father's been
called away... on business.

82
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,457
Go up at once darlings, please.

83
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,665
It wasn't bad news,
was it, Mummy?

84
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,499
Is anyone dead or...

85
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,249
Oh, no, nobody's dead.

86
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,082
I can't tell you anything about it tonight.
Up you go.

87
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,457
96... 97... 98... 99... 100.

88
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,624
Well, good night then.

89
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,957
Ruth!

90
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,582
What's up?

91
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,499
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

92
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,124
You'll know soon enough.

93
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,290
- Phyl?
- Yes.

94
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,915
If Mother doesn't want us to know
she's been crying then we won't know.

95
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,082
- That's all.
- All right.

96
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,749
She's gone into London,
that's all I know.

97
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,499
Now just you eat up.

98
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:25,165
Some dire calamity's happening,
I just know it.

99
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,165
Good evening, Mrs Waterbury.

100
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,915
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Sally.

101
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,582
Oh, it's so cold!
Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.

102
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,624
My darlings, those men last night
did bring very bad news

103
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,415
and Father will be away
for some time

104
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,790
Is it something to do
with the Government, Mummy?

105
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,165
Yes... yes, it is.

106
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,582
Now it's bed time, my darlings.

107
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,374
And don't worry.
It will all come right in the end.

108
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,665
Don't you worry either
because we'll be as good as gold.

109
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,707
Oh, we used to say life was so dull...
Nothing ever happened like in books.

110
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,332
Now something has happened.

111
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,790
Yes, it has
and it's made Mother unhappy.

112
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,790
Everything's horrid...

113
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,457
...just horrid.

114
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,457

00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,457
- Er, do you know the way?
- I daresay.

174
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,749
- Well, will you show us?
- I daresay.

175
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,665
- Phyllis, are you all right?
- Yes.

176
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,915
Can't we put just one box
on your cart?

177
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,582
You asked me to show you the way,
nothing was said about boxes.

178
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,999
Never mind, darlings.
It's only a few more yards.

179
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,207
Whoa!

180
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,582
I wonder why she didn't leave
the lights on.

181
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,082
Who is she?

182
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,540
Mrs Viney, The woman I engaged
to clean the place and to get the supper.

183
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,040
I expect Mrs Viney's gone home.

184
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,707
Your train was late, see.

185
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,249
But she's got the key.
What do we do?

186
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,790
She'll have left that
under the doorstep.

187
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:14,082
- We all do hereabouts.
- Well you might have said so.

188
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,707
You never asked, did you?

189
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,040
Nothing was said
about a door key.

190
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,040
- May I borrow your lamp, please?
- I daresay.

191
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,082
If you say "I daresay" once more,
I shall have hysterics, I daresay

192
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,790
Oh... there we are.

193
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,832
What's that?

194
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,249
It's only the rats.

195
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:14,624
God works in mysterious ways
his wonders to perform.

196
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,332
Ow!
Rats!

197
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,415
I wish we hadn't come.
Don't you worry, darlings.

198
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:34,582
I saw a paraffin lamp on the table,
we'll soon have some light.

199
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,665
Oh, those poor little mice,
they were so frightened.

200
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,915
I don't believe they were rats at all.

201
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,499
You've often said you wanted
something to happen, well now it has.

202
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,999
It's quite exciting, isn't it?

203
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,457
I told Mrs Viney to get
some meat and bread

204
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,040
and have some supper ready.
I wonder where...

205
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,249
Oh, I suppose she's laid it
in the dining room.

206
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,290
Come along darlings, up here.
Let's go and see.

207
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,915
Come along.

208
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,957
Oh darlings, mind the steps.
Mind how you go, Peter.

209
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,124
Oh, that beastly woman!

210
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,332
She's taken the money
and not left us any food.

211
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,707
Aren't we going to have
any supper tonight? I'm starving!

212
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,249
I know! There's some food
in the cases in the cellar.

213
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:36,415
Aunt Emma sent them on
ahead of us. Come along.

214
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,790
Mind the step.

215
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,665
Come along, Bobbie,
it's a real feast.

216
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,915
Sardines, biscuits, ginger.

217
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,540
Raisins...

218
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,999
No Phyl, no! You do not put
the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.

219
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,915
Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.

220
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,665
Tell you what,
let's drink Aunt Emma's health.

221
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,499
- Good idea.
- Here's to Aunt Emma.

222
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,499
- To Aunt Emma.
- Aunt Emma.

223
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,915
And all who sail in her.

224
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,332
- Oh! What's that, Mummy?
- Pie.

225
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,249
- Pie?
- Apple Pie.

226
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,124
Apple pie for breakfast?
Then we're not poor after all.

227
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,999
This is the supper
we should have had.

228
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,832
I found it in that little room
that we thought was a cupboard,

229
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,124
so Mrs Viney wasn't so bad
after all.

230
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,457
- Good morning, can I help you?
- I expect so. Viney's the name.

231
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,915
Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.

232
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,290
Do come in.
We're just been talking about you.

233
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:54,124
Oh, I see you found your supper then.
Funny time to have it though.

234
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,707
It was like a great dragon
tearing by.

235
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,915
A dragon's house
looks like that tunnel.

236
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,290
I never thought we'd ever get so near
to a train as this.

237
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,707
- It's better than toy engines, isn't it?
- I don't know, it's different.

238
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,332
It seems so odd to see all of a train.
It's so tall.

239
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,915
I've always seen them cut
in half by platforms

240
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,124
I wonder if that train's going to London?
London is where Daddy is.

241
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,665
- We don't know that, Phyl.
- He might be.

242
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,290
Oh! Ahem.

243
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,290
- How do you do?
- Eh?

244
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,457
- How do you do?
- Yes.

245
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,332
- Could I ask you two questions?
- Yes, well it depends what they are.

246
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,749
I can't spend all day conversationalising
with the junior public.

247
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,332
Now what are they?

248
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,707
What's the white mark
on the coal heap for?

249
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,540
That's to tell you how much coal there is
you see, in case anybody nicks it.

250
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:33,707
Second question, please.

251
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,749
Do you know anything
about engines?

252
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,707
Do I know anything about engines?
Why?

253
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,415
- Because I've got one.
- Er, what gauge?

254
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:44,124
I don't know anything about gauges,
but it's about this big.

255
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,290
Yes?

256
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,957
- It's brass and it blew up.
- It blew up.

257
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,165
Well just excuse me young man,
I've got a lot to do

258
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,749
cos the Station Master's
having his hair cut in Leeds, you see

259
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,290
and Perks must be about it.

260
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:58,665
- Perks? Who's Perks?
- Me, sir. I'm Perks.

261
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,207
Right on time.

262
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:22,290
- What is?
- This ere's the Scots Flyer.

263
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,165
Why is it going so slowly,
Mr Perks?

264
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:43,415
Why... well it's all up hill
to Scotland, isn't it?

265
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,124
That train's going to Scotland.

266
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,290
If Daddy's not in London,
he's in Scotland

267
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,915
and that train is going to Scotland.

268
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,082
Perhaps, Phyl.

269
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:04,082
I don't think we're going to enjoy
being poor, you know,

270
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,624
being cold and all that.

271
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,707
Phyllis, try to imagine it
as an adventure.

272
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:15,040
All sorts of things might happen.

273
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,165
Mother could write about it.

274
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,790
Write a book.
You never know.

275
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:24,290
We won't always be poor, Phyllis,
I'm sure.

276
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,790
All right. Good night.

277
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,415
Good night.

278
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,624
I'm still cold though.

279
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,582
...lightly on the-cheek.

280
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:44,832
...one of the men, in a bowler hat,
opened the door...

281
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:49,582
Father did not turn,
but left without a word.

282
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,332
Why don't we ask the next train
to take our love to Daddy?

283
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,374
Trains don't carry people's love,
they'd be above that.

284
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,165
Yes, they do if you tame them first.

285
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,207
I wonder why Daddy
hasn't written to us.

286
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,207
Mummy says he's too busy.
he'll write soon, she says.

287
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,332
Well, why don't we wave anyway?
Three waves won't matter.

288
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,374
We won't miss them.

289
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,415
Charming...

290
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,499
Charming!

291
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,165
About time they had it seen to.

292
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,290
The coal in the little shed
has held out well, Bobbie.

293
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,957
There was hardly any there yesterday
when I looked.

294
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,540
Well, we've only had one fire.

295
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:58,290
I know but I could swear there's more
than when we first came.

296
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:24,624
- That's silly.
- Course it's silly.

297
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,999
So it's you, Pete.

298
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,082
- It's you.
- It's me what?

299
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,665
It's you that's been putting
the coal in the shed.

300
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,707
But where from Pete,
for heaven's sake?

301
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,582
From the coal heap of course,
they've got stacks of it there.

302
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:42,707
But that's stealing!
Don't you remember your catechism?

303
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,707
"Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"

304
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,165
It wasn't stealing.
It was mining.

305
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,999
I took from the top.
That's mining, not stealing.

306
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,207
If it was, all the miners in the world
would be in jug.

307
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,999
Oh, Pete... Pete!

308
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,374
Oh Pete, Pete.

309
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,290
We'll have to take it all back.

310
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,332
- What?
- All of it.

311
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,165
- All of it.
- All of it!

312
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,790
All of it.

313
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,249
There can't be anything wrong in trying
to keep your own mother warm.

314
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,957
That can't be wrong.

315
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,457
It's all right Pete,
at least we can burn the evidence.

316
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,457
Mrs Viney, here we are.
I've got the buns for tea.

317
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,582
- Buns?
- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...

318
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,332
Mrs Viney, what's the matter?

319
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:35,249
It's your dear ma, master Peter,
she's... she's very poorly.

320
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,749
You'd better go back to the village
and get Dr Forrest.

321
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,790
Right.

322
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,874
Don't let her die, Mrs Viney.

323
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,832
Doctor Forrest!

324
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,499
Ahem!

325
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,915
Mother's very ill,
please come quickly,

326
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,957
Stay there, my boy.

327
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,207
Influenza.

328
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,790
But not serious.

329
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:46,540
Now my Lady Grave-airs,
I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?

330
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,457
- Of course, Doctor.
- Right.

331
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,165
Now we'll send down some medicine.
Keep a good fire going

332
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,165
and have some strong beef tea
ready to give her

333
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,290
the moment the fever goes down...

334
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,499
She can have the grapes now
and the soda water.

335
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,957
Oh, and you'd better get
a bottle of brandy.

336
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,165
You can go in now...

337
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,165
May I have the list?

338
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,707
Don't worry, funny face.

339
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:14,040
She's head nurse
but you can be Matron.

340
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,957
Oh, thank you.

341
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,624
Oh, what utter nonsense,
I can't afford all that.

342
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,582
I haven't an idea in my head
for a story

343
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:27,374
so there won't even be buns
for tea for some time.

344
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,790
Tell Mrs Viney to boil some scrag-end
of neck for your dinner tomorrow

345
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:35,165
then I'll have some of the broth.

346
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,040
But even if we never have
anything to eat at all

347
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,290
you can't afford all those other things.

348
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:45,749
Right. So we've got to think
of some other way.

349
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,332
Now everybody, think.

350
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,415
Just as hard as ever you can,

351
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,082
think!

352
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,290
- I, O, N.
- You sure?

353
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,915
Yes.

354
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,832
I...

355
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,124
O...

356
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,499
N.
There. Brilliant.

357
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,290
"Look out at the station. "

358
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,082
Definitely one of your best works,
Michael Angelo.

359
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:49,040
Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

360
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,290
Oakworth!

361
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,165
Oakworth Station.

362
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,457
Oh, I thought I'd missed you.

363
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,374
You are the man who waves to us,
aren't you?

364
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,040
- Mind the doors, please.
- Aren't you?

365
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,374
- Yes my dear, I wave...
- Oh, will you take this, please.

366
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,582
We chose you because we thought
you had such a kind face.

367
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,707
Er, mind the doors please, Miss.
Sir. On the way, Mr, Mitchell.

368
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,374
Thank you, Mr Perks.

369
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,499
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

370
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,665
Good evening.

371
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:38,165
Oh dear!
Oh! Good evening.

372
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,707
The name's Perks.
I believe we've met.

373
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,749
Yes, you were busy’cause of
the Station Master being in Leeds.

374
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,665
Yes, even busier now
'cause he had a drop too much

375
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:51,290
down at the Britannia Arms and fell over
and broke his daft leg playing billiards.

376
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,165
- Of course it was his own fault.
- Why?

377
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,915
He should've used the rest.

378
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,957
He will do that
over the edge, you see.

379
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,457
The old gent asked me
to fetch this up straight away.

380
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:00,790
Thank you very much, Mr Perks.

381
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,915
I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence
to give you like Father does, but...

382
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:08,582
Hey! Just stop that, please.
I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.

383
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:12,124
I just came to say I was sorry
to hear your mama wasn't so well

384
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,165
and to ask how she finds herself
this evening.

385
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,915
Oh and I've er, I brought her
a bit of sweet briar.

386
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,040
It's very sweet to smell that is.

387
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,915
Tuppence indeed.

388
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,665
Thank you very much and I beg
your pardon about the twopence.

389
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,415
No offences, I'm sure.
No offence.

390
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,040
And just to show I'll er,
I'll have a look

391
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,499
at that blown up brass engine
of yourn, shall I?

392
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,499
- What?
- Yes.

393
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,790
Oh, can you manage?
Bit heavy... Here you are.

394
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,457
Oh. Is that it?

395
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:50,624
Bit of a mess, isn't it?
Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.

396
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,790
- Good evening.
- Thank you, Mr Perks. Good night.

397
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,207
- Oh!
- Oh, look at that!

398
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,624
Oh, everything...

399
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,040
"Dear Roberta, Phyllis
and Peter,

400
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,290
"here are the things you want.

401
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,665
"Your mother will want to know
where they came from

402
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,457
"so please ask her to forgive me

403
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,790
"for taking the liberty
of allowing myself the great pleasure.

404
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:29,290
"Yours sincerely, G.P... Something. "
I can't read it.

405
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,082
I think we were right to ask him.

406
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,749
Right? Of course we're right.

407
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,957
I don't fancy telling Mother
the whole truth about this.

408
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,457
We shouldn't do that
until she's completely well.

409
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,082
And when she is, we'll be so happy
we shan't mind the fuss.

410
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,457
Oh, look at those roses!

411
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,082
I'll take them up to her.

412
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:53,707
- And the sweetbriar.
- Oh, thank you.

413
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,957
Cor, look!
I wonder what's in there.

414
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,082
So that's an end to it! Now listen.
It's true, we're poor,

415
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,040
but we shall have enough to live on
as long as I have ideas for stories.

416
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:28,499
But you mustn't go about telling people
of our affairs. It isn't right!

417
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:33,457
And you must never, never, never
ask strangers to give you things.

418
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,624
Always remember that.

419
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,624
- Yes, Mother.
- I shall write to your old gentleman

420
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,665
and I shall tell him
that I didn't approve.

421
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,999
I shall thank him too,
of course, for his kindness,

422
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,665
but it you that I don't approve of,
not the old gentleman.

423
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,332
He's been extremely kind.

424
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,582
You can give my letter to your Mr Perks
to give to him.

425
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,374
And we won't say any more about it.

426
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,457
Isn't she marvellous
when she's angry?

427
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,790
Hello, head-nurse.

428
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:27,290
That's funny, I was thinking about you.
I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.

429
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:31,665
- Your mother's not worse I hope?
- No, but...

430
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:34,457
Come on, we'll go for a ride.

431
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,999
This is great fun.

432
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,790
Come on, out with it, head-nurse.
What's the trouble?

433
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:08,165
It's rather hard, you see, to’out with it'
because of what Mother said.

434
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,832
What did Mother say?

435
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:13,165
She said I wasn't to go telling everyone
that we're poor.

436
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:17,832
- But you aren't everyone, are you?
- Not at all. Well?

437
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:20,332
Well, I know doctors
are very expensive

438
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:24,082
and Mrs Viney told me that her doctor
only cost her twopence a week

439
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,165
- because she belonged to a club.
- Yes.

440
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,332
Well, could we join
your club too, please?

441
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,582
The same as Mr Viney.

442
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,332
You aren't cross with me, are you?

443
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,957
Cross? How could I be?
You're a very sensible little woman.

444
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,790
Now don't you worry.
I'll make it all right with your mother,

445
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,749
even if I have to make
a special brand-new club just for her.

446
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,415
Thank you.

447
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:58,332
Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up
in here.

448
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,082
Here's a new ribbon for you.

449
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,165
There, the surprise is ready.

450
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,540
When the bell rings again
you can come into the dining room.

451
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,249
Come on, Pete.

452
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,790
Of course.

453
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,915
Happy birthday.

454
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,457
Happy birthday, head-nurse.

455
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,832
Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.

456
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,290
My darling.

457
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,790
I helped to make it.

458
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:12,332
Happy birthday, Lanky.

Lanky indeed!

465
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,915
Fatty.

466

- Hope you enjoy the cake.

- Have a lovely party, my dear.
- Thank you for coming.

468
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,665
Thank you.

469
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,207
Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?

Thank you very much,

Good night, good night.

472
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:13,415
Happy birthday!
Hey, happy birthday!

473
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,665
I hope Mother doesn't get too wet
in Wakefield.

474
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,665
We don't want her ill again.

475
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,332
It's like being in a besieged castle,

476
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:18,499
the arrows of the foe striking
against the battlements.

477
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,665
No, it's more
like a great big garden-squirt.

478
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,040
- You're a great big garden squirt
- Thank you.

479
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,374
Stop it you two!
There's a train coming.

480
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,707
Oakworth! Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

481
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,332
Oakworth Station!

482
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,665
Come on. Don't mind the rain,
it's only a shower.

483
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:54,832
That's it, thank you.

484
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:58,832
Mind the doors, please.
Mind the doors now.

485
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,999
Mind the doors, come on.

486
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,624
Right away, Mr Mainprice

487
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,707
Mother should be on the next train
in about fifteen minutes.

488
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:11,249
That one was from London, I think.

489
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,707
Hey, there's something going
at the end of the station.

490
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,457
Yes, something's happened,
come on.

491
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,249
If you ask me this is a case
for the police courts.

492
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,457
No, the infirmary more like.

493
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,374
Let me pass please, will you?
I'll deal with this if you please.

494
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:29,374
- What's he say?
- Sounds like French to me.

495
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,207
I was in Calais once for a day.

496
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:35,499
- That's not French.
- Well what is it then if it's not French?

497
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,165
I don't know.
It's not French, I know that.

498
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:44,165
No, that's not French.
Nothing like it.

499
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,999
Try him with French if you know
so much then, clever dick.

500
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,499
Parlez vous français, Monsieur?

501
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:55,290
Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!
Enfin un amis.

502
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:58,999
Mon petit vous ne soures jamais
combien je suis content.

503
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,790
- Now that's French.
- What's he say?

504
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:02,999
I don't know...

505
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,665
Yes, well all right everybody.

506
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,332
Keep moving along, please.
I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.

507
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,957
All right now, now, now...
Go on.

508
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,040
Take him into the waiting room.
Mother can talk French.

509
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,415
She's on the next train
from Wakefield.

510
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,665
Right. Come on.

511
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,124
He thinks you're a policeman.
He thinks you're going to shut him up.

512
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,665
I know he does.
Look at his eyes.

513
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:29,082
They're like a fox's eyes
when the beast is in a trap.

514
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,957
Vous attendre.
Ma mere parlez français.

515
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,165
Nous...

516
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:42,332
- What's "being kind"?
- Er, "bon" is good.

517
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:45,624
Nous sommes bon
pour vous, Monsieur.

518
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:57,457
Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at
the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.

519
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:03,082
C'est bon.
Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.

520
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,499
Je vous aide.

521
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,665
Look I'm not sure
we oughtn't to send for police.

522
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,665
- Don't!
- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.

523
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:10,832
She speaks French beautifully.
You'd love to hear her.

524
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,540
I'm sure he hasn't done anything
like you're sent to prison for.

525
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:17,165
Yes, well he looks
without visible means to me.

526
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,957
Still I don't mind waiting
till your mama comes.

527
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,999
I'd like to know what country
has got the credit of him.

528
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,499
Look, I've got an idea.
Foreign stamps.

529
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,082
We'll show them these.

530
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:32,582
Regardes les stamps.
Quelle patrie?

531
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,582
Ah... Ruskie...

532
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:39,040
- Ruskie.
- My lord, he's Russian.

533
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,332
Yeah, I-I thought he was.

534
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,332
I'll wait here
till you bring Mummy in.

535
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,040
Not afraid?

536
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,582
No.

537
00:50:56,916 --> 00:51:00,665
Oakworth Station! Mrs Waterbury,
I have something to tell you.

538
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,457
- Mummy, we found a Russian.
- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.

539
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,582
Close the doors.
Right away, Guard!

540
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,582
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

541
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:15,249
Hello, Bobbie.
Qui est vous?

542
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,790
Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.

543
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:23,165
Oh, it's all right.
Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.

544
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,665
- We'll take him home with us, Mr Perks.
- Thank you, Madam.

545
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,165
Come on, help him on the other side.
Don't worry.

546
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:33,290
Don't worry, she'll look after you.

547
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,832
I knew he was a Russian.

548
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,457
Doctor.

549
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:44,165
I need to tell you.
Mother's got a very shabby Russian.

550
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,832
Your mother's got
a very shabby what?

551
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:49,165
He'll have to join your club.
I'm certain he hasn't any money.

552
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:51,665
We found him at the station.

553
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,040
- Found him? Was he lost then?
- Yes, that's what he was.

554
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,707
He's been telling Mother
life story in French.

555
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,874
She said would you please
come directly.

556
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,665
He's got a nasty cough

557
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:02,290
and he's been crying.

558
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,207
Oh, don't smile.

559
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,165
Please don't.

560
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,124
You wouldn't if you'd seen him.

561
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,332
I've never seen a man cry before.

562
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,874
Haven't you?
I do it all the time.

563
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,499
Bobbie!

564
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,749
I know you said
we weren't to ask any questions

565
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,749
but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?

566
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:21,582
Oh, my darling, no.

567
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:24,165
Bobbie, look at me.

568
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:28,165
Daddy was quite, quite well
when I heard from him last

569
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,499
and he'll come back to us
some day.

570
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,124
Do tell us about the Russian.

571
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:44,832
That can't make a long story, my darling,
because I'm very tired.

572
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:48,790
He's a very clever writer,
but in Russia one dare not say

573
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:51,540
anything about the rich people
doing wrong

574
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,499
or what ought to be done
for the poor.

575
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,540
If one does, one is sent to prison.

576
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,832
Well he wrote a book about it all

577
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,707
and he was three years in a dungeon.

578
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:05,165
No light, damp and dreadful.

579
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,749
Then they took him out
and they sent him to Siberia

580
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,290
and he was condemned
to stay there for life.

581
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:13,999
- For life? For writing a book?
- That's stupid.

582
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,499
Go on, Mama.

583
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,749
While he was at the mines,
some friends got a message to him

584
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:23,540
to say that his wife and children
had escaped to England.

585
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:28,374
So after many adventures he too escaped
and came here to look for them.

586
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,457
- Do you think he will find them?
- Oh, I do hope so.

587
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,790
I think my darlings, in your prayers
you might ask God

588
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:39,790
to show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives.

589
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:44,040
To show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives?

590
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,957
Yes, darling.
Upon all the prisoners and captives.

591
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:03,374
Merci.

592
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:12,582
He seemed pleased. I wish we could think
of other things to give him.

593
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,374
What about strawberries?

594
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,082
Perks promised me some
from his own garden ages ago.

595
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,707
Look at that tree over there!

596
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,040
Lor, it's moving!

597
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,832
So are the others...

598
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,249
It's magic.

599
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:07,957
What is it?

600
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:16,290
It's much too magic for me.
I don't like it, I'm going home.

601
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,499
Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.

602
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,999
Hey! The 11:29 down
hasn't gone by yet.

603
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,332
We must let them know at the station,
there'll be an accident.

604
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:13,749
- Let's run!
- No, come back.

605
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,790
It's too late, it's two miles away.

606
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:19,665
- We do something to the telegraph wires.
- But we don't know how.

607
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,707
If we only had something red, we could
go down on to the line and wave it.

608
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:30,540
But the train wouldn't see us till it came
round the corner. That's too late.

609
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,540
We could go round
and wave to the train.

610
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:34,290
We might wave anyway.

611
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:37,832
No. They'd only think it was us as usual,
we've waved so often before.

612
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,040
- Flannel petticoats!
- I beg your pardon?

613
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,457
- Flannel petticoats.
- Of course! Take them off.

614
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:59,374
- Now.
- You're not going to tear them, Pete?

615
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,499
- Oh, shut up
- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.

616
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:06,665
If we can't stop the train,
there'll be an accident with people killed.

617
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,665
Now sticks, come on.

618
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:35,499
- I'll have two. It was my idea.
- They're our petticoats!

619
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,207
What's it matter who waves what
if we can only stop the train.

620
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,790
Stand firm and wave like mad.

621
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,874
Keep off the line, Bobbie.

622
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,707
They won't see us.
It's all no good.

623
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,624
- Stand off the line, Bobbie.
- It's all no good.

624
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,790
- Stand back!
- Not yet. Not yet!

625
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,915
- Stop!
- Stop!

626
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,874
Stop!

627
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,332
- Stand back.
- Stop!

628
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,499
Stop!

629
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,624
- Stop!
- Stop!

630
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,290
Stop.

631
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:41,499
Stop...

632
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,165
Stop.

633
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:52,665
Stop. There's been an earthquake.
Don't move you'll all be killed.

634
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:57,915
The trees are walking down the bank
and there's a mountain of great stones.

635
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:17,457
We'll have a look at this earthquake
then get back to the train.

636
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,707
Bobbie.

637
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:26,374
Ladies and gentlemen, I think
you'll agree with me that we have three

638
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:32,582
charming children here
who are indeed an example to us all.

639
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,540
All right chaps, this is it.

640
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,874
One, two, three.

641
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:53,540
...I have learned
in the short time I have seen them

642
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:56,082
to look forward to knowing them better.

643
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,707
If I had to rename the Waterbury children,

644
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:03,582
I would call them
the Three Saviours of the Steel Road

645
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,165
or perhaps the Railway Children.

646
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:09,915
And now my dears, from the directors
of the Northern and Southern Railway

647
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:15,290
in grateful recognition
of a courageous and brave action

648
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,624
which averted an accident

649
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,540
on August 15th, 1905.

650
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:23,790
Oh, thank you.

651
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:46,374
It's your turn now.
Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".

652
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,082
- Oh, lor!
- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".

653
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,374
Ladies and gentlemen...

654
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

655
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:59,332
we shall treasure these watches
for the rest of our lives.

656
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,582
What I mean to say is,
thank you all very much indeed.

657
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:09,290
One, two.

658
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:28,082
You must be very proud,
Mrs Waterbury.

659
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,832
And er, this is from me.

660
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:23,207
It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?
The kind that very seldom happens.

661
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,999
But I did so want to talk to
the old gentleman about something else.

662
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,790
What did you want
to say to him?

663
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:31,874
I'll tell you,
I've written him a letter.

664
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,165
"My dearest old gentleman,
I want to ask you something, please.

665
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,499
"If you get out of the train
and go by the next it would do.

666
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:45,499
"I do not want you to give me anything -
Mother says we ought not to.

667
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:50,665
"Besides, we only want to talk to you
about a prisoner and captive.

668
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,290
"Your loving friend, Bobbie. "

669
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:55,499
Very good.
Yes, it is.

670
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:13,124
My heart's thumping like a steam engine,
right under my sash, too.

671
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,332
People's hearts
aren't under their sashes.

672
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,999
I don't care, mine is.

673
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:21,040
If you're going to talk like a poetry book,
my heart's in my mouth.

674
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:23,707
My heart's in my boots
if it comes to that.

675
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,290
- He'll think we're idiots.
- He won't be far wrong.

676
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:29,207
Oakworth!

677
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,207
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Perks.

678
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:40,332
- Hello. This is a very great pleasure.
- It was good of you to get out.

679
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:43,332
Er, may I extend a cordial invitation
to the use of my room, sir?

680
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,499
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir.

681
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,957
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

682
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,874
If you'd care to follow me, sir
just along here.

683
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:59,499
- Nice and tidy for you sir.
- Ah, thank you, Perks.

684
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:02,790
- I'll leave you to it then, sir.
- Thank you.

685
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,415
Well?

686
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,249
Well?
What is it?

687
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:18,124
- Oh, please...
- Yes?

688
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,374
- What I mean to say is...
- Yes?

689
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,790
- I wish I might say something.
- I wish you would say something.

690
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:29,040
Well then... it's about our Russian.

691
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,582
- Captive.
- A captive.

692
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,249
We want more than anything in the world
to find his wife and children for him.

693
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,624
Only we don't know how.

694
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:40,374
- What did you say his name was?
- I'll write it for you.

695
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:46,665
Um, would you have a pencil
and the back of an envelope?

696
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,207
Here, write it here.

697
01:05:55,875 --> 01:06:00,624
This is how you write it.
You say... Szczepansky.

698
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:10,999
That man?
Bless my soul...

699
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,499
I've read his book.

700
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:16,915
So your mother took him in
like the good Samaritan.

701
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:20,457
I'll tell you what, youngsters,
your mother must be a very good woman.

702
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,915
- Yes, she is.
- And you're a good man.

703
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:26,332
You flatter me.

704
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,207
Now am I to tell you
what I think of you?

705
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,957
- Oh, please don't.
- Why?

706
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,665
I don't know why exactly,

707
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:37,290
only if it's something horrid
I don't want you to.

708
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:41,499
And if it's something nice
I'd rather you didn't.

709
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:45,582
Then all I will say is that I'm very glad
you came to me about all this,

710
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:47,290
very glad indeed.

711
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:50,832
And I shouldn't be surprised
if I don't find out something very soon.

712
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:53,249
Well now tell me something
about yourselves.

713
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,290
Tea first.

714
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,415
Who on earth?

715
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:20,124
Let's go and see.

716
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:26,124
- Hello.
- Hello.

717
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,665
Hello.
Good news, my dears.

718
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,457
I've found your Russian friend's
wife and children.

719
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,457
- Oh!
- And I couldn't resist

720
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:37,332
the temptation of having the pleasure
of telling him

721
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,832
No, you tell him, my dear.

722
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:45,124
And the other two
will show me the way.

723
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:54,665
Mother, Mr Szczepansky's wife
and children have been found.

724
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,332
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

725
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,457
Goodbye.

726
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,165
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

727
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,624
Goodbye.

728
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:18,374
Excellent.

729
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,124
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

730
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:49,582
Ah! There, that's a likely
little brooch that.

731
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,374
I don't know as ever I seen a thing
more like a buttercup,

732
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,290
without it were a buttercup.

733
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,457
Mother gave it to me
for my birthday.

734
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:00,707
Oh, is that it?
I didn't see it close to.

735
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:04,124
It highly decorative that,
thank you.

736
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,499
- When's your birthday, Mr Perks?
- My birthday?

737
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,915
I gave up keeping my birthday
afore you lot were born.

738
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,499
But you must have been born
sometime, you know.

739
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:16,290
Even if it was 20 years ago
or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.

740
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:19,665
Yeah, well it weren't quite
so long as that.

741
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,457
If you really want to know,

742
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,249
it's my 42 years
come the 15th of this month.

743
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,540
Why don't you keep it then?

744
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,707
I've got other things to keep
besides birthdays.

745
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,790
Oh what?
Not secrets, Mr Perks.

746
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:36,665
No, the kids and bloomin' missus.

747
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,457
I've sold another story, darlings,
the one about the King of the Mussels

748
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,999
so there'll be buns for tea.

749
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:52,165
You can go and got them
the moment they're ready.

750
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:56,749
Would you mind if we didn't them tonight,
but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.

751
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,832
I don't mind, darling,
but why?

752
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,165
Well, it's Mr Perks' birthday,
he's 42.

753
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:05,415
He says he doesn't keep his birthday
any more, he's got other things to keep.

754
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:09,749
Not rabbits and secrets,
but the kids and the bloomin' missus.

755
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,874
- His wife and children, Bobbie.
- It's the same thing, isn't it?

756
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,790
Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ
of endearment, isn't it?

757
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,374
- Term of endearment, Phyl.
- Yes.

758
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,624
We thought we'd make
a nice birthday for him.

759
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,124
He's been very nice to us.

760
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,040
And we agreed that next bun day
we'd ask if we could.

761
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:28,332
It would be rather nice to write his name
on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?

762
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:32,165
- Perks isn't a very pretty name.
- Albert's his other name, I asked once.

763
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,874
I think Albert's a pretty name.

764
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,290
What's the matter with that?

765
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,540
What about flowers?

766
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:46,290
He's got lots of flowers of his own,
hasn't he?

767
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:49,290
Yes, but it's always nice
to be given them.

768
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,415
Let's all just sit and think.

769
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:56,040
No one's to speak
until they've thought of something.

770
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,165
- I've got it.
- What?

771
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:07,624
- Perks is so nice to everyone, right?
- Right.

772
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,332
So there must be lots of people
who'd like to help make him a birthday.

773
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:14,165
Mother said
we weren't to ask people for things.

774
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,499
For ourselves, she meant,
not for other people.

775
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,374
I think we should ask Mummy first.

776
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,040
There's no harm in it,
it depends how you do it.

777
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:24,374
I only hope Mr Perks won't be offended
and think it's charity.

778
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,332
Poor people can be very proud,
you know.

779
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:29,332
It's not because he's poor,
it's because we're fond of him.

780
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,874
All right, I'll look out some things
that Phyllis has outgrown.

781
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,499
- Will that do?
- I'm sure he'd love that.

782
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,707
Come back tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do.

783
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,707
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

784
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:40,999
Thank you, bye bye.

785
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,874
I've always liked Mrs Ransome.

786
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,124
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

787
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,832
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

788
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,957
Bye!

789
01:11:57,666 --> 01:12:00,999
’Some people were kind
and some were crusty

790
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:03,040
'and some would give
some would not. '

791
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:05,999
It's Mr Perks' birthday on Thursday,
would you like to give him a present?

792
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,832
- No, I would not. I hate the man.
- Thank you!

793
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,457
That was pretty rude.

794
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:17,332
’It's rather difficult work
asking for things, even for other people.

795
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,540
'as you've no doubt found
if you've ever tried it. '

796
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:22,832
Tobacco pipe,
half a pound of tea.

797
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:27,332
- Woollen scarf from the Drapers.
- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.

798
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:30,665
There it is, you can have it
and good riddance to it.

799
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,957
- Oh!
- Thank you.

800
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:38,499
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

801
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,749
Thank you, Mr James,
he'll love that.

802
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:48,957
Goodbye.

803
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,582
Hello?

804
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:11,499
Hello, is anyone at home?

805
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:14,165
Me Mam's upstairs,
a- changing herself.

806
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,082
Mam, visitors!

807
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:19,499
Thank you Patrick,
just coming.

808
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,707
I'm a bit late changing, Miss,

809
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,332
owing to me having had
an extra clean up today

810
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,165
along with Perks happening to say
it's his birthday.

811
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,915
I don't know what put such an idea
into his head.

812
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,332
We keeps the children's birthdays,
of course,

813
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:37,915
but him and me... Well, we've no time
for suchlike as a general rule.

814
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:41,165
We know it was his birthday
and we've brought him some presents.

815
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,249
Oh, bring them in my dears.

816
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,749
Oh, don't, please don't,
Mrs Perks.

817
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,040
Whatever is the matter?

818
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:00,540
Do you mean to say
you don't like the things we brought?

819
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:01,790
Don't you like them?

820
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:05,499
Oh, there, there, don't mind me,
I'm all right.

821
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:10,165
Like them? Why it's a birthday
such as Perks never had,

822
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,040
not even when he were a boy.

823
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:13,749
Good, I'm glad you're pleased.

824
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,832
Could we wait and see
if Mr Perks is pleased too?

825
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:17,874
I won't say another word.

826
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,582
Could we have a plate for the buns,
Mrs Perks?

827
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,290
Oh, of course.

828
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,499
Fit for a prince, I'd say.

829
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:29,040
I never thought there'd be more for him,
except the ounce of his backie.

01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,374
Let's hide in there
and you tell him about it

834
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,749
but give him the tobacco first
as you got it for him.

835
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,624
When you've told him,
we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".

836
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,874
- How do.
- How do.

837
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,499
Hello, old woman.

838
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:08,374
- Well here's a pretty set out.
- It's your birthday tea, Bert.

839
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:14,915
And here's an ounce
of your extra particular.

840
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:18,832
Yes, she's a good old girl.

841
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,790
Eh, what's that pram doing here?
Hey, you're not...?

842
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,374
Well, what's all these bundles?
Eh?

843
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,249
And what's all this sweet stuff and...?

844
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,957
What's this squirrel
doing on the table, eh?

845
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:40,999
Oh, lor!
Whatever should we do?

846
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,374
I've forgotten to put the labels
on any of the things.

847
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,832
He won't know what's from whom.

848
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,332
He'll think it's all from us

849
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,707
and that we're trying to be grand and
charitable or something horrid like that.

850
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:52,915
Ssh, be quiet!

851
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,374
I don't care. I won't stand it.
I tell you straight.

852
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,290
But, it's them children
you make such a fuss about,

853
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,999
the children from the Three Chimneys.

854
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,749
I don't care,
not if it was angels from heaven.

855
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,040
We got on all right all these years
and no favours asked.

856
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,790
I'm not having these charity
goings-on at my time of life.

857
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,457
And don't you think it, Nell.

858
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:13,332
Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue,
for goodness sake.

859
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:16,790
All three of’em is in the other room
a- listening to every word you speaks.

860
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:18,915
I'll give them something to listen to.

861
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,332
I've spoke my mind to these afore
and I'll do it again. Come out.

862
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,374
Come on out!
Out here, come on.

863
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,165
No, not you lot, you stop in...

864
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,915
Sophie, look put some pants
on Benjamin, we've got company.

865
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,707
Right, you can tell me
what you mean by it.

866
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:38,290
Have I ever complained of being short
as you starts this charity with me?

867
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,915
We thought you'd be so pleased,
Mr Perks.

868
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,749
I'll never try and be kind to anyone else
as long as I live.

869
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,707
- No, I won't. Not never!
- We didn't mean any harm.

870
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,624
It isn't what you means
so much as what you does.

871
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,790
We thought you'd love it.
We always have things on our birthdays.

872
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:53,499
Oh ay, from your own relations,
that's different.

873
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,040
No, not just our relations.

874
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,749
They're from all sorts of people
in the village.

875
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:59,249
- And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.
- We did.

876
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:14,165
So you've been telling the neighbours
that we can't make both ends meet.

877
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,165
Now you've disgraced us as deep
as you can in the neighbourhood,

878
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:21,207
you can take that pack of tricks
back where it came from.

879
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,040
I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.

880
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:27,165
I don't doubt that you meant it kind

881
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:31,374
but I'd rather not be acquainted with you
any longer, if it's all the same to you.

882
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,457
Look here.
We'll go if you like

883
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:40,374
and you needn't be friends with us
any more, but...

884
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,457
We'll always be friends with you,
even though you're nasty to us.

885
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:47,874
But before we go, let us show you
these labels to put on the things.

886
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,499
I don't want to see no labels

887
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,999
except proper luggage labels
in me own walk of life.

888
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,749
- Please let Bobbie show you the labels.
- All right, go on.

889
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,832
We wrote down everything
everybody said

890
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,540
when they gave us the things
with the people's names on.

891
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:04,790
Because Mother said
that we ought to be careful because...

892
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,707
Well I wrote down what she said
and you'll see.

893
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:07,915
That's from Mother.

894
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,499
She thought Mrs Perks might like
some of Phyllis' things.

895
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,707
"I can't do much... "

896
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:24,999
Well that's all right.
I mean, your ma's a born lady.

897
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,165
We'll keep the little frocks
and what-not, Nell.

898
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,415
Yes, Albert.

899
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:32,332
Then there's the perambulator
and the gooseberries and sweets.

900
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,874
They're from Mrs Ransome.

901
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,249
I can't send the pram back, Bert,
and I won't so don't ask me.

902
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:40,249
I'm not asking anything.

903
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,165
Then there's the shovel.
Mr James made that for you himself

904
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,249
and he says...

905
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,207
Oh, where is it?
Oh, yes, here.

906
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,290
- No er, you can read it.
- He says,

907
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:54,999
"You tell Mr Perks it is a pleasure
to make a little trifle for a man

908
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:57,332
"as is so much respected. "

909
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:59,582
He's a good chap, that.

910
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,582
He's a very good chap, that.

911
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:05,165
He's not bad at all, that chap.

912
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:07,499
And everybody who gave anything
said they liked you

913
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,665
and thought it was
a very good idea of ours.

914
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:15,582
And nobody said anything about charity
or anything horrid like that.

915
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:19,040
We thought that you'd love to know
how fond everybody is of you.

916
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:23,915
And I've never so unhappy
in all my born days.

917
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,582
Goodbye.
Come on.

918
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:28,665
Stop!

919
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:36,707
I take back every word I've said
contrary to what you'd wish.

920
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,540
- Nell?
- Yes, Albert.

921
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:40,165
Put the kettle on.

922
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:42,957
We'll take away the things
if you're unhappy with them.

923
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,290
I'm not unhappy about’em.

924
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,915
I don't know
if I was ever better pleased.

925
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:51,582
...Not so much with the presents
though frankly they're an A. 1 collection

926
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,707
but the kind respect
of our neighbours.

927
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:57,290
- That's worth having, eh Nell?
- I think it's all worth having...

928
01:19:57,416 --> 01:20:00,749
And you've made a most ridiculous fuss
about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.

929
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,332
No, I haven't.

930
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,832
If a man didn't respect himself,
no one wouldn't do it for him.

931
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:07,707
But everyone respects you.
They all said so.

932
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:10,415
We knew you'd like it
once you understood.

933
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:16,999
Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?

934
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,332
May the garland of friendship
be ever green.

935
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:22,332
May our garland of friendship
be ever green, Mr Perks.

936
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,665
Hear, hear!

937
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,832
Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?

938
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:30,499
Let's have a look at them buns
you brought in. Where are they?

939
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,040
Who wrote that?
It's Albert.

940
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,832
Holy Mary, Mother of God

941
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:39,165
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

942
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:57,582
Now go to sleep all of you
and not another word.

943
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,499
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

944
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,957
Yeah they're jolly good
little kids, those Waterburys.

945
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:12,540
Oh, they're all right,
bless their hearts.

946
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,832
It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing
that ever was.

947
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,290
- I was ashamed of you, I tell you.
- You needn't be.

948
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:21,665
I climbed down handsome
as soon as I understood it weren't charity.

949
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,540
Charity's one thing I never could abide,
and won't neither.

950
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:27,624
- Go to sleep, Albert.
- Yes, dear.

951
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:31,040
I tell you this though,

952
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:33,499
it isn't what you does
so much as what you means,

953
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:35,582
that's what I say.

954
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:38,665
- Now if it had been charity...
- Oh, drat charity, Bert.

955
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:42,832
Nobody won't offer you charity
however much you was to want it.

956
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:46,165
That were just friendliness,
that were.

957
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:50,165
I reckon it's what people call
loving kindness.

958
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:53,374
- Now go to sleep, Bert.
- Yes dear, good night.

959
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,832
Good night, Bert.
Happy Birthday.

960
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,207
Nell?

961
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:16,457
Oh, all right, Bert,
as it's your birthday.

962
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,915
Hello, my dears.

963
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:53,082
Hard at it, are yer?

964
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:55,665
Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.

965
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:57,915
One good turn deserves another,
that's what I always say.

966
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,415
Hello, Mr Perks,
how do mean?

967
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,749
Well I found these magazines, you see,
in the waiting room.

968
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,665
I was cleaning up.

969
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:09,415
They were in a cupboard and well
they're only collecting dust and...

970
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:12,082
Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.

971
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:13,249
- Hello.
- Hello.

972
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,790
I thought perhaps
you might like them.

973
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:19,457
There's a lot of pictures in’em.
and that,

974
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,665
and you can colour’em up
with chalks and that.

975
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,957
Anyway I don't want’em.

976
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,874
- You're a dear.
- Yes, you are.

977
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,665
- Hear, hear!
- Well, that's all right then.

978
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:32,165
I must be getting along.
I've got lots to do.

979
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:34,082
Perks must be about it.

980
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:37,040
Thank you.
That was very kind of him.

981
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:40,415
We'd better go inside,
it's going to rain.

982
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:12,457
Daddy...

983
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:52,499
- Where's Bobbie?
- I thought I heard her upstairs.

984
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:56,665
She knows it's tea time.
I wonder if she's all right.

985
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:17,707
Bobbie?

986
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:22,582
What is it darling?

987
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,790
Oh, Mummy!

988
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:42,415
You don't believe Daddy did it?

989
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:45,165
- No.
- Because it's not true.

990
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:48,707
They have shut him in prison,
but he's done nothing wrong.

991
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:52,040
He's good and honourable
and he belongs to us.

992
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:56,832
Will it make you very unhappy
if you tell me all about it?

993
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,457
I want to understand.

994
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:08,249
Do you remember the day
those two men took Daddy away?

995
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,290
Yes, I do.

996
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:14,832
Well they arrested him, charging him
with selling State secrets

997
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:18,082
with being, in fact,
a spy and a traitor.

998
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:23,082
How could anyone believe that?

999
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,499
How could anyone do such a thing?

1000
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:27,457
Someone did.

1001
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:32,165
Why didn't you tell someone,
a lawyer?

1002
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:37,665
There wasn't anyone who could
hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?

1003
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:41,874
I don't know.
It's all so complicated.

1004
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:46,915
There was a man in the office
who was very envious of your father.

1005
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:49,874
Daddy always said
he didn't quite trust him.

1006
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,665
Why didn't you explain
all that to someone?

1007
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,165
No one would listen.

1008
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:58,290
Do you suppose
I haven't tried everything?

1009
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:02,332
No, my darling,
what we have to do, you and I,

1010
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:05,874
and Daddy, is to be brave.

1011
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:57,374
Where have you been?

1012
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,040
Where have I been?

1013
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:02,249
Down to the station.
Don't ask why, it's a secret.

1014
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,540
Oh, please yourself.

1015
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:06,749
- There's a paper chase tomorrow.
- Oh, whoopee!

1016
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,332
- Who?
- The grammar school boys.

1017
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,415
Oh zippee!

1018
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:11,665
Perks says we can see them
going along by the line.

1019
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,207
Oh really?

1020
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,457
What's a paper chase?

1021
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,832
Let me pass please

1022
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:43,915
Hey! That's against by-laws.

1023
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:47,332
- I ought to report him.
- They're only having fun.

1024
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:51,499
Passengers is forbidden to cross the line
on any pretence.

1025
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:55,082
He ain't no passenger.
He's out of sight now, anyway.

1026
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:59,874
What the eye don't see the heart need
take no notice of, that what I always say.

1027
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,082
Come on then.

1028
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,499
He's gone in the tunnel.

1029
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,582
Oh, it is dark in here.

1030
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,790
They don't know
what they're in for.

1031
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,665
It isn't easy running in the dark.

1032
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:23,790
They'll take a long time
going through, won't they?

1033
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,707
Aye, they will that.

1034
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,957
- They went that way.
- Oh thanks!

1035
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:41,249
I know! Let's cut across to the top
and see them come out the other end.

1036
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,540
- We'll be there before they are.
- Good idea.

1037
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:45,207
Yes, good idea!

1038
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:29,415
- This way!
- No, this way. Come on, quick.

1039
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:40,082
There, that's all.

1040
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:41,665
What should we do now?

1041
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:43,957
Not yet,
there's one in a red jersey.

1042
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:45,790
He hasn't come out yet.

1043
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,915
Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth

1044
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:51,874
and perhaps we can see him
from the inside.

1045
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:05,999
It's dark in there.

1046
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:08,665
- Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.
- I don't like it.

1047
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:12,999
Still no sign of him. I reckon
he must have had an accident.

1048
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:15,915
Let's go and rescue him.
Come on.

1049
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:17,999
Come on, Phyl.
Keep close behind me.

1050
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:20,249
If a train comes along
get flat against the tunnel wall

1051
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,124
and hold your skirts against you.

1052
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:23,624
I still don't like it.

1053
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:37,915
- I want to go back.
- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?

1054
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,499
It's another earthquake!

1055
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:59,165
- It's a train.
- Oh, let me go back!

1056
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:01,540
Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.
Stand back.

1057
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:03,582
Come in, come on.

1058
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,082
It is a dragon.
I always thought it was.

1059
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,082
Come on.

1060
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:46,915
Supposing that boy
was caught underneath the train...

1061
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:49,332
- Oh!
- We've got to go and see.

1062
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:51,999
Can't we go and get someone
from the station?

1063
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:54,374
- Phyl, you wait here.
- No.

1064
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:59,499
Hello?

1065
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,957
Hey you two, come quickly!

1066
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:09,249
Oh, is that blood?
Is that red blood?

1067
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,499
- Is he all killed?
- Phyllis, please.

1068
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:15,457
Hurry up you two, get help.

1069
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:33,374
"It was on a hot summer's afternoon... "

1070
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:39,040
Oh, do come down, we've found a hound
in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.

1071
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:41,332
They're bringing him here,
I've sent for Doctor Forrest.

1072
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:44,249
But you should send for a vet,
I can't have a lame dog here.

1073
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:46,457
Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.

1074
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,665
Well then he ought to be taken
to his mother.

1075
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:52,040
His mother's dead,
his father's in Northumberland.

1076
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,124
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,
won't you?

1077
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,665
I told him I was sure you'd want us
to have him here.

1078
01:33:56,791 --> 01:34:00,124
- You always want to help everybody.
- Come along.

1079
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:12,332
I'm glad you brought him here.

1080
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:16,124
- Let's get him to bed.
- It will hurt a bit, won't it?

1081
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:21,749
I hope you don't think I'm a coward if
I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.

1082
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,624
I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.

1083
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:28,165
Don't you worry, you're the one
who's got the trouble.

1084
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:31,082
We'd love to have you here,
wouldn't we, Bobbie?

1085
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,707
Yes.

1086
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,957
That will be Doctor Forrest.
I'll go.

1087
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:52,957
- That's not the doctor.
- I know.

1088
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:55,374
I know that voice though,
at least I think I do.

1089
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,915
I thought I recognised it too.
It's not the doctor, that's for sure.

1090
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:07,040
Could it be that Doctor Forrest
has been attacked by highwaymen

1091
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:09,790
and left for dead and this is the man
they've telegraphed

1092
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:12,582
- to take his place?
- Perhaps he's gone mad.

1093
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:15,457
Perhaps he's caught something awful
from one of his patients

1094
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,082
and that man's come to tell her.

1095
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,332
Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man
up into Jim's bedroom.

1096
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:21,040
Why should she?

1097
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:24,165
Listen.
The door's opening.

1098
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,540
Now they'll come down.

1099
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:38,707
It's rude to listen like this.

1100
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:42,832
It's not listening, nobody in their senses
would talk secrets on the stairs.

1101
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:44,749
Bobbie?

1102
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:47,665
A relative of Jim's has come,
he wants to see you.

1103
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:48,749
Wash your hands and faces.

1104
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,790
We'll be in the dining room
when you're ready.

1105
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:51,957
Yes, Mama.

1106
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,665
There now!
Fancy not thinking of that, hm?

1107
01:35:57,791 --> 01:36:01,165
- Any hot water, Mrs Viney?
- Righto love.

1108
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:09,832
You all right?
There we are, that's it.

1109
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:14,915
Well I never did!

1110
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,624
This, my dears,
is Jim's grandfather.

1111
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:21,124
Our own old gentleman!
I'm so awfully glad it's you.

1112
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:24,165
When I just think of all
the old gentlemen there are in the world

1113
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,082
it could have been anyone.

1114
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:28,165
You're not going to take
Jim away though, are you?

1115
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,457
Not at present.

1116
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:32,749
Your mother has most kindly consented
to let him stay here.

1117
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:37,374
I thought of sending a nurse but your
mother said she'd nurse him herself.

1118
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,707
But we won't have anything to eat
if Mother doesn't write.

1119
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,832
That's all right, Peter.

1120
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:44,707
I see you trust your children.

1121
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,915
- Of course.
- Then I may tell them our arrangement.

1122
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:49,665
Sit down, my dears.

1123
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:56,540
Your Mother, my dears, has consented
to give up her writing for a while

1124
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:58,874
and to become
a matron of my hospital.

1125
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,665
Does that mean we'll have to leave
Three Chimneys and the railways?

1126
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:04,290
No, no, my darling. No.

1127
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:07,124
The hospital is here.

1128
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:12,040
The Three Chimneys Hospital
and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.

1129
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:15,665
- Will Mother go on writing again?
- We shall see...

1130
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:17,915
Perhaps something nice will happen
and she won't have to.

1131
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,040
- But I like my writing.
- I know.

1132
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:24,165
Don't be afraid I'm going to try
and interfere but one never know.

1133
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:27,457
Very beautiful and wonderful things
do happen, don't they?

1134
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:32,040
And we live most of our lives
in the hope of them.

1135
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:43,124
I got your letter my dear,
but it wasn't needed.

1136
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:47,832
When I read about your father's case
in the papers at the time I had my doubts.

1137
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:51,915
And ever since I've known who you were,
I've been trying to find out things

1138
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:54,290
and I have hopes.

1139
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:57,707
- Oh...
- Yes, I may say, great hopes.

1140
01:37:57,833 --> 01:38:00,707
But keep your secret
for a little while longer.

1141
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,040
Wouldn't do to upset your mother
with a false hope, would it?

1142
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:07,332
But it isn't false.
I know you can do it.

1143
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:10,249
I knew you could when I wrote.
It isn't false hope, is it?

1144
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:12,040
No, my dear.

1145
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:15,790
You don't believe Daddy did it?
Oh, say you don't believe he did.

1146
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:19,624
My dear, I'm perfectly certain
he didn't.

1147
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:38,124
’Life at Three Chimneys
was never quite the same again

1148
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,832
'after the old gentleman
came to see us. '

1149
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,874
Oh, please Phyllis.

1150
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,582
’The house became a hospital. '

1151
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,874
I give you three guesses
who that is.

1152
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:57,374
Is everything all right?
Good luck. I'll curtain up.

1153
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,290
Have you...

1154
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:04,499
Have you noticed
the ship is sinking?

1155
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:08,040
Yes I know,
but don't blame me.

1156
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:13,374
Oh, no!
Oh, no they'll all get so wet.

1157
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:17,082
You'll need some light
on the subject.

1158
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:22,582
As your solicitor
I must advise you.

1159
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,332
Don't worry.

1160
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:29,582
Don't worry,
I've managed to get most of the survivors.

1161
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:31,290
Right, curtain down.

1162
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:34,624
Thank you, good evening.

1163
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:44,165
I hope you enjoyed it.

1164
01:39:54,458 --> 01:39:57,124
Children, will you please be quiet.

1165
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,832
Oh, the blood!

1166
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:02,999
- Oh, is it over?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1167
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:05,457
- Oh, you are a good doctor.
- Can I have that please?

1168
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,082
There we are. How's that?

1169
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:09,499
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

1170
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:12,957
’Jim's leg got better
and he went home. '

1171
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,707
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

1172
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:23,999
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1173
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:28,374
- Goodbye.
- Bye, I'll write.

1174
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:35,165
- Lor lummy, Pete!
- They'll have to marry now!

1175
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:36,290
Lummy.

1176
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:43,665
’We seemed to be hardly
Railway Children at all in those days

1177
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:48,790
'and as the days went on each of us
had an uneasy feeling about this

1178
01:40:48,916 --> 01:40:50,999
'which Phyllis expressed one day. '

1179
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:55,124
I wonder if the railway misses us.
We never go and see it now.

1180
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,499
It seems ungrateful.

1181
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:59,749
We loved it so when we hadn't
anyone to play with.

1182
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,790
The thing I don't like is our having
stopped waving to the 9:15

1183
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:04,957
and sending our love to Father by it.

1184
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:07,457
Let's begin again tomorrow.

1185
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:23,499
Hurry up, Fatty,
for goodness sake.

1186
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:25,957
I can't, my bootlace is undone.

1187
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:29,499
When you marry your laces
will come undone going up the aisle

1188
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:32,749
and the man that you marry
will tumble over and smash his nose in.

1189
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:37,582
I'd rather marry a man with
a smashed in nose than not marry at all.

1190
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:47,624
- Take our love to Father!
- Take our love to Father!

1191
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,249
Most extraordinary!

1192
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:31,290
- Most extraordinary.
- Extraordinary indeed.

1193
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:37,040
Now, Bobbie,
I wonder whether you could...

1194
01:42:38,916 --> 01:42:41,082
Don't you feel well?

1195
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:45,332
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel...

1196
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,290
Will you let me off lessons today?

1197
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:51,540
I feel as if I want to be
quite alone, by myself.

1198
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,790
Of course I'll let you off.

1199
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:04,124
What is it?
You don't feel ill, do you?

1200
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,290
No, not ill.

1201
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:11,165
I've just got to be alone,
do you know?

1202
01:43:11,291 --> 01:43:15,915
Mm, sometimes Roberta,
you're so like me.

1203
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:24,415
I'll be more alive in the garden.

1204
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,999
- Morning, Miss, I'm sure.
- Good luck, Miss Roberta.

1205
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:40,665
Thank you.

1206
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:45,915
Hello. Look, if this is the train,
it'll be smart work.

1207
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:50,540
Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was
never so pleased in all my born days.

1208
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:53,415
One I most have and no offence I know
on a day like this.

1209
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:57,124
And one for luck.
You ain't offended, are you?

1210
01:43:57,250 --> 01:44:00,499
I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I,
on a day like this, you know.

1211
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:03,499
- No, Mr Perks, of course it's not a liberty.
- No.

1212
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:07,290
Dear Mr Perks, we love you quite as much
as if you were an uncle of our own

1213
01:44:07,416 --> 01:44:08,749
but on a day like what?

1214
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:12,249
Well like this’ere. I told you,
I seen it in the papers, didn't I?

1215
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:14,124
Saw what in the papers?

1216
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:24,374
Oakworth!

1217
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:28,707
Oakworth Station.

1218
01:44:28,833 --> 01:44:31,665
Oakworth. There we are.
Thank you, Madam.

1219
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:34,374
Yes, thank you.
Quick as you can, please.

1220
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:38,832
Oakworth Station.

1221
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:45,624
- Right away, Mr Cryer.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.

1222
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,582
Daddy, my Daddy!

1223
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:07,665
’I think just now
we're not wanted there.

1224
01:47:07,791 --> 01:47:11,082
'Not for a few minutes anyway.

1225
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:16,082
'I think it would best for us
to go quickly and quietly.

1226
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:22,665
'We'll go to the end of the field
among the thin gold spikes of grass.

1227
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:27,790
'We may just take one last look
over our shoulders, at the house

1228
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:31,290
'where neither we nor anyone else
is wanted now. '

1229
01:48:46,625 --> 01:48:50,124
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

1230
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,290
Hope you loved it.

1231
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:06,374
Goodbye.
