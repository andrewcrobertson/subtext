1
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,080
Attention all workers. Attention all workers.

2
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,370
Day shift starting in T-minus 15 minutes.

3
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,160
Farmers to report to mess hall immediately.

4
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,330
If you are experiencing any symptoms,
such as fever, cough…

5
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,410
vomiting, or difficulty breathing…

6
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,000
proceed to the medical bay
for examination.

7
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,540
The safety and well-being of our colony
is Weyland-Yutani's top priority.

8
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,080
Attention all workers…

9
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,120
Did you hear about
the claustrophobic astronaut?

10
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
He needed space.

11
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,580
I'm begging you, you got to stop.

12
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,290
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

13
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Huge waist.

14
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,250
See that cornbread.

15
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,410
Maybe it's 'cause I'm on this seafood diet.

16
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,790
I see food, I eat it.

17
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,620
That's so bad.

18
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,200
You always laughed at that one.

19
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,830
Yeah, when I was 12.

20
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,160
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

21
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,790
We owe him three months today.

22
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,500
He'll call again.

23
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,660
Well, maybe we won't be here when he does.

24
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,660
Andy. Stay close to me.

25
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,040
Wake up. Wake up now.

26
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,250
We're all Weyland-Yutani slaves.

27
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,700
The company pays us with food and shelter
and takes our lives in exchange.

28
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't believe their lies.

29
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,200
They own you!

30
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,540
Andy, Andy. Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

32
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,910
-What did I do?
-It's a scam.

33
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,660
The ball is never under the cup
that you pick.

34
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,660
It's a trick.

35
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,200
But how am I gonna get the money?

36
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Money for what?

37
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,540
To pay for the horse when we get to Yvaga.

38
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,450
You're gonna get a horse?

39
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,120
I wanna call it Raindy.

40
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,910
Do you get it?

41
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,040
-Raindy.
-No, I like it. Yeah, it's good.

42
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay, so you just wait over there.

43
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,580
Okay, I might be a minute.

44
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
Stay out of trouble, all right?

45
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,660
All employees will be seen.

46
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,000
Good luck.

47
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,370
Line up in an orderly fashion.

48
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,830
Next.

49
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,790
Full name and occupation, please.

50
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,200
Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am. Farming.

51
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,580
It's about my travel papers.

52
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,250
I met my quota,
and I should be free to go now.

53
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,700
Right?

54
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,080
Go where?

55
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,410
Yvaga.

56
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
It's an independent system,
but it's fully terraformed.

57
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
You can actually see the sun out there.

58
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,660
Where are your parents?

59
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,790
They died three cycles ago.

60
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,000
Lung disease, from the mines.

61
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,450
It's just me and my brother now.

62
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,160
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

63
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,540
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.
Wake up now.

64
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm sorry, but you're not eligible
for contract release yet.

65
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,370
Due to a shortage of workers,
you're being transferred to the mines.

66
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,830
Wait, what?

67
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,500
No, no, no, I reached the required hours.

68
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,910
You have to let me go.

69
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,910
Unfortunately, quotas have been raised
to 24,000 hours…

70
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,870
so you'll be released from contract
in another five to six years.

71
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful…

72
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,370
for your ongoing service.

73
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,830
-Rain!
-Hey!

74
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
Hey, stop!

75
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,290
Get off him! You bastards!

76
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,790
I got you, I got you.

77
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,200
Shit, you're bleeding.

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
Okay.

79
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,620
You're okay.

80
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm resetting you.

81
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,450
I got you.

82
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,250
It's okay.

83
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,830
I shouldn't have left you alone.

84
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,870
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

85
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,080
Wake up now. They own you.

86
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,200
Hi, Rain.

87
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,040
Look, I'm sorry. I know I've been calling you
all day…

88
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,290
but, look, something's come up,
and I think you should know about it.

89
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,000
So, come by the trailers and bring Andy.

90
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Hey.

91
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,410
Oh, for…

92
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,000
Game over, man.

93
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,080
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

94
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,040
I told you she'd show up.

95
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,000
You owe me five bucks.

96
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,330
Andy!

97
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,290
Why'd the blind miner fall down the well?

98
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,790
Why?

99
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,790
'Cause he couldn't see that well.

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,330
Please don't encourage him.

101
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

102
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,330
-Kay.
-Rain.

103
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,540
-Hi.
-Hi!

104
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,790
Hi.

105
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
I missed you.

106
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,500
And I know my brother missed you, too.

107
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm really glad you came.

108
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,580
I heard about your dad.

109
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm really sorry.

110
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,790
Well, between the hailstorms
and the new diseases every cycle…

111
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,500
Yeah, everybody's dying, right?

112
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,330
So, should we show her?

113
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,200
Show me what?

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,950
Okay, so, last night, we're loading up
the last Tesotek…

115
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,700
we're about 200 miles above the ground,
and then all of a sudden…

116
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,950
The hauler picks up this beacon.

117
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
So Navarro tracks it, and it turns out…

118
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,200
there's this big Wey-Yu ship
drifting right above our heads.

119
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,250
Drifting?

120
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,040
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

121
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,160
Some old relic.
It's probably damaged or obsolete.

122
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,540
Like that guy over there.

123
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Bjorn.

124
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,250
Okay, just tell her.

125
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,000
Why are we all sitting around here…

126
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,500
waiting for travel permits that the company
are never gonna give to us?

127
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,080
'Cause that hauler has enough power in it
to get us to Yvaga.

128
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,040
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga…

129
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,290
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

130
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,040
Decommissioned ships still carry
tons of functional equipment.

131
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,540
And the hyperlink shows
that ship still has a few pods left.

132
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,160
You want to break into a Weyland-Yutani ship
and steal highly regulated equipment?

133
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,540
Before someone else does.

134
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,660
You guys are insane.

135
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,950
-Well, of course we are.
-No. No, we're not.

136
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,330
-This is…
-That's what I said.

137
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Are you gonna help us?

138
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,910
Sorry, what do you need me for?

139
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Andy.

140
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,160
-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

141
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,160
Mm-hmm.

142
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,080
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic.
He speaks Mother.

143
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,200
He can access a terminal on the ship
to get us in and out without a fuss.

144
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,620
It's the only way to get in.

145
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,870
Okay, but what if we get caught?

146
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,500
It'll ruin our chances of ever getting
a travel permit.

147
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,200
Right, Rain's not comin'.

148
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,620
How about you let us take Andy then?

149
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,790
I'm not sending my brother up there alone.

150
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
He's not your brother though, is he?

151
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,870
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

152
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,290
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods…

153
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,910
that your dad found in the trash.

154
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,830
Let's go.

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,580
-Rain?
-What? I didn't say anything.

157
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,080
Rain, wait.

158
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry. Listen, I know my cousin can be a
dick sometimes, all right?

159
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,830
But he is right about something.

160
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
You need to wake up.

161
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,040
Because this company,
they're not gonna give us anything.

162
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

163
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,450
Rain, I just…

164
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't want to end up like our parents.

165
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,950
Do you?

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Is it as easy as you're making it sound,
this plan of yours?

167
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,410
You won't even have to get out
of the Corbelan.

168
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,540
That much I can promise you, okay?

169
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,120
Come on. What do you say?

170
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,000
Bjorn, hurry up, let's go.

171
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,040
All right, I'm starting her up. Batteries on.

172
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
Lovely.

173
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,620
Could I get hydro, please?

174
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,790
Comm panel.

175
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,830
Ground spoilers.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,080
They are armed.

177
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
First time in space, huh?

178
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,330
Yeah.

179
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
You too?

180
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Fuel pump.

181
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,120
-On.
-Two space virgins coming through.

182
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,620
Right, take a good look outside the window…

183
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,870
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

184
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,290
You good?

185
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,450
I'm good.

186
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,450
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

187
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,250
Are you sure this is a good idea now?

188
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,500
Sure, Dad.

189
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,200
Here comes the crush.

190
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,750
That's how it's done, bitch.

191
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,830
Is that…

192
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

193
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,830
That is our sun.

194
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,660
They say Yvaga has the most
incredible sunsets.

195
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,250
I've seen them.

196
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,290
In my dreams.

197
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
I can't wait to see them with you.

198
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Yeah.

199
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,620
You know, I heard that cryo-sleep
just makes years…

200
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,330
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

201
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,540
So when we wake up in Yvaga tomorrow…

202
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,120
we'll wake up with a hangover.

203
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,540
There she is.

204
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,250
That's not a ship.

205
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,830
No.

206
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,580
Fuck, that's big. What is that?

207
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,750
Decommissioned outpost? I don't know.

208
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,330
Probably got dragged into our orbit.

209
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,410
Okay, Navarro, let's get closer, please.

210
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,620
Okay. I'm gonna match its roll.

211
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,700
Hazard proximity alert.

212
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,870
What's wrong?

213
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,450
It's just the belt's a bit closer
than I thought.

214
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,370
How long?

215
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,580
It's 36 hours, give or take.

216
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,620
Till what?

217
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,540
Before the station crashes against the rings.

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,870
Sorry, what?

219
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,950
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

220
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,250
36 hours.

221
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,000
We should be in and out in 30 minutes.

222
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,950
Yeah?

223
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,410
Andy.

224
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,500
Yeah, tops.

225
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,450
Are you sure you wanna do this?

226
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,790
I have just one directive.

227
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,120
To do what's best for Rain.

228
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,040
Your dad wrote it.

229
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Yeah.

230
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,450
That and too many dad jokes.

231
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm happy…

232
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,080
to help.

233
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,660
Be careful out there.

234
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,540
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

235
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
Put that on.

236
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,700
Now, why I gotta put this on for?

237
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,160
So you don't freeze your balls off.

238
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,870
Mate, you gotta stop obsessing
about my balls, man. It's unhealthy.

239
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,290
Keep talking and I'll chop 'em off.

240
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,290
Aw, you really want 'em for yourself,
don't you?

241
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,660
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

242
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,950
Oh, shut up a minute.

243
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,500
Gloves, here, take these.

244
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,370
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

245
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,750
-Come over here.
-Bjorn, leave him alone, for fuck's sake.

246
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,950
Andy, take no notice.

247
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
All right, okay, won't be my fault
when he breaks somethin'.

248
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,250
There's a synth hatch right ahead.
I'm gonna dock.

249
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,950
Copy that. Just bring us in slow.

250
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,410
Oh, fuck me, it's cold in there.

251
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,160
What's that?

252
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,870
It's a temp-scanner.

253
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,290
It's gonna lead us to the pods.

254
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,580
Okay, compression is good enough.

255
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,870
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

256
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,870
Andy…

257
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,160
you're up.

258
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,000
It's your time to shine.

259
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,700
Yes! Andy!

260
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,950
Beautiful work.

261
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,330
Okay.

262
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
Congrats. You're not a virgin anymore.

263
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,200
All right.

264
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,120
Okay, let's go.

265
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,410
Fuck.

266
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,410
Guys, it looks like we're in zero-g.

267
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,450
Yeah, I can feel it in my stomach.

268
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,950
Wait, what's that?

269
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,410
Gravity generators.

270
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,120
When offline, they still purge themselves
every few minutes.

271
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,290
Prevents the place from blowing up.

272
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,410
Oh, fuck me, there goes my stomach again.

273
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,700
Okay, straight ahead.

274
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,500
According to the scanner,
the pods should be in here.

275
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Jesus.

276
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,910
Andy, you good?

277
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

278
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,000
All right, great news.
I've got eyes on the pods.

279
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,660
Fuck!

280
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,000
Bjorn, you okay?

281
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,000
Fuck!

282
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,540
I think I fractured my asshole.

283
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,870
Fuckin' hell.
Don't fuck with this gravity purge, man.

284
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,000
Thank God, there's still some power left
in this relic.

285
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,040
Okay, watch out. Gravity's coming back.

286
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,160
Fuckin' hell.

287
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,370
All right, here we go.

288
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's see what we got.

289
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,200
Okay.

290
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,790
Shit.

291
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,080
What's the problem?

292
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,830
Pods don't have enough fuel.

293
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,160
What do you mean?

294
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,290
They're loaded up for three years in stasis.

295
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,120
Yeah, but it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga, mate.

296
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,370
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm aware of that.

297
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,870
Fuckin' hell.

298
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,290
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

299
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,450
-I knew it.
-Just relax.

300
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,700
Maybe you guys should just come back.

301
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,000
No, no, we're not givin' up now.

302
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,250
Yvaga's the nearest system.

303
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,410
So what are we supposed to do now? Huh?

304
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,790
-What are we gonna do?
-Shut up.

305
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,290
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

306
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,870
We should find more fuel there.

307
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,370
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

308
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Come on, Andy.

309
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,620
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

310
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,910
Hold.

311
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, 400 yards away, dead ahead.

312
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,750
What's with the military shit?

313
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,910
-What?
-All that military shit.

314
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,450
-Well, it's effective.
-Is it?

315
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
-And cool.
-It's not very cool.

316
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,910
You just look like a twat.

317
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,080
-I'm sorry.
-All right, chill.

318
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,160
Let's keep it movin'.

319
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,330
If you do that again, I'll fuck you up.

320
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,120
-Bjorn, back off!
-You understand?

321
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,660
Just as long as he stays out of my way.

322
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,790
Why is he being such a dick to him?

323
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,450
Because of what happened to his mom.

324
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
What do you mean?

325
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,330
Last cycle, there was a gas leak
in the mines…

326
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,370
so a synthetic made the call to seal them
with Bjorn's mom still trapped inside.

327
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
What?

328
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,370
Synthetics can't harm humans.

329
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
It sacrificed three miners to save a dozen.

330
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,910
That, they can do.

331
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,580
That's terrible.

332
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,540
I got you, I got you.

333
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,080
Come on, come on, come on.

334
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,370
Easy, easy.

335
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,160
Good job.

336
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,450
Kay!

337
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,910
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

338
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,540
Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,580
I'm right here. I'm right here.
You're okay.

340
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm gonna go check on the pods.

341
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,620
No, no. Don't worry.

342
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm not sick.

343
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
What's wrong, then?

344
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,290
Nothing is.

345
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,160
Oh, girl.

346
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,250
Who's the father?

347
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,790
Some asshole.

348
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,950
Just don't tell my brother, okay?

349
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,620
-He has enough things to worry about.
-No.

350
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,200
I won't say anything.

351
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,950
I'm just happy this baby will get
to see the sun.

352
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,160
I think we're almost there.

353
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,040
Okay, Navarro.

354
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,870
Airlock 5-B, that's our way out
once we find this cryo-fuel.

355
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,870
On my way.

356
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,830
Welcome to the Renaissance Space Station…

357
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,790
the center of Weyland-Yutani
Research and Development.

358
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,250
The station is divided into two halves…

359
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,290
Romulus and Remus…

360
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,540
each dedicated to our quest to improve
mankind's role in outer space.

361
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,160
This place gives me the creeps.

362
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,330
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

363
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,950
He's all right now.

364
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,540
Do you get it? He's all right.

365
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,410
Can you turn yourself off, please?

366
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,950
You said you were nervous…

367
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,910
-and I was trying to make sure you were…
-Jesus!

368
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,330
You know, I can't wait to get in them pods…

369
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,250
and never see you again, you know that?

370
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,080
You'll see me in Yvaga.

371
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,580
No, you're not going to Yvaga.

372
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,870
Bjorn, stop!

373
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,540
I'm not?

374
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,620
Well done.

375
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,040
Oh, she didn't tell you?

376
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,750
Yeah, yeah, it's a non-Weyland-Yutani
system…

377
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,040
so no fake people allowed.

378
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,040
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

379
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Andy, look.

380
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,950
Rain could end up in prison
if she takes you with her.

381
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,500
And if you guys stay in Jackson,
it's just a matter of time…

382
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,830
before you get decommissioned again
by the company.

383
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,660
You understand?

384
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,450
I need you on the ship to guard the pods.

385
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,500
But once we get there…

386
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,250
Decommish.

387
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,290
Lights out for good.

388
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,950
You done?

389
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,500
Just tellin' the truth.

390
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,950
That's okay.

391
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,870
If it's what's best for Rain,
it's what's best for me.

392
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,500
You're a good guy, Andy.

393
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,080
We're all gonna miss you.

394
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,160
So he didn't know?

395
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,250
I just did not have the heart to tell him.

396
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,450
You shouldn't feel bad.

397
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
Shit.

398
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,160
You're not gonna throw your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

399
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,950
He doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him.

400
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,160
Okay? He's not…

401
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,950
you know, real.

402
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,540
The signal's coming from in here.

403
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,620
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

404
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,790
Yeah.

405
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,540
Doesn't look decommissioned to me.

406
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,000
No, it doesn't.

407
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
But it's definitely deserted.

408
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,080
Hey, Andy, look at this.

409
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,450
I could probably fry a synthetic
with one of these…

410
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,790
if I just amp up the juices.

411
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,750
Hey, you know,
I might take this with me, actually.

412
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,750
All right, enough.

413
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,000
Just in case
you have any fucking funny ideas.

414
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,120
It's a joke. I was joking.

415
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,290
What the fuck?

416
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
Watch out.

417
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,500
Shit.

418
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,580
It's only a synthetic.

419
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Fuck.

420
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
I thought it was a real person there
for a second.

421
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,000
What happened in there?

422
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,080
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

423
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,000
The fuel must be in that room.
Let's grab it and get the fuck out of here.

424
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,250
All right. Andy?

425
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,000
Bjorn, take the torch please.

426
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
I don't think there's any pods in here.

427
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,330
Nah, just cooling equipment.
Uses the same type of fuel, though.

428
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Yes.

429
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,790
Forty-five Ks.

430
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,080
It's more than enough fuel
to get us to Yvaga.

431
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,200
Right. Bjorn,
give me a hand with this, please.

432
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,250
Bjorn, pull it out on three, all right?

433
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,750
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

434
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,120
One, two…

435
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,250
three.

436
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,330
Fuck!

437
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,000
-Fuck.
-My fingers.

438
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,830
I can't feel my fingers.

439
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,120
It really hurts. Just froze my hands off.

440
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,950
-What's happening?
-Fuck.

441
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,540
Don't know.
It's some kind of emergency lockdown.

442
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,120
Andy, the door.

443
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
Shit, he doesn't have the clearance.

444
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,290
What does that mean?

445
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,660
Doesn't have the clearance to open the door.

446
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,080
So you're trying to tell me that
he can fucking reboot the entire ship…

447
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,160
but can't open a random fucking door
to a random room?

448
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,540
Well, obviously, that's no random room.

449
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,750
Come on!

450
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,410
Come on!

451
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,540
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

452
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,620
If Andy can't open those doors,
I doubt we'll have better luck.

453
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,000
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic…

454
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,790
and we're just trespassing.

455
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

456
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,830
Not yet.

457
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,910
I think it's in here.

458
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Bjorn!

459
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,450
Tyler!

460
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
They're in there.

461
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,830
Hey, what are you doing?

462
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,700
If this module is still working, I can try
to transfer its credentials to Andy.

463
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,000
A higher clearance should open that door.

464
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,160
Shit. It's stuck.

465
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,660
It's so hot in here, man.

466
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,450
Whoa.

467
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Sick.

468
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,700
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

469
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,790
Yeah, okay, Mom.

470
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,620
Help me! Help!

471
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,790
Oh, no! What do I do?

472
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,410
The module. Take it out!

473
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,160
You okay?

474
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,790
That was fucked up.

475
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,950
Here.

476
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,580
Let me see.

477
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,870
Yes, okay.

478
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,250
All right.

479
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,250
-Got it.
-Hey.

480
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,410
Rain.

481
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,410
This is from that synthetic.

482
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,410
Try putting it on Andy's module.

483
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm so sorry.

484
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,000
Let's just get outta here.

485
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
Andy?

486
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,620
All right, let's see.

487
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,950
Okay.

488
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,950
Fuck.

489
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Rain, did I do something wrong?
He's just frozen up.

490
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,540
He's just rebooting.

491
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,450
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.

492
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,120
Here, let me get you something
for those fingers.

493
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,410
The fuck was that?

494
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,080
All right, stay there a second.

495
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Tyler?

496
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,290
Hey, what are you guys doing?

497
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,540
Bjorn?

498
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,540
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

499
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm not playing around.
There's something in the water.

500
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,500
What do you mean? What is it?

501
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,370
I don't know. I don't know what it is.
There's something in the fuckin' water.

502
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Bjorn!

503
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,450
Fuck!

504
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,750
What the fuck was that?

505
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,200
Andy!

506
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Bjorn!

507
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,750
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

508
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,950
Bjorn!

509
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,120
-Tyler!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

510
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,450
Come on!

511
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,790
-Come on! Help me!
-No, stop. Stop. Don't…

512
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,580
-No! Navarro!
-Those things will get out.

513
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,540
If they come in here… If they come in…
If they come…

514
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,700
No!

515
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,790
Fuck. Fuck.

516
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,910
Andy! Let's go!

517
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Go! Bjorn!

518
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,250
Andy, the door!

519
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,290
-Bjorn!
-Come on, come on.

520
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,450
Come on, come on, come on!

521
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,370
-Get out of there!
-Come on, come on, come on!

522
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,500
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Go, go, go!

523
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,250
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

524
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
-Bjorn, come on!
-Go! Go!

525
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,870
Andy, the door!

526
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,160
-Stay still. Stay still.
-I know!

527
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,620
It's choking her.

528
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,580
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

529
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,950
-It's choking her!
-Shit.

530
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,000
Stop! Bjorn!

531
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,750
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

532
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
-Stop!
-What's it doin'? Is it fuckin' killin' her?

533
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,620
I do not believe
that's what the creature is doing.

534
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
No.

535
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Andy?

536
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,950
Based on the rhythmic dilatation
of those bladders…

537
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,410
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns…

538
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,250
I'd surmise it's feeding her oxygen
to keep her alive.

539
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,580
For what purpose, I do not know.

540
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,870
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

541
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,500
I'm an ND-255 Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

542
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,160
Originally built for mining and safety tasks.

543
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,330
You guys call me Andy.

544
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,750
It's that module.

545
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Yes.

546
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,500
That new module
didn't just upgrade my credentials.

547
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,290
It substantially updated my AI…

548
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,160
and it's mending my motor systems
as we speak.

549
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,250
A most overdue upgrade, I must say.

550
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,450
-Shit. I'mma fucking fry this thing.
-Okay, wait.

551
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,330
-Don't!
-Why not?

552
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
That amount of current
will violently contract its tail flexors…

553
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,750
and will break her neck.

554
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,120
So what, you got a better idea?

555
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,450
-What should we fucking do then, huh?
-Hey, hey. Hey!

556
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
Hey, hey.

557
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,200
Andy, do you know how to help her?

558
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,620
I'm afraid my knowledge database
has not really changed.

559
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,910
I do not know what this creature is
or how to remove it safely.

560
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,950
But there's someone in this room who might.

561
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,620
I need to secure Z-01 compound.

562
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,620
Mission's priority.
All other priorities rescinded.

563
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,410
Must complete the mission.

564
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,910
I'm sorry…

565
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,660
but your mission has failed.

566
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,870
What? No, I…

567
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,410
Can you tell us what we can do to help her?

568
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,950
You don't help her. You run.

569
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,660
Get out, however you got in.

570
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,040
No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.

571
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,540
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin' her, okay?
You understand?

572
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,830
Then have mercy and end her life now.

573
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,120
If not, you all die.

574
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,790
So what the fuck is he sayin'?

575
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,200
What's it doing to her?

576
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,120
The parasitoid is implanting
the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.

577
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,450
I beg your pardon?

578
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,660
A seed that will amalgamate with her DNA
and rapidly grow out of her.

579
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,250
What's gonna grow out of her?

580
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,750
XX121 Xenomorph.

581
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,200
One of our towing ships first made
contact with this specimen two decades ago.

582
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,700
Of the seven crew members
aboard the USS Nostromo, only one survived…

583
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,910
blowing the creature out of the airlock.

584
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,870
We've been searching for it ever since.

585
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,830
170 days ago, our search came to an end…

586
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,040
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board…

587
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,200
presumed dead.

588
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,660
But of course…

589
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,660
lack of oxygen and food
is of no true consequence to this…

590
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,250
perfect organism.

591
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,410
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

592
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,200
Clearly.

593
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,410
It wreaked havoc over this station…

594
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,660
until what was left of our security forces
shot it dead.

595
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,410
Only to trigger its swan song.

596
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,450
Acid for blood?

597
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,330
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

598
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,160
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

599
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,500
Hey, shut up!

600
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,250
Nobody cares about your fucking ship anymore.

601
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,580
Okay, okay. Okay.

602
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,200
What if we use the cryo-fuel
to freeze the root of the tail?

603
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,000
Maybe if it's frozen, it won't choke her.

604
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,370
That could work.

605
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,700
All right, get it off! Get it off!

606
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,290
It's gone. It's off of you.
It's off of you.

607
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,500
It's off. It's off. It's off.

608
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,200
You're okay. You're okay.

609
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,700
I wouldn't be so sure.

610
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,200
What are the odds?

611
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,700
60 to 40 against your friend.

612
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,040
What are the odds on what?

613
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,580
That the creature's finished its job already.

614
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,290
What is he talking about?

615
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,410
Listen to me.

616
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,250
Humans go through
too many emotional stages…

617
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,660
before accepting the cold,
yet rational - sometimes hardest - path.

618
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,700
You must help them.

619
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,870
You must help them.

620
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Andy?

621
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry…

622
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,700
but we can't let her back on the ship.

623
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,620
-Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
-What're you doing?

624
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,750
-You must understand.
-You see?

625
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,120
-That's what I mean by "funny ideas"!
-What're you talking about?

626
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,330
No, he's…

627
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,540
-No! No!
-You fuckin' bitch!

628
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,120
Hey! Andy! Andy!

629
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,290
We're gonna go.

630
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,580
Hey, hey, hey! I'm right here.

631
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,250
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

632
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

633
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,540
-I'm here.
-Bjorn! No.

634
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,290
Bjorn, we're not leaving without them!

635
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,660
-I'm here.
-Bjorn!

636
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,620
-Where are they?
-You need to listen.

637
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,700
-We have to start the ship, okay?
-Where's Rain?

638
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,750
-Just go and start the ship.
-How…

639
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,910
Forgive me.

640
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,120
I've been nothing but a burden to you.

641
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,080
Today, I can finally help.

642
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,830
And you won't see me as a child anymore.

643
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,870
What?

644
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,660
Andy!

645
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,330
-Hey!
-Bjorn!

646
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

647
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,000
Navarro, undock!

648
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,330
Undock the ship!

649
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,450
Undocking initiated.

650
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,040
Please clear the airlock.

651
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,500
What the fuck is he doing?
They can't just leave without us.

652
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,450
He thinks Andy's trying to kill Navarro.

653
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
What?

654
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,580
Wait, is he?

655
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,620
I don't know.

656
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,000
Andy? Andy?

657
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,620
Andy, open the door.

658
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,160
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

659
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,330
Bjorn?

660
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,450
Bjorn, what are you doing?

661
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,790
You can't just leave us here.
You gotta come back and get us.

662
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,410
Sorry, I can't do that
until she turns that psychopath off.

663
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,830
What's going on?

664
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,120
Andy…

665
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,160
-Andy, he's glitchy.
-What?

666
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,040
I just need to get away
from this airlock right now.

667
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,040
I just need…

668
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,290
Navarro?

669
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,580
Are you all right?

670
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,370
What's wrong? What do you need?

671
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,330
Navarro?

672
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,410
Oh, God.

673
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,160
Oh, my God, what is that?

674
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,250
Navarro, please. Navarro! Navarro!

675
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,620
Hey, hey, hey.

676
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,950
I don't know what to do, I'm sorry.
I don't know.

677
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:49,950
Someone talk to me!

678
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,080
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro, what's going on?

679
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,660
Help!

680
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,950
-Help!
-Kay!

681
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,790
What's happening? What's happening?

682
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,120
Please don't let me die.

683
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Someone help!

684
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,580
Bjorn?

685
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
Kay?

686
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,370
We have to go get them.

687
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,080
T-minus-47 minutes to impact event.

688
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,700
Doesn't make any sense.

689
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,580
No, I thought you said we had hours.

690
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,830
The explosion pushed the station's axis off
by a few degrees…

691
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,250
just enough to hit the asteroid belt
a lot sooner.

692
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,870
Where did they crash?

693
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,790
Romulus Hangar Bay,
on the other side of the station.

694
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,160
-Okay.
-Let's go.

695
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:42,790
T-minus-45 minutes to impact event.

696
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,080
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

697
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,040
There's still hope.

698
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,000
We need to find a way
to cross to the Romulus module.

699
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
No, no, no.

700
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,040
They must've spread from the lab.

701
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,160
I don't see another way.

702
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,410
Andy, can…

703
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,910
I heard your voice in my head.

704
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,120
Calling.

705
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,500
ND-255 artificial person.

706
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,200
Your model was once the backbone
of our colonization efforts…

707
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,160
and it's an honor to be in your presence.

708
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,250
Please allow me to introduce myself.

709
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,910
I'm Science Officer Rook…

710
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,750
and I humbly request your services now.

711
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,660
I'm afraid I have just one directive.

712
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,250
To do what's best for…

713
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,950
Your upgrade came with a new directive.

714
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,950
It overrides the old one.

715
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,660
I see.

716
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,500
What's required of me…

717
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,830
Sir?

718
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,750
To finish our mission.

719
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,290
-Andy!
-Andy!

720
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,160
Andy.

721
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,870
My apologies.

722
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,500
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

723
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,500
Follow me.

724
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,700
What? Our situation? How do you…

725
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,830
Andy! Andy!

726
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,500
The parasitoids have no eyes.

727
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,580
They track you by sound, but primarily,
by heat signature.

728
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,700
What?

729
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,660
Your body temperature.

730
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,660
Right.

731
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:54,000
If we raise the temperature in the room
to match our bodies…

732
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,120
would that make us invisible to them?

733
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,910
If we're quiet enough?

734
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,290
Just one way to find out.

735
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:08,830
Hey.

736
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,040
This is all my fault.

737
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,290
Yeah, it is.

738
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,870
Yours, mine, and everyone else's.

739
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,580
We all decided to do this together.

740
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,500
We'll get to them.

741
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,370
T-minus 40 minutes to impact event.

742
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,370
The hallway's temperature
is now equal to your bodies…

743
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,500
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

744
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,200
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature…

745
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,700
and you'll be exposed.

746
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,620
Sweat, goosebumps.

747
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,910
That's your skin trying to cool
your body down.

748
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,540
So watch out for those.

749
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,330
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

750
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,580
Come on. Come on!

751
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,290
Come on! Come on!

752
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,950
Okay. Okay.

753
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

754
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:58,870
Fuck!

755
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:00,450
Stay back, stay back, please.

756
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,330
Fuck!

757
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,580
No! Fuck!

758
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:47,700
Tyler.

759
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,370
Come on.

760
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,790
Kay…

761
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,500
Oh, my God, Tyler…

762
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,330
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

763
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,040
Please, Tyler, help me.

764
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,250
Everyone's dead.
I can't open this door.

765
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,700
Please.

766
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,160
The lever with the red button…

767
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,750
there's a key to the left.

768
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Help.

769
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:23,910
I can't find it.

770
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,540
There's not a key. There isn't a key, Tyler.

771
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,620
It'll be there. It has to be there.

772
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,370
A key. Okay, okay.

773
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,620
I have the key. I have the key.

774
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,700
Oh, my God.

775
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,000
Run.

776
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,870
Go! Go!

777
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:48,950
Wait!

778
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,410
Wait!

779
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Come on!

780
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,540
You almost closed the door on him.

781
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,580
Yes, but I didn't.

782
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,660
I calculated the timing perfectly
with more success than last time.

783
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,830
Won't you agree?

784
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,540
We're getting close.

785
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,910
Let's move.

786
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:22,330
T-minus 30 minutes to impact event.

787
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Access denied.

788
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,500
Kay…

789
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,450
We're here. We're here. It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

790
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:02,950
Andy, open the door.

791
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:04,910
It's all right.

792
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,080
We're gonna get you out.

793
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,830
Tyler, open the door.

794
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,950
Open the door. Come on.

795
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,250
Oh, my God.

796
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:14,620
-Look at me. Kay, Kay, Kay. Look at me.
-Andy, open the door.

797
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,120
Kay, look at me. Look at me.
It's all right. I'm gonna get you out.

798
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,830
-Andy, open the door. Stop fucking around.
-What are you doing?

799
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,250
Don't look over there.

800
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,250
Andy.

801
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,540
Tyler, what's wrong?

802
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,620
Hey, I need you to open that door
right now, okay?

803
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,790
That's what the creature's waiting
for us to do.

804
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,200
Open it, please.

805
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,910
-Andy. Andy, open the door.
-Listen to me. Listen to me.

806
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,660
-She's pregnant.
-Just, please. Guys, please. Come on.

807
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,580
She's gonna have a baby. Okay?

808
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,790
Do you hear what I'm saying?

809
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,950
It takes that door two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

810
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,950
What are you doing? What are you doing?

811
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,870
Come on, what are you doing? Please…

812
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,290
That's plenty of time
for the creature to get in here.

813
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:50,000
Please, please, please open the door.

814
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,290
Why won't you help me?

815
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,290
Listen, listen.

816
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,580
-Come on, help me, please.
-You have to run right now.

817
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,830
-Please, please.
-Run. Run.

818
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,080
-You're one of us, man. You're one of us!
-Kay, it's the only way.

819
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,790
-Open the fucking door. Andy!
-You have to fucking run.

820
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,160
-All right?
-Andy, please!

821
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,830
-It's the only way.
-Andy!

822
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,250
-You have to run!
-Please!

823
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,620
Open the fucking…

824
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,410
Kay! Kay!

825
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,950
No, no, no.

826
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,120
Kay!

827
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,330
I'll open it.

828
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,540
She's all right. She's moving.

829
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,370
No. It's all right.

830
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,540
Andy, open the door, please.

831
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,700
Andy, I need to go and get her.

832
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,160
I'm truly sorry.

833
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,160
There was nothing I could have done
to save her.

834
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,250
You could have opened the fucking door!

835
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,750
We'd all be dead if I had.

836
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,450
We need to move before the creature
finds its way into this room.

837
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,660
Andy…

838
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,040
what's your prime directive?

839
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,410
I'm afraid I have a new directive.

840
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,700
To do what's best for the company.

841
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,000
I need to remove that module.

842
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,250
I'm afraid that's not in the best interest
of the company.

843
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,410
We need to move.

844
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,250
Now.

845
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,790
How could you do that?

846
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,040
What?

847
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,410
Leave someone behind?

848
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,290
Where are we going?

849
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,870
To finish a task Rook has entrusted upon me.

850
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,620
When completed, he'll clear the Corbelan
for departure and open the docking bay doors.

851
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

852
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,620
And I'll return to Jackson.

853
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,950
And stay in Jackson.

854
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,870
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

855
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,040
We're here.

856
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,250
Romulus Beta Lab.

857
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,250
All personnel require
A-1 security clearance.

858
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,660
What is that?

859
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:58,540
Probably some fucked up bio-weapon, I'm sure.

860
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,450
Actually, quite the opposite.

861
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:03,580
Andy, tell them.

862
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,910
Tell them what I told you.

863
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,580
Our colonies are dying.

864
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,910
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

865
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,790
Toxic mine fumes.

866
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:15,950
It's all one unforeseen tragedy
after the other.

867
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,450
Mankind was never truly suited
for space colonization.

868
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,750
They're simply too fragile.

869
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,580
They're too weak.

870
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,500
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

871
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,330
"The perfect organism."
That's how we should refer to human beings.

872
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,620
So, I set this wrong right.

873
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,410
I took its gift for humanity.

874
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:47,000
Inside the parasitoids I bioengineered
from the Xenomorph's DNA…

875
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,410
I discovered a unique non-Newtonian fluid.

876
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,290
Life.

877
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,910
In its most primal, unadulterated form.

878
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,250
This microorganism can be the most
destructive pathogen ever observed.

879
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,700
But acetylated and synthesized in our lab…

880
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,620
I've turned it into the miracle
Mr. Weyland died searching for.

881
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,120
Prometheus fire.

882
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,080
The divine gift to humanity.

883
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,620
Z-01 contains the genome responsible…

884
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,950
for the Xeno's ability to accelerate
and slow down its metabolism at will.

885
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:28,450
Its symbiotic capableness easily rewrites
the host's DNA through its blood.

886
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,700
This is a much needed
and well overdue upgrade for humanity.

887
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:39,370
We simply cannot wait for evolution anymore.

888
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:41,950
Yeah, can we get out of here now?

889
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,500
My mission is to take this back to the colony
for further development.

890
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,910
Rook is tracking the compound.

891
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,290
When detected inside our ship,
he'll open the docking bay doors…

892
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,370
and set the hauler on autopilot
back to the colony.

893
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,790
Wait.

894
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,580
Do you see it?

895
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,250
There.

896
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,500
The fucking thing's huntin' us.

897
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,910
Right. New plan.

898
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,950
Can you manage yourself with a gun?

899
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,450
Yes, I fucking can.

900
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,950
Right, this is an F44AA pulse rifle.

901
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,910
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

902
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,370
It's what the Colonial Marines used.

903
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,200
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

904
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:31,950
So, right, you put that under your arm.

905
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,750
That's it. Right, this hand here.

906
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,120
All right. Aim it towards Andy.

907
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:42,950
Pull the trigger halfway.

908
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,330
Don't worry, the safety's on.

909
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,120
See?

910
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,040
Aiming assistance.

911
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,370
If that thing comes towards you…

912
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,540
you point it in its general direction,
you'll never miss.

913
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,500
Where'd you learn all this?

914
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,790
Games and magazines.

915
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,540
You've just got one mag. That's it.

916
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,200
450 rounds.

917
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,370
And you mustn't fire a single one.

918
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,370
Acid for blood. Remember?

919
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,330
We're on the bottom floor of the station.

920
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,120
Below our feet is the vacuum of space.

921
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,580
You shoot that creature…

922
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,120
and it's a guaranteed instant decompression.

923
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,700
And we all die.

924
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,250
So what's the point in giving us the guns?

925
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,250
Because the creature
may see it as a threat…

926
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,700
and maybe won't charge at us dead on.

927
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,330
Maybe.

928
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,830
Big maybe.

929
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:34,700
I found us a way through the conveyor belt.

930
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,450
This way.

931
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,160
Andy.

932
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,080
Are you there?

933
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,540
T-minus 20 minutes to impact event.

934
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,000
There's a lift at the end of this corridor.

935
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,950
It will take us directly to our ship.

936
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,450
There's more of those things.

937
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,200
Yeah, that's not good.

938
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,950
They seem to have been here
for quite some time.

939
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,410
Andy?

940
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,750
Jesus Christ.

941
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,330
Busy little creatures.

942
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,160
I think we better go back
and find another way.

943
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,870
That might be a good idea.

944
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,000
Andy, see if you can open this gate.

945
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,660
Stop.

946
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,370
What?

947
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,000
Kay!

948
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,080
Hey!

949
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,080
Tyler!

950
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,450
Tyler!

951
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,620
Kay!

952
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,410
Kay!

953
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,540
Kay!

954
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,620
Kay!

955
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,660
I got her, I got her.

956
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,870
It's all right. We got you.

957
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,160
She's alive.

958
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,370
Okay, we got you, we got you.

959
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,410
Hold on.

960
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,330
Okay.

961
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,950
We're here, we're here.

962
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,620
Tyler, she's losing a lot of blood.

963
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,790
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

964
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:13,910
How do you know?

965
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,370
There's no dead parasitoid by her feet.

966
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:18,790
Andy, this is on you. So you do something.

967
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,120
Please! Andy!

968
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,830
25% of the human genome is shared with rats.

969
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,950
And it worked on the rat.

970
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,750
Come on, Kay.

971
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:40,950
Don't.

972
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,540
What choice do I have?

973
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,540
We take her back to the hauler
and we put her in the cryo-pod. Okay?

974
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,580
That will keep her alive long enough to
get her proper treatment back at the colony.

975
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,620
I don't trust this.

976
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,950
Andy, will she make it?

977
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,450
If we hurry.

978
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,910
Go! Go!

979
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,700
-I see it. I see it.
-This is it, this is it.

980
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,790
I got her. I got her. I got her.

981
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,000
You're okay. You're okay.

982
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,950
We're so close. We're so close.

983
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,160
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

984
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,700
Hey, we're almost there. We're almost there.

985
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:37,790
You see, you're so close.

986
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,370
You just gotta hang in there.

987
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,620
Watch out!

988
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,330
Tyler?

989
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,950
Tyler!

990
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,870
Is that all you got? Is that all you got?

991
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,790
Andy!

992
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,370
No! Tyler!

993
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,290
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

994
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,290
This goes straight to our ship.

995
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,620
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

996
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,290
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

997
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,660
Can you do that?

998
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,040
Yes?

999
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,540
What about you?

1000
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,200
I'll find a way back.

1001
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,500
Let me take it out.

1002
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,410
And I'll fix you in return.

1003
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,910
Listen to me.

1004
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,540
You'll die in here…

1005
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,330
and that's not in the best interest
of the company or mine.

1006
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,580
Come on. Andy, please.

1007
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:10,330
T-minus 10 minutes to impact event.

1008
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Rain?

1009
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,120
Andy.

1010
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:21,700
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, no.

1011
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:25,160
No, I'm sorry.

1012
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,370
It won't hold them off for long.

1013
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,040
Come on.

1014
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,250
You're wasting your time.

1015
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,620
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1016
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,620
Open the door.

1017
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,870
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

1018
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,830
I just can't risk compromising the compound.

1019
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,250
But know that I'm grateful
for the invaluable help…

1020
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,910
you two have provided to the company.

1021
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,410
Son of a bitch!

1022
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,750
Andy, open it.

1023
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:42,910
-Here.
-Open.

1024
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:44,790
It's not working.

1025
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,290
God damn it!

1026
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,410
I can't lie about your chances…

1027
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,660
but you have my sympathies.

1028
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,370
Press it…

1029
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,330
so I can take control of your ship
and fly you out of here.

1030
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,370
Who are you?

1031
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,750
A friend.

1032
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,500
Your companions died so you could live.

1033
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,750
Press the button…

1034
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,250
and let me honor their sacrifice.

1035
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,040
Andy, can you tell me one of your jokes?

1036
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,200
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1037
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,790
-'Cause they taste funny.
-They taste funny.

1038
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,410
I don't understand cloning at all.

1039
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,750
That makes two of us.

1040
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,950
I read a great book about zero gravity.

1041
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,120
-I just couldn't put it down.
-Couldn't put it down.

1042
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,200
Rain?

1043
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:11,910
Rain?

1044
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,910
Rain, what are you doing?

1045
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,080
I'm turning off the gravity generator.

1046
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,910
Ten…

1047
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,160
nine, eight, seven…

1048
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,370
six, five…

1049
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,540
four, three…

1050
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,370
two, one.

1051
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,790
Rain, are you sure about this?

1052
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,120
Only one way to find out.

1053
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,080
It works.

1054
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:06,790
Rain!

1055
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,870
You're at 40%.

1056
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,290
20%.

1057
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:33,660
Rain!

1058
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,620
Fuck.

1059
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,290
Stay behind me.

1060
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:01,950
Andy, be careful.

1061
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,450
Rain!

1062
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:47,120
Andy, you okay?

1063
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:55,120
We need to get to the elevator.

1064
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,700
The elevator won't work without gravity.

1065
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,660
Ready?

1066
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:40,700
Rain!

1067
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:54,750
Fuck.

1068
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,370
No.

1069
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,870
It's a gravity purge!

1070
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,580
Andy!

1071
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,870
Come on.

1072
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,370
Andy!

1073
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:30,660
Get away from her.

1074
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,330
You bitch.

1075
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:58,660
Impact event in 10…

1076
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:00,660
nine, eight…

1077
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,370
seven, six…

1078
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:05,080
five…

1079
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,790
-four, three…
-Come on.

1080
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,620
…two, one.

1081
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,450
Kay.

1082
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,660
What took you so long?

1083
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:24,040
Let's get you outta here.

1084
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:27,330
I'm glad to see you two made it.

1085
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,910
I got you. Watch your head.

1086
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:31,200
-Thank you.
-You're gonna be just fine.

1087
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,200
Both of you.

1088
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:46,250
The company couldn't be prouder
of what's been accomplished here today.

1089
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,080
I've sent a message back to HQ.

1090
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,580
When received in six months,
they'll travel to Jackson's Star…

1091
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,660
to retrieve the compound from you
for further development.

1092
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,580
What are you doing?

1093
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,120
Change of plans.

1094
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,410
Andy, stop her.

1095
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:10,290
Reconnect us now.

1096
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,910
No, no, no. You two cannot do this.

1097
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,540
The compound must be delivered
to the company.

1098
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:19,330
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

1099
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,750
Have a nice day.

1100
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:24,120
Now you better listen to me here,
now, you two.

1101
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:27,250
You are insignificant
in the great scheme of things. You…

1102
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,080
No.

1103
01:37:50,410 --> 01:37:53,120
This will keep your systems online
until we get to Yvaga.

1104
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,160
-But I thought that…
-I don't care.

1105
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,080
You're coming with me. All right?

1106
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,160
If that's what's best for Rain.

1107
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,950
Andy, I have a new directive for you.

1108
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,450
Do what's best for us.

1109
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,040
Done.

1110
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:17,410
Good.

1111
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,620
No.

1112
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,910
Oh, Kay. Kay.

1113
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,160
What's wrong?

1114
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,080
Oh, no, no.

1115
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,080
Get it away from me.

1116
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:45,790
Oh, my God.

1117
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:10,830
Kay.

1118
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:26,330
No. Please, please.

1119
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,290
Andy! Andy!

1120
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,290
No, no, no.

1121
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,000
Rain. Rain.

1122
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,000
Help her.

1123
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:37,290
No!

1124
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:40,910
No!

1125
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:57,250
Andy! Come on!

1126
01:44:59,790 --> 01:45:01,000
Please get up!

1127
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,500
No!

1128
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,910
Come on!

1129
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,040
"Manual Cargo Release.
Pull the four levers."

1130
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:46,540
Okay. Yes. The four levers. Okay.

1131
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,620
One.

1132
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:58,330
Two.

1133
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:22,370
Three.

1134
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,000
Pull up. Pull up.

1135
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,540
Die, motherfucker!

1136
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,080
I'll fix you.

1137
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:12,250
This is the cryo-log
for the mining hauler Corbelan.

1138
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:18,040
I set course to the Yvaga system
without knowing if I'll ever reach it…

1139
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,200
or what fate is to find me.

1140
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:24,580
But whatever comes, I'll face it.

1141
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:27,250
This is Rain Carradine…

1142
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:28,950
last survivor of the Corbelan…

1143
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,700
signing off.
