21
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,428
You know
the first thing I thought

22
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,222
when I saw you?

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,227
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

24
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,605
What if it's a her?

25
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,734
What would you call her?

26
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,861
Ragni, maybe.

27
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,446
Sorry?

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,072
Ragni.

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,367
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

30
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,703
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

31
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,414
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

32
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,666
You kidding me?

33
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,170
Texas is, like, a state,
you know? -I know.

34
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,213
There's about
three or four hours

35
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,548
till we reach the peak.

36
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,426
Ah, great.

37
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,392
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,936
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

39
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,397
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

40
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,983
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

41
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,569
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,613
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

43
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,573
to use your brother's band.

44
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,158
- Why not?
- Honey...

45
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,618
He's super, super good.

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,578
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,330
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

48
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,915
Yeah, I know this.

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,709
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,379
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,841
His singing is like shit.

52
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,055
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,766
Olaf!

54
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,559
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,144
Wait for me.

56
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,105
Why are you so sensitive?

57
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,613
Told you I could get us here.

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,412
It's beautiful.

59
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,373
Thank you. I love you.

60
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,053
Elsa.

61
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,099
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

62
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,476
- Look.

63
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,230
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

64
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,233
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

65
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,902
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

66
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,406
We have such good luck
in nature.

67
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,500
What do you see?

68
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,335
Hmm?

69
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,005
It's demented or something.

70
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,340
What?

71
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,553
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. -Yeah.

72
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,597
Demented?

73
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,140
I-I-I think we should leave it.

74
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,183
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

75
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,560
- Come on...
Ah!

76
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,022
Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.

77
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,524
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, kristoffer.

78
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,944
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

79
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,406
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

80
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,702
Oh, fuck.

81
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,204
Don't panic.

82
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,372
What do we do?

83
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,916
"If it's black, fight back.

84
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,918
If it's brown, lay down."

85
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,586
But is it black or is it brown?

86
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,921
I mean, it looks brown to me.

87
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,714
We're in appalachia.
It's black.

88
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,424
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

89
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,469
You're not a bear expert.

90
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,095
Whatever you do, don't...

91
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,181
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

92
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,102
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

93
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,561
Run!
- Where do we go?

94
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

95
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,066
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

96
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,276
- Run!

97
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,070
He's coming! Come on!

98
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,781
No! It's following...

99
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,205
Olaf! No!

100
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,457
God!

101
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,134
Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

102
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,096
Olaf!

103
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,663
This is drugs.

104
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,040
This is your brain on drugs.

105
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,712
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

106
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,964
The thrill can kill.

107
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,970
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

108
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,182
And pulling the trigger.

109
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,229
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

110
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,315
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

111
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,317
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

112
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,820
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

113
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,823
when his parachute
failed to open.

114
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,410
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

115
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,163
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

116
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,165
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

117
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,167
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

118
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,252
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

119
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,088
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

120
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,174
wrapped in
football-size packages

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,219
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

122
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,645
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,689
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

124
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,357
Nothing.

125
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,485
Here's the I.D.

126
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,236
I know who that is.

127
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,782
Full name:
Andrew c. Thornton ii.

128
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,035
Man was out of his mind.

129
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,955
- What's the "c" stand for?
- Hmm?

130
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,210
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

131
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,215
Thornton was one of Syd
white's guys out of Missouri.

132
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,259
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

133
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,221
Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.

134
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,391
And there's more of this
out there.

135
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,436
They dumped it somewhere.

136
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,564
Hey, reba,
you have a dog, right?

137
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,399
Had.

138
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,111
Border collie. Barry.

139
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,530
Sorry for your loss.

140
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,532
Border collie, huh?

141
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,617
That's a cool dog.

142
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,952
Did he play fetch and stuff?

143
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,329
He loved fetch.

144
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,581
What?

145
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,542
Nothing. I just...

146
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,462
That's just awesome.

147
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,940
Damn it, Gabe.

148
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,693
Hi, daveed.

149
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,446
Uh, mind if I order first?

150
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,449
This won't take long.

151
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,708
Damn, I just bought these.

152
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,882
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

153
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,260
Did you hear about Thornton?

154
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,136
It's a tough way to go.

155
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,346
He only had 30 kilos on him.

156
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,308
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

157
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,809
Chattahoochee.

158
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,102
Georgia?

159
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,937
There's an area
called blood mountain.

160
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,814
When the plane's going down,

161
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,816
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

162
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,401
And then we just go and get it.

163
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,821
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

164
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,656
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

165
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,033
Eddie's in mourning.

166
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,868
Joanie just died.

167
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,161
And he quit.

168
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,079
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,831
She's not here anymore.

170
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,000
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

171
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,211
Syd, I-I just don't...

172
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,420
Stop.

173
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,298
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

174
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,676
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

175
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,096
Grandpa Syd, watch.

176
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,391
Yeah, that's great.

177
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,146
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,816
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

179
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,402
Chicken's in the microwave.

180
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,280
Just hit "start."

181
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,199
Thought you were off tonight.

182
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,951
We talked about this, remember?

183
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,494
Me picking up some extra shifts?

184
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,037
You said you were okay with it.

185
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,747
I was okay with it
until I realized

186
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,707
why you want
those extra shifts...

187
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,046
So you could go and do overtime
with ray the pediatrician.

188
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,050
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

189
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,886
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

190
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,471
this weekend
to see his band play.

191
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,307
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

192
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,184
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

193
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,727
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

194
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,646
It's Nashville.

195
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,358
He's a good guy, deirdra.

196
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,776
Just...

197
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,152
Give him a chance.

198
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,321
Please don't do that.

199
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,657
Do what?

200
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,410
You know what.

201
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,455
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

202
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,252
Close my door.

203
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,760
That's enough for today.

204
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,847
Wait, what?

205
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,850
Hey, Eddie.

206
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,229
They spelled her name wrong, daveed.

207
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,606
- It says "John."
- Oh.

208
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,942
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

209
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,111
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

210
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,280
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

211
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,282
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

212
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,451
I got seven more days of "John."

213
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,453
The chutist has been identified

214
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,246
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

215
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,582
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

216
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,419
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

217
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,006
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

218
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,634
I'm so sad, man.

219
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,346
I'm so fucking sad.

220
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,182
Okay?

221
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,857
Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?

222
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,651
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

223
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,654
It's just plain.

224
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,917
I knew you'd be late.

225
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,127
It finally came in.
Check it out.

226
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,004
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

227
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,048
Like a thousand, but worth it.

228
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,883
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

229
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,968
My mom is gonna be home soon.

230
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,139
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

231
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Why by lunch?

232
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,769
The light, Henry.

233
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,896
But I got to go pee.

234
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,314
Go outside.

235
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,191
Why do I skip school with you?

236
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,735
You're bossier than
the teachers.

237
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,320
Now, the adoption people...

238
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,489
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there...

239
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,699
Told me I was supposed to be
getting me a lab.

240
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,495
A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.

241
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,205
I don't know
if there was an error,

242
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,041
because the one I got
is just kind of...

243
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,876
Bob?
- I don't know,

244
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,378
just kind of fancy.

245
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,089
Bob, captain says
it's time to go. -Got it.

246
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,592
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

247
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,469
Hey, reba.

248
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,722
You got plans for tonight?

249
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,350
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

250
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,146
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after rosette?

251
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,064
- Oh.
- I have to go to Georgia

252
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,315
for the Thornton case,

253
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,025
and you said
you were good at dogs.

254
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,777
I said I had a dog.

255
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,572
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

256
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,282
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

257
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,741
talking at a bar last night.

258
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,619
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

259
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,413
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

260
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,374
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

261
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,626
I only had her for a day.

262
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,170
Please?

263
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,756
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

264
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,593
Just go.

265
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,304
We'll be fine.

266
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,598
Thanks.

267
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,601
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

268
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,478
I can. I know the way.

269
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,313
School's gonna call, you know.

270
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,315
You know what? Let 'em.

271
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,775
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

272
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,319
So's your dad.

273
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,112
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

274
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,697
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

275
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,449
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

276
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,117
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

277
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,452
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

278
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,786
Admit it.

279
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,789
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

280
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,447
- Jesus! Fuck!

281
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,573
Coral, it's sari.

282
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,200
Is Dee Dee over there?

283
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,160
School just called.

284
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,495
No.

285
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,831
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

286
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,750
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

287
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,629
so can you please
just put him on?

288
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,674
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

289
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,010
What the hell is wrong with him?

290
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,846
Never mind.

291
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,372
<i><font color=Lime>♪ A love song of the waterfall ♪</i></font>

292
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,296
<i><font color=Lime>♪ I hear through
virgin timbertop... ♪</i></font>

293
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,475
50 cents.

294
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,233
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

295
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,068
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

296
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,446
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

297
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,615
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

298
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,076
Vest pocket. Come on.

299
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,331
Is that perfume?

300
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,207
That's none of your business.

301
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,543
Well, it smells really nice.

302
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,087
Yeah, well, it's European.

303
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,422
Oh.

304
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,965
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

305
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,884
Is it too much?

306
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,968
Not at all.

307
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,261
Smells expensive.

308
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,931
Well, it is.

309
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,767
You want a sucker?

310
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,644
Sure.

311
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,936
I like the green one.

312
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,605
This is a red one.

313
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

314
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,987
Oh, shit. He's here.

315
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,124
Am I in the right place?

316
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,628
Oh! Right.

317
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,296
Told you it was big.

318
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,965
Oh, it's big.

319
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,092
What's that smell?

320
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,469
It's European.

321
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,014
Someone been smoking?

322
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,641
Um, he was.

323
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,975
- Can you believe it?
- What?

324
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,310
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

325
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,062
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

326
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,357
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

327
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,484
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

328
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,653
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

329
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,405
Just get out of here.

330
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,990
- Get out.

331
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,119
Unbelievable.

332
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,413
You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.

333
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,499
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

334
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,606
Hey, Henry!

335
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,484
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

336
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,028
Hold on.

337
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,241
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

338
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,659
Marking our territory.

339
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,536
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

340
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,207
I'm not shitting.

341
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,962
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

342
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,548
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

343
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,217
Hey, Henry.

344
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,104
Check it out.

345
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,150
It's drugs, I think.

346
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,777
It's drugs?

347
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,945
Remember that guy from assembly?

348
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,073
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

349
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,992
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

350
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,619
No.

351
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,913
This is definitely cocaine.

352
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,414
Yeah. Of course.

353
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,250
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

354
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,339
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

355
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,591
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

356
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,926
When I do it.

357
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,052
Oh, yeah?

358
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,136
With who?

359
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,596
With faulk.

360
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,931
After church.

361
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,933
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

362
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,559
Are you friends with faulk?

363
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,727
No. He's a pervert.

364
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,187
Then you wouldn't know.

365
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,438
Liar.

366
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,690
You're just mad
you're never invited.

367
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,734
I don't care I'm not invited.

368
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,987
Sounds like you care.

369
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,782
Do some, then.

370
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,076
What?

371
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,203
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

372
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,123
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

373
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,252
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

374
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,837
That wouldn't be good.

375
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,129
Fine.

376
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,632
Knife me.

377
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,102
Okay, so how do I do it?

378
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,271
You eat it.

379
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,313
How much?

380
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,984
Like a tablespoon's worth.

381
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,620
Oh!

382
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,582
- Son of a bitch!

383
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,669
Oh, what the hell?

384
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,422
- Rookie.

385
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,091
You do it, then.

386
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,969
Ugh.

387
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,192
- Ah, shit!

388
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,028
What the hell?

389
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,406
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

390
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,328
Ugh!

391
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,039
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

392
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,999
Let's sell drugs together.

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,336
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and faulk.

394
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,048
There's more.

395
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,551
Ow.

396
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,221
Something got into it.

397
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,681
A deer, maybe.

398
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,892
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

399
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,393
It'd be like this.

400
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,188
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like... bang!

401
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,940
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

402
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,400
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

403
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,570
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

404
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,532
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

405
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,079
My throat's really runny.

406
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,167
Stop that.

407
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,931
Did it do the cocaine?

408
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,768
Don't move a muscle.

409
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,525
Listen to me.

410
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,778
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

411
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,905
Now we have trouble.
You understand? -Got it.

412
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,074
- I'll take care of it.

413
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,243
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

414
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,578
Grandpa Syd!
Gabe, driving me nuts.

415
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,122
Little...

416
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,041
Fuck.

422
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,280
Joan loved this song.

423
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,410
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

424
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,582
Um, Eddie, listen.

425
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,836
Uh, when joanie died,

426
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,465
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

427
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,383
It's fine.

428
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,218
No, I could've did more.

429
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,344
It's fine.

430
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,429
I should've been there.

431
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,764
I didn't need you there.

432
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,098
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

433
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,683
It's against my constitution.

434
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,643
I'm more than a drug dealer.

435
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,937
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

436
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,397
We're friends, right?

437
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,482
No.

438
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,401
Fine.

439
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,737
I think he's happy she's dead.

440
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,197
He's not happy she died.

441
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,699
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

442
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,535
if we can call it that.

443
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,329
Sometimes...

444
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,706
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

445
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,458
No, joanie died of cancer.

446
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,709
I know.

447
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,795
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

448
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,213
You can't give no one cancer.

449
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,881
Yes, you can. With stress.

450
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,925
Stop protecting him.

451
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,843
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

452
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,929
No!

00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,239
- Did you notice my nails?
- Those are beautiful.

459
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,617
- Thank you. We start...
- Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

460
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,786
I'm wearing the stuff.

461
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,455
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

462
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,290
13, come through here?
My daughter...

463
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,334
You lost your daughter
in the park.

464
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,962
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

465
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,048
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

466
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,883
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

467
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,510
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

468
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,971
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

469
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,514
with the way things are at home.

470
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,849
She's not a runaway.

471
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,267
She just came to paint the...

472
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,768
Can someone just please point me

473
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,103
in the direction
of blood mountain?

474
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,147
This is blood mountain.

475
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,481
- Sorry. I-I'm Peter.
Oh.

476
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,066
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

477
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,944
We're about to head up there ourselves.

478
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,362
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

479
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,905
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

480
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,282
is a very important process.

481
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,825
We wouldn't want you distracted

482
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,785
by our little
damsel in distress here.

483
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,328
Nothing can distract me

484
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,956
from making sure
the entire biological community

485
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,749
is safe for all our friends.

486
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,376
Friends?

487
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,336
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

488
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,797
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

489
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,217
Well, I won't be a burden.

490
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,971
I'll get my hat.

491
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,473
Okay.

492
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,353
Shoes okay for hiking?

493
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,272
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

494
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,149
I have on boots.
- Yep.

495
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,817
Come on, Eddie.

496
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,527
I'm done playing this game.

497
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,778
You-you wanted...

498
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,363
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

499
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,324
You still have
three more questions.

500
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,493
Listen.
What?

501
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,746
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

502
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,497
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

503
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,335
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

504
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,925
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

505
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,344
Park rangers are peace officers.

506
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,679
Which means we can shoot people.

507
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,140
Forest is a dangerous place.

508
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,392
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

509
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,769
"Gang of pubes"?

510
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,146
Teens. Delinquents.

511
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,691
They've been attacking hikers.

512
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,193
They hurt anyone?

513
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,488
They cut them with a knife.

514
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,865
Call themselves the doochamps.

515
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,743
Watch your back.

516
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,371
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

517
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,749
Out of nowhere.

518
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,681
Fuck is this?

519
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,767
He's afraid, buds.

520
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,560
Empty your pockets.

521
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,979
No.

522
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,565
Empty your pockets, please.

523
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,070
Since you asked so nicely.

524
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,865
You think this is a joke?

525
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,450
I do.

526
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,244
Get him, buds.

527
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,912
I'm shaking
a fucking knife, man. Come on.

528
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,747
Just stab him. -Come on, man.
It's a fucking knife!

529
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,333
- Go on!

530
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,254
Oh!

531
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,755
Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.

532
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,341
- Come on, rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

533
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,595
Give me this fucking board!

534
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
You're going down, man!

535
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,857
Submit! Submit!

536
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,276
What the...

537
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,779
Hold this!

538
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,241
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

539
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,088
Oh, my.

540
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,020
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

541
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,647
Shit!

542
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,149
I love this road.

543
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,692
Ah, love it up there.

544
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,819
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

545
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,321
What? The falls.

546
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,697
The secret falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

547
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,324
- or take the loop.
I love the loop.

548
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,034
Well, you can see
the top of the...

549
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,994
This is a more direct...

550
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,871
All right. We're going this way.

551
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,539
Well, crap.

552
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,125
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

553
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,211
Just distracting you completely.

554
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,712
She can hear you.

555
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,299
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

556
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,843
- What's taking you so long?

557
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,805
What'd you do?

558
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,149
Please tell me
you found them like this.

559
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,192
They attacked me.

560
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,360
Are they dead?

561
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,736
Well, one might be.

562
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,240
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

563
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,327
Jesus chr... they're kids.

564
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,663
I loved this fucking Jersey, man.

565
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,123
Okay, they're fine.

566
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,250
Thank god.

567
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,877
No fucking way.

568
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,214
Daveed?

569
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,055
What happened?

570
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,140
Hey.

571
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,391
- Wake up.

572
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,934
Where'd you find this?

573
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,394
Whoa.

574
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,021
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

575
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,565
You tried to fucking kill me.

576
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,025
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

577
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,194
I tell him that all the time.

578
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,113
Where did you find this?

579
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,906
Up on the mountain.

580
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:08,991
Where's the rest of it?

581
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,868
I don't know.

582
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,538
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

583
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,081
What do you think I'll do
to just you

584
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,292
when you're already
on the floor?

585
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,335
Okay. Okay.

586
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,088
We stashed it under a gazebo.

587
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,965
Going back for it later tonight.

588
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,925
A gazebo?

589
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,095
It's a pavilion-type structure.

590
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,889
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

591
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,725
I didn't.

592
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,602
Are my buds dead?

593
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,270
- Show us where.
- Oh, god.

594
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,439
You know,
i-I'm feeling kind of tired.

595
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,940
I think I should rest.

596
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,942
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

597
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,360
Eddie, go get the gun.

598
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,778
It's in the glove.

599
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,113
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

600
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,073
Yeah. Same.

601
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,118
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

602
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,996
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

603
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,790
Okay.

604
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,292
Okay.

605
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,460
All right, all right.

606
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,463
All right, I'm coming.

607
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,548
Relax.

608
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,476
It's getting real cold out.

609
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,035
Let's go.

610
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,163
So, where you guys from?

611
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,873
Shut up. Keep walking.

612
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,501
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

613
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,503
It better not be a long hike.

614
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,837
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

615
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,506
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

616
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,174
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

617
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,009
Well, it wasn't me.

618
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,511
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

619
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,012
Getting stabbed sucks.

620
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,473
Hey, shut the fuck up.

621
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,978
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Well, you're too hot ta trot,

627
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,574
Yeah, reba, it's Bob.

628
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,451
I was wondering
how rosette is doing.

629
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,745
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

630
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,330
I...

631
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,043
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

632
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,797
Anyway, I...

633
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,758
Thanks again for helping out.

634
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,386
Bye.

635
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,014
Look at this.

636
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,390
Oh, no.

637
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,642
Look at this mess.

638
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,686
People don't have any respect.

639
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,646
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

640
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,939
I... let me pick that up.

641
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,233
- All right. Thank you, ranger.
- Dee Dee!

642
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,193
That is sticking.
- I got some oil in the car.

643
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,403
Dee Dee! Henry!

644
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,904
'Cause if that stays open,

645
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,740
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

646
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,825
What kind of critters? Huh?

647
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,452
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

648
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,662
Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

649
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,289
- Dee Dee!
Uh, skunks.

650
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,749
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

651
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,584
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

652
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,585
Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. -I think they're cute.

653
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,045
Uh, skunks.

654
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,212
Skunks. Hmm.

655
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,339
- Possums.
Possums.

656
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,506
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

657
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,592
- Uh...
- Hey, possum.

658
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,761
Mrs. Mckinndry!

659
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,137
Henry?

660
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,930
Here! Hello?

661
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,182
Henry?

662
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,768
Up here!

663
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,771
Hey. Whoa.
Oh.

664
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,731
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

665
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,815
No.

666
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,609
- No, that's not safe at all.
No.

667
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,778
It's too high.
You got to come down.

668
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,862
Get down here.

669
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,657
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

670
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,492
- No shit, Henry.
It's high.

671
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,035
But there was a bear.

672
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,370
A really terrible bear.

673
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,829
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

674
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,956
- It was fucked!
Hey!

675
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,750
That's inappropriate.

676
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,128
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

677
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,588
It attacked you?

678
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,590
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.

679
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,592
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

680
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,302
You must have done something
to upset it.

681
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,262
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

682
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,348
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

683
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,184
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

684
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,228
You have to listen to me!

685
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,105
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

686
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,648
The monster took her.

687
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,984
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

688
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,611
Get down here now.

689
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,155
- A...

690
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,282
- I...

691
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,993
Dee Dee!

692
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,054
Whoa!

693
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,306
Peter!

694
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,184
- No!
- Peter!

695
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,565
Oh! Oh, no!

696
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,400
It let me go! He ran off!

697
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,611
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

698
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,071
Is it gone?

699
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,991
Do you see it?

700
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,790
Yeah.

701
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,084
Why are you shooting at me?

702
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,294
Get your ass down!

703
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,712
This is your fault.

704
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,256
Right behind you. I saw it.

705
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,717
Stay down.

706
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,561
What?

707
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,663
Help me!

708
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,333
Help!

709
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,422
Ranger! Ranger!

710
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,799
Did it get you?

711
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,343
That asshole!

712
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,636
I'm gonna get him.

713
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,180
I'm gonna get that asshole.

714
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,767
I'll get help.

715
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,268
Where are you going?

716
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,603
God almighty.

717
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,773
Hey. What...

718
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,776
Where is it?

719
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,987
Hey!

720
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,199
What should I do?

721
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Motherfucker!

722
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,119
Come back! Help us!

723
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,373
Oh, fuck!

724
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,963
There's something wrong with it.

725
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,548
Yeah, I told you there was.

726
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,758
Why is it acting like this?

727
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,802
Did you feed it cocaine?

728
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,179
No. But you're safe.

729
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,139
Bears can't climb trees.

730
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,432
Of course they can!

731
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,394
Then why are you up here?

732
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,839
It's okay. It's okay.

733
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,900
Okay.

734
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,375
No.

735
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,630
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

736
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,049
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

737
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,592
- Climb.
Go, Henry!

738
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,885
Go!

739
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,013
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

740
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,891
Go up!

741
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,976
Henry, go!

742
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,854
Oh, god.

743
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,357
Go, Henry! No!
- Whoa!

744
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,566
No!

745
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,611
Oh, god. Henry!

746
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,503
Oh, god.

747
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,006
Oh, shit.

748
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,720
No, no, no, no!

749
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,849
Get off of me! No, no!

750
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,186
- Get off! Get off of me!

751
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,402
Henry, jump! Jump down!

752
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,488
- Move, Henry!

753
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,204
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

754
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,790
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

755
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,126
- Come on. Let's go.

756
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,087
Come on.

757
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,275
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

758
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,948
That was so messed up.

759
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,367
That little man
was an expert on bears

760
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,328
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

761
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,039
Wait. What did you say?

762
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,498
We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.

763
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,333
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

764
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,836
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

765
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,338
and now on that guy back there.

766
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,215
Did you hear him scream?

767
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,468
He's so dead.

768
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,970
I'd love to not remember that.

769
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,972
But it kind of seems like

770
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,517
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

771
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,687
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

772
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,689
Alive? Yeah.

773
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,358
It chased her that way.

774
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,195
We got to go. Let's go.

775
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,531
He get at you, too?

776
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,367
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

777
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,163
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

778
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,957
Keep him awake.

779
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,419
Yeah, I've been trying.

780
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,936
You piles of shit!

781
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,522
- You're the doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

782
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,191
We found it.

783
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,113
"It's not ours."

784
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,572
I'm a park ranger.

785
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,741
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

786
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,409
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

787
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,912
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

788
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,831
I'd have been
at yellowstone by now

789
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,915
if it weren't for you shits!

790
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,416
- Buds.
Huh?

791
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,294
There's someone outside.

792
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,089
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

793
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,298
- Yeah.

794
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:36,219
Now, uh, open it
when I-I count to three.

795
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,221
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

796
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,722
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

797
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,141
He took a bite out of my ass!

798
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,561
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

799
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,273
Now, open it when I say so.

800
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
Now.

801
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,990
That's a fucking bear.

802
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,998
What the fuck?!

803
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,964
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

804
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,299
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

805
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,718
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

806
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,802
Where's the bear?!

807
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,554
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

808
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,349
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

809
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,603
Close the door.

810
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,690
Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.

811
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,616
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

812
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,766
Shh.

813
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,895
He's up there.

814
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,356
He's up there.

815
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:44,181
I got it. I got it.

816
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,067
Maybe the kid can help you.

817
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,236
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

818
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,071
- What game?
- 20 questions.

819
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,573
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

820
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,076
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

821
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,203
Like, "is it a spider?

822
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,247
- Is it an arrow?"

823
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,625
What are you, new?

824
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,627
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

825
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,920
Everybody knows that.

826
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,714
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

827
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,299
Is that one of your questions?

828
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,009
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

829
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,262
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

830
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,598
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

831
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,311
Is it bigger than a bread box?

832
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,770
- Yes.
- Whoo!

833
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,105
Yeah!

834
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,898
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

835
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,067
What? No.

836
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,279
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

837
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,449
You have one question left.

838
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,215
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

839
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,841
You sure this is the way?

840
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,928
Pretty sure.

841
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,017
Dee Dee! It's okay.

842
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,686
It's mama.

843
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,190
Oh.

844
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,900
Thank god.

845
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,860
- Ew! What the heck?

846
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,154
It's paint. It's just red paint.

847
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,698
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

848
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,659
I'm a nurse, Henry.

849
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,370
Good point.

850
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,248
Come on.

851
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,546
Oh, smart girl.

852
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,799
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

853
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,052
Mrs. Mckinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

854
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,720
What?

855
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,889
Why do you ask?

856
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,392
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects...

857
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,645
For the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

858
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,065
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

859
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,568
What if they never want
to do it again?

860
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,237
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

861
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,115
But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry

862
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,367
because drugs...
Especially cocaine...

863
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,536
Are very, very bad.

864
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,288
What if they would
never find out?

865
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,914
Oh, Henry.

866
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,125
We always find out.

867
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,002
Dee Dee!

868
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,839

Medic!

873
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,280
Just open it.

874
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,656
Yeah, open it. You think?

875
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,783
Can you just push?
Harder. -

876
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,285
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

877
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,661
- All right. You go.
- Let me do it.

878
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,538
You go. Yeah.

879
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,956
Please, show me how it's done.

880
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,251
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

881
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,337
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

882
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,380
What is that?

883
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,382
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

884
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,800
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

885
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,636
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

886
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,639
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

887
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,642
Oh, fuck.

888
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,018
- Come on.

889
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,645
God, I'm trying.

890
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,313
- Come on, push.

891
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,648
I'm trying.

892
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,776
You said they called in
a concussion.

893
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,363
They did.

894
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,201
Jesus.

895
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,869
This guy's been shot.

896
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,539
Yeah. Obviously.

897
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,208
Holy shit.

898
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,334
It's the ranger.

899
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,669
- Tom.

900
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,672
Come here. She's got a gun.

901
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,676
Tom! Hello?

902
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,721
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

903
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,682
It's okay.

904
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:39,684
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

905
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,687
B... b...

906
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,855
"Buh"?

907
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,909
B... b...

908
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,547
Beth?

909
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,718
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

910
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,100
Uh...

911
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,665
Beth, we should go.

912
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,585
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

913
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,678
Bear.

914
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,431
Bear.

915
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,268
- Let's go.

916
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,146
Tom, get up!

917
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,653
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

918
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,118
Hang on. Push.

919
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,582
Oh, shit.

920
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,794
- Sorry. Sorry.

921
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,509
- Come on. Come on.

922
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,802
Anybody else surprised by

923
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,345
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

924
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,931
Leave him!

925
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,157
Our next story, the weather

926
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,076
at the top of the hour,
but first... -Go! Drive!

927
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,080
More of your favorite hits
here on 103.7 Bob fm.

928
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,582
- Tom, get in!
- Wait! Wait!

929
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,752
- Wait!
- Oh, god.

930
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,047
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

931
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:18,008
Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

932
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,595
What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?

933
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,932
What the hell
have you got a gun for?

934
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,350
Hey, move! Move!

935
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,435
Put that away!

00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,655
- The big fucking bear!
- Shut up!

942
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,115

963
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,946
I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

964
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,159
Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

965
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,454
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

966
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,956
And what a man you are.

967
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,041
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

968
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,292
Can you not?

969
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,461
I'm sorry. Just continue.

970
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,463
Well, when my daddy died,

971
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,799
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

972
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,759
It was the coolest little thing.

973
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,928
It had all these
green scales on it.

974
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,347
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

975
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,015
I thought that was so awesome.

976
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,726
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

977
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,436
but I practiced
conversation starters

978
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,230
on that lizard every day.

979
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,401
And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.

980
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,319
That's my team, man.

981
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,740
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

982
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,660
Those are my buds, man.

983
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,288
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

984
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,999
Well, you know what?

985
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,669
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

986
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,713
but people...

987
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,300
People are good at hearing.

988
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,514
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

989
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,141
- Can we...
- It's okay.

990
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,268
Y'all are hugging.

991
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,730
It's okay.

992
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,443
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

993
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:38,812
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

994
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,273
I'm already angry with you.

995
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,445
It's gone.

996
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,780
What the actual...

997
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,281
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

998
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,825
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

999
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,201
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

1000
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,869
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

1001
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,246
It's just gone.

1002
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,415
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

1003
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,625
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

1004
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,877
i'm-a give you one more chance.

1005
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,504
Where's the ba...

1006
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,466
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

1007
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:14,805
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

1008
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,391
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

1009
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,810
I ain't fucking around.

1010
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,980
Just do it.

1011
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,316
Fuck.

1012
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,402
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

1013
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,072
I'm coming down there.

1014
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,998
Uh...

1015
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,212
Uh...

1016
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,549
- Uh...

1017
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,509
Shh!

1018
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,510
I'm just trying to...

1019
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,637
Find a safe spot to hop down.

1020
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,347
How did you get up there?

1021
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,683
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

1022
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,185
I hurt my hip a little.

1023
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,895
I can try to catch you
if you want.

1024
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,483
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

1025
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,526
Let's, uh, see, uh...

1026
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,820
Get it.

1027
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,324
Fuck!

1028
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,701
Fuck!

1029
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,703
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

1030
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,539
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

1031
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,083
I told you not to move.

1032
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,169
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

1033
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,214
They're not even
next to each other.

1034
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,550
Fuck you!

1035
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,385
Come out of there!

1036
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,970
Shit! Come on out!

1037
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,890
No fucking way!

1038
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,268
God! Goddamn it!

1039
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,562
You two, on your bellies.

1040
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,607
Now! And no more moving.

1041
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,692
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

1042
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,985
Can you grab them for me?

1043
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,403
Can I grab his fingers?

1044
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,073
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

1045
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,118
Slow. Slow.

1046
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,079
Easy.

1047
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,623
Ugh, god.

1048
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,084
All right.

1049
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,710
Now, you get back on your belly.

1050
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,588
I'll hold on to these.

1051
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,304
Now, where you at?

1052
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,432
Shit.

1053
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:23,976
What?

1054
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,520
Oh, no. The river.

1055
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,606
Henry, look.

1056
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,608
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

1057
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,902
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

1058
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,696
We're on the right track.

1059
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,407
I can feel it.

1060
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,466
Mama?

1061
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,844
Fuck.

1062
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,679
Fuck, man.

1063
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,141
My fucking Jersey, man.

1064
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,311
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

1065
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,979
Until that guy in the gazebo

1066
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,731
throws his weapon
into the woods.

1067
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,691
Well, then we'll be here forever.

1068
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,194
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1069
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,070
We don't need to die
because of this.

1070
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,072
Eddie, I got this.

1071
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,324
Do you?

1072
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,160
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1073
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,828
You're all gonna get arrested.

1074
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,122
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1075
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,875
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1076
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,960
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1077
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,670
and supervised shower time.

1078
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,173
Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1079
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,925
I've never even done coke.

1080
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,011
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1081
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,180
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1082
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,723
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1083
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,683
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1084
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,603
I like to shit in peace.

1085
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,319
Nobody move.

1086
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,071
It's a bear.

1087
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,739
Yeah.

1088
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,491
No, no.

1089
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,370
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1090
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,476
Oh, fuck.

1091
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,728
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1092
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,106
Just play dead.

1093
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,591
Shh.

1094
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,453
Oh, fuck.

1095
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,795
Oh, man. You fucked.

1096
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:39,921
Eddie, can you breathe?

1097
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,882
What the fuck?

1098
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,468
I think that's a yes.

1099
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,053
Can someone do something?

1100
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,471
Maybe your boy can do something.

1101
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,308
Can you just, like... move it?

1102
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,228
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1103
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,524
Dee Dee!

1104
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,653
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1105
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,656
Oh, god.

1106
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,617
Look.

1107
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,370
Hello.

1108
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:15,123
- Is he okay?

1109
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,001
Help me, please.

1110
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,961
Does he have food?

1111
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,339
Her name was Elsa,

1112
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,759
and she was so beautiful.

1113
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,928
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1114
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,180
Were you attacked?

1115
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,933
Devil bear.

1116
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,142
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1117
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,352
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1118
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,561
Have you seen her?

1119
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,105
You have?

1120
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,315
- Was she alive?
Yes.

1121
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,858
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1122
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,777
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1123
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:44,820
I haven't...

1124
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,364
Henry!

1125
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,547
I'll show you. Come.

1126
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,804
It's not moving.

1127
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,140
I think it died.

1128
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,225
It died on top of me?

1129
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,476
Check its pulse.

1130
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,062
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1131
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,399
I'm not sure.

1132
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,569
Uh, hey, guy?

1133
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,695
Detective.

1134
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,737
Can we call a truce

1135
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,739
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1136
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,950
Yeah.

1137
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,706
Fuck.

1138
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,170
You okay?

1139
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,423
What do you think?

1140
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,608
S-Still breathing.

1141
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,943
We should go.

1142
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,321
He'll probably be all right.

1143
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,406
What the hell, man?

1144
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,782
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1145
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,826
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1146
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,119
"She."

1147
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,454
What?

1148
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,289
The bear is a girl.

1149
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,832
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1150
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,920
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1151
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,839
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1152
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,257
She's awake.

1153
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,635
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1154
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,305
Okay.

1155
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,185
Chill out. Just chill out!

1156
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,145
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1157
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,856
- Stay back.

1158
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,486
What the hell?

1159
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,323
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,495
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1161
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,163
I will be goddamned.

1162
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,665
Should we shoot her?

1163
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,127
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1164
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,006
What the fuck?

1165
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,354
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1166
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,273
- Eddie!
Daveed, help.

1167
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,900
What is this?

1168
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,360
- No, no.

1169
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,112
- Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?

1170
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,863
I-I don't like this.

1171
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,282
Please stop.

1172
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,368
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1173
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,329
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!

1174
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,498
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1175
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,624
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1176
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,709
It's-it's playing with you.

1177
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,210
I'd stay still if I were you.

1178
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,421
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1179
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,840
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1180
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,091
Daveed!

1181
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,884
All we've been through! Come on!

1182
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,219
Come on, help him!

1183
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,221
Get lower. You're not listening!

1184
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,557
- Eddie.

1185
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,351
Oh, my god. He's gonna die.

1186
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,895
No!

1187
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,607
Hey, girl.

1188
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,992
There you go, girl.

1189
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,745
There you go.

1190
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,247
There you go.

1191
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,752
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1192
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:43,933
Go!

1193
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,854
Don't have to tell me twice.

1194
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,940
Come on!

1195
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,025
Daveed!

1196
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,610
That bag's worth 14 million.

1197
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,613
We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.

1198
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:00,241
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1199
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,951
I need that bag.

1200
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,037
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1201
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,624
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1202
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,636
Shot...

1203
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,556
No. I didn't.

1204
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,646
Run! Go, go!

1205
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,108
Oh, shit!

1206
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,997
Holy shit.

1207
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,125
- Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.

1208
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,334
Where's Gabe?

1209
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,585
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1210
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,295
- Calm down.

1211
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,381
He's safe at home watching TV.

1212
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,299
What?
How long has he been alone?

1213
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,884
You left him with me!

1214
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:03,013
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1215
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,683
- Huh?

1216
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,477
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1217
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,063
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1218
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:14,149
The bear ate most of it.

1219
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,192
- What?
- The bear.

1220
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,153
It fucking did cocaine.

1221
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,654
A fucking...

1222
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,990
A bear did cocaine, dad!

1223
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,032
Fuck this!

1224
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:26,161
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1225
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,079
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1226
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,082
Look at me. Look at me.

1227
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,876
I'm on the hook here.

1228
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:37,714
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1229
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,591
And the people that I deal with,

1230
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,093
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1231
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:44,012
And look at me.

1232
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,557
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1233
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:51,060
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1234
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,979
You hear what I'm saying?

1235
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,940
It's you and Gabe.

1236
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,902
You understand?

1237
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,323
We don't have a choice.

1238
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,701
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1239
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,829
over at the pavilion structure.

1240
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,082
Come on.

1241
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,254
Come on, son. Come on.

1242
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,763
Who's there?

1243
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,765
Easy.
Stay away.

1244
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,391
Where's the duffel?

1245
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,101
I gave it to the bear.

1246
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,103
You gave it to the bear?

1247
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,232
Yeah. The bear.

1248
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,776
It loves coke.

1249
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:41,653
Wh-which way did it go?

1250
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,613
I'm not fucking around here.

1251
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,115
Syd white.

1252
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,660
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1253
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,454
They all have.

1254
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,961
Reba.

1255
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,547
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1256
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,798
I got you now.

1257
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,800
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1258
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,386
They're kind of shifty.

1259
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:12,225
What...

1260
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,811
What are you doing?

1261
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,691
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1262
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,568
You shot him?

1263
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:22,694
I told you not to hurt him.

1264
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,445
I don't work for you.

1265
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,072
The department trusted you.

1266
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:29,784
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1267
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,497
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1268
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,165
I know.

1269
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,626
- I trusted you with rosette.
- I know.

1270
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,545
Who's rosette?

1271
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,796
The dog in my car.

1272
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,339
You left a dog in the car?

1273
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,300
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1274
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,177
How is she?

1275
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,895
She being a good girl?

1276
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,480
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1277
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,857
E-Enough.

1278
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,984
Tell me which way the bear went,

1279
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,612
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1280
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:08,114
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1281
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,408
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1282
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,285
but that's just me.

1283
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,037
Well, what do you guys say?

1284
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,373
What's so funny?

1285
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,877
Apex predator,

1286
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,214
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1287
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,805
Dead north, man.

1288
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,766
- Yes, we will.

1289
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,602
Dead... dead north.

1290
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,271
Let's go.

1291
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,398
The devil bear is in there.

1292
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,942
You can't go in there.

1293
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,444
Do you have kids?

1294
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,946
We would have.

1295
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,698
I have to go find mine.

1296
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,951
And his name would be Texas.

1297
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,453
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1298
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,210
Here.

1299
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,461
Thank you.

1300
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,131
Bye, lady and little man.

1301
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,925
Bye, you both.

1302
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,636
Okay.

1303
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,889
Wait. What about me?

1304
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,996
Watch where you step.

1305
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,208
- I got you. Stay close.

1306
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,838
What's that?

1307
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,926
Don't move.

1308
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,554
Stay still, Henry.

1309
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,728
They look like polar bears.

1310
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,104
Henry?

1311
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,065
Dee Dee?

1312
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:47,523
Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1313
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:49,317
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1314
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,527
No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. -Dee Dee!

1315
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,989
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1316
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,948
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1317
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,283
Are you hurt?

1318
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,701
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1319
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,119
That looks really deep.

1320
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,371
Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow! Ow! Henry!

1321
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:03,831
Let's keep you warm.

1322
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,374
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1323
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,667
You smart girl.

1324
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,377
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1325
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,754
We found you.

1326
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,255
Put that on.

1327
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:14,258
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1328
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,760
Oh, my god.

1329
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,220
Mom, i'm-I'm so sorry.

1330
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,471
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1331
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,514
Henry told me everything.

1332
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,057
Everything?

1333
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,266
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1334
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,935
- You told her?
No.

1335
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,895
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1336
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,189
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1337
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:32,110
- Um, what was that?

1338
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,196
Cocaine bear's back.

1339
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,823
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1340
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,324
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1341
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,617
Go that way.

1342
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,869
Go ahead.

1343
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,705
It's okay. Come on.

1344
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,792
Look. It's a way out.

1345
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,506
It's the falls.
Oh, wow.

1346
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,517
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1347
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,478
Oh, god.

1348
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,362
This is it.

1349
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,283
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1350
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,869
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1351
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,748
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1352
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,253
What is that?

1353
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,297
- Oh, fuck!

1354
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,550
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1355
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,554
Come on.

1356
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,602
Eddie.

1357
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,688
Take this.

1358
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,362
Fuck.

1359
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,453
Thank you.

1360
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,005
Goddamn bear.

1361
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,591
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1362
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,893
You got what you wanted?

1363
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,229
Let's go.

1364
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,609
There's-there's a lot more
out there.

1365
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:21,571
We got to keep looking, understand?

1366
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,574
We're not whole yet.

1367
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:27,536
I'm leaving, Syd.

1368
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,083
Go.

1369
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,609
Give me the bag.

1370
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,404
When did you all get so soft?

1371
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,533
All got sand in your pussies.

1372
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,038
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1373
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,081
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1374
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,792
Stay away from the bears.

1375
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,130
This way.

1376
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,882
Come on. There's an opening.

1377
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,967
Henry, come here.

1378
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:27,429
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1379
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,183
He has a gun.

1380
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,396
No!

1381
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,857
Come on!

1382
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,442
The hell is this?

1383
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,944
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1384
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,863
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1385
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,490
I'm a mom.

1386
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,493
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1387
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,745
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1388
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:56,165
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1389
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,709
You understand?

1390
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,545
Go.

1391
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,507
Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1392
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,637
It's stuck.

1393
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,764
Fuck!

1394
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,683
Who are these guys?

1395
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,061
We're going home.

1396
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,230
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1397
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,774
Nobody's going anywhere!

1398
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,235
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1399
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,029
- Dad!
- Shut...

1400
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,698
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1401
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,367
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1402
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,702
- Fuck.

1403
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,538
Get back! Get... fuckers!

1404
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:36,914
- Stay away.

1405
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:37,998
- Whoa.
Stay away.

1406
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,125
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1407
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,459
Just give 'em the bag.

1408
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,336
Shoot the fucking bears!

1409
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,671
- Get over here.
- Dee Dee and Henry: Whoa!

1410
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,381
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1411
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,383
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1412
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,344
The fuck's the matter with you?

1413
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,222
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1414
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,640
Get 'em off me!

1415
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,100
- Fuck him.
Help me out!

1416
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,685
Ow. Eddie!

1417
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,396
- Ow!
- No.

1418
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,606
Coward. Daveed!

1419
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,942
Here, catch.

1420
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,240
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1421
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,324
Mama!

1422
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:15,286
Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.

1423
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,495
Look around, dad.

1424
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:18,539
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1425
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,916
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1426
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,751
People are dead.

1427
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,837
You are no son of mine.

1428
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,088
Hey, you!

1429
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,590
You did this.

1430
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,091
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1431
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:31,427
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1432
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,637
because you're
a piece of crap person

1433
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,764
and a bad dad!

1434
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,099
Who the fuck are you?

1435
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,268
I'm Henry,

1436
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,937
and I am so fucking tired!

1437
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,106
Yeah, me, too.

1438
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1439
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:14,136
She's protecting the cubs.

1440
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:15,221
Oh, shit!

1441
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,680
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1442
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,015
- What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.

1443
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,308
We're gonna be okay.

1444
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:20,518
Here, here, here.

1445
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:21,936
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1446
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,521
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1447
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,357
- We're gonna be all right.

1448
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,025
- Ready?
Mm-hmm.

1449
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,279
Three, two, one. Jump!

1450
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,827
- Oh, shit.

1451
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,173
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1452
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,970
Let's go!

1453
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,545
- Come on. It's okay.

1454
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,382
Eddie. Help.
We made it.

1455
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:25,435
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1456
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,848
- Oh, shit. He shot you.

1457
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,644
Help! Help!

1458
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:14,817
S-Six more days of John.

1459
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,485
Okay.

1460
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,362
Six more days...

1461
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,739
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1462
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,908
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1463
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,743
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1464
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:27,122
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1465
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,708
Hey, hey, I...

1466
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,876
I got my last question.

1467
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:34,169
What?

1468
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,671
It's 20 questions.

1469
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,506
I got my last one.

1470
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,218
What? All right. Sure.

1471
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,638
Is it joanie?

1472
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,181
It's joanie, right?

1473
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:47,851
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1474
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:50,644
How'd you guess?

1475
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,355
You're so fucking obvious.

1476
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:55,315
I just didn't want to guess it

1477
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,193
to have you crying on me
all day.

1478
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,996
She's a nurse!

1479
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,706
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1480
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,040
He's in shock.

1481
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,752
Put pressure on him.

1482
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:14,061
I've called backup.

1483
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,606
Her name's rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1484
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,566
You should get going.

1485
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,778
Take care of yourself.

1486
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:30,078
Hi. Hi.

1487
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,122
Rosette.

1488
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,801
Whose dog is this?

1489
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,386
I think it's mine.

1490
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,137
Mine and Gabe's.

1491
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:50,472
Is it on cocaine?

1492
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:52,392
No.

1493
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,979
That's a good dog.

1494
01:27:58,147 --> 01:28:00,357
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1495
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:01,860
Yeah.

1496
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,239
I knew you'd be okay.

1497
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,658
You're the toughest person
I know.

1498
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,619
I think you get that
from your mom.

1499
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,996
I think you're right.

1500
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,164
Thanks for coming to get me.

1501
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:18,417
I'm your mom. I love you.

1502
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:21,086
You, too, Henry.

1503
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,589
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray
on you too soon.

1504
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,342
No. You deserve to be happy.

1505
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,219
Henry, let's walk over here.

1506
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,597
- Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.

1507
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,015
I also don't want to look.

1508
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,725
Ugh.
Don't look.

1509
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,019
- Let's just cruise on by.

1510
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,605
Oh, here come the po-po.

1511
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:40,981
Hey, mom.

1512
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,233
I want to go to Nashville
with you and ray.

1513
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,320
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1514
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,696
Rehab?

1515
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,406
We're cokeheads now.

1516
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,866
You know?

1517
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,409
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1518
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,827
- Mrs. Mckinndry.
Mm-hmm.

1519
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,164
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1520
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,388
Rodney, are you getting it?

1521
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:15,432
I swear to god, Carol.

1522
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:17,017
Well, then zoom in.

1523
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,228
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1524
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,939
Oh, they're so cute.

1525
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,523
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1526
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:24,733
Wait.

1527
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,401
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1528
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,153
Oh.

1529
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:29,696
