1
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:41,709
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

2
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,504
Blessed art thou among women....

3
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,090
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

4
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:54,346
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,437
Now and in the hour of our death.

6
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,940
Amen.

7
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,829
No, no.

8
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,388
No, no, no.

9
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,126
No.

10
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,540
Help.

11
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,309
Help.

12
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,270
Help.

13
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,650
No, no, no.

14
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,485
Help.

15
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,585
Please...

16
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,673
help.

17
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,468
No.

18
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,269
Help.

19
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,262
I'm sorry, but how long is
this going to take?

20
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,254
I have to say my vows tonight....

21
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,475
And I really can't be late.

22
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,268
Do you speak English?

23
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,729
Sorry for the wait.

24
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,814
It's extra work now when
someone arrives...

25
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,275
without a return ticket.

26
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,944
Parli italiano?

27
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,322
I asked if you are learning Italian.

28
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,742
I'm trying, but it's a
lot harder than I thought.

29
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,581
So this monastery, did it
ticket bought for you?

30
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,464
You are very young to become a nun, aren't you?

31
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,257
What a waste.

32
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,802
Look at her.

33
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,304
It's a different life, right?

34
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,307
It must have been a difficult decision
must have been.

35
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,437
I don't think of it that way...

36
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,606
As if it were a decision.

37
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,529
Good.

38
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,200
I hope you find what you are looking for,
Sister Cecilia.

39
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,341
Sister Cecilia.

40
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,676
Apologies.

41
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,357
I am Deacon Enzo. Please come with me.

42
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,680
Thanks.

43
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,497
How much further?

44
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,049
We are almost there.

45
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,890
This way, Sister Cecilia.

46
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,809
Sister Cecilia.

47
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,279
Reverend Mother.

48
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,825
Your eyes radiate
the light of the Holy Spirit.

49
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,412
As if the angels delivered you directly
from heaven.

50
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,332
We have been anxiously awaiting
your arrival, my dear.

51
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,834
Excuse me.

52
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,964
She says you are beautiful.

53
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,758
Thank you. I am Sister Cecilia.

54
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,636
Isabelle.

55
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,430
Isabelle, would you take
Cecilia to her room?

56
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,964
I have to help our sisters with the
preparation for tonight's party.

57
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,341
Know your place and do as I say.

58
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,608
I will take you to your room.

59
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,070
Our Lady of Sorrows
was founded in 1632...

60
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,018
As a refuge for elderly sisters

61
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:33,949
for their transition to heaven.

62
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,826
It's really beautiful.
-Yes, it is.

63
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,452
Good morning, sisters.

64
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,533
And we work hard to
to keep it that way.

65
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,290
The last days of our sisters....

66
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,038
must be in a pleasant environment
to distract them....

67
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,295
Of all sickness and suffering.

68
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,172
All this was built on the
catacomb of St. Stephen.

69
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,841
Catacombs?

70
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,884
It is off limits.

71
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,761
Hello, sisters.

72
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,972
This is our new novice,
Sister Cecilia.

73
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,724
Hello.

74
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,116
In the case of the one in the wheelchair,
her tumor has metastasized.

75
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:04,353
So we expect her to meet God by
the end of the week.

76
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,565
You talk about it so casually.

77
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,192
Death here is part of
daily life.

78
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,070
Have you seen my daddy?

79
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,283
Yeah, let's go find him, all right?

80
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,578
It is best to just
play along with their delusions....

81
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,455
unless they become violent.

82
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,498
Be careful with this one. She bites.

83
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,898
Excuse me.

84
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,941
Living quarters for caregivers....

85
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,027
Are down there and up there.

86
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,155
Morning prayer begins at 05:00,
't communal meal is afterwards.

87
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
And if you have dietary restrictions....

88
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,242
Then we cannot accommodate them.

89
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,287
And this room is yours.

90
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,085
Thank you, sister.

91
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,670
I feel honored to serve with you.

92
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,297
You are very sweet.

93
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,757
Thanks.

94
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,425
I don't mean that as a compliment.

95
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm sure this must feel
must feel...

96
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,973
but this is our life.

97
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,560
And I assure you, the work is hard,
physically and emotionally.

98
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,729
So if you are here to find yourself ,
then there are easier ways.

99
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,314
I'm not.

100
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,154
Tonight you don't have to take your vows yet
to take your vows yet.

101
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,825
You can still change your mind
and God will forgive you.

102
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,788
I think he has
sufficiently prepared.

103
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,713
The ceremony begins at 5 p.m. in the chapel.

104
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,298
Don't be late.

105
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,809
Hello.
-Hello.

106
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,936
Excuse me.
-No, it's fine.

107
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,604
I am Cecilia.

108
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,606
I'm Guendalina.
You can call me Gwen.

109
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,191
My room is there.

110
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,193
Where in the US are you from?

111
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,571
Just outside Detroit, Michigan.

112
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,615
Are you from here or...

113
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,951
Closer to Milan.

114
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,871
You are far from home.

115
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,999
Yes, my parish is closed.

116
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,960
Was the priest in trouble?
-No.

117
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,087
No, no, no, nothing like that.

118
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,506
Just a low turnout.

119
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,551
And that church was my family, my home.

120
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,854
When I left, I felt
pretty lost.

121
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,639
But then Father Tedeschi
contacted me.

122
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,891
Yes.

123
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,059
He has a talent.

124
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,397
Detecting broken birds.

125
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,031
Oh, I didn't mean to offend you.

126
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,744
I think we might all be
problem cases or runaways.

127
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,539
What do you fall under?

128
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,002
Both.

129
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,621
Next time, you can
lock the door if you want.

130
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:20,372
Thanks.

131
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,882
Sister Cecilia.

132
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,803
Fr. Tedeschi,
it's nice to meet you in person.

133
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,599
We all feel so blessed
That you are here.

134
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,184
How are you doing in Italian?

135
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,478
So, so.

136
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,729
It's fine.

137
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,272
I'll translate for you.

138
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:10,493
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

139
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,724
Let us rejoice,
for the wedding of the Lamb has come....

140
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:37,062
And his brides have made themselves ready.

141
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,486
Sister Cecilia.

142
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,404
Sister Cecilia.

143
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,746
Do you promise to follow Christ...

144
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,292
By living a life without
material possessions?

145
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,779
Do you promise to free yourself from the
desire for a human relationship

146
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:08,907
And you will follow Him with joy
When He returns...

147
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,931
and a vow of poverty,
chastity and obedience?

148
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,307
I do.

149
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:28,989
May God give you the strength to fulfill your
vows faithfully and joyfully.

150
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:33,284
May you let His light shine
So that the world can see it.

151
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,668
How do you feel?

152
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,129
Vol.

153
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:48,591
Yeah, we don't really have anything
like this at home.

154
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,844
Cecilia, this is your home.

155
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,056
I know.

156
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,933
I felt the same way when I started here.

157
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,644
I didn't grow up with the
desire to become a priest.

158
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,899
My first career was in the
sciences, biology.

159
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,611
I was almost twenty years in...

160
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,649
and I couldn't understand the world better....

161
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,574
than when I was in Sunday school.

162
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,619
And then God showed me a path.

163
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,788
He brought me here.

164
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,790
This is where I needed to be.

165
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,214
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

166
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,383
After two glasses, I can't stop
talking about myself.

167
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,286
I'm very sorry.
-No, it's okay.

168
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:33,970
It's okay.
-And what about you?

169
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,673
I can imagine it was a
difficult decision.

170
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,895
I mean, yes, it seemed so far away.

171
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,690
But the odds in the US...

172
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,319
I didn't feel like God had
had saved me for that.

173
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,614
If it's too personal...

174
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,032
No.

175
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:58,411
When I was 12 years old,
there was a section...

176
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:02,582
of the Saginaw River that was always freezing.

177
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,711
And no matter how cold it was,
I always walked on the ice.

178
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:12,801
And then I took off my gloves
and placed my hands on the ice.

179
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,595
And then I kept them there until
I didn't feel them anymore.

180
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,724
I don't remember the ice breaking.

181
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,228
I remember only this sharp
pain of cold.

182
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,479
The paramedics,
tried to resuscitate me....

183
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,731
but my heart stood still for almost seven
minutes.

184
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,613
That sounds frightening.

185
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,451
I know God saved me for a reason
saved me...

186
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,121
but I think I'm still
looking for what that reason is.

187
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,087
Would you please excuse me now?

188
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,840
Hello?

189
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,481
Are you okay?

190
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,909
I'm going to get help.

191
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,203
Cecilia.

192
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,413
Reverend Mother, I am so sorry.

193
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,499
I heard her crying and...

194
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,824
It's okay.

195
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,711
Sometimes we get caught up in emotion.

196
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,714
You have a question.

197
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,716
Okay.

198
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,934
What is this place?

199
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:21,729
Saint Helena, Mother of Constantine,
brought this back from Jerusalem.

200
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,024
Here.

201
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,915
He suffered on the cross.

202
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,634
Suffering? This is the...

203
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,015
Yes.

204
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:52,812
For you. For us.
For our sins. For our redemption.

205
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,273
We suffer.

206
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,734
In the name of His love.

207
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,268
It is a gift.

208
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,657
Suffering is love.

209
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,912
Are you okay, sister?

210
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,430
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

211
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,931
Amen.

212
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,101
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

213
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,520
It has been three days since my
last confession.

214
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,527
I was...

215
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,863
I was careless last night.

216
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:52,228
I drank too much wine and made a fool of myself
embarrassed myself in front of Mother Superior.

217
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,216
I promise to conduct myself with grace
conduct because I have nothing

218
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,302
would rather than belong here.

219
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,554
I'm afraid I've already messed things up.

220
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,355
I am sorry for this...

221
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,572
Desires.

222
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,044
Hello?

223
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,684
Good morning, sisters.
Today begins a new life.

224
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,605
But this new year
will not be easy.

225
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:23,731
You will question your purpose.

226
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,360
You will doubt me and
why you have come here.

227
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,208
And some of you
won't have the spiritual...

228
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,200
have endurance for this life.

229
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,409
What did she say?

230
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,453
God is good. God is great.

231
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,080
God, my head hurts.

232
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,831
Too much blood of Christ?

233
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,254
Do you think this is funny, Sister Guendalina?

234
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,673
No, forgive me.

235
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,800
This side of the room belongs to me.

236
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,471
The others, will
serve at Sister Isabelle's.

237
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,682
No.

238
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,811
What a blessing to be able to
guidance.

239
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,803
Eat your plate.
There is work to be done.

240
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,594
It seems that the
battery of her vibrator is dead.

241
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,067
What is that supposed to mean?

242
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:12,029
Oh, nothing. I really like her.
I'm super excited.

243
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,823
Clean their backs thoroughly.

244
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,926
And if the consistency of their
droppings doesn't seem to match....

245
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:19,053
let Dr. Gallo know.

246
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,206
Hello.

247
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,375
Hello.

248
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,128
The larger items we want to
forward...

249
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,797
and the shorter items to the rear.

250
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,425
That way, the wind can blow underneath.

251
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,638
First, you need to make sure that
your knife is properly sharp.

252
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,608
Otherwise, you run the risk of making
a big mess.

253
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,507
Sorry. I can't.

254
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,258
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

255
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,583
Amen.

256
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,487
Blessed...

257
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,323
Holy.

258
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,077
We all adore you.

259
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,999
Sister, let's get you to bed.

260
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,060
Blessed Saint Cecilia.

261
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,485
Good night, sister.

262
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,888
It could have been worse.

263
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,640
She could have slapped you.

264
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,726
Gwen, I'm not kidding.

265
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,312
She had scars on the bottom of
her feet.

266
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,525
It's not what you thought it
would be, isn't it, this place?

267
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,195
No, it's definitely different.

268
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,490
However, it is better than where I came from.

269
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,366
What do you mean?

270
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:48,911
There is a boy.
There was a boy, I mean.

271
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,873
What happened to this boy?

272
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,211
He hit me.

273
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,297
I hit him back.

274
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:04,283
When I left him
I went to a support group.

275
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,722
There were these nuns there.

276
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,017
And I thought, these women have
a very good life.

277
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,736
They have a place to live, a job
where they can keep their clothes on....

278
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,941
and don't have to worry about anything.

279
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,902
So I signed up.

280
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:23,239
Wait, so you don't even believe in God?
-Of course I do.

281
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:26,890
Life is so cruel.
Only a man can be responsible.

282
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:38,076
Oh, my God, I was kidding.
Are you okay?

283
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,507
I don't feel good.

284
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,676
I'm going to call a doctor.

285
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,308
Sister Cecilia. Come with me.

286
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,084
Your Eminence.

287
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,418
Sit down.

288
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,994
Can you please tell Cardinal Merola
tell your vows?

289
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,165
My vows?
-Your vows.

290
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,007
I swore three vows when
I arrived here...

291
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,218
Of obedience, poverty and chastity.

292
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,640
He asks if you...
-I understand.

293
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:57,851
I did.

294
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,061
I have been obedient, Your Eminence.

295
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,195
Have you kept your vow
of poverty?

296
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,273
Yes, I don't own anything.

297
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,315
I lack nothing.

298
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,275
Did you stay chaste?

299
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,444
I'm sorry, why are you asking me this?

300
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,779
It's okay.

301
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,073
Just answer the question,
if you like, Cecilia.

302
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,493
Of course I have been chaste,
Your Eminence.

303
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,585
Did you, before you arrived here,
sexual intercourse with a man?

304
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,465
Sexual intercourse with... no, no.

305
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,386
Have you ever had sexual intercourse
had with a man?

306
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,431
I have not broken my vows and have
never had intercourse with 'any man or woman.

307
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:38,134
You will not be punished.
We just want to know the truth.

308
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,803
I'm not lying, Reverend.

309
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,274
What's going on?

310
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:58,120
When she arrived, Dr. Gallo,
did you examine her then?

311
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,634
Her hymen was intact.
It was never touched.

312
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,668
What do they say?

313
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,224
Mother Superior, have there been
visitors, in recent weeks?

314
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,392
No.

315
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,394
What are you looking at?

316
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,532
One last time.

317
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,497
Have you ever had sexual intercourse?

318
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,003
Why are you asking me this?

319
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,537
You are expecting.

320
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,499
This child is...

321
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,585
immaculately received.

322
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,548
With God as my witness...

323
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,885
we have been blessed with a miracle.

324
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,889
He believes you.

325
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,184
It is a miracle.

326
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:57,990
Why did he, of all the women
in the world, chose me?

327
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:03,745
You told me who saved your life....

328
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,583
Who sent you on the path that
led you here.

329
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,419
Cecilia, you were looking for a reason.

330
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,029
God has saved you.
This is it.

331
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,554
Blessed are the meek....

332
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,682
For they shall inherit the earth.

333
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,058
You are no longer allowed to work.

334
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:34,146
Remember that your only job is the baby.

335
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,900
How long would it be before
they started calling you Mary?

336
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,622
It should have been me. Bitch.

337
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,801
Isabelle. Isabelle.

338
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:46,760
Sisters.

339
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:47,844
Stop.

340
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,169
Release her.

341
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:50,555
Stop.

342
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,808
No. No, no.

343
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,559
We have to try again.

344
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,145
They should try again with me.

345
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,190
They should try again with me.

346
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,911
The heart rate is stable.

347
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,080
There is no bleeding.

348
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,041
Be praised.

349
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,670
We'll do some blood tests
to check for problems.

350
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,006
But he seems to be fine.

351
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:33,974
But I'm not okay.

352
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,935
Eminence, Isabelle said that she
it had to be her.

353
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,562
Why would she say that?

354
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:46,945
Isabelle has been losing her
battle with her mental health.

355
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,073
And in beholding
you and the miracle...

356
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,951
it obviously triggered something,
whether it was jealousy...

357
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,163
She tried to drown me.

358
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,789
You are right.

359
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,168
And I will make sure that this never
happen again.

360
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,137
I want to go to another doctor.

361
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,680
Why? Dr. Gallo...

362
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,390
Cares for old women.

363
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,515
I want to go to a real hospital, please.

364
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,728
He is a licensed obstetrician.

365
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,731
Thursday through Saturday
I do deliveries at Cosentino.

366
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:26,776
A hospital is not what you
need right now. You are in perfect health.

367
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,654
I just puked out one of my teeth.

368
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:33,074
Hospitals are not the safest places.

369
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,667
We don't want you to get sick.

370
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,662
Or that some of it leaks out, you know.

371
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:42,542
The safest thing to do is to stay here
until the Savior is born.

372
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,306
God bless you, young mother.

373
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,522
Isabelle.

374
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,524
Go away all of you.

375
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,193
I said, go away.

376
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,467
Cecilia, you have to stand up for yourself.

377
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,803
Gwen, shush.
-Open your eyes.

378
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,014
I don't trust this place.

379
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,685
I don't think we can just leave.

380
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,588
Cecilia, you are five months pregnant....

381
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:28,231
And you haven't even been in a
hospital.

382
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,568
We can arrange this.

383
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,945
How can we trust
on what's inside you?

384
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,658
Maybe God is...
-God has nothing to do with this.

385
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,829
Sisters, is something going on?
I see that you...

386
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,154
Don't touch me.

387
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,250
Rock on.

388
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,338
How can you guys just
stand there like nothing happened?

389
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,923
Cecilia is pregnant and we don't know how.

390
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,301
Isabelle committed suicide.
What the hell is going on?

391
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,344
Sister...

392
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,138
Leave me alone.
I know when a man is lying to me.

393
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:03,558
And all of you, every one of you,
lying your asses off.

394
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,435
Let go of me.

395
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,770
Let go of me.

396
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:07,979
No.

397
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,023
Let go of me! I said, let go of me.

398
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,796
"For Satan himself often disguises himself
as an angel of light."

399
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,522
Gwen.

400
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,816
Gwen.

401
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,961
No.

402
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,469
No, no.

403
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,244
Let me go.

404
00:50:04,178 --> 00:50:05,378
No.

405
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,339
No, I beg, please.

406
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,091
Blessed...

407
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,680
Holy.

408
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,689
Please help me.

409
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,900
We have to get out of here.

410
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:20,787
You will never leave here again.

411
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:03,086
What is happening?
-I don't know.

412
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,774
Mother. What's the matter?
-I don't know, Reverend.

413
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,290
God in heaven.

414
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,053
Call Dr. Gallo.
-I can't, it's Saturday.

415
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,513
Call him. Something is wrong.

416
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:24,461
I don't get it, it's Saturday.
We have to take her to the hospital.

417
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:25,727
No.
-You have to go. Now.

418
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,520
No.
-Enough, I'm calling an ambulance.

419
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,938
Stop.

420
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,857
Something is wrong.

421
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,859
I don't want to die.

422
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,026
I don't want to.

423
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,820
I don't want to die.

424
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,349
What do we do if she dies along the way?

425
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,019
We must hold out hope.

426
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:11,279
It doesn't look good.
-Then we will pray.

427
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,244
Yes.

428
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:37,849
I understand.

429
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,534
Stop the car.
-What?

430
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:47,859
Stop the car.

431
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:53,040
What are you doing?

432
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,667
Row.

433
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,919
Drive through.

434
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,010
Clean yourself up.

435
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,054
Clean yourself up.

436
00:55:55,779 --> 00:55:56,979
Are you embarrassed now?

437
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,304
Now?

438
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:02,777
Where was your shame when you
put a dead animal inside yourself?

439
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,313
You should be ashamed of yourself.

440
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,950
Making us believe that the
miracle has died in you.

441
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,369
What do you have to say for yourself?

442
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,663
God will never forgive you.

443
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,680
I want to apologize if
any of my actions scared you.

444
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:44,693
And I want to assure you that you are
are safe.

445
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,449
What have you done to me?

446
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:03,879
When you look at this, what do you see?

447
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:13,139
Some people might just see
an old piece of iron, a rusty nail.

448
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:22,106
For those of us who know...

449
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:27,528
we see the evidence of Jesus' sacrifice....

450
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:31,240
A symbol of his suffering.

451
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:35,578
And for 2,000 years,
that's all it was.

452
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:46,665
But we took a closer look
and we found blood...

453
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:54,930
tissue, small bone fragments,
a genetic code.

454
00:57:55,055 --> 00:58:00,269
All we had to do was
't crack the key to resurrection.

455
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,732
You are insane.

456
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,361
I will show you.

457
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:30,007
It has taken us 20 years of trial and
getting up ...

458
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:37,132
20 years for God to give us the knowledge
and the perfect fruitful vessel.

459
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,809
Is this what is in me?

460
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,061
No.

461
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,355
These are all our failures.

462
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,776
What is in you is our success.

463
00:58:56,075 --> 00:59:01,163
I left the field of genetics
because some people...

464
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:06,460
disagreed with the ethics
of my experiment.

465
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:14,468
So many people have such a limited
view of its potential.

466
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:19,515
But here in the church, here they understood
that a simple procedure

467
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,435
could bring us salvation.

468
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,229
You are playing for God.

469
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:29,233
I'm not playing God.

470
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,236
Do you know what it's like to watch the
miracle to see die...

471
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:36,573
In the mother's womb, to abandon God again and again
forsaken again and again....

472
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:40,828
but still find the strength
to keep going?

473
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,830
This is my calling.

474
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:52,423
And this, this is yours.

475
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,677
No.

476
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,405
What are you doing?

477
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,365
What's going on?

478
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,952
What is that?

479
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,246
What are you doing?

480
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,582
Please, stop.
Stop, stop.

481
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,334
Please, stop.
Stop.

482
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:31,545
May you never stray again.

483
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,173
No.
No, no.

484
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,674
Stop.

485
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,010
Blessed are the meek....

486
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,803
No, no, no.
Please. No.

487
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,890
...for they will be the earth...
-No, no. Please, no.

488
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,183
...inheritance.
-No, no.

489
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,508
No.

490
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,810
Wait.

491
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,939
Wait.

492
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,781
Wait.

493
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,700
Wait.

494
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,496
Wait.

495
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,914
Wait.

496
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,961
Sister Cecilia.

497
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,842
How long have you had your eye on me?

498
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,846
Please confess.

499
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,141
Was it since the accident?

500
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:56,356
What will happen when it is finished?

501
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,569
Do you think it, will save the world?

502
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,604
Or terminate?

503
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,912
That's what Revelation says, right?

504
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,524
This is not God's work.

505
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,529
Well then.

506
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:49,535
If this is not the will of God ,
why doesn't He stop us?

507
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,113
It could happen any day now.

508
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,037
He moves.

509
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,419
I'll be right back with her medicine.

510
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,996
Would you be willing to do that?

511
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,706
Yes.

512
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,970
I'll be right back.

513
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:08,905
Such a beautiful mother.
And those eyes. Like sunflowers.

514
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:14,870
Blessed child, it is all
part of His plan.

515
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,169
You will save us.

516
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:28,634
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

517
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,008
God damn.

518
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:05,999
Oh my God.

519
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:12,130
Cecilia, what did you do?

520
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:09,855
Cecilia, this solves nothing.

521
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:14,109
If you die, we'll find another one.

522
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:17,404
You can end this.

523
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:20,329
All you have to do is
bring our Savior into the world.

524
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,260
No.

525
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,808
No.

526
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,815
Cecilia.

527
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,743
Cecilia.

528
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,444
Let go of me.

529
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:39,285
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

530
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,120
Amen.

531
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:47,126
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

532
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:58,214
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

533
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:01,599
Holy Mary...

534
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,393
No, no.

535
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:11,401
Mother of God, pray for us sinners....

536
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:18,032
Now and on the hour...

537
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,277
No.

538
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,990
Fuck you.

539
01:20:35,315 --> 01:20:38,315
Subtitles: DUTCH SUBS.

540
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:51,472
Hail Mary...

541
01:20:55,643 --> 01:21:01,482
full of grace.

542
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:09,782
Mary, full of grace.

543
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:16,205
