1
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:46,921
On your feet!

2
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,235
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,529
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,203
You were alone?

5
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,749
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,334
| like to be alone.

7
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,379
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,716
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,175
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,013
"To the victor
belongs the spoils.”

11
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,432
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,892
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,728
The Fuhrer's in hiding.

14
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:46,647
You lost.

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,028
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,572
What? What? Hey!

17
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,823
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,283
A moment. Please!

19
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,577
Stop! | must speak to the commander.

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,746
Colonel. | found it!

21
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,207
Do as he says. Open it.

22
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,589
Doctor.

23
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,599
The Lance of Longinus.

24
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,436
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

25
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,563
The Holy Lance.

26
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,034
<i>Double the guard.
This is the prize the Fuhrer seeks.</i>

27
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,077
Colonel, we need to talk.

28
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,411
No time, Doctor.

29
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,038
The train to Berlin is waiting.

30
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,290
Search the woods!

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,375
Take the dogs.

32
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:49,919
Do you think that spy was alone?

33
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,046
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

34
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,089
On the double!

35
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,157
Looks like
they're leaving

36
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,534
without you guys.

37
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,954
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:27,081
Story. Erm...

39
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,792
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,711
Well...

41
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,254
it all started

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,008
once upon a time,
when this village

43
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,722
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together

44
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,890
and follow this sweaty
little pied piper

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,726
named Adolf...

46
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,993
This man
was with the American.

47
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:30,830
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,666
What have | done?

49
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,588
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,266
Careful.
This is the Fuhrer's special relic!

51
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,535
Heil Hitler!

52
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,130
Stay seated.

53
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,340
So...

54
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,137
you are a birdwatcher?

55
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,684
Yes. Because of the bombing,

56
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,604
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

57
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,276
We caught your accomplice.

58
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:44,987
The American.

59
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,179
Oh, my!

60
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,998
Get off of me!

61
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,485
There's one reason

62
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,070
you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

63
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,158
Who sent you?

64
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,492
What was your mission?

65
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,661
Please, Colonel, no.
| beg you.

66
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,122
My name is Basil Shaw.

67
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,333
I'm a professor at Oxford.

68
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,835
An archaeologist.

69
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:13,427
There you are.

70
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,558
There is a problem.

71
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,019
I must speak to the Colonel.

72
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,520
It's urgent.

73
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,567
| have a daughter. | beg you.

74
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,945
| guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr Shaw.

75
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:38,243
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

76
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:48,796
Sieg heil!

77
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,018
We were fold
that the Lance of Longinus

78
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,937
could be found
at the fortress.

79
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,272
We were looking for it.

80
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,774
Why?

81
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,360
Because of its power?

82
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,197
It has no power.

83
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,494
My friend and |
were trying to save history.

84
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,581
| must
speak with the Colonel.

85
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:26,917
It's about the Lance.

86
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,048
| only had a moment to look at it.

87
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,967
Of course, my training is in physics,

88
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,428
For God's sake, spit it out!

89
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,222
The Lance...

90
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,643
It's a fake.

91
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,061
It's a fake.

92
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,646
A fake?

93
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,442
The blade is an alloy.

94
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,943
Fifty years old,

95
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,279
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

96
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:38,488
We're dead.

97
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,242
Twelfth century.

98
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,535
Thirteenth century.

99
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,829
Ramesses II.

100
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:48,957
None of this stuff is fake.

101
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,378
| gotta stop this train.

102
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,047
There is another relic on this train.

103
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,633
One with real power.

104
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,218
What are you talking about?

105
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,179
The Antikythera.

106
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,555
The Antikythera?!

107
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,807
Enough about that old dial!

108
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,227
Colonel, the Fuhrer
has lost the war...

109
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,020
and his mind!

110
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,565
Let me explain.

111
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,028
The Antikythera's power
is not supernatural.

112
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
It is mathematics.

113
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,575
Whoever harnesses it...

114
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,162
will not be King...

115
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,914
nor Emperor...

116
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,500
or Fuhrer.

117
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,797
He will be God.

118
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,472
})

119
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:56,858
Too many Nazis.

120
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,323
And how do you propose
we tell him this?

121
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,700
My Fuhrer,

122
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,411
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

123
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,829
But here is...

124
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,000
half of something you've never heard of.

125
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,502
Tell me,

126
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,462
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

127
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:21,133
A saboteur aboard.

128
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:22,634
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

129
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,140
})

130
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:03,925
Sieg heil!

131
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,218
That way!

132
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,182
What are you doing here?!

133
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:18,815
What the hell?

134
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,109
Indy?

135
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,194
Baz?

136
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,528
You're alive!

137
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:25,238
So far.

138
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,325
| thought | told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

139
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,452
What sort of a man
hides in a hedge

140
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,537
while his friend
is facing death?

141
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,513
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

142
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,724
| was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

143
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,810
Did you at least
find the Lance?

144
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,019
"At least"?

145
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,479
Well, have you got it?

146
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,398
-It's a fake.
-What?

147
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,400
A reproduction.

148
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:04,903
Who are you?

149
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,617
Indy?

150
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,836
The Antikythera.

151
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,672
Archimedes' Dial.

152
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,216
Bring it.

153
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,068
Hurry up, Baz.

154
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,364
Give me that.

155
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,657
Come on.

156
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,882
Get up, Baz.

157
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,258
Follow me.

158
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,218
Towards the gun?

159
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,678
Away from the Nazis!

160
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,055
Those are Nazis!

161
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,600
Get down! Down! Down!

162
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,025
This way. Come on!

163
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,610
| can't do that!

164
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,695
You wanna stop
for a little lie-down?

165
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,867
They have the Antikytheral!

166
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,286
<i>Easy.</i>

167
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,193
Tunnel!

168
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,539
Got you! No!

169
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,205
Indy!

170
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,465
Get the gun!

171
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,059
Shoot him!

172
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,063
Not me!

173
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,190
S-Sorry.

174
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,503
To the victor go the spoils.

175
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,615
})

176
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,202
Drop the gun.

177
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,498
Give me the Antikythera.

178
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,969
Indy!

179
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:32,772
Hey!

180
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,194
- Here!
- They can't hear you, Baz.

181
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,113
We gotta jump!

182
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,614
What about my dicky knee?

183
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,324
Ahh!

184
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,581
Baz!

185
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,499
Baz!

186
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,377
Baz!

187
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,380
-Indy!
-Baz!

188
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:04,304
Go! Move! Move it!

189
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,808
Bit rum to go home
empty-handed after all that.

190
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,602
"Empty-handed"?

191
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,895
Not exactly.

192
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,024
Archimedes' Dial.

193
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,233
Well, half of it.

194
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,611
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

195
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,283
Roll up, roll up
for the Magical Mystery Tour

196
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,202
Step right this way

197
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,080
Roll up

198
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,958
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

199
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,752
Roll up

200
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,588
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

201
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,466
-Roll up
-That's an invitation

202
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,884
Roll up for the...

203
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,595
Larry! Turn it down!

204
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,889
Turn it down!

205
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,891
Hey, Larry!

206
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:37,105
<i>The Magical Mystery Tour
is waiting to take you away</i>

207
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,358
<i>Waiting to take you away</i>

208
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:46,531
Roll up
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

209
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:47,615
Larry!

210
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,118
Larry!

211
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,744
-Hi, Mr Jones.
-Where's Larry?

212
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,081
- Who is this guy?
- It's the old guy next door.

213
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,875
Larry, it's 8:00
in the morning.

214
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,419
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

215
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,628
Yeah, but that was

216
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,172
-a workday, Mr Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

217
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,717
Turn on the news.

218
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,927
It's moon day, Mr Jones.

219
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,596
Moon day?

220
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:27,864
And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear

221
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:35,413
<i>Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare</i>

222
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:42,003
<i>This is Major Tom
to Ground Control</i>

223
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:45,965
I'm stepping through the door

224
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:53,222
And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way

225
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,647
And the stars look
very different today

226
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,067
Thanks.

227
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,248
All you really
need to remember

228
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:23,002
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterised

229
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,131
by this complex
blue-line pattern.

230
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:28,299
Okay?

231
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,762
| assigned pages 131
through 171

232
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,555
in Winford for today.

233
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,224
Anybody do the reading?

234
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,519
Anyone?

235
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:44,357
This is on the test.

236
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,733
Okay.

237
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,945
Guess I'll spoon-feed it
to you.

238
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,450
In 213 BC,

239
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:56,619
Roman forces led by Marcellus

240
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,622
laid siege
to the city of Syracuse.

241
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,457
"Syracuse."

242
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,503
Not the Syracuse
in New York, Tonya.

243
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,255
The one in Sicily.

244
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:10,425
Amongst the defenders
of the city

245
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:13,678
was its most famous resident,
who was...

246
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,598
Come on, guys.
This is on the final.

247
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:19,892
Archimedes.

248
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:21,811
Archimedes.

249
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,312
Archimedes, who was a...

250
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,605
A mathematician.

251
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:25,940
A mathematician.

252
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,693
But more than that,
an inventor,

253
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,362
a brilliant engineer

254
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,947
who conceived of a way

255
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,825
to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun

256
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:38,745
on concave mirrors
and focus it

257
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,581
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

258
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,209
Who devised giant iron claws

259
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:47,962
that could snatch hostiles
from the sea.

260
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,426
But how do we know
it really happened?

261
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:58,556
What physical, irrefutable
archaeological evidence

262
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,060
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

263
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,605
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

264
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,774
They're here!
They're downtown!

265
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,069
The astronauts.

266
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,654
Giant parade
this morning will be seen

267
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,448
by about
two and a half million people

268
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:16,866
lining the sidewalks...

269
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,329
He's coming.
He's come. See?

270
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,914
Oh, here he comes.

271
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,874
Hide the cake.

272
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,669
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

273
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,968
For over a decade now,
our colleague Dr Jones

274
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,638
has been a loyal servant
of Hunter.

275
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,641
A token of our gratitude.

276
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:50,775
Wow.

277
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,197
Thanks for putting up with me.

278
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,712
Here.

279
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,390
Astronauts
Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,

280
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,351
<i>and Buzz Aldrin will not be
able to avoid the spotlight.</i>

281
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,436
Al 7700 a.rm.
Eastern Daylight Time,

282
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,230
a grateful nation
will pay homage

283
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,024
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago,

284
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:33,693
climaxed by a dinner
in Los Angeles...

285
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,194
What would the ancients say?

286
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,446
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

287
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:40,366
If they knew
we walked on the moon?

288
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,076
Speaking as an ancient,

289
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,704
going to the moon
is like going to Reno.

290
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,164
Middle of nowhere

291
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:48,833
and no blackjack.

292
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,502
You don't recognise me,
do you?

293
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,882
Whatever | did, | apologise.

294
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,884
It's Helena.

295
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,511
Helena Shaw.

296
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,639
Wombat?

297
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,349
Wow, | haven't
heard that in a while.

298
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,643
- You got tall.
- 1 did.

299
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,103
It's fair to say.

300
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,315
I'm celebrating.

301
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,651
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

302
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,653
Wow. Well, in that case,
what are we drinking?

303
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,827
Room service for Mr Schmidt.

304
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,382
Put that away.

305
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,010
| was asking how you broke
your ankle.

306
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,095
- None of your business.
- Are you Mr. Schmidt?

307
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,389
"Doctor" Schmidt.
He's in there.

308
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,058
And he don't eat anything
on wheels,

309
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:48,351
so put it on a table.

310
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,103
When [ was a little boy,

311
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,772
! always imagined

312
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,651
that one day
man would walk on the moon.

313
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,319
And by golly...

314
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,661
Quite a celebration
out there, hmm?

315
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,540
The man you're servin',

316
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,001
he's the one who put
those astronauts on the moon.

317
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:15,211
Built the rockets
they rode in.

318
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,880
Congratulations.

319
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,131
Where are you from?

320
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:21,133
The Bronx, sir.

321
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,177
No, no. | mean originally,
your people.

322
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,345
Do you know?

323
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,685
| was born
by Yankee Stadium, sir.

324
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,106
And you fought
for your country?

325
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,483
320th Battalion.

326
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,027
Set up balloons to stop
the planes bombing Normandy.

327
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,368
And are you enjoying
your victory?

328
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,252
Will there be
anything else?

329
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,006
You didn't win the war.

330
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,800
Hitler lost it.

331
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,515
Yeah.

332
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,227
My field agent,
she found Shaw.

333
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:15,438
Yeah, I'm comin'.

334
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:16,605
Let's go, Hauke.

335
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,193
Where are we here?

336
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,779
Oxford. In the garden.

337
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,366
He was an original.

338
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,203
| just graduated.

339
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,371
In archaeology.

340
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,458
Archaeology. Wow.

341
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,168
Apple didn't fall far.

342
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,046
Well, now I'm researching
a doctorate.

343
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:42,256
What's your subject?

344
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,051
The Archimedes Dial.

345
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,136
The Antikythera.

346
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,432
What do you know about that?

347
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,309
Well, for starters,

348
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,854
in 1902, Greek sponge divers
found a wrecked Roman warship,

349
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,397
huge, off the coast of Greece.

350
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,733
Below deck, sealed in wax,

351
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,443
was a clock-like mechanism,

352
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,404
finely tooled,
purpose unknown.

353
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,448
Nothing approximating
its complexity

354
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,533
appears in the world
for 1,000 years.

355
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,828
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

356
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:14,413
Dad. He had
all these journals,

357
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,998
reams of notes about it.

358
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,000
He was obsessed till the end.

359
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,839
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

360
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,386
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

361
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,348
Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.

362
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,974
And it was only half the Dial.

363
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,184
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial...

364
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,811
-...disassembled it.
-...in two, and then hid

365
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,979
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

366
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,356
| know. Look.

367
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,317
You don't remember the last
time | saw you, do you?

368
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,112
Remember what?

369
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,196
These are the Alps.

370
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,241
Yeah, | see.

371
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,159
And this is the route
that your train took

372
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,285
from the Nazi stronghold

373
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,370
-in '44.
-Right.

374
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,330
It went through
this mountain pass,

375
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,998
and then here.

376
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,000
Here, it's the only river
on the route.

377
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,627
-Right.
-Under a bridge.

378
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,170
It's down there.
It's got to be.

379
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:05,756
-And nobody knows except us.
-“US“?

380
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,550
Well, | mean, you.

381
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:09,260
And me. So, yeah.

382
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,262
-Us.
-Us.

383
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,765
And what were you
thinking exactly?

384
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,309
Well, that maybe...

385
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,688
we could go there.

386
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,897
And?

387
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,149
And find it. And...

388
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:25,693
And I'd become...

389
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,487
famous.

390
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:30,948
Oh, well, not famous.
Renowned. Feted.

391
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,325
A feted archaeologist.

392
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:35,202
And you, a final triumph!

393
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,412
Indiana Jones!

394
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,539
Out with a bang!
Back in the saddle!

395
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,002
I'm not selling this, am 1?

396
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:46,714
Wombat...

397
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,676
why are you chasing the thing

398
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,513
that drove your father crazy?

399
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,896
Wouldn't you?

400
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:21,123
| got it.

401
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,208
Parade's comin' soon.

402
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,251
So, what we got?

403
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,380
She's in there, third floor,
with an old guy.

404
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:29,673
Who is he, a Russian?

405
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,759
No, a professor.
Dr Henry Jones.

406
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:33,844
Klaber!

407
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,430
Klaber, get back here!
You're not an agent!

408
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,890
God damn it! Go.

409
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,643
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

410
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,540
This way.

411
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,787
Basil became obsessed
by this German theory.

412
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,707
Conjecture, really.

413
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,877
Archimedes had figured out

414
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,964
that the movements
of the moon and planets

415
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,049
weren't perfect.

416
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,803
There were irregularities
in their rotations.

417
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,265
He thought these
irregularities might

418
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,810
explain fluctuations
in temperature, tides.

419
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,230
Storms, even.

420
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,484
So, he set about building
a device to predict them.

421
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:15,988
But then, he stumbled upon

422
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,115
a method to predict
even larger

423
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,867
disturbances.

424
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,162
Larger disturbances?

425
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,998
Your father
thought this thing could

426
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,959
predict fissures in time.

427
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,478
Hauke, if you don't...

428
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,107
Found 'em.

429
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,741
Hello.

430
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,994
Are you looking for...

431
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,329
Dr Jones?

432
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,250
Excuse me, can | help you?

433
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:11,835
No, thank you.

434
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,629
Just a routine investigation,
ma'am.

435
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,216
Are you the police?

436
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:18,717
It'll just be a few moments.

437
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:20,594
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

438
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,679
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

439
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,393
Drop your weapon.

440
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,769
What the hell are you doin'?

441
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:29,978
Erm...

442
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,231
What the doctor tells me,
Miss Mason.

443
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:33,315
Mandy?

444
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,988
Yeah, no witnesses.

445
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,453
Jesus. What the hell?

446
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:48,122
Your father wrote
SO many letters

447
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,040
about the Dial,
| stopped reading 'em.

448
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,169
You really don't remember

449
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,879
the last time
| was at your house?

450
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,717
| took that from him then.

451
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:02,928
| thought he'd stopped
thinking about it.

452
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,012
But your father was convinced

453
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,099
this thing was real
and dangerous.

454
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,226
Do not shoot.

455
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:13,063
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

456
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,356
the Grafikos...

457
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,524
The tablet
containing directions

458
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:16,692
to the rest of the Dial.

459
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,985
And if they found
the Grafikos,

460
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,611
they might acquire
the other half of the Dial

461
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,696
and put the two together.

462
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:23,574
| knew
you wouldn't destroy it.

463
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:29,037
How did you know
he asked me to destroy it?

464
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,915
-What?
-You do remember that night.

465
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,585
| was 12 years old, Indy.

466
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,086
You knew we didn't drop it
in ariver.

467
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,839
-Baz didn't tell you that.
-See, listen.

468
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,174
-1 didn't...
-No, he never lied.

469
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,967
-No...
-What was all that crap

470
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,093
-about the map?
-You...

471
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,303
No, you've had
too many whiskeys.

472
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,180
What are you doing, Wombat?

473
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,598
Stay where you are.

474
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:49,808
Don't move.

475
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,060
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

476
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,145
Are they with you?

477
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:54,480
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

478
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:56,690
Miss Shaw, stop!

479
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,361
Helena!

480
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,159
Stop!

481
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,120
Sorry.

482
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,165
-Helena!
-Dr Jones. It's over.

483
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,541
Who are you people?

484
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,793
What do you want?

485
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,629
Stop!

486
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:21,715
Helena Shaw!

487
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,258
She's on the roof.
Find another way up.

488
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,426
Dr Jones!

489
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,261
Dr Jones,
we're not gonna hurt you.

490
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,081
Move.
We gotta follow 'em.

491
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:55,290
Go. Hurry up.

492
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,861
Fan out!

493
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,166
All right, let's go.
Move, move, move! Pack it up!

494
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,251
Come on,
get everything.

495
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,544
Found her!

496
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,283
- Operator-
-1 need the police.

497
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,744
Hunter College.
People are dead.

498
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:14,995
- Please...
- Hang up, fella.

499
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,960
Stand up.

500
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,508
Okay, okay.

501
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,326
She's gone. You blew it,

502
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,744
you trigger-happy cracker.

503
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,372
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

504
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,126
Here's the file on Jones.

505
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,211
Yes.

506
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,522
Who are you?

507
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,148
That's my question.

508
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,119
You're CIA.

509
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,037
Oh, not me, man.

510
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,164
| don't take government jobs.

511
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,416
Okay.

512
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,877
How are you acquainted
with Miss Shaw?

513
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,504
She's my goddaughter.

514
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,881
| haven't seen her
in 18 years.

515
00:41:50,048 --> 00:41:51,133
Why did you
meet with her today?

516
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:52,217
To give her the Dial?

517
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:56,054
Lady, it's an ancient
hunk of gears.

518
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,056
Half a hunk.

519
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,808
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

520
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

521
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,062
Where do you think
you're going?

522
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:05,605
| got a parade going on.

523
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,232
And a demonstration
coming down here.

524
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,442
Hey! Hey, hey!

525
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,152
-Hey...
-Shut up.

526
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:12,738
| can't go this way.
Gotta go back.

527
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,494
Hell no!
What is wrong with you, man?

528
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:21,288
Damn it! Let's go on foot.

529
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,539
You heard her.

530
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:25,292
What the hell
were you thinking?

531
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,668
- Walk! Come on.
- What is your problem?

532
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,753
You don't look
when you're backin' up?

533
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,379
-Take care of that guy.
-Who's gonna pay for that?

534
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,589
Easy, fella. Easy.

535
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:31,673
Keep movin'.

536
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,508
Can't you see my cab?
It's yellow.

537
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,177
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man.

538
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,261
| don't...

539
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,432
Peace now!
Peace now!

540
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,686
Stop the war!
Stop the fighting!

541
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,605
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

542
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,233
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

543
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,818
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no!

544
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,696
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

545
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,781
We won't go!

546
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,325
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no, we won't go!

547
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,327
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

548
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,495
Hell yeah!

549
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,663
Hell no, we won't go!

550
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,582
Hell no, we won't go!

551
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:09,127
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

552
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,463
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

553
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:12,547
Hell no...

554
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:16,510
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

555
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,768
Hey!

556
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,229
Officer! Help me!

557
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,564
Officer,
there was a shooting...

558
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,483
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

559
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,401
People are dead. God damn it.

560
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,195
Some rogue maniacs
broke in and...

561
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,905
Sir, you need to calm it down.

562
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,281
Please listen to me.

563
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,575
There was a shooting
this morning, and the...

564
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:44,162
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

565
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:48,375
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

566
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:00,470
Whoa!

567
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,888
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

568
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,056
Whoa!

569
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:38,633
Hyah! Hyah!

570
00:44:51,104 --> 00:44:52,939
- Move, out the way!
- Whoa, whoa!

571
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,610
Hyah!

572
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,531
- Watch out!
- Hyah!

573
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,366
Whoa. Whoa.

574
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,618
Move! Quickly!

575
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:11,291
Hyah!

576
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,300
Move! Move!

577
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,229
Go, go, go!

578
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,734
Hyah!

579
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,829
Hyah!

580
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:54,960
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

581
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,544
- It's a horse.
- Come on.

582
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,882
- Hey, mister.
- Move! Out of the way!

583
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,009
-Hold my horse.
-Move! Move!

584
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,094
Transfer is available

585
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:06,263
for IND Queens Boulevard.

586
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,692
Next stop, 59th,
Lexington Avenue.

587
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:22,862
-Subway is faster.
-Oh!

588
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,115
People tend
to romanticise science,

589
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:27,158
when it is, in fact,
quite cold.

590
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:28,827
So, what's next,
Dr Schmidt?

591
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,037
Mars?

592
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,248
No, we've conquered space.

593
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,793
I'm moving
to the next frontier.

594
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,672
What's beyond space?

595
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,219
You might wanna
get that suit pressed,

596
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,304
Dr Schmidt.

597
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:49,556
We leave for the airport
in an hour.

598
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,016
He's gonna meet the President.

599
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,684
If the President objects
to a few creases,

600
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,103
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

601
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,939
- Can | use that?
- No.

602
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,399
Yes.

603
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:01,526
Baxter.

604
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,823
It's for you, Doctor.

605
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,704
| may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

606
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:15,040
I'm expecting
a delivery shortly.

607
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:19,210
Speak.

608
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,795
Your goons made a mess.

609
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:22,130
Did they?

610
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,716
Miss Shaw met
with a professor. Jones.

611
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,093
She acquired the device
from him.

612
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,095
Then we lost her.

613
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,432
Dr Jones got away as well.

614
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,017
/s that so?

615
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,518
<i>Most unfortunate.</i>

616
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,354
| gotta clean things
up here, Doctor.

617
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,438
<i>And as a representative</i>

618
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:39,981
<i>of the United States
government,</i>

619
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,775
/ urge you to cooperate.

620
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,151
<i>Get on that plane
to Los Angeles,</i>

621
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,320
and get your medal
from the President.

622
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:54,037
Hello?

623
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,706
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

624
00:47:58,124 --> 00:47:59,125
To Morocco.

625
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,377
Yes, sir.

626
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:02,545
The university murders

627
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,589
took place at the height
of the parade.

628
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:05,757
Police are searching

629
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,093
for retired professor
Dr Henry Jones.

630
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:11,262
A colleague told ABC that
Jones recently lost his son

631
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:13,431
and was in the middle
of a divorce.

632
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,853
This guy,
he looks like you.

633
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,190
Nah. No.

634
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,152
-It is you.
-No, no, no. Hey.

635
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,862
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

636
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,280
- Hey!
- It's the killer!

637
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,368
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

638
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,953
Bridge traffic.

639
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,007
Boy, am | glad
to see you, Sallah.

640
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,844
| wish | could say the same,
old friend.

641
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,057
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

642
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,147
Your goddaughter, Helena,

643
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,983
was arrested in Tangier
last year

644
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:07,902
for auctioning contraband.

645
00:49:10,363 --> 00:49:11,448
There's more.

646
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,910
She was bailed out
by Aziz Rahim.

647
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:19,581
Aziz Rahim is the son
of Big Rahim,

648
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:22,417
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

649
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,630
Big Rahim
owns the Hotel Atlantique

650
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,383
in Tangier, and this week,

651
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,679
the hotel is hosting
its annual auction

652
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,723
of stolen antiquities.

653
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,393
All the big players
are already there.

654
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,353
Alia, Jabari.

655
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,772
This is the great man
who brought our family

656
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,691
to America during the war.

657
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,235
Quick, when was
the Suez Crisis?

658
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,779
1956.

659
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,615
Very impressive, Jabari.

660
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:56,201
My grandchildren watch
too much TV,

661
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:58,912
but they know their history.

662
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:03,208
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

663
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,252
| need a ride
to the airport, Sallah.

664
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,839
If you run, the police will
assume that you're guilty.

665
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:11,883
Without Helena or the Dial,

666
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:13,885
I'm gonna get framed
for murder.

667
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,679
Have you thought
about calling Marion?

668
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,098
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

669
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,481
<i>Welcome to New York's</i>

670
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:28,858
John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

671
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:31,986
The upper level is
for Pan American Airlines...

672
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:33,988
| took something else
from your apartment.

673
00:50:34,155 --> 00:50:35,365
It was under the bed.

674
00:50:40,578 --> 00:50:41,621
Thanks, Sallah.

675
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,667
| also brought my passport.

676
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,920
| could help you.

677
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,088
In Tangier?

678
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:51,798
Wherever chance takes us.

679
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:53,800
Indy, I...

680
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:56,177
| miss the desert.

681
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:58,054
| miss the sea.

682
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:01,391
And | miss waking up
every morning

683
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,976
wondering what
wonderful adventure

684
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,686
the new day will bring to us.

685
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,647
This is not
an adventure, Sallah.

686
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,693
Those days have come and gone.

687
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:12,902
Perhaps.

688
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,404
Perhaps not.

689
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:21,286
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

690
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,173
Champagne?

691
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,426
We've got four more hours
to Tangier.

692
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,602
Your scotch, sir.

693
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:47,228
Thanks.

694
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,528
Basil. Come on, Baz/

695
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,447
- Open the door!
- No/

696
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,115
-Stay out, Indy!
-Open the door.

697
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,203
The Germans were right, Indy.

698
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,664
- Huh? What?
- It's too big. It's too much.

699
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,499
Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!

700
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,584
-Give me...
-No.

701
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,668
What are you doing?

702
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,961
You've listened
to nothing that | said.

703
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,838
| don't understand it, Baz!

704
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,132
Well, | was trying to
explain it to you downstairs.

705
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:17,508
You've just
ignored everything.

706
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,593
You're terrifying
your daughter.

707
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,847
Indy, Archimedes

708
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,224
discovered
a temporal meteorology.

709
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,061
Archimedes was
a mathematician, Baz,

710
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,437
not a magician.

711
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,065
He could predict
fissures in time.

712
00:52:32,231 --> 00:52:33,775
Fissures in time?

713
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,195
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

714
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,238
Proving it
is what makes it science!

715
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,713
Oh, Baz.

716
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:58,966
| never should've
given you the thing.

717
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,177
It... It belongs in a museum.

718
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,805
Give it to me. Please.

719
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,768
If | give you this,

720
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:11,437
it must be destroyed.

721
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,023
| will.

722
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,069
I'll destroy it, Baz.

723
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:21,572
Promise.

724
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,205
I'm sorry about this.

725
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,581
It's all my fault.

726
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,252
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

727
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,421
Okay. I've gotta catch
an aeroplane.

728
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:39,382
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

729
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:40,800
Some things
should stay buried.

730
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:41,884
| know, Baz.

731
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,177
It's vital
that you destroy it.

732
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,679
- | will, Baz.
- Do you understand?

733
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:46,389
- I'll destroy it. Yes.
- Say you will, Indy.

734
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:47,473
| will... Yes.

735
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,183
You promised me.
Remember that.

736
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,309
| will... | promise.

737
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,436
There's a reason,

738
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,105
a reason that Archimedes
broke it in two.

739
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,982
| know, Baz.

740
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,276
-Indy.

741
00:53:59,026 --> 00:54:00,319
Thanks, Wombat.

742
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:02,447
He's gonna be all right
in a few days.

743
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,950
I'll call you
as soon as | land.

744
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:12,373
Ladies and gentlemen,

745
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,917
<i>we are 20 minutes
from landing in Tangier.</i>

746
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,077
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

747
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,829
No more champagne!
How many more...

748
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,955
I'm staying.

749
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,499
Go home. Go home!

750
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:11,098
Rahim.

751
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,518
Miss Shaw, she's here.

752
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,940
Forged in bronze.

753
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,066
Nearly complete.

754
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,859
It is an astrological clock.

755
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:24,654
Dating third century BC

756
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,741
and built
by Archimedes himself.

757
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,203
All right,
let's start at 20,000.

758
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:33,454
20,000, thank you very much.

759
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,956
30. 30.

760
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:37,792
Gauges green, power full,

761
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,294
and when | reach 85, | rotate.

762
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:41,879
What next?

763
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,256
Louis, help him! He's so cute.

764
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,383
-Pull back on the yoke.
- did, man. I'm airborne.

765
00:55:45,466 --> 00:55:46,467
Yeah, he's airborne.

766
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,844
-Can | have a sip?
-Do | pick up the flaps?

767
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,929
Don't touch the flaps
under 400 feet.

768
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,764
Decrease your pitch
to get to 120.

769
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:52,932
All right.

770
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,770
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

771
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,439
No password, no entry.
| don't make the rules.

772
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,318
And, er,
what is the current bid?

773
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,404
-The bid is 50,000.
-Then | bid 55.

774
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:08,030
Who'll give me 607?

775
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,657
-60. 657

776
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,075
65. 707

777
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:12,493
- 75.
- 75. 807

778
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,578
-80.
-85.

779
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,871
How about 907

780
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:23,880
-This auction is private.
-This auction's over.

781
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,631
Au contlraire,
it's hardly begun.

782
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,174
- 100.
- 100,000.

783
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,885
| like the hat, by the way.

784
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,303
Makes you look
at least two years younger.

785
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:31,637
Thanks.

786
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,722
-110, bravo.
-1 told you that

787
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:34,765
-this auction is over.
-Excuse me, who is this man?

788
00:56:34,932 --> 00:56:36,392
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

789
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:38,394
And she's up past her bedtime.

790
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,770
-Come on, Wombat.
-1 wouldn't do that.

791
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:41,439
You want to explain it
to the cops at the bar?

792
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,940
The ones | paid off?

793
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:45,067
You're out of your depth,
Jonesy.

794
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:46,652
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

795
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,487
He's the one
wanted for murder.

796
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:50,698
Nice big picture
in the New York Herald. 1307

797
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,450
| didn't kill anyone.

798
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:53,534
No entry,
it's a private auction.

799
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,827
And you know it,
Helena.

800
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,497
But whoever did
was looking for this.

801
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,042
What you've got here
is Pandora's Box.

802
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,502
No, actually.

803
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,838
It's my box.

804
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,467
You.

805
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,303
Have we met?

806
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,596
No.

807
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:15,097
My memory
is a little fuzzy,

808
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,891
but your face rings a bell.

809
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,517
Are you still a Nazi?

810
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,815
You're confused.
My name is Schmidt.

811
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:27,568
Professor Schmidt
of Alabama University.

812
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,572
Professor Schmidt. How nice
to meet you in person.

813
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,199
150.

814
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:34,367
After our conversation,
Miss Shaw,

815
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,494
| thought we'd come to
an agreement about the Dial.

816
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:37,578
Funny. The last time

817
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,955
| saw the other guy
who looks like you,

818
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,790
he was also after this.

819
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,000
Your numbers were light,
Professor Schmidt.

820
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,002
But good news is, you're here
now. The bid is 160.

821
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,921
You don't seem
to understand, Miss Shaw.

822
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,297
This relic is my property.

823
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,883
-It's not yours. You stole it.
-Then you stole it.

824
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,635
And then | stole it.
It's called capitalism.

825
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:53,761
The bid is 160.

826
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:54,845
- 160.
- 170?

827
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,930
You should've
stayed in New York.

828
00:57:56,013 --> 00:57:57,014
- 1707
-You should've stayed

829
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,892
- out of Poland.
- 170. Anyone? Anyone?

830
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,352
Going, going...

831
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:02,728
Gone!

832
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,355
Stay away!

833
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,108
Get the Dial.

834
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,780
Stay away!

835
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,082
Oh, hello, Claude.

836
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:24,542
You should not
have come back, Helena.

837
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:34,927
Get back.

838
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:46,647
Teddy!

839
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,163
Rahim says you stay.

840
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:14,967
Thank you.

841
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,523
See you in the past,
Dr Jones.

842
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:57,551
It's my cab!

843
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,308
Tell them to back off.

844
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,851
| just told them to shoot you.

845
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,146
All right, guys.

846
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,899
Put the guns down.

847
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,275
Put 'em down.

848
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,237
All right.

849
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,198
That's better.

850
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,703
Oh, dear.

851
01:00:34,755 --> 01:00:35,881
Rahim.

852
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,467
You're in pyjamas.

853
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,636
| was sleeping, Helena.

854
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:41,804
- Mmm-hmm.
- Peacefully.

855
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:42,888
Oh.

856
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,807
My father woke me.

857
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,601
He told me you'd
returned to our hotel.

858
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,355
Then he handed me
this scimitar

859
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,358
and told me to come home
with your head.

860
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:56,110
Huh.

861
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:57,486
Does it have to be that bit?

862
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,038
| thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

863
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:09,331
Rahim,

864
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:11,667
| had an item to sell.

865
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,711
Excuse me. The item
she's talking about

866
01:01:13,794 --> 01:01:14,795
-actually belongs to me.
-No.

867
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,172
You do not need to intrude
in this conversation.

868
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,381
And some very bad people,
worse people...

869
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:18,674
You do not need to get
involved with my business.

870
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:20,217
-...have run off with it.
-Is this your new man?

871
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,011
-No. No, no, no, no.
-It's complicated.

872
01:01:23,345 --> 01:01:24,847
What exactly
do you owe this guy?

873
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,099
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

874
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,934
| presume you sold the ring.

875
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:30,436
It didn't go for as much
as | thought it would.

876
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,937
I'll do it!

877
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,105
What are you... Hey!

878
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,946
You just got me killed!

879
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:43,699
Well, I'm not the one that's
engaged to a mobster!

880
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,785
| don't need morality lessons
from an ageing grave robber!

881
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,162
I'm not a grave robber.

882
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,331
Your father and |
did important work together.

883
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,585
Don't tell me
all your escapades were noble,

884
01:01:54,668 --> 01:01:56,295
selfless quests.
You did it for the buzz!

885
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,049
Oh, good work, Teddy!

886
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,219
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

887
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,814
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

888
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:34,708
Not this way!

889
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,460
You don't know where you're
going, Indy! Listen to him.

890
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,878
-He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

891
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,425
There he is!

892
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:50,683
Faster. Go faster!

893
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:52,768
Ten minutes
to the airport, boss.

894
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,105
I'm not sure
Professor Schmidt

895
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:57,481
is an actual professor,
by the way.

896
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,857
- He's a Nazi!
- Turn left!

897
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,484
Turn left! Turn left!

898
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:01,735
- Oh, no!
- No!

899
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,377
Helena! Don't do this!

900
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:27,886
- Hey, this way!
- That way!

901
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:29,847
No!

902
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:32,308
Helena!

903
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:35,477
No!

904
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,613
What the hell?

905
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:54,496
Helena!

906
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,334
Hey! Hey!

907
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,502
What the hell?

908
01:04:03,213 --> 01:04:04,256
Come on!

909
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,887
Come on. Come on!

910
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,631
You think
he'd be proud of this?

911
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:47,549
Who?

912
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,010
Your father!

913
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:53,138
His only daughter selling
her soul for bail money!

914
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:54,765
Sounds quite cool
when you put it like that.

915
01:04:54,848 --> 01:04:56,475
And it's not all bail money.

916
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:57,851
Some of it's gambling debt

917
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,019
-and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

918
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,896
Helena! No!

919
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:01,980
Helena!

920
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,567
How did you end up like this?

921
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:07,069
Well, you mean resourceful?

922
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,571
Daring? Beautiful?
Self-sufficient?

923
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,958
Whoa!

924
01:05:34,888 --> 01:05:36,348
Hold on!

925
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,436
Go this way!

926
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,821
There he is.

927
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,042
Stop!

928
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,919
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop!

929
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:10,257
Aah!

930
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,808
On the left!

931
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:21,935
Take the wheel, Teddy!

932
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,189
What are you doing?

933
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:26,899
Getting what's mine.

934
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,859
Helena!

935
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:35,199
Damn it! You crazy?

936
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:39,161
Hey! Helena!

937
01:06:43,123 --> 01:06:44,750
- Take the gun!
- Miss Shaw.

938
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,836
Let go, Miss Shaw!

939
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:11,693
Let go.

940
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,154
Come on! Give me the Dial!

941
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,949
<i>Helena!</i>

942
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,785
Damn.

943
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,668
Turn back! They went that way!

944
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:28,752
He's gone!

945
01:07:28,835 --> 01:07:30,671
- Move over!
- Hey!

946
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,052
| didn't come here to
rescue you from your fiancé!

947
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:38,136
Rescue me?

948
01:07:43,308 --> 01:07:44,935
| just want the Dial back.

949
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,998
Put your hands
above your head.

950
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,584
Not the smoothest
break-up | ever had.

951
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,918
If your father
was still alive...

952
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,044
Well, he's not, Indy.

953
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,629
Hey, something's wrong
with the engine.

954
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:13,922
If only there'd been
someone there for me,

955
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,507
some father figure, someone

956
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,718
specifically anointed
for the job.

957
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:19,177
You have no idea
about the kind...

958
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,262
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

959
01:08:20,345 --> 01:08:22,389
| mean,
what even is a godfather?

960
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,434
Anyway, family never
was your strong suit.

961
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:28,437
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

962
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,605
Hey, no fair.

963
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,356
Give me that back.

964
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,649
That was my father's watch!

965
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:36,069
Give it back to him.

966
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:41,950
You're gonna have
to leave town with me.

967
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:43,619
Rahim will be
looking for you too.

968
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:44,995
They'll go to
Tangier airport first,

969
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,079
so we'll need to catch a train

970
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,331
and get a plane
from Casablanca.

971
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:50,417
Whoa. What was that?

972
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,422
Ah.

973
01:08:55,505 --> 01:08:56,506
Damn.

974
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:00,010
Yeah.

975
01:09:00,093 --> 01:09:01,219
| know, sir.

976
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,431
Yes...

977
01:09:05,682 --> 01:09:06,683
Copy.

978
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,065
They pulled the plug.

979
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:14,524
You got them scared.

980
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,068
Because they don't understand.

981
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:17,736
No. Because your associates

982
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,154
killed three
American civilians

983
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,573
and blew up
a nationally televised parade.

984
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,908
Because you stood up

985
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,701
the President
of the United States,

986
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,036
ran to Morocco,

987
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,580
and created an incident that
required military extraction!

988
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:32,417
Then take me to DC,
and | will explain it all.

989
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,919
They want you to vanish.

990
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:36,213
We have half the Dial now.

991
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,714
They were just trying
to keep you happy,

992
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:40,384
letting you chase that thing.

993
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,593
They never cared about it.

994
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,761
They will, Miss Mason,

995
01:09:42,844 --> 01:09:44,471
when they understand
what it can do.

996
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,764
You put them
on the moon.

997
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:47,724
They got what they wanted.

998
01:09:49,017 --> 01:09:50,936
All right, buckle up.
We're landing in Spain.

999
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:53,563
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

1000
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,190
I'm not going back to Alabama!

1001
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,609
All we need is a vessel to
take us to the Mediterranean.

1002
01:09:58,276 --> 01:09:59,695
The Grafikos
will take us to the other...

1003
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,863
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

1004
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,073
Let go of me, Schmidt.

1005
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,866
I'm asking you personally.

1006
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,202
You're a piece of work, Doc.

1007
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:09,746
Hey!

1008
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:39,276
Schmidt...

1009
01:10:40,193 --> 01:10:41,820
My name is Voller.

1010
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:45,991
Jurgen Voller.

1011
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:01,047
That's a Sea Stallion.

1012
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:02,632
American helicopter.

1013
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:05,343
Did you know
the Wright Brothers?

1014
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:07,262
- What?
- The Wright Brothers.

1015
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,513
Orville and Wilbur.

1016
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,932
They invented the aeroplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

1017
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:12,642
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

1018
01:11:12,809 --> 01:11:15,228
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

1019
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,939
And the Wright Brothers were
born during the Civil War.

1020
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:20,233
Oh, | thought maybe you went
to school with them.

1021
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:24,112
Oh, come on, Indy.
That was funny.

1022
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,572
-"Funny"?
-Mmm-hmm.

1023
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,532
I'm stuck in Tangier

1024
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,951
with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

1025
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:31,328
I'm wanted for murder.

1026
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:33,413
Nazis have
half of Archimedes' Dial

1027
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,998
and your father's notebooks.

1028
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,375
| have a copy.

1029
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,669
Dad's notebooks.
| made a copy.

1030
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,671
Where?

1031
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,715
You memorised five notebooks?

1032
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,091
Seven. And of course not.

1033
01:11:45,258 --> 01:11:46,885
Half of them were
as dull as ditchwater.

1034
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,180
Just the really
important bits.

1035
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,057
Like what?

1036
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,642
The location of the Grafikos.

1037
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,519
Nobody knows
where the Grafikos is.

1038
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:57,020
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

1039
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,355
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

1040
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,148
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

1041
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,608
It's directions
to the rest of the Dial.

1042
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,276
Ask her if she knows
what language it's in.

1043
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,362
Ah! It isn't in a language.
It's in a code.

1044
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,738
What code?

1045
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,365
Archimedes used two codes.

1046
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,075
Linear B and Polybius Square.

1047
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,868
So, even if you find
the Grafikos,

1048
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,578
without me, you can't read it.

1049
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,413
Please.

1050
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,415
Dad taught me Polybius
when | was nine.

1051
01:12:17,582 --> 01:12:19,251
Used to leave little notes
around the house.

1052
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,335
"Tidy your room."

1053
01:12:20,418 --> 01:12:21,711
"Stay away from my brandy."

1054
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:23,880
What if it's Linear B?

1055
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,216
50 quid it's Polybius.

1056
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,385
Give me that.

1057
01:12:28,468 --> 01:12:29,469
Hey.

1058
01:12:29,886 --> 01:12:31,096
That won't work.

1059
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,515
Moroccan chewing gum's made
from the sap of the Manilkara.

1060
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,975
Heat resistant.

1061
01:12:36,476 --> 01:12:37,686
Try and start it.

1062
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:43,775
-Start it.
-1 am.

1063
01:12:45,318 --> 01:12:47,445
Huh? Huh?

1064
01:12:48,154 --> 01:12:49,739
-Huh?
-t won't hold.

1065
01:12:49,906 --> 01:12:51,825
It'll get us
to the train station.

1066
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,118
“US“?

1067
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,494
- You goin' home?
- No.

1068
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,454
I'm going to Casablanca.

1069
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:58,373
Then I'm gonna hop a plane
to the Aegean.

1070
01:12:58,456 --> 01:12:59,457
Just like you.

1071
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,418
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

1072
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,671
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

1073
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,923
Archimedes was
surrounded by Romans.

1074
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:08,842
Where else would it be?

1075
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,010
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

1076
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:11,303
And you don't
have coordinates.

1077
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:13,013
And you don't have a boat.

1078
01:13:15,932 --> 01:13:18,351
I've got an old friend
in Greece.

1079
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:19,895
An expert diver.

1080
01:13:20,061 --> 01:13:21,897
With a big, beautiful boat

1081
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:24,107
that'll get us there
before they will.

1082
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,027
You need me,

1083
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:28,403
and you know it.

1084
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:19,788
Renny!

1085
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:22,916
Indy?

1086
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,793
Indy!

1087
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:32,217
So, that's the expert diver?

1088
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,594
Spain's greatest frogman.

1089
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,390
Hey!

1090
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:40,642
So, Spain's greatest frogman
has a shit boat

1091
01:14:40,725 --> 01:14:42,018
and only one good frog leg?

1092
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:43,228
Stop it.

1093
01:14:47,023 --> 01:14:48,233
You got
a different boat.

1094
01:14:48,316 --> 01:14:49,526
Stop it.

1095
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,833
We're going here.

1096
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,920
Where they found the first
part of the Antikythera.

1097
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,006
But...

1098
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,633
we're going deeper.

1099
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:17,220
Dad tracked down
the old sponge diver

1100
01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:18,930
who found the Dial.

1101
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,265
He told him

1102
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:23,393
that the wrecked Roman ship
broke up under the sea

1103
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,686
70 feet below.

1104
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,814
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1105
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,150
That's where they found it.

1106
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,821
But he said that most
of the ship had broken off

1107
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,740
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1108
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,284
Too deep for sponge divers.

1109
01:15:40,326 --> 01:15:43,163
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship

1110
01:15:43,329 --> 01:15:46,708
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1111
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,798
They weren't taking
half a Dial for a joyride.

1112
01:15:57,635 --> 01:15:59,220
They had the Grafikos...

1113
01:16:02,098 --> 01:16:04,267
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1114
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,189
Your dad was a genius.

1115
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:10,857
Yeah.

1116
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:13,318
He was.

1117
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,172
Seven of spades.

1118
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,551
How do you do that?

1119
01:16:38,718 --> 01:16:40,136
Wow.

1120
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,429
Do it again.

1121
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:47,310
Pick a card, Dr Jones.

1122
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:55,944
Seven of spades!

1123
01:16:58,071 --> 01:16:59,114
She's magic.

1124
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,448
Trick deck.

1125
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:01,616
No.

1126
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,202
| force the card.

1127
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,662
| offer the mark,

1128
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:06,996
you,

1129
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:08,164
the feeling of a choice,

1130
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:10,542
but ultimately, | make you
pick the card | want.

1131
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:13,837
"The mark."

1132
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:18,800
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1133
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:20,718
| have to check the lines.

1134
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:27,851
Good night.

1135
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,107
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1136
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:36,818
Dates?

1137
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:38,278
What dates?

1138
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,196
These dates.

1139
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:46,369
Written over and over again
in this letter.

1140
01:17:47,787 --> 01:17:49,622
August 20th, 1969.

1141
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:51,332
That's three days from now.

1142
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:53,751
And the same date in 1939.

1143
01:17:53,918 --> 01:17:56,337
Two weeks before
Hitler invades Poland.

1144
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,757
Wait.

1145
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,886
Now you believe the Dial
has magical powers?

1146
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,222
| don't believe in magic,
Wombat.

1147
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:10,476
But a few times in my life,
I've seen things.

1148
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,356
Things | can't explain.

1149
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:19,068
And I've come to believe
it's not so much

1150
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:21,362
what you believe.

1151
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:23,781
It's how hard you believe it.

1152
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,244
I've seen things too, Indy.

1153
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,706
The only thing
worth believing in, ever,

1154
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,541
is cash.

1155
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:36,920
Right.

1156
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,843
What if you could
go back in time?

1157
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,222
What would you do?

1158
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:50,016
Witness the Trojan War?

1159
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,644
Check in on Cleopatra?

1160
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:58,399
I'd stop my son
from enlisting.

1161
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:03,279
Did he sign up to please you?

1162
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,574
No, he signed up
to piss me off.

1163
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,746
How would you
have stopped him?

1164
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,461
I'd tell him
he was gonna die.

1165
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,387
I'd tell him
that his mother would...

1166
01:19:30,014 --> 01:19:31,849
find no end to her grief.

1167
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,436
And that his father
would be...

1168
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,191
helpless to console her.

1169
01:19:43,486 --> 01:19:45,989
And that the loss would put
an end to their marriage.

1170
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:01,212
You're still wearing the ring.

1171
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,233
Mmm.

1172
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:25,320
Promising.

1173
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,455
More promising.

1174
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:42,337
Hello.

1175
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:46,549
Get your gear on.
They're waiting.

1176
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,263
Hey.

1177
01:20:53,264 --> 01:20:54,265
Come here.

1178
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:56,476
Okay.

1179
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:57,560
I'm gonna show you something.

1180
01:20:57,643 --> 01:21:00,646
Gosh, this looks important.

1181
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:03,816
Around the rope...

1182
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,027
Now, we are going deep.

1183
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,030
Descend fast, and breathe
through these hoses.

1184
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,239
Okay?

1185
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:12,033
Ah, stay separate.

1186
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,160
No crisscross. All right?

1187
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:15,495
We cannot stay long.

1188
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:18,998
| have a method that
usually prevents the bends.

1189
01:21:19,999 --> 01:21:21,125
- Usually?
- Yeah.

1190
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,418
| call it "the bounce."

1191
01:21:22,585 --> 01:21:23,586
You know, fast down,

1192
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,671
three minutes on the bottom,
and then up.

1193
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:26,881
Three minutes!

1194
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,883
No one more second.

1195
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,803
-Three minutes.
-Yeah, that's right.

1196
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:33,805
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, capitan.

1197
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,973
We have to go.

1198
01:21:38,309 --> 01:21:39,769
Er, quick question.

1199
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:41,270
What's that?

1200
01:21:41,437 --> 01:21:42,814
-They're sharks?
-No.

1201
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:45,274
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1202
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,653
-Eels?
-Anguilas.

1203
01:21:48,736 --> 01:21:49,737
Most are small.

1204
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:51,489
Sometimes they are big.
Two metres.

1205
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,699
But if you see them,
stay still.

1206
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:57,078
They bite you,
they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1207
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,663
They look like snakes.

1208
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:00,373
No, they don't.

1209
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:02,625
Private Brandy
reporting for duty.

1210
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,127
You're not coming, Teddy?

1211
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:06,003
| can't swim.

1212
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,296
Lucky him.

1213
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:08,756
Everyone can swim.

1214
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:12,510
Reach and pull.
Reach and pull.

1215
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:15,638
All right.
You stay here

1216
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:17,014
with Hector
and watch our lines.

1217
01:22:20,017 --> 01:22:21,936
It is time, camarada.

1218
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:11,295
Two minutes?

1219
01:26:24,553 --> 01:26:25,554
Hey.

1220
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,421
Hurry up!

1221
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:14,979
Helena!

1222
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:24,739
Come on.

1223
01:27:24,905 --> 01:27:26,449
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

1224
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,492
That's it.

1225
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:53,017
Who are these people?

1226
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:56,270
Nazis.

1227
01:27:56,353 --> 01:27:58,814
First, you return my Dial,
Dr Jones,

1228
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:02,109
and now,
you bring me the Grafikos.

1229
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:05,196
I'm very happy you're not
wasting in retirement.

1230
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:07,948
| should have retired you
when | had the chance.

1231
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:09,241
Where are your sponsors?

1232
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:10,993
I'm on my own now.

1233
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,828
Things move forward,
Dr Jones.

1234
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:13,913
And sometimes...

1235
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,583
they go backward.

1236
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:23,088
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1237
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:51,534
What language is that?

1238
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:53,285
It's not a language.

1239
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:55,621
It's a code.

1240
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:57,456
Polybius.

1241
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,583
You owe me 50 quid.

1242
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,712
Not familiar
with Polybius cipher?

1243
01:29:03,879 --> 01:29:04,880
No.

1244
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,049
But it appears you are.

1245
01:29:11,428 --> 01:29:12,638
Read it, please.

1246
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:21,772
No.

1247
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,529
Indy...

1248
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:40,916
Feeling helpful now?

1249
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:45,170
| am.

1250
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,592
| know this stuff backwards.

1251
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:50,843
No!

1252
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:53,429
Sorry, Indy.

1253
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:55,222
| don't do noble death.

1254
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,974
Just

1255
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:58,559
cold, hard maths.

1256
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:00,936
| crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1257
01:30:02,354 --> 01:30:03,981
One hundred grand. Cash.

1258
01:30:04,064 --> 01:30:05,149
Helena...

1259
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:06,817
Take it or leave it.

1260
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:09,361
You have a deal.

1261
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,668
He'll never pay you.

1262
01:30:26,211 --> 01:30:27,546
I think
you will find this is worth

1263
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,089
more than your asking price.

1264
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,100
-Teddy.
-Helena,

1265
01:30:40,267 --> 01:30:41,435
don't do this.

1266
01:30:46,857 --> 01:30:48,275
Let's see what we've got here.

1267
01:30:50,444 --> 01:30:51,820
"My Makhana..."”

1268
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:53,322
that's "machine"...

1269
01:30:54,573 --> 01:30:58,118
"lies with me,
in the city | left.

1270
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:00,663
"Where wolves
teach men to walk.

1271
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:04,959
"Under one of nine, | lie."

1272
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,505
Only one thing
lies anywhere forever.

1273
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:12,383
The dead. So, if the Dial lies
with him, then...

1274
01:31:14,259 --> 01:31:15,761
then this is directions
to his tomb.

1275
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:17,596
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1276
01:31:19,014 --> 01:31:20,808
Undiscovered
for two millennia.

1277
01:31:23,894 --> 01:31:25,980
"The city | left."

1278
01:31:26,605 --> 01:31:28,649
Archimedes lived two places
his entire life,

1279
01:31:28,732 --> 01:31:30,067
so he only left one.

1280
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,945
Anyone? At the back?

1281
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,364
Come on, Indy.
Everyone knows this.

1282
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:37,366
-Even this clown.
-Alexandria.

1283
01:31:38,033 --> 01:31:39,868
Full marks.

1284
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:42,496
Now, "wolf"
in Greek is “/ycos.”

1285
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,915
Root of the word
"lycaeum” or "school."

1286
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:47,710
And the Doric
for "walking" is...

1287
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:49,962
"peripatio.”

1288
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,008
Which also happens to be
the word for...

1289
01:31:55,342 --> 01:31:56,593
Aw.

1290
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,223
| thought you were
a bright spark.

1291
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:06,937
"Peripatio” means "walking,"

1292
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:09,523
but it also means "counting.”

1293
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:12,818
So, "Where wolves
teach men to walk"

1294
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,863
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

1295
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:18,782
Is correct.

1296
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:20,492
Now, the next bit is easy.

1297
01:32:21,785 --> 01:32:23,370
"Beneath one of nine"?

1298
01:32:24,538 --> 01:32:25,873
There are nine Muses.

1299
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,166
The Museon.

1300
01:32:27,332 --> 01:32:29,793
The Greek word for the
Great Library of Alexandria.

1301
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,003
Which, as we all know,

1302
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:33,756
has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1303
01:32:33,922 --> 01:32:34,923
May 1?

1304
01:32:36,091 --> 01:32:37,217
Thank you.

1305
01:32:38,385 --> 01:32:41,138
The nine Muses,
in reverse order,

1306
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:44,099
are Calliope,

1307
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:45,851
Urania,

1308
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:48,479
Polymnia,

1309
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:50,981
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

1310
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,567
...and Meli whasisname,

1311
01:32:53,942 --> 01:32:54,943
that other one,

1312
01:32:55,694 --> 01:32:56,695
Thalia,

1313
01:32:57,446 --> 01:32:58,655
Euteroe,

1314
01:32:58,822 --> 01:33:00,908
but the first is...

1315
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:02,159
Clio.

1316
01:33:03,994 --> 01:33:05,162
The Muse of history and time.

1317
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,538
That Archimedes,

1318
01:33:06,705 --> 01:33:07,956
- what a clever bugger.
- The entrance

1319
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,167
to the tomb is by
the School of Mathematics,

1320
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:12,044
under a statue of Clio,

1321
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,963
in the ruins of the Great
Library of Alexandria.

1322
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,423
Gold star for Dr Brains.

1323
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,801
Teddy!

1324
01:33:28,727 --> 01:33:30,312
The Grafikos, get it!

1325
01:33:57,965 --> 01:34:00,676
| have said it before,
and | will say it again!

1326
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:03,470
When you're
in a tight spot, dynamite.

1327
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:06,765
My friend was just murdered.

1328
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,272
Sorry.

1329
01:34:13,438 --> 01:34:15,190
You told them everything.

1330
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:17,985
Word for word.

1331
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,529
But Archimedes
didn't make it that easy.

1332
01:34:21,321 --> 01:34:23,240
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1333
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,292
Go!

1334
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:37,754
So, what do you see?

1335
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,215
Polybius square.

1336
01:34:40,757 --> 01:34:41,884
Made of?

1337
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:45,637
Wax and wood.

1338
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:48,515
Anything else?

1339
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:52,978
It's heavy.

1340
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,149
Too heavy.

1341
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:00,402
Give me that.

1342
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:42,319
This is solid gold?

1343
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:43,695
Ancient gold.

1344
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:46,198
From the Nile.

1345
01:35:47,866 --> 01:35:48,867
Hold it, Teddy.

1346
01:36:00,379 --> 01:36:01,463
Sell this thing

1347
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,298
and we are out of the hole
and then some.

1348
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:04,383
| have just the customer.

1349
01:36:04,549 --> 01:36:05,926
Cranky, old Duchess
in Gibraltar...

1350
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:07,970
This is going in a museum.

1351
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:12,140
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1352
01:36:19,022 --> 01:36:20,023
What does it say?

1353
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:25,028
"Search where Dionysius

1354
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:28,573
"hears each whisper

1355
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:31,451
"like a hurricane."

1356
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,706
The Ear.

1357
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:38,208
The cave of Dionysius.

1358
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:40,043
Where is that?

1359
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:42,546
In Sicily.

1360
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:46,133
- How much fuel have we got?
- It's full.

1361
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,143
They're heading west.

1362
01:36:57,519 --> 01:36:58,520
Not east.

1363
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:29,593
- | want the papaya.
- How much is it?

1364
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:34,056
Take this.

1365
01:37:36,808 --> 01:37:38,977
Look at that kid
with the straw hat.

1366
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:41,063
This way.

1367
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:45,650
Hey.

1368
01:37:46,693 --> 01:37:49,154
What do you think?

1369
01:37:54,951 --> 01:37:56,203
What are we doing?

1370
01:37:57,829 --> 01:37:59,498
Waiting for closing time
at the caves.

1371
01:37:59,664 --> 01:38:01,166
It's crawling with tourists.

1372
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,752
Okay, so he's, like,
running the show now?

1373
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:06,546
He's not running
the show, Teddy.

1374
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:11,051
| just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1375
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:12,803
We are.

1376
01:38:16,264 --> 01:38:17,265
Most assuredly.

1377
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:20,102
You know he's never gonna
let us sell any of that stuff.

1378
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,271
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1379
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:24,398
Helena,
get over here!

1380
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:25,482
Give me a hand!

1381
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:32,531
Oh, you splurged.

1382
01:38:33,865 --> 01:38:34,908
Here's your backpack.

1383
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:36,034
Where's the kid?

1384
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:51,550
Hey, watch it!

1385
01:38:51,633 --> 01:38:52,884
What's wrong
with you?

1386
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,581
Hello.

1387
01:39:23,999 --> 01:39:25,000
Hey.

1388
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:29,004
Let me go!

1389
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,339
Let me go!

1390
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:41,892
Get off me! Let me go!

1391
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,229
Hey, hey, hey!

1392
01:39:57,073 --> 01:39:58,158
Helenal!

1393
01:39:59,534 --> 01:40:00,952
They've got Teddy.

1394
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:04,664
They took him
up the hill somewhere.

1395
01:40:13,548 --> 01:40:15,550
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1396
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:25,852
What are they
gonna do to him?

1397
01:40:26,019 --> 01:40:28,688
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1398
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:31,525
They're not gonna hurt him.

1399
01:40:31,691 --> 01:40:32,859
They're gonna use him

1400
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,862
to get the other half
of the Dial.

1401
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:36,988
We gotta get there first.

1402
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:54,214
Colonising queens
built many cities in Sicily.

1403
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:55,882
-The temple...
-Let's go.

1404
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,094
...is the oldest
of the Greek temples.

1405
01:41:00,178 --> 01:41:01,555
The cave's over there.

1406
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,692
Could we go
a little faster, please?

1407
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:24,369
The Ear of Dionysius.

1408
01:41:32,085 --> 01:41:33,086
Wow.

1409
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:49,019
"Search where Dionysius hears

1410
01:41:49,102 --> 01:41:50,812
"each whisper
like a hurricane."

1411
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,023
That's some echo.

1412
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:57,360
Keep making noise till we
find out where it's loudest.

1413
01:42:14,794 --> 01:42:15,962
Stop.

1414
01:42:23,553 --> 01:42:24,679
This is it.

1415
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,144
Greek pediment.

1416
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:32,812
An entrance.

1417
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,231
Used to be.

1418
01:42:38,526 --> 01:42:39,527
A crescent.

1419
01:42:42,405 --> 01:42:43,490
Just like on the Grafikos.

1420
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:52,916
| think there's
an opening up there.

1421
01:42:59,547 --> 01:43:00,548
You okay up there?

1422
01:43:01,716 --> 01:43:02,884
Yes.

1423
01:43:05,387 --> 01:43:06,429
You're not moving.

1424
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,141
I'm thinking.

1425
01:43:12,977 --> 01:43:13,978
About?

1426
01:43:15,146 --> 01:43:18,066
About what the hell I'm doing
up here, 40 feet in the air,

1427
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,984
with crap shoulders,

1428
01:43:20,151 --> 01:43:21,945
crumbling vertebrae,

1429
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,614
a plate in one leg,
screws in the other.

1430
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,032
Yeah, | get it. | get it.

1431
01:43:26,658 --> 01:43:27,784
No, you don't get it.

1432
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:29,828
You're half my age.

1433
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:33,540
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1434
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:34,958
No. Fair enough.

1435
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,544
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1436
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:39,921
And I'm just guessing,

1437
01:43:40,004 --> 01:43:41,673
but | don't think
you've been shot nine times,

1438
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,300
including once by your father.

1439
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:47,387
Dad shot you?

1440
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,264
Don't talk to me.

1441
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:50,598
Just go ahead.
I'll follow you.

1442
01:43:59,357 --> 01:44:01,943
No, no, no. We are close.
We are close.

1443
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,111
Look around you.

1444
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:04,779
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

1445
01:44:04,946 --> 01:44:07,824
No, no, no. The cave
is closed for renovation.

1446
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:09,826
Oh.

1447
01:44:09,909 --> 01:44:10,952
Let me ask again.

1448
01:44:11,035 --> 01:44:12,954
Where is
the Cave of Dionysius?

1449
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:34,768
What's the matter?
You worried about the kid?

1450
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,729
Are you sure
they won't hurt him?

1451
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:39,105
He'll be fine.

1452
01:44:39,272 --> 01:44:40,315
He's smart.

1453
01:44:42,192 --> 01:44:43,568
Where'd you find him?

1454
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:47,405
He, er... He tried to steal
my purse outside a casino

1455
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:49,949
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1456
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:51,951
| hit him repeatedly
with my car door,

1457
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:54,621
but he didn't let go
and neither did |.

1458
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:56,331
So, been together ever since.

1459
01:44:57,457 --> 01:44:59,417
Thought you were
all about the money.

1460
01:45:00,543 --> 01:45:01,544
| am.

1461
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,466
Nobody memorises every page

1462
01:45:06,549 --> 01:45:08,676
of their
dead father's notebooks

1463
01:45:08,843 --> 01:45:09,928
for the money.

1464
01:45:16,559 --> 01:45:18,019
HerrVoller!

1465
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:29,572
They went that way.

1466
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,668
Why?

1467
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:46,714
Come on, come on.

1468
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:50,385
Let's go.

1469
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:56,099
Oh, my...

1470
01:45:59,143 --> 01:46:00,645
Oh, my God!

1471
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:02,814
Oh, my God!

1472
01:46:03,022 --> 01:46:04,399
- Oh, God!
- No, no.

1473
01:46:05,316 --> 01:46:06,693
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1474
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:12,866
Are they off me? Get 'em off!

1475
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:14,617
-No, no. Wait.
-Get 'em off!

1476
01:46:27,672 --> 01:46:28,756
What is that?

1477
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,219
Methane.

1478
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:35,471
Don't breathe.

1479
01:46:35,638 --> 01:46:36,639
Don't breathe?

1480
01:46:40,351 --> 01:46:41,728
We've gotta get outta here.

1481
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:51,571
Athena.

1482
01:46:53,323 --> 01:46:54,616
Goddess of war.

1483
01:46:57,493 --> 01:46:58,703
And reason.

1484
01:47:02,999 --> 01:47:04,375
"Under the moon...

1485
01:47:06,669 --> 01:47:08,671
"life lies at her feet."

1486
01:47:16,429 --> 01:47:17,764
Water displacement.

1487
01:47:18,556 --> 01:47:19,891
Get in the pool!

1488
01:47:20,058 --> 01:47:22,060
Why?
Help me open the door.

1489
01:47:22,226 --> 01:47:23,853
Well, they didn't
get out the doors!

1490
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:24,938
Get in the pool!

1491
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,857
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1492
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:29,150
Help me.

1493
01:47:31,569 --> 01:47:33,905
Archimedes was fascinated

1494
01:47:35,406 --> 01:47:37,367
by water displacement!

1495
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:52,215
Whoa!

1496
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:20,660
Hey! Get back here! Klaber!

1497
01:48:34,882 --> 01:48:36,050
You don't need to do that.

1498
01:49:02,118 --> 01:49:03,161
Hey!

1499
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:06,289
Give me that!

1500
01:49:07,081 --> 01:49:08,791
No!

1501
01:49:15,339 --> 01:49:16,632
Leave them.

1502
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:18,968
| said leave them.

1503
01:49:43,409 --> 01:49:44,952
Reach and pull.

1504
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,704
Reach and pull.

1505
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:49,040
Reach and pull.

1506
01:50:17,485 --> 01:50:19,028
Archimedes' tomb.

1507
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:49,267
Grab that corner.

1508
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:36,606
Indy.

1509
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,276
This frieze...

1510
01:51:42,945 --> 01:51:44,197
It's a phoenix.

1511
01:51:44,363 --> 01:51:45,364
A common icon.

1512
01:51:45,531 --> 01:51:47,116
No. Look,
it isn't.

1513
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:50,411
This phoenix has propellers.

1514
01:51:59,295 --> 01:52:00,755
What's this doing here?

1515
01:52:09,555 --> 01:52:12,558
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years,

1516
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,685
much less watches.

1517
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,439
Archimedes used it.

1518
01:52:21,984 --> 01:52:23,361
Dad was right.

1519
01:52:24,028 --> 01:52:25,029
It works.

1520
01:52:25,112 --> 01:52:26,739
Of course it works,
Miss Shaw.

1521
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:30,701
Mathematics works.

1522
01:52:31,827 --> 01:52:34,830
As it conquered space,
it will conquer time.

1523
01:52:42,713 --> 01:52:44,632
You've already
lost your son, Dr Jones.

1524
01:52:44,799 --> 01:52:45,800
Your wife is gone.

1525
01:52:45,883 --> 01:52:47,802
Do you really
want to lose your godchild?

1526
01:52:50,888 --> 01:52:51,973
For what?

1527
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,558
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1528
01:53:05,903 --> 01:53:06,904
Thank you.

1529
01:53:45,609 --> 01:53:46,986
History's greatest moment.

1530
01:53:54,076 --> 01:53:55,369
Its end.

1531
01:54:03,044 --> 01:54:04,045
Throw me the gun!

1532
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,682
-Get him outta here.
-Teddy.

1533
01:54:17,725 --> 01:54:18,851
Teddy! Teddy!

1534
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:20,061
Come on! Go!

1535
01:54:20,144 --> 01:54:21,145
This way. Come on.

1536
01:54:25,232 --> 01:54:26,776
<i>Go!</i>

1537
01:54:30,363 --> 01:54:31,364
Indy!

1538
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:34,533
Go!

1539
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:35,951
Go!

1540
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:37,203
Stop!

1541
01:54:40,581 --> 01:54:41,999
Now what?

1542
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:44,627
Bring him.

1543
01:54:52,718 --> 01:54:53,719
Helena, come on!

1544
01:54:53,886 --> 01:54:55,179
Teddy, we can't
just leave him.

1545
01:54:55,262 --> 01:54:56,597
We're not! Follow me!

1546
01:54:58,557 --> 01:54:59,558
Come on!

1547
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:04,563
Come on.

1548
01:55:18,744 --> 01:55:20,704
Teddy. Come on.
We've got a car.

1549
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:26,585
Ah, crap.

1550
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,843
Stay there.

1551
01:55:52,736 --> 01:55:53,737
Hop on.

1552
01:55:57,366 --> 01:56:00,286
The first hemisphere
sets the destination.

1553
01:56:01,787 --> 01:56:05,374
The second calculates
the location of the fissure

1554
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:08,461
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1555
01:56:09,044 --> 01:56:11,922
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude,

1556
01:56:12,965 --> 01:56:14,842
and transmit waypoints
to the pilots.

1557
01:56:26,979 --> 01:56:28,481
Shortcut.

1558
01:56:32,776 --> 01:56:35,738
You got coordinates for 37.07.

1559
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:37,156
So, who is it?

1560
01:56:37,907 --> 01:56:39,158
Churchill?

1561
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:41,494
Ike?

1562
01:56:43,829 --> 01:56:46,332
Who are you gonna kill
to win the war?

1563
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:50,044
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes,

1564
01:56:50,211 --> 01:56:52,087
we shall fly
into the eye of this storm

1565
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,132
and cross into
Sicilian airspace

1566
01:56:55,299 --> 01:56:58,802
on August 20th, 1939.

1567
01:56:59,553 --> 01:57:01,388
We will head north
over friendly skies

1568
01:57:01,472 --> 01:57:03,098
with enough fuel
to reach Munich.

1569
01:57:04,391 --> 01:57:06,018
My quarry
will be waiting for me

1570
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,021
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz

1571
01:57:09,396 --> 01:57:11,607
for an update
on his V-1 rocket.

1572
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:22,576
What kind of Nazi
kills the Fuhrer?

1573
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,872
The kind that believes
in victory, Dr Jones.

1574
01:57:32,127 --> 01:57:35,965
Hitler lit a fire that could
have burned 1,000 years.

1575
01:57:36,131 --> 01:57:37,633
| saw every mistake.

1576
01:57:38,425 --> 01:57:39,718
Every blunder.

1577
01:57:39,885 --> 01:57:41,554
And | will correct them all.

1578
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:44,348
History is a long list
of losses, Dr Jones.

1579
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:46,642
It's just a question of whose.

1580
01:57:59,321 --> 01:58:00,614
Stop!

1581
01:59:13,312 --> 01:59:14,313
Teddy.

1582
01:59:16,148 --> 01:59:17,149
You think you can fly
one of those?

1583
01:59:19,151 --> 01:59:20,152
A Nord?

1584
01:59:22,863 --> 01:59:23,864
Sure.

1585
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:25,741
It's not a ringing response.

1586
01:59:25,908 --> 01:59:27,534
Well, | haven't flown a Nord.

1587
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:29,244
You've never flown any plane.

1588
01:59:30,454 --> 01:59:32,247
I'll get it started.

1589
01:59:32,414 --> 01:59:33,666
No, Teddy.

1590
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:35,834
Crap.

1591
01:59:50,474 --> 01:59:51,809
})

1592
01:59:54,728 --> 01:59:55,979
})

1593
02:00:03,237 --> 02:00:04,822
Fasten
your seat belt, Dr Jones.

1594
02:00:04,988 --> 02:00:06,281
There might be
some turbulence.

1595
02:00:07,533 --> 02:00:09,743
You're German, Voller.

1596
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:11,912
Don't try and be funny.

1597
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:37,146
Come on, big talker.

1598
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:52,953
Okay.

1599
02:01:09,803 --> 02:01:11,388
Okay. Okay.

1600
02:01:11,555 --> 02:01:14,099
Gauges green. Power full.

1601
02:01:14,767 --> 02:01:17,269
And when | reach 85, | rotate.

1602
02:01:55,015 --> 02:01:56,433
Okay, wings down.

1603
02:01:58,519 --> 02:02:00,521
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1604
02:02:00,979 --> 02:02:02,064
Rotate.

1605
02:02:29,508 --> 02:02:31,760
})

1606
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,174
Time to destination?

1607
02:03:12,384 --> 02:03:13,927
60 seconds.

1608
02:03:19,266 --> 02:03:20,726
Continental drift.

1609
02:03:24,146 --> 02:03:25,355
Continental drift!

1610
02:03:27,107 --> 02:03:29,693
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1611
02:03:30,527 --> 02:03:32,696
He couldn't have!

1612
02:03:32,779 --> 02:03:34,698
It hadn't been observed yet.

1613
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:37,492
You're off target.

1614
02:03:37,951 --> 02:03:39,828
Your coordinates
are based on markers

1615
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:43,790
that have been moving
for 2,000 years!

1616
02:03:43,957 --> 02:03:46,793
You could be off
by 10 degrees, by...

1617
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:03,936
30 seconds.

1618
02:04:05,103 --> 02:04:06,104
HerrVoller...

1619
02:04:06,188 --> 02:04:08,231
Your calculations are wrong!

1620
02:04:09,483 --> 02:04:11,234
- HerrVoller...
- { Will you shut up?

1621
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:12,319
I'm thinking!

1622
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,198
20 seconds.

1623
02:04:18,992 --> 02:04:20,077
Hold the flight path!

1624
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:23,372
15 seconds.

1625
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:28,961
| don't know
where we're going, Jurgen.

1626
02:04:29,044 --> 02:04:30,045
10 seconds.

1627
02:04:30,295 --> 02:04:30,879
Ol

1628
02:04:31,213 --> 02:04:32,756
But it sure as hell

1629
02:04:33,173 --> 02:04:34,633
-7!
-...ain't 1939!

1630
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,425
G!

1631
02:04:35,592 --> 02:04:36,385
Turn around!

1632
02:04:37,719 --> 02:04:38,428
Abort!

1633
02:04:38,929 --> 02:04:39,680
Turn around!

1634
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:41,306
ABORT!!!

1635
02:04:41,765 --> 02:04:43,725
We're being pulled in!

1636
02:04:53,735 --> 02:04:55,070
What are you doing?!

1637
02:04:55,278 --> 02:04:56,113
This is my plane!

1638
02:04:56,446 --> 02:04:57,781
You're flying my plane!

1639
02:05:22,597 --> 02:05:23,765
We're going to DIE!!!

1640
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:26,810
We need to pull up!

1641
02:05:48,665 --> 02:05:49,833
Restart engines!

1642
02:06:18,528 --> 02:06:19,696
That's Sicily.

1643
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,989
19309.

1644
02:06:22,741 --> 02:06:24,159
| did it.

1645
02:06:24,326 --> 02:06:25,827
| did it, Dr Jones!

1646
02:06:25,994 --> 02:06:27,704
Setting
coordinates for Munich.

1647
02:06:27,954 --> 02:06:29,581
})

1648
02:06:34,669 --> 02:06:36,713
Yesterday
belongs to us, Dr Jones.

1649
02:07:01,613 --> 02:07:03,782
Those are Roman triremes.

1650
02:07:32,018 --> 02:07:33,228
Keep it in the air!

1651
02:07:53,498 --> 02:07:54,082
Master...

1652
02:07:54,332 --> 02:07:56,751
The Romans are getting closer.

1653
02:07:58,503 --> 02:07:59,379
They have dragons!

1654
02:08:04,551 --> 02:08:05,927
Amazing.

1655
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:10,515
})

1656
02:08:12,601 --> 02:08:13,602
Whoa!

1657
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:15,896
Open the door!

1658
02:08:20,859 --> 02:08:21,860
What are you doing?

1659
02:08:22,819 --> 02:08:24,529
What are you doing,
you idiots?

1660
02:08:24,696 --> 02:08:26,489
They think we're a monster!

1661
02:08:27,032 --> 02:08:28,033
Aah!

1662
02:08:32,954 --> 02:08:34,456
You have
to turn around.

1663
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:36,541
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1664
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:39,002
214 BC.

1665
02:08:39,169 --> 02:08:40,378
You got the wrong war.

1666
02:08:44,132 --> 02:08:44,841
Master...

1667
02:08:48,386 --> 02:08:49,638
Don't ride out there, Master!

1668
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:51,431
The dragons!!

1669
02:09:01,691 --> 02:09:05,195
We must take down their dragons!

1670
02:09:12,202 --> 02:09:13,286
Boss!

1671
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:14,204
Change course!

1672
02:09:14,454 --> 02:09:15,830
The portal closes in minutes!

1673
02:09:16,248 --> 02:09:17,165
| have to go back!

1674
02:09:17,624 --> 02:09:18,750
| can't be here!

1675
02:09:18,959 --> 02:09:20,043
| CAN'T STAY HERE!

1676
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:21,670
The plane won't make it!!

1677
02:09:32,722 --> 02:09:35,350
})

1678
02:09:51,366 --> 02:09:52,367
Get out of the way!

1679
02:09:58,707 --> 02:10:00,834
How do you like that,
you savages?

1680
02:10:03,878 --> 02:10:06,631
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1681
02:10:16,683 --> 02:10:18,768
What are you doing here?

1682
02:10:18,935 --> 02:10:20,478
Rescuing you!

1683
02:10:31,114 --> 02:10:32,907
Get him off!

1684
02:10:34,284 --> 02:10:35,368
Indy!

1685
02:10:40,999 --> 02:10:42,208
Parachute!

1686
02:10:45,003 --> 02:10:46,171
| got a parachute!

1687
02:10:47,672 --> 02:10:49,090
Hang on!

1688
02:10:52,093 --> 02:10:53,178
Let go!

1689
02:10:55,513 --> 02:10:56,890
Give me the parachute!

1690
02:11:02,979 --> 02:11:05,106
Grab it. Hang on!

1691
02:11:06,649 --> 02:11:08,401
Indy!

1692
02:11:26,711 --> 02:11:28,171
})

1693
02:11:35,762 --> 02:11:37,222
We're losing altitude!

1694
02:11:38,473 --> 02:11:39,391
We're going down!

1695
02:11:41,309 --> 02:11:42,894
I've lost control!

1696
02:12:01,121 --> 02:12:03,581
Hey,
those are my friends.

1697
02:12:03,748 --> 02:12:05,792
Those are my friends.
We need to help them!

1698
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,545
Those are my friends!

1699
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:11,816
Eureka.

1700
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,001
He's trying to land.

1701
02:13:30,084 --> 02:13:32,045
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1702
02:13:32,795 --> 02:13:34,839
Get up. Yeah.

1703
02:13:35,006 --> 02:13:37,300
We need to get you
out of here. Okay.

1704
02:13:39,219 --> 02:13:40,512
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1705
02:13:41,387 --> 02:13:42,639
Sit up. You need to help me.

1706
02:13:42,805 --> 02:13:44,682
| know it hurts,
but we gotta get you back.

1707
02:13:44,849 --> 02:13:47,560
This is incredible, Wombat.

1708
02:13:48,102 --> 02:13:50,063
Incredible.

1709
02:13:51,606 --> 02:13:53,316
Yeah, it very well is.

1710
02:13:53,483 --> 02:13:55,068
But we have to
get you out of here.

1711
02:13:57,195 --> 02:13:58,321
My God.

1712
02:13:59,989 --> 02:14:01,866
We're witnessing history.

1713
02:14:08,957 --> 02:14:10,750
Reverse these numbers.

1714
02:14:10,917 --> 02:14:12,001
They'll get you home.

1715
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:14,671
What?

1716
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:18,800
I'm going to stay.

1717
02:14:19,551 --> 02:14:21,553
No. You're not serious.

1718
02:14:24,389 --> 02:14:25,431
Wow, you are serious.

1719
02:14:29,519 --> 02:14:31,145
Indy, you've been shot.

1720
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:32,230
You're bleeding.

1721
02:14:32,605 --> 02:14:34,148
You can't stay here.

1722
02:14:34,232 --> 02:14:35,233
Yes, | can.

1723
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:36,943
But for what? For...

1724
02:14:37,026 --> 02:14:40,572
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1725
02:14:41,614 --> 02:14:43,741
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1726
02:14:44,826 --> 02:14:46,661
Studied it.

1727
02:14:46,828 --> 02:14:48,871
-All my life.
-Yeah.

1728
02:14:49,038 --> 02:14:52,041
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1729
02:14:52,125 --> 02:14:53,126
And die.

1730
02:14:53,876 --> 02:14:55,503
Please, get up.

1731
02:14:57,255 --> 02:14:58,423
Helena!

1732
02:14:58,756 --> 02:14:59,757
| did it!

1733
02:14:59,924 --> 02:15:02,260
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1734
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:04,053
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.
Get up.

1735
02:15:04,137 --> 02:15:05,597
| need to get you
into that plane, okay?

1736
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,681
-We need to.
-No. No.

1737
02:15:06,848 --> 02:15:09,183
Get up. You can... We can!

1738
02:15:21,654 --> 02:15:22,280
Master!

1739
02:15:25,158 --> 02:15:26,951
We have to leave, Master.

1740
02:15:28,578 --> 02:15:29,579
It's him.

1741
02:15:38,546 --> 02:15:40,590
He's asking
how far we've come.

1742
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,763
Two thousand years.

1743
02:15:47,388 --> 02:15:48,556
We've come...

1744
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:52,143
two thousand years.

1745
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:57,607
But we didn't expect to meet...

1746
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:00,652
the great...

1747
02:16:01,194 --> 02:16:03,237
Archimedes.

1748
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:09,827
You...

1749
02:16:11,037 --> 02:16:12,372
were always...

1750
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:14,290
going to...

1751
02:16:14,874 --> 02:16:16,459
meet me.

1752
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:19,045
That dial
is a forced deck.

1753
02:16:19,128 --> 02:16:20,588
It doesn't take us
anywhere but here.

1754
02:16:20,755 --> 02:16:22,048
He built it to get help.

1755
02:16:22,215 --> 02:16:24,759
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy,

1756
02:16:24,842 --> 02:16:25,843
so | think
we've helped enough.

1757
02:16:26,052 --> 02:16:27,679
Apologies, Archimedes.

1758
02:16:27,887 --> 02:16:29,222
I'm a fan...

1759
02:16:29,472 --> 02:16:31,057
-but we need to leave. He's hurt.
-Helena.

1760
02:16:32,809 --> 02:16:33,810
He can't
keep that, by the way.

1761
02:16:33,893 --> 02:16:34,894
He needs to build his own one.

1762
02:16:34,977 --> 02:16:36,646
Helena, we need to go!

1763
02:16:37,105 --> 02:16:39,232
Indy, the window is closing!

1764
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:40,525
We cannot get stuck here!

1765
02:16:42,026 --> 02:16:42,652
| want...

1766
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:43,945
to stay...

1767
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,072
with you.

1768
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:48,199
No, no, no!
Do not say yes!

1769
02:16:48,783 --> 02:16:51,035
You are a brilliant man...

1770
02:16:51,285 --> 02:16:53,287
a wise man...

1771
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:55,081
a genius...

1772
02:16:55,164 --> 02:16:56,165
Helena...

1773
02:16:56,332 --> 02:16:58,668
a hero to your people.

1774
02:16:59,377 --> 02:17:02,922
But he can't help you.

1775
02:17:04,006 --> 02:17:05,258
This is your time.

1776
02:17:05,341 --> 02:17:06,676
This is your time.

1777
02:17:06,759 --> 02:17:08,720
He must be in his own time

1778
02:17:08,803 --> 02:17:10,054
He needs to be in his.

1779
02:17:10,138 --> 02:17:12,432
His work is not done.
He needs to go home.

1780
02:17:12,515 --> 02:17:14,183
There is medicine at home.

1781
02:17:14,267 --> 02:17:16,144
He cannot die here. He can't.

1782
02:17:17,812 --> 02:17:20,648
Helena, get on the plane.

1783
02:17:23,234 --> 02:17:24,318
I'll be all right.

1784
02:17:26,154 --> 02:17:27,488
No, you won't.

1785
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:32,201
| need to do this.

1786
02:17:33,286 --> 02:17:34,287
Me too.

1787
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,801
Good morning.

1788
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:36,057
How's the shoulder?

1789
02:18:38,726 --> 02:18:41,229
Better than my jaw.

1790
02:18:44,857 --> 02:18:45,858
Right.

1791
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:49,362
You should've
let me stay.

1792
02:18:50,238 --> 02:18:51,447
| couldn't do that.

1793
02:19:00,456 --> 02:19:01,457
Why not?

1794
02:19:03,334 --> 02:19:05,878
Well, for starters, you'd have
changed the course of history.

1795
02:19:10,216 --> 02:19:12,009
That's supposed to be
a bad thing?

1796
02:19:16,138 --> 02:19:17,932
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1797
02:19:21,727 --> 02:19:22,728
Here.

1798
02:19:27,859 --> 02:19:28,985
For who?

1799
02:19:56,304 --> 02:19:57,889
Marion.

1800
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:00,182
Hey.

1801
02:20:19,452 --> 02:20:20,453
Teddy.

1802
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:23,080
Marion.

1803
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:26,792
What are you doing?

1804
02:20:28,336 --> 02:20:29,503
Putting groceries away.

1805
02:20:31,797 --> 02:20:34,508
There wasn't a scrap of food
in this place.

1806
02:20:35,426 --> 02:20:37,428
No. Really.

1807
02:20:42,224 --> 02:20:44,435
Someone told me you were back.

1808
02:20:51,901 --> 02:20:53,527
Are you back, Indy?

1809
02:20:55,154 --> 02:20:56,864
It was explosives,

1810
02:20:57,031 --> 02:20:59,158
and Indy was running,
Marion was running,

1811
02:20:59,325 --> 02:21:01,994
and suddenly
the plane exploded.

1812
02:21:05,706 --> 02:21:07,750
Indy, you're up and about.

1813
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:10,336
Yes, | am.

1814
02:21:11,462 --> 02:21:12,463
Yes.

1815
02:21:13,089 --> 02:21:15,132
Why don't we go
and get some ice cream, kids?

1816
02:21:15,299 --> 02:21:16,634
But Marion
just bought some.

1817
02:21:16,717 --> 02:21:17,802
Oh,
