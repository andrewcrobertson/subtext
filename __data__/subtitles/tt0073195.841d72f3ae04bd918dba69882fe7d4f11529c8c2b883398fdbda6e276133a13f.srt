1
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,149
- What's your name again?
- Chrissy.

2
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,111
- Where are we goin'?
- Swimming.

3
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,619
Slow up. Slow down some.

4
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,165
I'm not drunk. Slow down.

5
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,419
Wait. I'm coming.

6
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,090
I'm coming.

7
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,927
I'm definitely coming.

8
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,971
Hold on.

9
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,944
I can swim.

10
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,699
I just can't walk or undress myself.

11
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,934
Come on in the water.

12
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,062
Take it easy. Take it easy.

13
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,413
Help me!

14
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,916
I'm coming. I'm coming.

15
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,088
It hurts!

16
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
Oh, my God!

17
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,153
Please help!

18
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,778
How come the sun didn't
use to shine in here?

19
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,495
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

20
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,128
Somebody feed the dogs.

21
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,672
Right.

22
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,471
Do you see the kids?

23
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,773
They must be in the backyard.

24
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,442
In Amity you say "yard."

25
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,449
They're in the "yard",
not too "far" from the "car."

26
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,955
- How's that?
- Like you're from New York.

27
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,170
Mom, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.

28
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,382
You were playin' on those swings,
weren't you?

29
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:50,428
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.

30
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,597
I think you're gonna live.

31
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,059
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

32
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,269
- Yes.
- Can I go swimmin'?

33
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,189
Let me clean this thing off first.

34
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,235
What do they usually do?
Wash up or float up? Or what?

35
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,619
Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...

36
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:22,544
...15, 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off. Go on, get a Band-Aid.

37
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,381
Got to go. Missing person.

38
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,926
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

39
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,641
Listen, Chief...

40
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,353
...be careful, will ya?
- In this town?

41
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,063
Hi, Dad.

42
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,983
Wait a minute. Let me get on.

43
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,820
- I want my cup back!
- You'll get it.

44
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,742
Wave goodbye. Bye.

45
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,656
Nobody saw her go into the water?

46
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,702
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

47
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,332
- You mean, she ran out on you?
- No, sir.

48
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,379
She must've drowned.

49
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,132
Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?

50
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,302
- You live here?
- No. Hartford.

51
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,181
I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.

52
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,518
- Your folks were born here, right?
- I'm an Islander.

53
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,270
They moved off when my dad retired.

54
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,981
- You an Islander?
- No. New York City.

55
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,275
You here for the summer?

56
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,277
Come on.

57
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,920
Hold it.

58
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,563
Oh, Jesus.

59
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:22,307
You're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

60
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:30,190
- Chief, what have you got on?
- Lf this new filing system is to work...

61
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,486
...you must keep that old stuff
off my desk. Just the pending.

62
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,531
Yes, Chief. We got a bunch
of calls about the Karate school.

63
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,827
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been...

64
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,081
...karate-ing the picket fences.

65
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,002
Chief Brody's office.
The Medical Inspector.

66
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,105
The Fire Chief wants you to go over...

67
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,234
I want a list of the water activities
that the city fathers...

68
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,277
...are planning for today.

69
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,779
Hendricks!

70
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,782
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

71
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,450
We never had any.

72
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,830
There's a truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

73
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,460
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

74
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,159
Look what the kids did to my fence.
Eight and nine-year-olds...

75
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,369
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.

76
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,458
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

77
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,134
This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.

78
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,304
The summer ginks come
down here in June.

79
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,016
You haven't got one thing
on here I ordered.

80
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:33,104
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

81
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,940
If I can't get service...

82
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,411
Polly sent me to tell you
that there's a bunch...

83
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:53,208
...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay,
doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.

84
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,544
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

85
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,838
Come on, get out of there.

86
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,634
Take this stuff back to the office
and work on those signs.

87
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,930
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

88
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,932
Let Polly do the printing.

89
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,144
- What's the matter with my printing?
- Let Polly do the printing.

90
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,689
Chief Brody!

91
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,736
What have you got there?

92
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,365
We had a shark attack at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

93
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,076
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

94
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,579
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

95
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,050
Charlie, take me out to those kids, will ya?

96
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,625
You're gonna shut down
the beaches on your own authority?

97
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,629
- What other authority do I need?
- You need a civic ordinance...

98
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,592
...or a resolution by the board.
- That's going by the book.

99
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,638
We're really a little anxious that you're
rushing into something serious here.

100
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,433
This is your first summer, you know.

101
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,477
What does that mean?

102
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:40,815
I'm only trying to say
that Amity is a summer town.

103
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,568
We need summer dollars.

104
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:49,449
If they can't swim here, they'll be glad
to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...

105
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,618
...the Hamptons, Long Island.

106
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,412
That doesn't mean we serve
them a smorgasbord.

107
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,124
But we've never had
that kind of trouble in these waters.

108
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,796
What else could've done that?
A boat propeller?

109
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,424
I think possibly yes, a boating accident.

110
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,219
That's not what you told me
over the phone.

111
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:13,348
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.

112
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,935
- And you'll stand by that?
- I'll stand by that.

113
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,441
A summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

114
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,779
- She tires, fishing boat comes along...
- It's happened before.

115
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:32,325
I don't think you appreciate
the reaction people have to these things.

116
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,287
I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

117
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,041
It's all psychological.

118
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,921
You yell "Barracuda!"
and everybody says, "What?"

119
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,426
You yell, "Shark!"...

120
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,223
...we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

121
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,562
Okay. You can take us back now.

122
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,664
I'm gonna get my raft
and go back out in the water.

123
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,958
Let me see your fingers.

124
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,673
- Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune.
- Just let me go out a little longer.

125
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,843
- Just 10 more minutes.
- Thanks.

126
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,062
All I want to know...

127
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:46,858
I just want to know one simple thing:
When do I get to become an Islander?

128
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,569
Ellen, never. Never.

129
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,281
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

130
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,690
Don't bother him. Come right back.

131
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,071
I know you got
a lot of problems downtown...

132
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,242
...but I've got a couple of problems
I wish you'd take care of.

133
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:24,956
One, I've got some cats parking
in front of the house, I can't get...

134
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,173
What I need is a red zone.
It's simple, you could take care of it.

135
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,092
Would you come here a minute, please?

136
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,433
Are you okay?

137
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,102
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

138
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:50,231
Look, if the kids goin'
in the water is worrying you...

139
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,735
...they can play out here on the beach.

140
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,029
It's all right. Let them go.

141
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,793
It's cold.

142
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:17,509
We know all about you, Chief.
You don't go in the water at all, do you?

143
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,720
That's some bad hat, Harry.

144
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,522
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

145
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,819
Come on. That's it.

146
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,504
Tippet! Tippet!

147
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,085
Did you see that?

148
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,098
Blood!

149
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,731
Everybody out!

150
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,153
Get them out!

151
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,247
Michael, get out of the water!

152
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,682
Alex!

153
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,209
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

154
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,671
I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.

155
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,634
I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
This is turning into a contest.

156
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,431
It's not just the <i>Gazette</i>.
She's advertising in out of town papers.

157
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:14,769
I suggest we move to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

158
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm responsible for public safety here.

159
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:21,067
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

160
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,904
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

161
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,825
The ad is gonna run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

162
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,162
Right in here, please.

163
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,291
Move on in, please.

164
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,519
Why do you insist on playing the heavy?

165
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:01,399
I have a point of view and it speaks
for many of the people here.

166
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:09,866
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

167
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,327
Let's have some order.

168
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,374
Let's have some order, please.

169
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,752
Any special questions?

170
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:26,466
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

171
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:32,847
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.

172
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,933
All right, all right.

173
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:40,772
That's private business between
you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

174
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,735
Martin, would you please...

175
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,613
Chief Brody.

176
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:55,120
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

177
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,414
What about the beaches, Chief?

178
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:02,335
We're gonna put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

179
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,798
And then we're gonna try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

180
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,260
Are you going to close the beaches?

181
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,349
Yes, we are.

182
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:24,024
We're also bringing in some experts
from the Oceanographic Institute.

183
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,861
Only 24 hours.

184
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,989
I didn't agree to that.

185
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,909
Only 24 hours.

186
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:39,122
24 hours is like three weeks.

187
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,739
You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.

188
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:19,871
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.

189
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:26,044
Not like goin' down to the pond
and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.

190
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,674
This shark, swallow you whole.

191
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:37,389
Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.

192
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,684
And we got to do it quick.

193
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:46,022
Got to bring back the tourists that'll put
your businesses on a payin' basis.

194
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:50,235
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

195
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:54,364
I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.

196
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:01,162
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

197
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,624
You got to make up your minds.

198
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,585
Gonna stay alive and ante up...

199
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,881
...gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

200
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,970
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

201
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:20,265
There's too many captains on this island.

202
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,686
$10,000, for me, by myself.

203
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:30,900
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

204
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,867
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

205
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:44,205
We'll take it under advisement.

206
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:51,713
Mr. Mayor, Chief...

207
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,217
...ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:41,012
Oh, God, you scared me.

209
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,814
People don't even know
how old sharks are.

210
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:55,193
If they live 2,000,
3,000 years they don't know.

211
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,781
Enough. You're not going to be able
to go to sleep tonight.

212
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,534
Here. Come on.

213
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,870
Thanks.

214
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,759
Want to get drunk and fool around?

215
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,845
Oh, yeah.

216
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,769
Mikey really loves his present.

217
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,897
Where is he?

218
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,275
Sitting in it.

219
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,280
Good God.

220
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,121
All right, Michael, out of the boat.

221
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:53,084
Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.

222
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,628
I'm helpin' Michael.

223
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,089
- Get out of that boat.
- Hi, Dad.

224
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,508
Just a little longer. Please?

225
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:04,262
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- I don't want him on the ocean!

226
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,808
He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.
He's not gonna go in the water.

227
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:14,397
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

228
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,026
Now don't say that.

229
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,364
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

230
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,994
I want him to read the boating regulations,
the rules...

231
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,789
...before he goes out on his own.

232
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:36,461
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

233
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:51,101
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

234
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,815
The chief lives on the other side
of the island.

235
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,818
Am I comin' in straight?

236
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,779
Just keep rowin'.

237
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:17,669
We better catch something,
this is my wife's holiday roast.

238
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:22,340
Don't worry about it.
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.

239
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:36,438
Come and get it.

240
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,861
The tide's takin' it right out.

241
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,742
Can't we go home?

242
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,903
He's takin' it.

243
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,615
Go, go, go.

244
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:52,741
Charlie, take my word for it.
Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.

245
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:02,083
Come on, Charlie, swim to me!
Keep comin'.

246
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,968
- I can't get up.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

247
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:19,225
- Help me!
- Get your feet out of the water!

248
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,286
Can we go home now?

249
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:54,094
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there tryin' to catch their breath...

250
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,724
...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife
what happened to her freezer full of meat.

251
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,061
That's not funny. That's not funny at all.

252
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,564
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in <i>Field and Stream</i>.

253
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,651
Looks more like <i>The National Enquirer</i>.

254
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:16,408
All right, hold it, hold it.
Hold everything. I said, hold it!

255
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:28,628
- Hello.
- Hello, back, young feller. How are you?

256
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:33,717
Say, I hope you're not goin' out
with those nuts, are you?

257
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,307
The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.

258
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,020
You have to move out,
or he can't get out at all.

259
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:51,359
Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it.
You got a paddle on the boat?

260
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,196
Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.

261
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,577
How many guys are you gonna put
in that boat?

262
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,454
Whatever's safe, right?

263
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,708
- Yeah, well that ain't safe.
- Watch it, that's dynamite.

264
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,714
- Where are you goin' with that?
- I'm goin' on the boat.

265
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,885
- Help me get those guys out of the boat.
- Sure.

266
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:24,601
Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you
that you're overloading that boat.

267
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,312
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:31,232
- You ain't going. What do you care?
- Can you tell me...

269
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,235
...if there's a good restaurant
or hotel here?

270
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,863
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

271
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,033
They're all gonna die.

272
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:45,205
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

273
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,999
You've got to get somebody to help us.

274
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:51,711
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.

275
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:56,049
Because we've got more people
down here than we can handle.

276
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:59,969
What are you doing?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

277
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,305
They aren't mine. They're from all over.

278
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,352
You see the plates in the parking lot?
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...

279
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:11,564
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help?

280
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,651
That's not until the Fourth of July.

281
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:18,113
You know those guys
in that fan-tail launch out there?

282
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:21,116
None of them will get
out of the harbor alive.

283
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:25,704
That's what I'm saying. You know
their names. Talk to those clowns.

284
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:31,084
- Everyone seems to be having a good time.
- Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.

285
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:34,379
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

286
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:35,755
Who are you?

287
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,592
Matt Hooper.
I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.

288
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:44,139
For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody.

289
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,766
- I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.

290
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:50,437
I know you got a lot
on your hands right now, but...

291
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,858
The best thing for me to do is
to see the remains of the first victim.

292
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,735
The girl on the beach.

293
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:59,904
- Just bear with me, will ya?
- Sure.

294
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:05,535
Wait'll we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

295
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,412
There'll be some fun.

296
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:10,957
They'll wish their fathers
had never met their mothers...

297
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:15,503
...when they start diggin' the bottoms out
and slammin' into them rocks.

298
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:19,049
Get away from there, you goddamn fool!

299
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,134
What's the matter with you?

300
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,262
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

301
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,016
What are these guys doin' out here?

302
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,104
- What are they doin' back there?
- They're chummin' right now.

303
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,358
- What is that?
- They're tracking the shark now.

304
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:40,403
$3,000 divided four ways is what?

305
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:54,084
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

306
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,676
Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian.

307
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:07,138
- And here's the way we have it.
- Probable boating accident.

308
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:20,902
The height and weight of the victim can
only be estimated from the partial remains.

309
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,245
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

310
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,332
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?

311
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:40,130
The right arm has been severed
above the elbow with massive tissue loss...

312
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,924
...in the upper musculature.

313
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:45,885
Thank you, very much.

314
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:53,184
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

315
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:59,190
- Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
- No. It was only local jurisdiction.

316
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:10,160
The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum
and portions of the rib cage are intact.

317
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:13,371
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

318
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,667
This is what happens.

319
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:25,050
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>, possibly <i>longimanus</i>...

320
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,552
...or <i>isurus glaucus</i>.

321
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:33,183
The amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis...

322
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:37,062
...however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be larger...

323
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,566
...than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

324
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,569
Didn't you get a boat
and check these waters?

325
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,697
This is not a boat accident.

326
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:52,869
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

327
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,789
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

328
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:01,544
It was a shark.

329
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,152
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I wanna get on the state wire services.

330
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,947
See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.

331
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:33,034
Call Dave Axelrod in New York
and tell him he owes me a favor.

332
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,038
This is the shot I want
with everybody and the fish in it.

333
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:40,458
Guys, could we please get organized?

334
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,503
I want to get a picture for the paper.

335
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:49,718
- Ben Gardner get this?
- No, no. We caught it.

336
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:56,182
- That's swell.
- It's a beauty, eh?

337
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,604
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way, please.

338
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,358
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

339
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:08,361
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

340
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:14,576
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign please?

341
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:29,674
Young fella,
could you step out of the picture?

342
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,013
We're ready.

343
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:40,143
- Can you get that, please.
- How's that?

344
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:50,403
Larry, you won't believe it.

345
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:53,865
- What kind of a shark is that?
- I don't know.

346
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:58,036
- I think it's a mako.
- It's got a deep throat, Frank.

347
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,123
- Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?
- Tiger shark.

348
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,585
A what?

349
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,545
We can start breathing again.

350
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,007
- Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
- You bet he is.

351
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,885
What is this bite radius crap?

352
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:21,017
You stuff your friggin' head in there man,
and find out if it's a man-eater.

353
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,859
All I'm saying,
is that it may not be the shark.

354
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:35,407
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.

355
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,286
- Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- Nice to meet you.

356
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,835
There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.

357
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:49,713
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...

358
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,383
And the chances that these bozos got
the exact shark...

359
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:58,221
- There are no other sharks like this here.
- It's 100 to 1.

360
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:04,019
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

361
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:08,023
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

362
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:11,943
The fact is,
the bite radius on this animal is different...

363
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,487
...than the wounds on the victim.

364
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:19,617
I want to be sure. You want to be sure.

365
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:23,788
We all want to be sure. Okay?
What I want to do is very simple.

366
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:27,417
The digestive system
of this animal is very, very slow.

367
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:31,546
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...

368
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:35,717
...is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.

369
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:46,102
It may be the only way to confirm it.

370
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,105
Look, fellas let's be reasonable.

371
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:52,359
This is not the time or the place...

372
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:56,821
...to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

373
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:02,660
I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open...

374
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:07,457
...and see that little Kintner boy spill out
all over the dock.

375
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:39,948
I just found out...

376
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:45,495
...that a girl got killed here last week.

377
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,374
And you knew it.

378
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,586
You knew there was a shark out there.

379
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:59,050
You knew it was dangerous.

380
00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:03,138
But you let people go swimming anyway.

381
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,645
You knew all those things...

382
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,153
...but still my boy is dead now.

383
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:26,870
And there's nothing you can do about it.

384
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:36,421
My boy is dead.

385
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:45,805
I wanted you to know that.

386
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:05,658
I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.

387
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,829
No, she's not.

388
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,088
All right, fellas...

389
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:22,926
...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down
before it stinks up the island.

390
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:27,722
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

391
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,147
Come here.

392
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,362
Give us a kiss.

393
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:07,280
Why?

394
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,243
Because I need it.

395
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,709
Get out of here.

396
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:26,800
The door was open.
Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.

397
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,760
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

398
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:32,681
Your husband's home?
I'd really like to talk to him.

399
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:34,724
Yes, so would I.

400
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,521
Can I get you some coffee?

401
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:42,899
Wine. How nice.

402
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:08,341
How was your day?

403
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,475
Swell.

404
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,983
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

405
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,818
That's nice.

406
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,613
Is anyone eating this?

407
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,754
My husband tells me you're in sharks.

408
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:55,013
Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it
quite put that way. But yes, I am.

409
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,432
I love sharks.

410
00:50:57,557 --> 00:51:00,435
- You love sharks?
- Yeah, I love them.

411
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:05,940
When I was 12 years old, my father got me
a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

412
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,777
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...

413
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,530
...I hooked a four and a half foot
baby thresher shark...

414
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:15,325
...who proceeded to eat my boat.

415
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:20,497
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

416
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:24,626
He turned an inboard into an outboard.
Scared me to death...

417
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,961
...and I swam back to shore.

418
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,047
When I was on the beach...

419
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:32,634
...I turned around and I saw my boat
being taken apart.

420
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:36,054
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks...

421
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:40,225
...and that's why I'm gonna go
to the Institute tomorrow...

422
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:44,187
...and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

423
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,441
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- I'm sorry, I thought that...

424
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,777
You told me the shark was caught.

425
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:54,197
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

426
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,367
They caught a shark, not the shark.

427
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:01,204
Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.

428
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,916
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

429
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:08,253
Which I wanted to prove
by cutting the shark open...

430
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,464
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

431
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:40,326
You'll be the only rational man
left on this island after I leave tomorrow.

432
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,370
Where are you going?

433
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,207
I am going on the Aurora.

434
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:52,422
- The Aurora? What is that?
- It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.

435
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:55,008
Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.

436
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,137
Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.

437
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:04,768
Martin sits in his car when we go
on the ferry to the mainland.

438
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:10,190
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?

439
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,816
Drowning.

440
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:18,448
Is it true that most people get attacked
by sharks in three feet of water...

441
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,284
...about 10 feet from the beach?

442
00:53:23,536 --> 00:53:27,248
And before people started
to swim for recreation...

443
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:31,086
...I mean before sharks knew
what they were missing...

444
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,756
...that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

445
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:38,134
That's right.

446
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:43,723
Now this shark that swims alone,
what's it called?

447
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:46,226
- Rogue.
- Rogue, yeah.

448
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,145
Now, this guy...

449
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:53,566
...he keeps swimmin' around in a place
where the feeding is good...

450
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:58,113
...until the food supply is gone. Right?
- That's called territoriality.

451
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:02,367
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

452
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:10,917
Then why don't we have one more drink
and go down and cut that shark open?

453
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,422
Can you do that?

454
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:23,304
I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.

455
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:34,482
We start in the alimentary canal...

456
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:39,446
...open the digestive tract.

457
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,195
- Just like I thought.
- What?

458
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:25,283
Came up from the Gulf Stream
from southern waters.

459
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,167
He didn't eat a car, did he?

460
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:38,672
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

461
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:42,008
Somebody probably threw that in the river.

462
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,976
That's it.

463
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,982
I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.

464
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,153
You got a bigger problem than that.

465
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:05,407
You still got a hell of a fish out there...

466
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:08,076
...with a mouth about this big.

467
00:56:13,915 --> 00:56:16,626
How do we confirm that by morning?

468
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,298
If he is a rogue, and there's any truth
to territoriality at all...

469
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:26,636
...we could spot him
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

470
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:30,223
- Where're you going?
- To find him. He's a night feeder.

471
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:33,476
- On the water!
- We're not gonna find him on the land.

472
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:35,729
I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.

473
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,148
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

474
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:40,608
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

475
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:55,957
I'm tellin' you,
the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.

476
00:56:56,875 --> 00:57:01,504
There's so many problems, you never feel
like you're accomplishing anything.

477
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:04,716
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

478
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:09,679
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.

479
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:13,099
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

480
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:19,230
In 25 years, there's never been a shooting
or a murder in this town.

481
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:23,485
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

482
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:25,904
Where are we?

483
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:29,783
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

484
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:35,205
Can you get the Late Show on this thing?

485
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,585
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore and aft.

486
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:45,465
Who pays for all this stuff?
The Government? The Institute?

487
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,134
This stuff cost a lot of money.

488
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,391
- I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
- You're kidding.

489
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:57,977
- You rich?
- Yeah.

490
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,730
How much?

491
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:03,441
Personally or the whole family?

492
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:09,698
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

493
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:17,539
It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates
the water to live on an island, either.

494
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:21,501
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

495
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:24,170
That makes a lot of sense.

496
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:33,805
What is that thing doing?

497
00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:38,685
It's a fish finder.

498
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:44,065
It's probably just a school of mackerel
or something, all clumped together.

499
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,028
Wait a minute.

500
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,746
- There's somethin' else out there.
- What is it?

501
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:01,916
About 100 yards, south, southwest.

502
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:48,630
- That's Ben Gardner's boat.
- You know him?

503
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:52,676
It's all banged up. Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

504
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,805
What happened?

505
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:07,774
I got to go down there and check their hull.

506
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,402
Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?

507
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:13,863
We will. I just got to check something out.

508
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,157
Keep the lights going.

509
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:48,690
Let's tow it in.

510
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:52,068
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's gonna happen.

511
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:01,244
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

512
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:06,666
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.

513
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:12,005
I'll be back in two minutes.

514
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:03,825
This is a great white. A big one.

515
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:08,705
Any shark expert in the world
will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.

516
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,294
A great white shark has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

517
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:18,340
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

518
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:22,260
There's no limit to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.

519
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:25,138
Two people killed in a week.
It'll happen again.

520
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:27,724
It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.

521
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:30,393
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

522
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:32,312
Tell him about the swimmers.

523
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:36,524
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity...

524
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:40,153
...that occurs whenever people swim.
You can't avoid it.

525
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:43,073
If you open the beaches
on the Fourth of July...

526
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:46,618
...it's like ringing the dinner bell,
for Christ sakes.

527
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:51,831
I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass,
out of a boat out there.

528
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:54,167
It was the tooth of a great white.

529
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:59,089
It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.
I helped tow it. You should've seen it.

530
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:03,259
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

531
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:04,844
I didn't see it.

532
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:08,306
- He dropped it on the way in.
- I had an accident.

533
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,893
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

534
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:17,691
It's a <i>carcharodon carcharias</i>.
It's a great white.

535
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:20,235
You don't have the tooth?

536
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,198
We depend on the summer people
for our lives...

537
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:29,411
You are not gonna have a summer
unless you deal with this problem.

538
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:33,832
We have to close the beaches,
and hire somebody to kill the shark!

539
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,709
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

540
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:39,421
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

541
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:42,507
You'll have to ring this entire harbor.

542
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:47,095
I don't think either one of you
are familiar with our problems.

543
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:51,266
I know that you are going to ignore...

544
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:55,520
...this problem until it swims up
and bites you on the ass!

545
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:59,566
Wait a second.
There are two ways to deal with this.

546
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:03,945
You're either gonna kill this animal,
or cut off it's food supply.

547
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,281
We have to close the beaches.

548
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,326
Sick vandalism.

549
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:15,582
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

550
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:20,003
I want those little paint-happy
bastards caught...

551
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:24,049
...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.
- That's it. Goodbye.

552
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:29,179
I won't waste my time arguing with a man
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

553
01:05:29,262 --> 01:05:30,972
Don't do this.

554
01:05:40,523 --> 01:05:46,363
What we are dealing with here,
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.

555
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:52,994
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does is swim...

556
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:57,374
...and eat, and make little sharks.
And that's all.

557
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:02,003
Now, why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign.

558
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:05,674
- Those proportions are correct.
- You'd love to prove that.

559
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,927
Get your name
into the <i>National Geographic</i>.

560
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:28,446
Larry, if we make an effort today,
we might be able to save August.

561
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:33,493
August? For Christ sake,
tomorrow's the Fourth of July.

562
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:35,829
And we will be open for business.

563
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:38,707
This will be the best summer
we've ever had.

564
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:43,753
If you are concerned about the beaches
do what you have to, to make them safe.

565
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:47,424
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

566
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,122
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

567
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:21,833
I don't need to come to Brisbane...

568
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:24,794
...when I have a great white shark
right here.

569
01:07:25,503 --> 01:07:28,173
<i>We need men to patrol the swimming area. 

570
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:31,926
<i>We've got to have help. </i>
<i>Anybody with a gun or a boat. 

571
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,236
Monday!

572
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:57,744
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy with a crew cut.

573
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:23,770
Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?
Could you connect me, please?

574
01:08:42,914 --> 01:08:45,542
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

575
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:51,089
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

576
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,883
All right. I'll get to them later.

577
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:01,307
Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.

578
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:12,027
Brody to Daisy, do you read me?

579
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:16,406
<i>Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me? </i>
<i>Come in, Hooper. What do you see? 

580
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,659
Nothing, here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

581
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:25,081
Amity Island has long been known
for it's clean air, clear water...

582
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:28,043
...beautiful white sand beaches.

583
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,045
But in recent days...

584
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:34,674
...a cloud has appeared on the horizon
of this beautiful resort community.

585
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:38,219
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

586
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:19,552
- Hi, Larry.
- Why aren't you in the water?

587
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:26,601
I just put some sun tan lotion on,
and I'm trying to absorb some...

588
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:29,229
Nobody's going in.

589
01:10:30,271 --> 01:10:32,899
Please, get in the water.

590
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:51,895
Do me a favor, will you?

591
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,775
You and the other guys take the boat
and put it in the pond instead.

592
01:11:57,692 --> 01:11:59,569
The pond's for old ladies.

593
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:04,157
I know it's for the old ladies,
but just do it for the old man.

594
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,995
- All right.
- Thanks.

595
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:27,097
I've got Sean.

596
01:12:36,564 --> 01:12:38,400
Michael, wait!

597
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:41,945
Michael, I don't like you no more.

598
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,271
Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.

599
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:19,149
Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

600
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:28,867
False alarm. Must be this glare.

601
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:46,551
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have...

602
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:52,640
...caught and killed a large predator
that supposedly injured some bathers.

603
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,101
As you see, it's a beautiful day.

604
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:59,272
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

605
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:02,567
"Amity," as you know, means "friendship."

606
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:21,252
My God!

607
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:37,268
Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!

608
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,529
<i>Martin, get them the hell out of the water. 

609
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:55,662
No whistles! No whistles!

610
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:00,667
<i>Everybody please, get out of the water. </i>
<i>Everybody out of the water. 

611
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:27,420
<i>Give an answer, please. </i>
<i>What's going on out there? 

612
01:16:32,425 --> 01:16:36,137
He made me do it. He talked me into it.

613
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:41,726
Please, please, move back.
Please. Give these people some air.

614
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:49,776
Martin it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

615
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:53,863
Everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

616
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:05,875
Shark! A shark!

617
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:12,674
- It's going into the pond! Shark in estuary!
- Now what?

618
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,802
Michael's in the pond.

619
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:22,475
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

620
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:41,911
- Hurry up. Get that done.
- I can't do a damn thing.

621
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,756
Haul in your sheet. Make it fast.

622
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:01,014
You guys okay over there?

623
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,891
In the pond!

624
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:59,656
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

625
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:32,689
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not. He's in shock.

626
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:15,857
Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.

627
01:20:19,402 --> 01:20:22,072
- How's my big kid?
- I'm all right.

628
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:25,492
You gonna miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

629
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:28,787
- Want anything from home?
- My cars.

630
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,373
- What about ice cream?
- Coffee.

631
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:48,973
Want to take him home?

632
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,728
Like to New York?

633
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:56,773
No. Home, here.

634
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:23,341
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

635
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:26,678
You got a pen, Larry?

636
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,597
Yeah, pen, you know.

637
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,730
'Cause you're gonna do what you do best.

638
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,859
You're gonna sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

639
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:46,239
- I don't know if I can do that without...
- I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.

640
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,367
- August?
- What?

641
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:52,579
What are you talkin' about?

642
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:55,540
Summer's over.
You're the Mayor of Shark City.

643
01:21:55,665 --> 01:21:58,752
These people think
you want the beaches open.

644
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:02,714
I was acting in the town's best interest.

645
01:22:02,839 --> 01:22:05,300
You were acting
in the town's best interest.

646
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,969
That's why you're gonna do the right thing.

647
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:13,558
That's why you're gonna sign this, and
we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.

648
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:22,067
My kids were on that beach, too.

649
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:37,207
Sign it, Larry.

650
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,096
<i>$10,000.

651
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:55,392
<i>-$200 a day, whether I catch him or not. </i>
<i>-You've got it. 

652
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:59,646
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more zoning crap.

653
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:01,398
You've got that.

654
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:06,069
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

655
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:10,365
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

656
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:14,953
Champagne, <i>pâté de foie gras</i>,
Iranian caviar...

657
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,872
...and don't forget the color TV.

658
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,423
You try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

659
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,924
Thanks.

660
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:32,387
Here's to swimmin'
with bow-legged women.

661
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,523
Excuse me, Chief.

662
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:05,545
Can't get a good man these days, under 60.

663
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:08,715
All gone at least 35 years.

664
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,592
Don't drink that.

665
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,934
You'll need an extra hand.

666
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,020
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know.

667
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:24,773
- I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
- Transplants?

668
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:29,277
- He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- And an America's Cup trial.

669
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:34,532
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talkin'
about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.

670
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:40,163
I'm talkin' about workin' for a living.
I'm talkin' about sharkin'.

671
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:44,334
I'm not talkin' about hookin'
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

672
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:47,212
I'm talkin' about finding a great white.

673
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:50,256
Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?

674
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:59,015
Just tie me a sheepshank.

675
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:06,481
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

676
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:10,819
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

677
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:15,615
How's that?

678
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:21,830
Gimme your hands.

679
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:25,375
Dogfish?

680
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:29,838
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

681
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:34,009
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
by the time he's finished with that net...

682
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:38,972
...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class
has cut it up for a paper doll.

683
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:46,104
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.
You been countin' money all your life.

684
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:50,942
I don't need this.
I don't need this working class hero crap.

685
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:55,447
You're not gonna do this
aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?

686
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:59,784
Maybe I should go alone.

687
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:06,499
It's my party. It's my charter.

688
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,920
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.

689
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:13,340
You're on board my vessel...

690
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,675
...l'm mate, master, pilot...

691
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,803
...and I'm captain.

692
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,727
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.

693
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:30,357
You got him.

694
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:41,201
Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, pliers, irons...

695
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:46,081
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float...

696
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:49,668
...temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...

697
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:53,296
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

698
01:27:04,724 --> 01:27:08,812
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure.

699
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,404
Jesus H. Christ!

700
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:24,077
When I was a boy, every squirt wanted
to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.

701
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:29,624
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

702
01:27:29,749 --> 01:27:33,545
- An anti-shark cage.
- Anti-shark cage?

703
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:37,382
You go inside the cage?

704
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:42,095
Cage goes in the water?

705
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:45,724
You go in the water? Shark's in the water.

706
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:48,768
Our shark.

707
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:56,818
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

708
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:02,657
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

709
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:09,748
"For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston

710
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:17,339
"And so never more
shall we see you again"

711
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:29,017
- Did you take your Dramamine?
- Yes.

712
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:34,105
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks...

713
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:40,236
...and there's the stuff for your nose,
the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.

714
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:46,034
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothin'.

715
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:50,497
Young girls just ain't quite smart
like their grandmothers were.

716
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:53,124
That's got to be Quint.

717
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,043
Colorful, isn't he?

718
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:56,961
He scares me.

719
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:04,386
- Don't use the fireplace in the den.
- What am I gonna tell the kids?

720
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,351
Tell them I'm going fishing.

721
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:21,778
Break it up, will ya, Chief?
Daylight's wastin'.

722
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,492
Front: bow. Back: stern.

723
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:30,120
Better get it right, squirt...

724
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:34,708
...or I throw your ass out
the little round window on the side.

725
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:38,003
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

726
01:29:38,753 --> 01:29:41,047
See you got your rubbers.

727
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:49,639
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee,
Died at the age of 103

728
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:56,229
"For 15 years she kept her virginity,
Not a bad record for this vicinity"

729
01:29:57,147 --> 01:30:01,234
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt.

730
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:06,823
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow.

731
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:15,540
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.

732
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:29,220
How's the Missus, Chief?

733
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:35,060
If they don't like you goin' out,
they'll love you comin' in.

734
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,346
Keep that chum line goin'.
We got five good miles on it.

735
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:17,811
- Who's driving this boat?
- Nobody. The tide.

736
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:24,359
One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.

737
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:27,445
Two to wear him down and bring him up.

738
01:31:28,571 --> 01:31:31,658
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

739
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:36,413
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.

740
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,043
Jesus H. Christ.

741
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:47,465
Best drop another chum marker.

742
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,328
Damn it, Martin!

743
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:20,498
This is compressed air.

744
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:25,003
- What the hell kind of a knot was that?
- You pulled the wrong one.

745
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:29,132
You screw around with these tanks,
and they're gonna blow up.

746
01:32:29,215 --> 01:32:33,720
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear you've brought out here.

747
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:38,600
I don't know what
that bastard shark's gonna do with it.

748
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:43,605
Might eat it, I suppose.
Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.

749
01:32:48,818 --> 01:32:52,697
Next time,
you just ask me which line to pull, right?

750
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,750
Little brown eel comes out of the cave...

751
01:33:04,834 --> 01:33:07,003
...swims into the hole...

752
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:12,592
...comes out of the hole,
back into the cave again.

753
01:33:14,427 --> 01:33:16,596
It's not too good, is it?

754
01:33:17,597 --> 01:33:21,142
Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.

755
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,787
I got it.

756
01:35:05,914 --> 01:35:08,458
- What?
- Get behind me.

757
01:35:12,712 --> 01:35:14,923
Hooper, reverse her!

758
01:35:15,965 --> 01:35:18,510
Takin' a hell of a lot of line.

759
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:22,514
Get the scoop out of the bucket.
Wet the reel.

760
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:31,106
Reverse her!

761
01:35:34,567 --> 01:35:38,738
Duck your head down.
We're swingin'. Get behind me again.

762
01:35:39,572 --> 01:35:43,159
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

763
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:48,206
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watchin' it!

764
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:55,255
Hooper, neutral.

765
01:36:04,222 --> 01:36:06,057
Where'd he go now?

766
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:09,561
He ain't foolin' me.

767
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:13,189
What's he yankin' on now?

768
01:36:14,733 --> 01:36:16,484
Go on, try it.

769
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:36,254
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

770
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:46,431
Jesus...

771
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:52,979
He's gone under.

772
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:57,442
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

773
01:36:58,985 --> 01:37:00,904
Yeah, it's too easy.

774
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:05,075
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

775
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:09,829
Keep her steady, now.
I got somethin' very big.

776
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,831
I don't think so.

777
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:15,752
Chief, put your gloves on.

778
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:19,547
You put your gloves on, both of you.

779
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,595
Getting ready to run out again.

780
01:37:26,554 --> 01:37:28,640
Quint, let it go.

781
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:33,603
You may be big in the lab,
but out here you're just cargo.

782
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:37,273
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here.

783
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:41,111
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

784
01:37:41,194 --> 01:37:45,365
- It's not a shark.
- The wire's showing!

785
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:47,033
Unbuckle me.

786
01:37:48,451 --> 01:37:52,747
- Get the other side.
- It's a tuna or swordfish.

787
01:37:56,376 --> 01:37:58,044
Take this rod.

788
01:37:59,295 --> 01:38:02,424
- Give the Chief a hand, will you?
- Right!

789
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:19,149
It's a marlin or a stingray...

790
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:22,902
...but it's definitely a game fish.

791
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,627
Gamin' fish?

792
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:44,007
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

793
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:46,926
Don't you tell me my business again.

794
01:38:47,052 --> 01:38:51,556
- You get back on the bridge.
- Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.

795
01:38:51,681 --> 01:38:53,600
It proves one thing.

796
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:58,396
It proves that you wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough...

797
01:38:58,521 --> 01:39:00,774
...to admit when you're wrong.

798
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:15,789
What's the point? Hooks and lines?

799
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:22,045
You lose one, you rig one.

800
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:31,012
Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now.
Full throttle.

801
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:32,972
Aye, aye, sir.

802
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,688
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick 'em to the surface.

803
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,148
And then jab at 'em.

804
01:39:42,732 --> 01:39:46,945
I'm not gonna haul 'em up
like a lot of catfish.

805
01:39:48,154 --> 01:39:49,489
Full throttle.

806
01:39:49,614 --> 01:39:52,909
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

807
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:56,871
Your head's bleeding. First aid there.

808
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:35,493
Start that chum line again, will ya?

809
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:41,124
Let Hooper take a turn.

810
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:44,461
Hooper drives the boat.

811
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:06,107
Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.

812
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,526
Slow ahead, if you please.

813
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:11,863
You heard him. Slow ahead.

814
01:41:23,249 --> 01:41:24,793
Slow ahead.

815
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:30,590
I can go slow ahead. Come on down
and chum some of this shit.

816
01:41:52,028 --> 01:41:54,614
You're gonna need a bigger boat.

817
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,094
Shut off that engine.

818
01:42:50,962 --> 01:42:54,299
- That's a 20-footer.
- 25.

819
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:57,385
Three tons of him.

820
01:43:04,309 --> 01:43:07,270
We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?

821
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:09,439
Gotta get to work.

822
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:11,733
How do we handle this?

823
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,487
Come up front, Martin. I need you.

824
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:19,908
He's circling the boat.

825
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:41,429
<i>Amity Point Light Station to Orca. </i>
<i>This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca. 

826
01:43:41,554 --> 01:43:43,056
<i>Come in, Orca. 

827
01:43:44,265 --> 01:43:48,603
- Orca. Come in.
- <i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here. 

828
01:43:48,812 --> 01:43:50,188
Put her on.

829
01:43:51,272 --> 01:43:54,901
- Come on, Martin! Move!
- I'm not goin' out there!

830
01:43:55,110 --> 01:44:00,907
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels, further out.

831
01:44:01,282 --> 01:44:02,784
- Further out.
- Why?

832
01:44:02,909 --> 01:44:04,744
- Go further out.
- What for?

833
01:44:04,869 --> 01:44:07,247
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

834
01:44:07,372 --> 01:44:10,166
- What?
- Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

835
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:14,004
I need something
in the foreground to give it some scale.

836
01:44:14,087 --> 01:44:15,505
Foreground my ass!

837
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:19,551
Your husband's okay. He's fishin'.
He just caught some stripers.

838
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:22,178
We'll bring 'em for dinner.
We won't be long.

839
01:44:22,303 --> 01:44:24,681
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

840
01:44:24,931 --> 01:44:27,726
- I'm not staying here!
- I'm begging you!

841
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:29,519
Goddamn it!

842
01:44:30,103 --> 01:44:32,605
Come here, come here, darlin'.

843
01:44:39,654 --> 01:44:43,199
I want you up on the bridge,
just take her forward, steady.

844
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:48,621
- I've never steered a boat in my life.
- Just watch my hand, take her steady.

845
01:44:49,456 --> 01:44:52,834
Attach the end of this line to the first keg.

846
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:57,672
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

847
01:45:21,446 --> 01:45:23,448
Get clear of the bow.

848
01:45:29,162 --> 01:45:32,457
- Hurry up, will ya?
- Your turn, Quint.

849
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:35,251
Hooper, where are you?

850
01:45:40,173 --> 01:45:42,467
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

851
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:47,305
He's comin' straight for us!
Don't screw up now.

852
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,224
Don't wait for me.

853
01:45:52,477 --> 01:45:56,231
Come on, Hooper. Come on.
Hurry it up. Tie it on.

854
01:45:57,273 --> 01:45:58,942
Now. Now.

855
01:46:03,738 --> 01:46:05,281
Kill it!

856
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,742
Now!

857
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:11,788
Shoot!

858
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:17,168
Time.

859
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:24,592
What were you doin', anyway?
I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.

860
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:29,139
Let's see how long that barrel takes
to bring him up.

861
01:46:31,057 --> 01:46:35,061
Free another barrel.
I'm comin' around again.

862
01:47:42,379 --> 01:47:44,756
What do we do now? We're quittin', right?

863
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:49,886
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

864
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:53,014
We could radio in and get a bigger boat...

865
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:27,716
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

866
01:48:28,842 --> 01:48:30,844
It won't be permanent.

867
01:48:31,094 --> 01:48:33,888
You want to see something permanent?

868
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:45,442
You want to feel somethin' permanent?

869
01:48:46,985 --> 01:48:51,489
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

870
01:48:52,073 --> 01:48:55,744
Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.

871
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,251
I got that beat.

872
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,221
It's a moray eel.

873
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:19,017
It bit right through my wet suit.

874
01:49:21,478 --> 01:49:25,565
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...

875
01:49:25,648 --> 01:49:28,818
...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.
See this?

876
01:49:28,943 --> 01:49:31,696
I can't extend that. You know why?

877
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:34,324
'Cause in the semi-final...

878
01:49:34,741 --> 01:49:37,535
...celebrating my third wife's demise...

879
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:41,539
...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.

880
01:49:56,971 --> 01:49:58,473
Look at that.

881
01:50:00,892 --> 01:50:02,811
That's a bull shark.

882
01:50:03,311 --> 01:50:06,398
He scraped me when I was takin' samples.

883
01:50:07,732 --> 01:50:09,859
I got something for you.

884
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:14,698
There's a thresher.
You see that? A thresher's tail.

885
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:17,784
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

886
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:25,458
- You want a drink? Drink to your leg?
- I'll drink to your leg.

887
01:50:25,583 --> 01:50:28,253
So we drink to our legs.

888
01:50:34,884 --> 01:50:38,638
I got the <i>crème de la crème</i>.
Right here. Hold on.

889
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:42,225
Here, you see that?

890
01:50:42,934 --> 01:50:45,103
You're wearin' a sweater.

891
01:50:46,062 --> 01:50:48,648
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

892
01:50:50,608 --> 01:50:52,402
She broke my heart.

893
01:51:05,623 --> 01:51:07,334
What's that one?

894
01:51:07,584 --> 01:51:11,087
- What?
- That one, there. On your arm.

895
01:51:14,632 --> 01:51:17,093
A tattoo. I got that removed.

896
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:21,556
Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother."

897
01:51:28,646 --> 01:51:30,315
What is it?

898
01:51:36,905 --> 01:51:39,532
That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

899
01:51:49,959 --> 01:51:52,420
You were on the Indianapolis?

900
01:51:52,629 --> 01:51:54,214
What happened?

901
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:01,846
Japanese submarine slammed
two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

902
01:52:03,556 --> 01:52:07,727
I was comin' back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte...

903
01:52:07,852 --> 01:52:11,773
...just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

904
01:52:16,152 --> 01:52:19,155
1,100 men went into the water.

905
01:52:19,489 --> 01:52:22,075
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

906
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,748
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

907
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,251
Tiger, 13-footer.

908
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:35,005
Know how you know that
when you're in the water?

909
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:38,675
You tell by lookin'
from the dorsal to the tail.

910
01:52:41,386 --> 01:52:43,388
Well, we didn't know.

911
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:47,559
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret...

912
01:52:48,935 --> 01:52:52,022
...no distress signal had been sent.

913
01:53:00,363 --> 01:53:03,616
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

914
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:09,831
Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...

915
01:53:10,874 --> 01:53:14,169
...so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

916
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:21,051
Kinda like old squares in a battle
like you see on a calendar...

917
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:23,219
...like the Battle of Waterloo.

918
01:53:23,345 --> 01:53:26,681
The idea was,
the shark comes to the nearest man...

919
01:53:26,806 --> 01:53:30,393
...and he starts poundin'
hollerin' and screamin'.

920
01:53:30,477 --> 01:53:32,979
Sometimes the shark would go away...

921
01:53:35,398 --> 01:53:37,776
...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

922
01:53:37,901 --> 01:53:41,363
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right into you...

923
01:53:41,488 --> 01:53:43,615
...right into your eyes.

924
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:48,244
You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...

925
01:53:48,703 --> 01:53:50,455
...lifeless eyes.

926
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:53,875
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

927
01:53:55,877 --> 01:53:59,798
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be livin'...

928
01:54:00,423 --> 01:54:02,509
...until he bites you.

929
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:06,554
Those little black eyes
roll over white and then...

930
01:54:09,015 --> 01:54:12,977
...then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screamin'.

931
01:54:13,603 --> 01:54:15,647
The ocean turns red...

932
01:54:16,523 --> 01:54:21,027
...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin',
they all come in.

933
01:54:23,363 --> 01:54:25,490
They rip you to pieces.

934
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:34,749
You know, by the end of that first dawn...

935
01:54:36,876 --> 01:54:38,712
...we lost 100 men.

936
01:54:40,755 --> 01:54:43,675
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

937
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,637
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

938
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:52,058
On Thursday mornin',
I bumped into a friend of mine...

939
01:54:52,183 --> 01:54:54,894
...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

940
01:54:56,813 --> 01:54:59,899
Baseball player, Bosun's mate.

941
01:55:03,028 --> 01:55:05,155
I thought he was asleep.

942
01:55:06,156 --> 01:55:08,533
Reached over to wake him up.

943
01:55:09,909 --> 01:55:14,289
He bobbed up and down
in the water just like a kind of top.

944
01:55:15,498 --> 01:55:17,000
Upended.

945
01:55:22,213 --> 01:55:25,592
He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.

946
01:55:30,388 --> 01:55:35,393
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

947
01:55:35,518 --> 01:55:39,064
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

948
01:55:39,147 --> 01:55:41,608
Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...

949
01:55:41,733 --> 01:55:44,611
...and he came in low,
and three hours later...

950
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:48,823
...a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

951
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:52,911
That was the time I was most frightened.

952
01:55:53,703 --> 01:55:55,872
Waitin' for my turn.

953
01:55:57,624 --> 01:56:00,585
I'll never put on a life jacket again.

954
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:06,424
So, 1,100 men went into the water...

955
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:09,511
...316 men come out.

956
01:56:09,594 --> 01:56:14,391
The sharks took the rest
June the 29th, 1945.

957
01:56:18,436 --> 01:56:22,941
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

958
01:56:38,456 --> 01:56:39,874
What's that?

959
01:56:41,209 --> 01:56:42,794
It's a whale.

960
01:56:45,255 --> 01:56:50,802
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

961
01:56:53,138 --> 01:56:59,019
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"

962
01:57:04,941 --> 01:57:09,738
"Show me the way to go home

963
01:57:11,531 --> 01:57:16,703
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

964
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:24,294
"I had a little drink about an hour ago

965
01:57:24,878 --> 01:57:30,008
"And it's gone right to my head

966
01:57:31,468 --> 01:57:36,473
"Wherever I may roam

967
01:57:37,724 --> 01:57:42,771
"By land, or sea, or foam

968
01:57:56,534 --> 01:58:00,330
"Show me the way to go home

969
01:58:00,872 --> 01:58:04,709
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

970
01:58:04,876 --> 01:58:08,088
"I had a little drink about a hour ago

971
01:58:08,213 --> 01:58:11,299
"And it's gone right to my head

972
01:58:11,383 --> 01:58:14,260
"Wherever I may roam

973
01:58:14,803 --> 01:58:17,639
"On land or sea or foam

974
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:21,976
"You can always hear me singing this..."

975
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:27,899
Start the engines.

976
01:58:40,453 --> 01:58:41,913
Fire her up!

977
01:58:52,799 --> 01:58:55,010
Put out the fire, will ya?

978
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:09,190
- Pump her out.
- Done.

979
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,121
- Everybody on deck.
- He ate the light.

980
01:59:23,246 --> 01:59:25,206
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

981
01:59:28,418 --> 01:59:32,088
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

982
01:59:34,049 --> 01:59:36,176
What's wrong with this?

983
01:59:39,137 --> 01:59:43,933
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

984
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:07,749
You okay?

985
02:00:10,377 --> 02:00:11,670
You okay?

986
02:00:43,326 --> 02:00:45,078
More left rudder.

987
02:00:46,204 --> 02:00:48,039
Pull your left hand down.

988
02:00:48,164 --> 02:00:51,793
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.

989
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:56,715
All of our injectors got scored
from the salt water in the fuel.

990
02:00:58,091 --> 02:01:01,302
Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.

991
02:01:02,345 --> 02:01:07,934
Try the left rudder again. More left.
Good. Once again now.

992
02:01:13,023 --> 02:01:14,524
There it is.

993
02:01:14,983 --> 02:01:17,110
What do you say, Chief?

994
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:20,572
The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.

995
02:01:25,326 --> 02:01:29,622
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

996
02:01:45,096 --> 02:01:47,599
If we can get close enough...

997
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:54,731
...l've got things on board that'll kill it.
- Just want to goose him up. Come on.

998
02:02:09,496 --> 02:02:13,792
When he runs, you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

999
02:02:15,919 --> 02:02:21,216
I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.
Whole sea's bones, full of 'em.

1000
02:02:21,758 --> 02:02:23,885
Give it to me a minute.

1001
02:02:43,113 --> 02:02:46,241
Haul in that line or it'll foul us.

1002
02:02:47,325 --> 02:02:49,160
Start the engine.

1003
02:02:51,663 --> 02:02:55,667
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna make a phone call.

1004
02:03:04,092 --> 02:03:07,137
Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?

1005
02:03:08,722 --> 02:03:11,599
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you read me?

1006
02:03:11,683 --> 02:03:14,811
Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...

1007
02:03:22,444 --> 02:03:24,362
Excuse me, Chief.

1008
02:03:25,113 --> 02:03:30,785
That's great. That's just great.
Now, where the hell are we?

1009
02:03:33,371 --> 02:03:38,126
You're certifiable, Quint.
You know that? You're certifiable.

1010
02:03:38,293 --> 02:03:42,172
- You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!
- Boys.

1011
02:03:44,507 --> 02:03:48,011
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.

1012
02:03:49,512 --> 02:03:51,681
Hook me up another barrel.

1013
02:04:30,053 --> 02:04:32,347
Bring her around after him.

1014
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:56,413
Full throttle.
Get me right up alongside of him.

1015
02:04:56,538 --> 02:05:00,625
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not gonna take it.

1016
02:05:23,064 --> 02:05:25,066
Five degrees port.

1017
02:05:33,825 --> 02:05:36,202
All right, hold your course.

1018
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:46,421
Five degrees port now.

1019
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,594
Hold your course.

1020
02:05:54,888 --> 02:05:57,182
- Fast fish.
- Watch my hand.

1021
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:03,355
Be sure you watch my hand.
Follow me. Follow me.

1022
02:06:05,106 --> 02:06:08,568
Lad, you watch him now.
Starboard. Starboard.

1023
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:11,613
Run him down.

1024
02:06:21,414 --> 02:06:23,083
Hard apart.

1025
02:06:27,587 --> 02:06:28,797
Watch him.

1026
02:06:28,922 --> 02:06:30,382
Starboard.

1027
02:07:00,954 --> 02:07:05,083
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

1028
02:07:11,923 --> 02:07:13,717
It's incredible.

1029
02:07:21,516 --> 02:07:23,893
- They're up again!
- Now what?

1030
02:07:35,238 --> 02:07:40,535
Why don't we lead the shark into shore
instead of him leading us out to sea?

1031
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:48,418
Grab a couple of poles.

1032
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:53,965
Hang on now, we're going around.

1033
02:07:54,799 --> 02:07:57,886
Into starboard. Easy.

1034
02:07:59,095 --> 02:08:03,641
I'm gonna back her off now.
Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.

1035
02:08:09,898 --> 02:08:12,442
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

1036
02:08:19,324 --> 02:08:22,535
Now then tie them to the stern cleats.

1037
02:08:26,289 --> 02:08:29,542
Brody, bring your end around the cleat.

1038
02:08:30,502 --> 02:08:34,798
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

1039
02:08:37,175 --> 02:08:39,302
Stay clear of the line.

1040
02:08:49,479 --> 02:08:51,606
Watch it. Stand clear.

1041
02:09:04,202 --> 02:09:07,539
Stand away from those stern cleats.

1042
02:09:23,847 --> 02:09:26,307
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

1043
02:09:26,433 --> 02:09:30,603
He gonna have a heart attack
when he sees what I brought him.

1044
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:43,158
Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.

1045
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:49,247
My God, this one, too. They're both going.

1046
02:09:49,664 --> 02:09:55,045
- He's eating his way through that line.
- He's working his way right up to us.

1047
02:09:55,837 --> 02:09:58,923
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1048
02:10:01,384 --> 02:10:02,927
Out of my way.

1049
02:10:09,517 --> 02:10:10,810
Watch it.

1050
02:10:15,857 --> 02:10:19,069
Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.

1051
02:10:23,907 --> 02:10:25,575
Make it fast.

1052
02:10:26,826 --> 02:10:29,245
I can't. It's trying to run.

1053
02:10:32,916 --> 02:10:35,377
Pull, you son of a bitch!

1054
02:10:38,546 --> 02:10:41,508
Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.

1055
02:10:49,974 --> 02:10:51,726
It's impossible!

1056
02:11:12,372 --> 02:11:14,916
We're breaking up! Cut it!

1057
02:11:16,751 --> 02:11:18,545
Watch your hands!

1058
02:11:19,796 --> 02:11:22,382
Cut it quick. I can't hold it!

1059
02:11:49,034 --> 02:11:52,037
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

1060
02:11:52,162 --> 02:11:54,873
Not with three barrels, he can't.

1061
02:11:55,206 --> 02:11:57,042
What about us?

1062
02:11:59,085 --> 02:12:02,756
Get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

1063
02:12:02,839 --> 02:12:04,758
We're gonna sink, aren't we?

1064
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:08,303
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

1065
02:12:16,686 --> 02:12:18,605
Starting to go under.

1066
02:12:19,397 --> 02:12:23,193
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1067
02:13:06,736 --> 02:13:09,406
You ever have one do this before?

1068
02:13:12,409 --> 02:13:13,702
No.

1069
02:13:53,158 --> 02:13:55,910
He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.

1070
02:14:03,376 --> 02:14:06,129
I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.

1071
02:14:06,254 --> 02:14:11,134
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.

1072
02:14:11,676 --> 02:14:14,679
- We're headin' in, Brody.
- Thank Christ!

1073
02:14:24,439 --> 02:14:27,567
- You ever had a great white do that?
- No.

1074
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:37,619
How far do we have to go?

1075
02:14:41,247 --> 02:14:44,459
Don't put that much pressure on it.

1076
02:14:56,971 --> 02:15:00,558
- Goddamn it.
- Shut up. Get back there.

1077
02:15:07,732 --> 02:15:08,983
Hold on.

1078
02:15:28,003 --> 02:15:33,675
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

1079
02:15:37,345 --> 02:15:43,435
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

1080
02:15:45,353 --> 02:15:50,483
"For we received order
for to sail back to Boston"

1081
02:15:52,318 --> 02:15:55,321
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.

1082
02:15:57,407 --> 02:16:01,661
All right stop the boat. Stop the boat.
Stop it.

1083
02:18:06,411 --> 02:18:10,123
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1084
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:20,508
I think I can pump 20 ccm
of strychnine nitrate into him.

1085
02:18:21,092 --> 02:18:23,345
If I can get close enough.

1086
02:18:26,973 --> 02:18:30,101
Get this little needle through his skin?

1087
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,481
No, I can't do that.

1088
02:18:36,274 --> 02:18:40,153
If I can get him close to the cage,
I can get him in the mouth.

1089
02:18:40,278 --> 02:18:45,116
- That shark'll rip that cage to pieces.
- You got any better suggestions?

1090
02:19:17,565 --> 02:19:18,858
Easy.

1091
02:19:21,986 --> 02:19:23,488
Up she goes.

1092
02:20:32,307 --> 02:20:34,142
Ain't got no spit.

1093
02:20:53,328 --> 02:20:56,456
Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.

1094
02:20:59,959 --> 02:21:01,961
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

1095
02:24:42,349 --> 02:24:46,978
Bring him up, goddamn it.
Bring him up now!

1096
02:24:53,985 --> 02:24:56,154
Pull it up. Pull it.

1097
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:12,045
Come on, Quint, bring him in.

1098
02:25:16,049 --> 02:25:17,759
It's giving way.

1099
02:25:32,774 --> 02:25:35,110
Rig something!

1100
02:25:39,447 --> 02:25:40,699
Got it?

1101
02:25:45,662 --> 02:25:47,163
It's comin'.

1102
02:25:50,458 --> 02:25:51,626
Slower.

1103
02:29:55,495 --> 02:29:57,414
Show me the tank.

1104
02:30:20,395 --> 02:30:21,688
Blow up!

1105
02:30:26,026 --> 02:30:28,236
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1106
02:32:19,889 --> 02:32:21,266
Quint?

1107
02:32:22,809 --> 02:32:24,185
No.

1108
02:32:35,947 --> 02:32:38,074
Can we get in on those?

1109
02:32:46,541 --> 02:32:48,293
What day is this?

1110
02:32:51,004 --> 02:32:54,299
It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think.

1111
02:32:56,384 --> 02:32:58,678
I think the tide's with us.

1112
02:32:59,846 --> 02:33:01,639
Keep kicking.

1113
02:33:05,935 --> 02:33:08,104
I used to hate the water.

1114
02:33:11,358 --> 02:33:13,276
I can't imagine why.

1115
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,531
