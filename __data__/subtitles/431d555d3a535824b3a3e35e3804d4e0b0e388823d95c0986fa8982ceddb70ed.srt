2
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:30,955
On the clearest of nights

3
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:34,792
when the winds of the Etherium
were calm and peaceful

4
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,060
the great merchant ships

5
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,130
with their cargoes
of Arcturian sura crystals

6
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,337
felt safe and secure

7
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:57,074
Little did they suspect
that they were pursued by

8
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,775
pirates

9
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:04,847
And the most feared
of all these pirates

10
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:09,049
was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint

11
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,318
Fire!

12
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:25,766
Like a Candarian zap-wing
overtaking its prey...

13
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,438
James Pleiades Hawkins

14
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:29,539
I thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,303
I thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

16
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,107
Mom, I was just getting
to the best part.

17
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,374
Please?

18
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:41,109
Oh, can those eyes
get any bigger?

19
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:43,745
Scootch over.

20
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,216
Like a Candarian zap-wing

21
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,245
overtaking its prey

22
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,688
Flint and his band of renegades

23
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,625
swooped in out of nowhere

24
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,794
And then. Gathering up
their spoils

25
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:12,570
vanished without a trace

26
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,673
Flint's secret trove
was never found

27
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,272
but stories have persisted
that it remains hidden

28
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:25,682
somewhere at the farthest
reaches of the galaxy

29
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:29,744
stowed with riches
beyond imagination...

30
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:33,052
the loot of a thousand worlds

31
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,025
Treasure Planet

32
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,083
OK. Blow your nose.

33
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,127
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?

34
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:49,364
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere
and vanished without a trace?

35
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,496
I have no idea.

36
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,529
Come here, you, you li...

37
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,165
I'm gonna get... oh!

38
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:01,941
OK, now it's time for this
little spacer to go to sleep.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,709
You think somebody'll
ever find Treasure Planet?

40
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:08,912
Sweetheart,
I think it's more...

41
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:11,011
like a legend.

42
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:13,180
I know it's real.

43
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:16,350
You win. It's real.

44
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,319
- Nighty-night, Mom.
- Nighty-night, sweetheart.

45
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,661
I love you.

46
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,096
Love you, too.

47
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,863
There are nights when
the winds of the Etherium

48
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:38,238
so inviting in their promise
of flight and freedom

49
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:41,608
made one's spirit soar!

50
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,746
Come on!

51
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:50,156
Oh, great.

52
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,997
Mrs Hawkins!

53
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,264
I know...
refill on the purp juice.

54
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,633
Coming right up,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,298
There we go. That's four
powdered spheroids...

56
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,136
two lunar eclipses,
and it's a big bowl...

57
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,438
of Zorellian jelly worms
for the big boy!

58
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,637
- Awesome!
- Enjoy.

59
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,606
Sorry, Delbert. It's been
a madhouse here all morning.

60
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:20,946
No problem, Sarah.

61
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,612
My Alponian chowder
with the extra solara seed.

62
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,450
Yum!

63
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:29,751
Hello.

64
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:32,359
What brings you here

65
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,451
curious little one?

66
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,428
Go away.

67
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,401
Are your parents around?

68
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:48,027
What's the matter?
Cat got your...

69
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:52,135
Oh, they're so adorable
at that age.

70
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:54,268
Oh, yes... deplorable.

71
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,210
Adorable!

72
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,736
Speaking of which,
how's Jim doing?

73
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,840
Much better. I know
he had some rough spots...

74
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,147
earlier this year,
but I really think...

75
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:05,777
that he's starting
to turn a corner.

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,651
Mrs. Hawkins?

77
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:08,984
Jim!

78
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,922
Wrong turn.

79
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:12,719
OK. Thanks for the lift, guys.

80
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,487
Not so fast.

81
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,154
We apprehended
your son operating...

82
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,786
a solar vehicle
in a restricted area.

83
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,922
Moving violation 9-0-4...

84
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,830
section fifteen, paragraph...

85
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:23,992
Six?

86
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,501
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

87
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,663
- Jim!
- As you are aware, ma'am...

88
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,694
this constitutes a violation
of his probation.

89
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:33,401
Yes, yes. No, I understand.
But could we just...

90
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,908
Pardon me

91
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:38,434
Officers, if I might,
interject here.

92
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,915
I am the noted astrophysicist
Dr. Delbert Doppler.

93
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,381
Perhaps you've heard of me.

94
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,680
No? I have a clipping.

95
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,413
- Are you the boy's father?
- Oh! Good heavens, no!

96
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,513
He's just an old friend
of the family.

97
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:52,989
Back off, sir!

98
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,390
Thank you, Delbert.
I will take it from here.

99
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,257
Well, Sarah, if you insist.

100
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,762
Don't ever let me
do that again.

101
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,888
Due to repeated violations
of statute 15-C...

102
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:04,923
we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result...

103
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,525
in a one-way ticket
to Juvenile Hall.

104
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,365
- Kiddie hoosegow.
- The slammo.

105
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:12,032
Thank you, officers.
It won't happen again.

106
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,630
We see his type
all the time, ma'am.

107
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,164
- Wrong choices.
- Dead-enders.

108
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,177
Losers

109
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,440
- You take care now.
- Let's motor.

110
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,385
Jim, I have had it.

111
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,718
Do you want to go
to Juvenile Hall? Is that it?

112
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:35,119
Jim?

113
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,785
Jim, look at me.

114
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:38,816
It's been hard enough
keeping this place...

115
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,725
afloat by myself
without you going...

116
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,956
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.

117
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,693
Those cops just
won't get off my...

118
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,533
Forget it.

119
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,299
Mrs Hawkins! My juice!

120
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,738
Yes, I'll be right there,
Mrs. Dunwiddie.

121
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,570
Jim, I just don't want
to see you...

122
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,736
throw away your entire future.

123
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,712
Yeah, what future?

124
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:17,847
I really don't
know how you manage it. Sarah

125
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,621
Trying to run a business
while raising a felon like...

126
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:24,494
felon... fellow...
fellow like Jim.

127
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,397
Managing it?
I'm at the end of my rope.

128
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,332
Ever since his father left

129
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,859
well. Jim's just
never recovered

130
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:35,133
And you know how smart he is

131
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:39,198
He built his first solar surfer
when he was eight!

132
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:41,676
And yet. He's failing at school

133
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,769
he is constantly in trouble

134
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:46,610
and when I talk to him.
He's like a stranger to me

135
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,446
I don't know. Delbet
I've tried everything...

136
00:08:58,524 --> 00:08:59,991
Hey, Mister?

137
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,926
Mister,
you're OK in there, right?

138
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,157
He's a-comin'.

139
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,166
Can you hear him?

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,191
Those gears and gyros
clickin' and whirrin'...

141
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,897
like the devil himself!

142
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,837
Hit your head there
pretty hard, didn't ya?

143
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,465
He's after me chest...

144
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:23,841
that fiendish cyborg
and his band of cutthroats.

145
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,206
But they'll have to pry it...

146
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:33,378
from old Billy Bones' cold,
dead fingers afore I...

147
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,521
Oh, my...

148
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,250
Come on, give me your arm.

149
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:42,024
That's it.

150
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:47,954
- Good lad.
- Mom's gonna love this.

151
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,131
Thanks for listening, Delbert.

152
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:02,370
It helps.

153
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,973
It's going to be OK.

154
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,776
You'll see.

155
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,477
I keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door...

156
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:15,144
and there he'll be
just the way he was.

157
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:18,518
A smiling, happy little boy,
holding a new pet...

158
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:21,217
and begging me
to let him keep it.

159
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,150
James Pleiades Hawkins!

160
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,424
Mom, he's hurt... bad!

161
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,123
Me chest, lad.

162
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,498
He'll be comin' soon

163
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,363
Can't let them find this.

164
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,738
Who's coming?

165
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,869
The cyborg!

166
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,506
Beware the cyborg!

167
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:13,530
Quick! We gotta go!

168
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,960
I believe I'm with Jim
on this one!

169
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,739
Delilah! Hallelujah!

170
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:33,140
Stay! Don't move!

171
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,046
Where is it?!

172
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,710
Find it!

173
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,081
Don't worry. Sarah

174
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,348
I'm an expert in the laws
of physical science.

175
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:42,446
- On the count of three... one...
- Three!

176
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,651
Go, Delilah! Go!

177
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:50,024
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!

178
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,059
I just spoke
with the constabulary

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,160
Those blaggard pirates
have fled without a trace

180
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,194
I'm sorry, Sarah.

181
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:24,333
I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn
has burned to the ground.

182
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,474
Well, certainly
a lot of trouble...

183
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:34,676
over that odd little sphere.

184
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:37,413
Those markings baffle me

185
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,613
Unlike anything
I've ever encountered

186
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,255
Even with my vast experience

187
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,756
and superior intellect

188
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,884
it would take me years
to unlock its... hey!

189
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:53,827
Why, it's a map!

190
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,327
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

191
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,302
This is us,
the planet Montressor.

192
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,130
That's the Magellanic Cloud!

193
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,266
The Coral Galaxy!

194
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:09,569
That's the Cygnus Cross

195
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:12,045
and that's the Kerian Abyss.

196
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,515
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it... it's...

197
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,380
Treasure Planet.

198
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:18,782
No!

199
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,752
That's Treasure Planet!

200
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,448
Flint's trove?

201
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,456
The loot of a thousand worlds?

202
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,117
You know what this means?

203
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,615
It means that all that treasure
is only a boat ride away.

204
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,186
Whoever brings it back
would hold an eternal place...

205
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,757
atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience...

206
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
What just happened?

207
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,295
Mom, this is it. This is
the answer to all our problems.

208
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,567
Jim, there is
absolutely no way...

209
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:47,166
Don't you remember,
all those stories?

210
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,040
That's all they were... stories!

211
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,203
With that treasure...

212
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,872
we could rebuild the Benbow
a hundred times over!

213
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,609
Well, this is...
it's just... oh, my.

214
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,048
Delbert, would you please
explain how ridiculous this is?

215
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,382
It's totally preposterous...

216
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,444
traversing
the entire galaxy alone.

217
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,546
Now at last,
we hear some sense!

218
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:08,216
- That's why I'm going with you.
- Delbert!

219
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:10,658
I'll use my savings
to finance the expedition.

220
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:14,150
I'll commission a ship,
hire a captain and a crew.

221
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,493
You're not serious.

222
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:18,124
All my life I've been waiting
for an opportunity like this...

223
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,602
and here it is screaming,
"Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!"

224
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:24,763
OK. OK! You're both grounded!

225
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,939
Mom. Look

226
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:31,500
I know that I keep
messing everything up...

227
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:34,273
and I know...

228
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,303
that I let you down.

229
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,979
But this is my chance
to make it up to you.

230
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:43,679
I'm gonna set things right.

231
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,449
Sarah?

232
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,683
If I may?

233
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:51,157
You said yourself,
you've tried everything.

234
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,820
There are much worse
remedies...

235
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,988
than a few character-building
months in space.

236
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,827
Are you saying this
because it's the right thing...

237
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,129
or because
you really want to go?

238
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,896
I really, really, really,
really want to go...

239
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,870
and it's the right thing.

240
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,537
Jim...

241
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:17,240
I don't want to lose you.

242
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,806
Mom... you won't.

243
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,011
I'll make you proud.

244
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:26,611
Well.

245
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:28,211
There we are then.

246
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,490
We'll begin preparations
at once.

247
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:30,889
We'll begin preparations
at once.

248
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:35,223
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be
off to the spaceport.

249
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:18,727
Jim! Oh. Jim! Wait for me!

250
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,597
Well, Jim, this should be
a wonderful opportunity...

251
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,798
for the two of us
to get to know one another.

252
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,204
You know what they say,
familiarity breeds,

253
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,208
well, contempt,
but, in our case...

254
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:39,337
Look, let's just
find the ship. OK?

255
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:44,063
- Second berth on your right!
- You can't miss it.

256
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,373
Hey, thanks.

257
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:49,004
It's the suit, isn't it?
I should never have listened...

258
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:51,412
to that pushy
two-headed saleswoman.

259
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,779
This one said it fit,
that one said it was my color.

260
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,842
I didn't know what to do.
I get so flustered.

261
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:02,714
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!

262
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,789
Stow those casks forward!

263
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,299
Heave together now!

264
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,167
How cool is this?

265
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,200
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean...

266
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,838
Allow me to handle this.

267
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,417
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.

268
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:39,078
Took two years of it
in high school.

269
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:43,351
Flatula? Cool.

270
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:47,649
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?

271
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,321
Shipshape it is, sir,
but I'm not the captain.

272
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,194
The captain's aloft.

273
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,365
Mr. Arrow, I've checked
this miserable ship...

274
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:06,841
from stem to stern,
and, as usual, it's... spot on.

275
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,899
Can you get nothing wrong?

276
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:11,309
You flatter me, Captain.

277
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:16,240
Dr. Doppler, I presume?

278
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,080
Yes. I...

279
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,348
- Hello! Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can! Stop that banging!

280
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,048
If I may, Doctor,
this works so much better...

281
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,215
when it's right-way up
and plugged in.

282
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,383
Lovely. There you go.

283
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:31,053
If you don't mind,
I can manage my own plugging!

284
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm Captain Amelia...

285
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,061
late of a few run-ins
with the Protean armada.

286
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,258
Nasty business, but I won't
bore you with my scars.

287
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,062
You've met
my first officer, Mr. Arrow.

288
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,192
Sterling, tough, dependable,
honest, brave, and true.

289
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,862
Please, Captain.

290
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,870
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know
I don't mean a word of it.

291
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:47,271
Excuse me. I hate to
interrupt this lovely banter...

292
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,775
but may I introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?

293
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,108
Jim, you see, is the boy
who found the treasure...

294
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,306
Doctor, please!

295
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,383
I'd like a word with you
in my stateroom.

296
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:07,079
Doctor, to muse and blabber
about a treasure map...

297
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:09,090
in front of
this particular crew...

298
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:11,354
demonstrates
a level of ineptitude...

299
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,553
that borders
on the imbecilic...

300
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,586
and I mean that
in a very caring way.

301
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,087
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've...

302
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,759
May I see the map, please?

303
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,599
Here.

304
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,641
Fascinating.

305
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,312
Mr. Hawkins, in the future...

306
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,246
you will address me
as "Captain" or "Ma'am."

307
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:38,406
Is that clear?

308
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,247
Mr. Hawkins?

309
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:46,254
- Yes, ma'am.
- That'll do.

310
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,585
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key...

311
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,387
when not in use.
And, Doctor, again...

312
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,120
with the greatest
possible respect...

313
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,184
zip your howling screamer.

314
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,889
Captain, I assure you I...

315
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,421
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

316
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:04,765
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

317
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:07,202
They're... how did I
describe them, Arrow?

318
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,569
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

319
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:13,905
"A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots, " ma'am.

320
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:17,470
- There you go... poetry.
- Now, see here...

321
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:21,676
Doctor, I'd love to chat...
tea, cake, the whole shebang...

322
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,047
but I have a ship to launch...

323
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,184
and you've got your outfit
to buff up.

324
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:27,517
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes...

325
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,077
down to the galley
straightaway.

326
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:31,852
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

327
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:34,324
What? The cook?

328
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,165
That woman! That... feline!

329
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,394
Who does she think
is working for whom?

330
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,766
It's my map, and
she's got me bussin' tables?

331
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,532
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

332
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:49,905
There's no finer officer
in this or any galaxy.

333
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,004
Mr Silver?

334
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,276
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

335
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,714
Bringin' in such fine
and distinguished gents

336
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,718
to grace my humble galley.

337
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:04,219
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.

338
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,725
A cyborg!

339
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,989
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?

340
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:15,426
The financier of our voyage.

341
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:17,589
Love the outfit, Doc.

342
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:21,157
Well, thank you. Love the eye.

343
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,929
This young lad is Jim Hawkins.

344
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:27,129
Jimbo!

345
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:35,937
Now, don't be too put off
by this hunk of hardware.

346
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,249
These gears have been
tough getting used to...

347
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:50,052
but they do come in
mighty handy from time to time.

348
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:04,960
Here, now, have a taste
of me famous bonzabeast stew.

349
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:08,071
Delightfully tangy, yet robust.

350
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:11,699
Delightfully tangy, yet robust.

351
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,300
Old family recipe

352
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:19,105
In fact, that was part
of the old family!

353
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:25,174
Oh, ho! I'm just kiddin', Doc!

354
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,549
Yeah, well...

355
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:29,110
I'm nothin'
if I ain't a kidder.

356
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:31,645
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.

357
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:40,322
Morph!

358
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:43,627
You jiggle-headed
blob of mischief!

359
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,157
So that's where you was hiding!

360
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,669
Wha...? What is that thing?

361
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,038
"What is that thing?"

362
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,872
He's a morph

363
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,878
I rescued the little
shape-shifter on Proteus 1

364
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,039
He took a shine to me.

365
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,846
We been together ever since.

366
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,717
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.

367
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,152
We're about to get underway.

368
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:13,315
Would you like to observe
the launch, doctor?

369
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:14,584
Would I?

370
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:18,287
Does an active galactic nucleus
have superluminal jets?

371
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:20,693
I'll follow you.

372
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:24,528
Mr. Hawkins will stay here
in your charge, Mr. Silver.

373
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,031
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but...

374
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,971
Captain's orders! See to it
the new cabin boy's kept busy.

375
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:35,769
- But, no, but...
- No, you can't...

376
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:44,203
So, Captain's
put you with me, eh?

377
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,113
Whatever.

378
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:51,552
Well, who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

379
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,884
Yeah.

380
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:56,914
You know... these purps...

381
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,223
they're kind of like the ones
back home on Montressor.

382
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:02,854
You ever been there?

383
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:05,558
I can't say as I have, Jimbo.

384
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,794
Come to think of it,
just before I left...

385
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:11,860
I met this old guy, who was...

386
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:15,270
he was kind of looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

387
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:16,603
Is that so?

388
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,972
Yeah.

389
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,842
What was that
old salamander's name?

390
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,368
Oh, yeah. Bones.

391
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,347
Billy Bones?

392
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,475
Bones? Bones?!

393
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:31,815
T'ain't ringin' any bells.

394
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,116
Must have been
a different cyborg.

395
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:37,419
There's a slew of cyborgs
roamin' this port.

396
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:40,387
Prepare to cast off!

397
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:44,361
Off with you, lad,
and watch the launch.

398
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:48,332
There'll be plenty work
a-waitin' for you afterwards.

399
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:58,937
We best be keepin' a sharp eye
on this one, eh, Morph?

400
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:03,876
We wouldn't want him strayin'
into things he shouldn't.

401
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:07,112
We're all clear, Captain!

402
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:10,486
Well, my friend. Are we ready
to raise this creaking tub?

403
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:12,616
My pleasure, Captain.

404
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,650
All hands to stations!

405
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,021
Smatly now!

406
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,620
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!

407
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:26,631
Loose all solar sails!

408
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,900
Come on!

409
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:40,838
Heave up the braces

410
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,678
Brace up

411
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:01,729
Mr. Zoff,
engage artificial gravity.

412
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,603
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.

413
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,506
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.

414
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,071
Full speed, Mr. Arrow,
if you please.

415
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,409
Take her away!

416
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,510
Brace yourself, Doctor.

417
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,519
"Brace yourself."

418
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:12,749
Upon my word,
an Orcus Galacticus.

419
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:15,752
Smile.

420
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,348
Doctor, I'd stand clear...

421
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,185
Ha.

422
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:25,254
'tis a grand day
for sailing. Captain

423
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,731
and look at you

424
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,393
You're as trim and as bonny
as a sloop

425
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:32,232
with new sails
and a fresh coat of paint

426
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,100
You can keep that kind
of flim-flammery...

427
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,003
for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.

428
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,507
Spaceport floozy,
spaceport floozy...

429
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,940
You cut me to the quick,
Captain.

430
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:42,911
I speaks nothing
but me heart at all times.

431
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,172
Nothing but me heat

432
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:47,010
And, by the way,
isn't that your cabin boy...

433
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:50,745
aimlessly footling about
in those shrouds?

434
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,412
Yep, it...

435
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:57,480
A momentary aberration, Cap'n,
soon to be addressed. Jimbo!

436
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,755
I got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.

437
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:08,097
Say hello to Mr. Mop
and Mrs. Bucket.

438
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,431
Yippie.

439
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,200
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.

440
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,204
Watch it, twerp.

441
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,715
What are you looking at,
weirdo?

442
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:41,150
Yeah, weirdo.

443
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:51,293
Cabin boys should learn
to mind their own business.

444
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,823
Why? You got something to hide,
bright eyes?

445
00:28:55,403 --> 00:29:00,101
Maybe your ears
don't work so well.

446
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,108
Yeah.

447
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,166
Too bad my nose works just fine.

448
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,203
Why, you impudent little...

449
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,978
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!

450
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:17,980
Any last words, cabin boy?

451
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,688
Mr. Scroop...

452
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,192
you ever see what happens
to a fresh purp...

453
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:31,096
when you squeeze real hard?

454
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,766
What's all this. Then?

455
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:40,101
You know the rules.

456
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:42,767
There'll be no brawling
on this ship.

457
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:44,001
Aye, aye, sir.

458
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:47,738
Any further offenders
will be confined to the brig...

459
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:50,542
for the remainder
of the voyage.

460
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,208
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?

461
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,355
Transparently.

462
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:10,625
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!

463
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:13,530
A tight ship's
a happy ship, sir.

464
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,429
Jimbo, I gave you a job.

465
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:19,868
Hey, I was doing it
until that bug thing...

466
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:25,068
Belay that! Now, I want
this deck swabbed spotless...

467
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:28,669
and heaven help you if
I come back and it's not done.

468
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:32,407
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup...

469
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,075
and let me know if there be
any more distractions.

470
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:36,276
OK Aye-aye

471
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,719
So, we're all here, then.

472
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,986
- Excuse me.
- Fine.

473
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,490
Now, if you pardon
my plain speaking, gentlemen...

474
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:59,191
are you all...

475
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,929
stark-raving,
totally blinking daft?!

476
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:06,500
After all me finagling
getting us hired...

477
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:08,165
as an upstanding crew...

478
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:11,971
you want to blow the whole
mutiny before it's time?

479
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:14,977
The boy was sniffing about.

480
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:20,607
You just stick to the plan,
you bug-brained twit.

481
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:24,345
As for the boy,
I'll run him so ragged...

482
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:26,444
he won't have time to think.

483
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,656
Well, this has been a fun day?

484
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:44,156
Making new friends
like that spider psycho.

485
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,135
Spider psycho, spider psycho.

486
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:48,000
A little uglier.

487
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:51,734
Pretty close.

488
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:53,036
Well

489
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:56,066
thank heavens
for little miracles.

490
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:57,703
Up here for an hour...

491
00:31:57,746 --> 00:32:00,043
and the deck's
still in one piece.

492
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,049
Look, I...

493
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,483
What you did...

494
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,187
Thanks.

495
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,023
Didn't your pap
ever teach you...

496
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,356
to pick your fights
a bit more carefully?

497
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:24,157
Your father's
not the teachin' sort.

498
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,996
No.

499
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:30,164
He was more the taking off
and never coming back sort.

500
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:36,374
Sorry, lad.

501
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,004
Hey, no big deal.
I'm doing just fine.

502
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:43,675
Is that so?

503
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:47,378
Well, since the captain
has put you in my charge...

504
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:49,579
like it or not,
I'll be pounding a few skills...

505
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,020
into that thick head of yours
to keep you out of trouble.

506
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,387
- What?
- From now on...

507
00:32:53,424 --> 00:32:55,687
I'm not letting you
out of me sight.

508
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:56,851
You can't do...

509
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,654
You won't so much
as eat, sleep...

510
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:01,788
or scratch your bum
without my say-so.

511
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,297
Don't do me any favors!

512
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:06,129
Oh, you can be sure of that,
my lad.

513
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:06,223
You can be sure of that.

514
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:08,521
You can be sure of that.

515
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:16,720
Put some elbow into it.

516
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:31,807
I am a question to the world

517
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,074
Not an answer to be heard

518
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:40,243
Or a moment
that's held in your arms

519
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:44,845
And what do you think
you'd ever say

520
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:48,084
I won't listen anyway

521
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:49,818
You don't know me

522
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:52,656
And I'll never be what you want

523
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:55,093
Made of pain

524
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:04,260
And what do you think
you'd understand?

525
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,534
I'm a boy. No. I'm a man

526
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:12,475
You can take me
and throw me away

527
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,310
And how can you learn
what's never shown

528
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,406
Yeah. You stand here
on your own

529
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,110
They don't know me

530
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:27,486
'Cause I'm not here

531
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:31,480
And I want a moment to be real

532
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:35,119
Want to touch things
I don't feel

533
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:40,188
Want to hold on
and feel I belong

534
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:44,793
And how can the world
want me to change

535
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:47,929
They're the ones
that stay the same

536
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:50,064
They don't know me

537
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:54,542
But I'm still here

538
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:59,478
And you see the things
they never see

539
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,677
All you wanted. I could be

540
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,343
Now you know me

541
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:07,217
And I'm not afraid

542
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:12,316
And I want to tell you who I am

543
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:15,520
Can you help me be a man?

544
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,152
They can't break me

545
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:21,528
As long as I know who I am

546
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:27,167
They can't tell me who to be

547
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:34,966
'Cause I'm not what they see

548
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah. The world
is still sleeping

549
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:39,845
While I keep on dreaming for me

550
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,711
While I keep on dreaming for me

551
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,113
And the words
are just whispers and lies

552
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:49,780
That I'll never believe

553
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:56,254
And I want a moment to be real

554
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:59,352
Want to touch things
I don't feel

555
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:03,092
Want to hold on
and feel I belong

556
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:09,128
How can you say I never change?

557
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,036
They're the ones
that stay the same

558
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:14,096
I'm the one now

559
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,907
'Cause I'm still here

560
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:24,176
I'm the one son still here

561
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,548
I'm still here

562
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,577
I'm still here

563
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:48,957
Oh, ho ho!

564
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,328
You having
a little trouble there?

565
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:51,491
Oh, get away from me.

566
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,763
Oh, Jimbo.

567
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:59,170
If I could maneuver a skiff
like that when I was your age...

568
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:02,334
they'd be bowing in the streets
when I walked by today.

569
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,501
Bowing in the streets.

570
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,842
I don't know.

571
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:10,939
They weren't exactly singing
my praises when I left home.

572
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,548
But I'm gonna change all that.

573
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:19,646
Are you now? How so?

574
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:23,352
I got some plans.

575
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:26,485
Gonna make people see me
a little different.

576
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:33,158
Sometimes, plans go astray.

577
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,565
Not this time.

578
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:47,500
Oh, thank you, Morphy.

579
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:53,182
So how'd that happen anyway?

580
00:37:56,118 --> 00:38:01,419
You give up a few things
chasing a dream.

581
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,583
Was it worth it?

582
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,395
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo.

583
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,921
I most surely am.

584
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:22,763
What the devil?

585
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:24,466
Good heavens.

586
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,941
The star Pelusa...

587
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,103
it's gone supernova!

588
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:31,374
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!

589
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:32,607
Aye-aye, Captain.

590
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:38,852
All hands,
fasten your lifelines!

591
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,629
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!

592
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,066
Secure all sails!

593
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:00,728
Reef them down. Men!

594
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:14,577
Yeah, baby!

595
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,878
Silver!

596
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:28,756
Thanks, lad.

597
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:54,640
Captain, the star!

598
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,840
It's devolving into a...

599
00:39:56,881 --> 00:40:00,816
a black hole!

600
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:03,911
We're being pulled in!

601
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,648
No, you don't, you...

602
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:16,694
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!

603
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:18,961
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,332
There'll be one more
in precisely 47.2 seconds.

605
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:25,030
Followed by the biggest
magilla of them all!

606
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,129
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!

607
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:30,004
We'll ride that last magilla
out of here.

608
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,475
All sails secured, Captain!

609
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,036
Good man!
Now release them immediately!

610
00:40:37,514 --> 00:40:40,311
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.

611
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,476
Unfurl those sails

612
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:44,076
- What?!
- But we just finished...

613
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,646
- Tying them down!
- Make up your blooming minds!

614
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:51,023
Mr. Hawkins...

615
00:40:51,058 --> 00:40:55,016
make sure all lifelines
are secured good and tight!

616
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,528
Aye-aye, Captain.

617
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,702
Lifelines secured, Captain!

618
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:06,896
Very good!

619
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:36,058
Captain. The last wave!

620
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,085
Here it comes!

621
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,187
Hold on to your lifelines,
gents!

622
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,596
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

623
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,094
Captain! That... oh, my goodness.
That was...

624
00:42:25,129 --> 00:42:26,687
that was absolutely...
that was the most...

625
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:29,097
Oh, tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor...

626
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:31,965
your astronomical advice
was most helpful.

627
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:35,664
Well... thank you.
Thank you very much.

628
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:37,899
Well, I have a lot of help
to offer anatomically...

629
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,340
amanamonically...
as-astronomically.

630
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:44,209
Well, I must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.

631
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:45,370
It seems your cabin boy...

632
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:47,937
did a bang-up job
with those lifelines.

633
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:51,982
All hands accounted for,
Mr. Arrow?

634
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,180
Mr. Arrow?

635
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:02,715
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow
has been lost.

636
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:07,730
His lifeline was not secured.

637
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,326
No, I checked them all.

638
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:19,697
I... I did. I checked them all.
They were secure.

639
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,468
I swear.

640
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,643
Mr. Arrow was a...

641
00:43:35,686 --> 00:43:39,883
Fine spacer...

642
00:43:39,922 --> 00:43:43,858
finer than most of us
could ever hope to be...

643
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,488
but he knew the risks,
as do we all.

644
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,021
Resume your posts. We carry on.

645
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:18,447
It weren't your fault,
you know?

646
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:26,187
Why, half the crew would be
spinning in that black abyss...

647
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:29,592
Look, don't you get it?!
I screwed up!

648
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,596
For two seconds,
I thought that maybe...

649
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,996
I could do
something right, but...

650
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:37,126
I just...

651
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,296
Just forget it. Forget it.

652
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:53,880
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.

653
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:57,350
You got the makings
of greatness in ya...

654
00:44:57,385 --> 00:45:00,717
but you gotta take the helm
and chart your own course.

655
00:45:00,754 --> 00:45:04,212
Stick to it,
no matter the squalls...

656
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:06,451
and when the time comes
you get the chance...

657
00:45:06,492 --> 00:45:08,756
to really test
the cut of your sails...

658
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:14,356
and show what you're made of,
well, I hope I'm there...

659
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:18,960
catching some of the light
coming off ya that day.

660
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:33,236
There, there.

661
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,077
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.

662
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:38,709
It's all right.

663
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,883
Now, Jim, I...

664
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:47,447
I best be getting
about my watch...

665
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,550
and you best be getting
some shut-eye.

666
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:10,398
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.

667
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:14,640
Next thing ya know, they'll be
saying I've gone soft.

668
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:56,023
Morph?

669
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,223
Morph, knock it off.
It's too early for this.

670
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:06,756
Hey, Morph!

671
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:08,132
Pbbbt!

672
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:13,202
- Hey, come back here!
- Come back here!

673
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,077
Gotcha, Morph!

674
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:24,215
That's it, you little squid.

675
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:26,216
You little squid.
You little squid.

676
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,241
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

677
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:46,896
Ha! Busted!

678
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,796
Look. What we're saying is
we're sick of all this waiting

679
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:54,237
There's only three of them left

680
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:56,433
We are wanting to move.

681
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,409
We don't move till
we got the treasure in hand.

682
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,640
I say we kill 'em all now

683
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,239
I say what's to say!

684
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,943
Disobey my orders again...

685
00:48:07,984 --> 00:48:10,042
like that stunt you pulled
with Mr. Arrow...

686
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:13,153
and so help me,
you'll be joining him!

687
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:15,154
And so help me,
you'll be joining him!

688
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,491
Strong talk,
but I know otherwise.

689
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,155
You got
something to say. Scroop?

690
00:48:24,197 --> 00:48:27,063
It's that boy.

691
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:33,125
Methinks you have
a soft spot for him.

692
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,330
Yeah

693
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:38,466
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.

694
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:42,170
I care about one thing,
and one thing only!

695
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,735
Flint's trove.

696
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:46,838
You think I'd risk it all
for the sake...

697
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:50,475
of some nose-wiping
little whelp?

698
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:52,178
What was it now?

699
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:57,121
"Oh. You got the makings
of greatness in ya"

700
00:48:57,156 --> 00:48:58,646
Shut your yap!

701
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:03,184
I cozied up to that kid
to keep him off our scent.

702
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:05,457
But I ain't gone soft.

703
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:07,487
Land ho!

704
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,233
There it is!

705
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:18,967
Feast eyes and click heels
if you got 'em.

706
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,406
Where the devil's me glass?

707
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:39,116
Jimbo.

708
00:49:42,492 --> 00:49:46,427
Playing games, are we?

709
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:48,453
Yeah.

710
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:50,555
Yeah, we're playing games.

711
00:49:50,598 --> 00:49:57,560
Oh, I see. Well, I was never
much good at games.

712
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:01,198
Always hated to lose.

713
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,209
Me, too!

714
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:05,766
Yaaah!

715
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:10,773
Right-o...

716
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:17,677
Blast it all

717
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:24,751
Change in plan, lads!

718
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,919
We move now!

719
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:34,457
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.

720
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:36,991
With pleasure, Captain.

721
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:51,524
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.

722
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:53,992
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.

723
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:55,151
Doctor, familiar with these?

724
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:57,919
Oh, I've seen...
well, I've read...

725
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,926
No. No. No, I'm not.

726
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:07,661
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.

727
00:51:07,704 --> 00:51:09,194
Morph! Give me that!

728
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:15,271
Oh, you're taking
all day about it.

729
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:25,548
Oh! Stop them!

730
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,858
Hey, you!

731
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,190
To the longboats, quickly!

732
00:51:48,937 --> 00:51:50,870
Rrr-yeah!

733
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:55,774
Morph! No!

734
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:02,440
Chew on this,
you pus-filled boils!

735
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:11,318
Did you actually aim for that?

736
00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:12,981
You know, actually, I did.

737
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:21,356
Oh, blast it.

738
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:25,560
Doctor, when I say "now",
shoot out the forward cable.

739
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,725
I'll take this one.

740
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,428
Morph. Here! Morph!

741
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:32,163
Morph!

742
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:34,229
Morphy, come here.

743
00:52:34,273 --> 00:52:37,298
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.

744
00:52:37,342 --> 00:52:39,775
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.

745
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,107
Come here, boy. Morph!

746
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:43,409
- Come on!
- Morph! Morph, here!

747
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:44,573
- Morphy!
- Morph!

748
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,015
Now!

749
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:08,262
Jim!

750
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,833
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.

751
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:16,596
That's it! Come to papa!

752
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,166
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!

753
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:24,012
Captain!
Laser ball at 12 o'clock!

754
00:53:54,337 --> 00:53:56,201
Oh, my goodness.

755
00:53:56,238 --> 00:53:58,604
That was more fun than
I ever want to have again.

756
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,767
That's not one of my...

757
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,369
gossamer landings.

758
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:06,038
Captain!

759
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:09,913
Oh, don't fuss.

760
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:13,144
Slight bruising. That's all.

761
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:15,379
Cup of tea,
and I'll be right as rain.

762
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,580
Mr. Hawkins.

763
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,216
The map if you please.

764
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,728
Morph!

765
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:27,423
Morph!

766
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:29,192
Morph, where's the map?!

767
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,726
Are you serious?!
It's back on the ship?

768
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:39,561
Stifle that blob and get low.

769
00:54:41,141 --> 00:54:43,541
We've got company

770
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,975
We need
a more defensible position.

771
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:53,176
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

772
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:56,177
Aye, Captain.

773
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:59,313
Steady, steady.

774
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:01,949
Now, let's have a look at that.

775
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:43,967
Oh, this is fantastic!

776
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,036
A carbon-based life form
come to rescue me at last!

777
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,071
I just want to hug you
and squeeze you...

778
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:50,877
and hold you close to me.

779
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:54,147
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?

780
00:55:54,186 --> 00:55:55,914
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

781
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:59,548
It's just I've been marooned
for so long.

782
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,251
I mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.

783
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,123
For heaven's sakes,
after a hundred years...

784
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,788
you go a little nuts!

785
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,593
I'm sorry. Am I...

786
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:11,029
I am...

787
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:14,694
My name is...

788
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:21,304
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.

789
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,036
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

790
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,702
- And you are?
- Jim.

791
00:56:25,744 --> 00:56:27,268
Oh, what a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

792
00:56:27,312 --> 00:56:29,542
- It's Jim.
- Anyway...

793
00:56:29,581 --> 00:56:31,047
Look, I'm kind of
in a hurry, OK?

794
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:33,675
I got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

795
00:56:33,717 --> 00:56:36,913
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates!

796
00:56:36,953 --> 00:56:40,012
I don't like them.
I remember Captain Flint.

797
00:56:40,055 --> 00:56:42,319
This guy had such a temper.

798
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,450
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

799
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:47,427
I think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

800
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:49,224
I'm not a therapist,
and anyway...

801
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:51,389
but I... you let me know
when I'm rambling.

802
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,762
But that means... but wait.

803
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,164
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

804
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,861
- Treasure?
- Yeah, Flint's trove?

805
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:58,870
You know,
loot of a thousand worlds.

806
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:00,837
It's... well, it's...

807
00:57:00,872 --> 00:57:04,399
it's all a little...
little... little fuzzy.

808
00:57:04,442 --> 00:57:08,036
Wait. I... I r-r-remember.

809
00:57:08,078 --> 00:57:10,136
I do. I... treasure!

810
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:13,080
Lots of treasure
buried in the centroid...

811
00:57:13,115 --> 00:57:15,139
centroid... centroid
of the mechanism.

812
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:18,448
And there was this big door
opening and closing...

813
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:20,510
and opening and closing...

814
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:22,146
and Captain Flint
wanted to make sure...

815
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,781
nobody could ever
get to his treasure...

816
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:26,815
so I helped him...

817
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:29,419
Data inaccessible! Reboot!

818
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:31,656
Be? Ben? Ben!

819
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:34,290
Reboot! And you are?

820
00:57:34,332 --> 00:57:35,696
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?

821
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:37,166
I want to say Larry.

822
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:39,362
The... the centroid
of the mechanism, or...

823
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:42,565
I'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

824
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:42,672
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.

825
00:57:42,673 --> 00:57:45,697
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.

826
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:47,174
You haven't found it, have you?

827
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:50,905
My missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

828
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:55,472
Look, B.E.N., I really need
to find a place to hide, OK?

829
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:59,542
So I'm just gonna be,
you know, moving on.

830
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:03,043
Oh, so, well, then...

831
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:06,956
I guess... this is good-bye?

832
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:11,893
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.

833
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:16,956
So go ahead and...
I do understand.

834
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:20,456
I do. Bye-bye.

835
00:58:23,605 --> 00:58:26,072
Look,
if you're gonna come along...

836
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:27,802
you're gonna have
to stop talking.

837
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:31,436
Huzzah! Oh, this is fantastic!

838
00:58:31,478 --> 00:58:35,243
Me and my best buddy
are lookin' for a...

839
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,749
Being quiet.

840
00:58:38,784 --> 00:58:41,081
And you have to stop
touching me.

841
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,782
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.

842
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,880
OK. Now, I think
that we should...

843
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:50,017
Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search...

844
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:54,553
would you mind if we made
a quick pit stop at my place?

845
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,564
Kind of urgent.

846
00:58:56,598 --> 00:59:00,124
BEN. I think
you just solved my problem

847
00:59:04,238 --> 00:59:06,171
Pardon the mess. People

848
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:07,331
You'd think
in a hundred years...

849
00:59:07,373 --> 00:59:09,204
I would've dusted
a little more often...

850
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:11,573
but, you know,
when you're batchin' it...

851
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,204
you tend to, let things go.

852
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,475
Isn't that sweet?

853
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:19,779
I find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

854
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,647
How about drinks
for the happy couple?

855
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,845
Oh, No.

856
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,786
Thank you, we don't drink...

857
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,085
and, we're not a couple.

858
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:32,626
Look at these markings.

859
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,992
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

860
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:38,156
I suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants...

861
00:59:38,198 --> 00:59:39,927
of an ancient culture.

862
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:41,455
Mr Hawkins

863
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,435
stop anyone
who tries to approach.

864
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,027
Yes, yes. Now listen to me...

865
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,267
stop giving orders for a few
milliseconds and lie still.

866
00:59:50,307 --> 00:59:52,400
Very forceful, Doctor.

867
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:54,501
Go on. Say something else.

868
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:54,715
Hey. Look! There's
some more of your buddies!

869
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,945
Hey. Look! There's
some more of your buddies!

870
00:59:57,984 --> 01:00:00,952
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!

871
01:00:06,156 --> 01:00:10,353
Stop wastin' your fire!

872
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:13,885
Hello. Up there!

873
01:00:16,398 --> 01:00:18,093
Jimbo?

874
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:21,499
If it's all right
with the captain...

875
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,436
I'd like a short word with ya.

876
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:28,066
No tricks,
just a little palaver.

877
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:30,803
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

878
01:00:30,843 --> 01:00:31,969
Pestilential...

879
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,070
Captain.

880
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:39,550
That means... that he thinks
we still have it.

881
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:50,391
Morphy! I wondered
where you was off to.

882
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:58,594
Oh, this poor old leg's
downright snarky...

883
01:00:58,632 --> 01:01:01,600
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

884
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,306
Whatever you heard
back there...

885
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:12,605
at least the part
concerning you...

886
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:16,510
I didn't mean a word of it.

887
01:01:16,546 --> 01:01:20,675
Had that bloodthirsty lot
thought I'd gone soft...

888
01:01:20,716 --> 01:01:23,150
they'd have gutted us both.

889
01:01:25,286 --> 01:01:29,814
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right...

890
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:35,158
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

891
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:37,628
Yeah?

892
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,756
You get me that map...

893
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,562
and...

894
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,093
an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

895
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,141
Boy.

896
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,839
You are really something.

897
01:01:57,879 --> 01:02:00,574
All that talk of greatness...

898
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:04,209
light coming off my sails...
what a joke.

899
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,047
Now, just see here, Jimbo...

900
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:07,314
I mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

901
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:08,718
Stick to it, right?

902
01:02:08,755 --> 01:02:10,722
Well, that's just
what I'm gonna do.

903
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:12,383
I'm gonna make sure
that you never see...

904
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:15,052
one drabloon of my treasure!

905
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:18,620
That treasure is owed me,
by thunder!

906
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:23,031
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

907
01:02:23,066 --> 01:02:28,162
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

908
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:31,639
Now, mark me.

909
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:35,301
Either I get that map
by dawn tomorrow...

910
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:39,472
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons...

911
01:02:39,513 --> 01:02:43,312
to blast ya all
to kingdom come!

912
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:46,374
Morph, hop to it.

913
01:02:47,752 --> 01:02:49,219
Now!

914
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:53,552
Oh, blast it!

915
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,996
Gentlemen...

916
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:10,969
we must stay together and...

917
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:12,835
and...

918
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,670
And what? What?!

919
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,232
We must stay together
and what?!

920
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:22,770
Doctor,
you have wonderful eyes.

921
01:03:22,814 --> 01:03:24,406
She's lost her mind!

922
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:25,676
Well, you gotta help her.

923
01:03:25,716 --> 01:03:28,048
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

924
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:30,450
I mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

925
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:32,113
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

926
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,622
You can't help people
with a doctorate.

927
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:36,180
You just sit there,
and you're useless.

928
01:03:36,224 --> 01:03:38,488
It's OK, Doc.

929
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,256
It's all right.

930
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:43,695
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly
how to get out of this.

931
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:46,858
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

932
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:50,526
Jim, any thoughts at all?

933
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:53,663
Without the map, we're dead.

934
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,672
If we try to leave, we're dead.

935
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,699
- If we stay here...
- We're dead!

936
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:01,210
We're dead! We're dead!

937
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:10,011
Well, I think that Jimmy could
use a little quiet time.

938
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:13,282
So I'll just slip out
the back door.

939
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:15,515
- Back door?
- Oh, yeah.

940
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,716
I get this delightful breeze
through here...

941
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:19,020
which I think is important...

942
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,457
because ventilation
among friends...

943
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:23,053
What is all this stuff?

944
01:04:23,095 --> 01:04:25,358
You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

945
01:04:25,397 --> 01:04:27,627
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

946
01:04:27,665 --> 01:04:29,360
Not a clue.

947
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:31,800
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
I found a way out of here!

948
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,303
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

949
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:37,238
- I'll be back.
- Cannonball!

950
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,865
Woof.

951
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:49,639
- So, what's the plan?
- B.E.N., quiet.

952
01:04:53,753 --> 01:04:55,118
OK, here it is.

953
01:04:55,155 --> 01:04:58,681
We sneak back to the Legacy,
disable the laser cannons...

954
01:04:58,724 --> 01:05:00,384
and bring back the map.

955
01:05:00,425 --> 01:05:01,653
That's a good plan.

956
01:05:01,692 --> 01:05:03,284
I like that plan.
The only thing is...

957
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:05,760
I'm wondering,
how do we get there?

958
01:05:05,796 --> 01:05:07,229
On that.

959
01:05:18,473 --> 01:05:19,906
Ben.

960
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:23,000
Sorry. Sorry Sorry

961
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:32,110
OK, I'll get the map.
You wait here.

962
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,812
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize
laser cannons, sir!

963
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:36,319
Ben! Ben!

964
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:39,151
A pirate's life for me

965
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:45,449
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?

966
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:48,190
All we gotta do is find
that one little wire.

967
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,892
Oh, mama.

968
01:05:56,736 --> 01:05:58,465
Yes.

969
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,636
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.

970
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:02,800
OK, fixing.

971
01:06:02,842 --> 01:06:05,810
That stupid robot's
gonna get us all... killed.

972
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:08,108
Cabin boy.

973
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:37,867
Whoops OK. Don't panic

974
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:40,235
Breathing in breathing out

975
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,246
This has gotta be cannons.

976
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:05,815
Maybe not.

977
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,975
Come on, come on, come on.

978
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:32,673
No!

979
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:34,977
Oh, yes.

980
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:38,143
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.

981
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:41,814
Rraar!

982
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,685
Tell him yourself!

983
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:56,660
Back you go, you naughty plug!
Oh!

984
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,967
Morph?

985
01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:09,669
Laser cannons disconnected

986
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,267
Captain Jimmy, sir!

987
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:13,404
Gee, that wasn't so tough.

988
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:23,421
Doc! Doc, wake up!

989
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,656
I got the map.

990
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:31,962
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.

991
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:38,901
Thanks for showing us
the way, boy.

992
01:08:47,012 --> 01:08:49,412
What's this sorry stack
of metal?!

993
01:08:49,448 --> 01:08:50,744
Not the face!

994
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:53,649
You're just like me, Jimbo.

995
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:56,778
Ya hates to lose.

996
01:09:05,161 --> 01:09:07,526
What the devil's the...

997
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:13,226
Open it.

998
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,306
I'd get busy.

999
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:44,551
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?

1000
01:09:50,997 --> 01:09:54,990
Tie him up and leave him
with the others till we... what?

1001
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,625
You want the map...

1002
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:59,500
you're taking me, too.

1003
01:10:07,477 --> 01:10:09,308
We'll take 'em all.

1004
01:10:31,663 --> 01:10:34,359
It's OK, Morph. It's OK.

1005
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:36,298
Jimmy,
I... I don't know about you...

1006
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:40,167
but I'm starting to see my life
pass in front of my eyes.

1007
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,193
At least, I think it's my life.

1008
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,366
Was I ever dancing
with an android named Lupe?!

1009
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,534
B.E.N., shh.

1010
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:49,736
This isn't over yet.

1011
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:53,413
We're gettin' close. Lads

1012
01:10:53,447 --> 01:10:56,711
I smell treasure a-waitin'.

1013
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:05,180
Where is it?

1014
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:09,716
I see nothing! One great, big
stinking hunk of nothing!

1015
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,660
What's going on, Jimbo?

1016
01:11:12,696 --> 01:11:15,563
I don't know.
I can't get it open.

1017
01:11:15,598 --> 01:11:18,293
We should've never
followed this boy!

1018
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:19,767
Hey!

1019
01:11:19,802 --> 01:11:21,564
I'd suggest you get

1020
01:11:21,602 --> 01:11:23,729
that gizmo going again.
And fast!

1021
01:11:23,771 --> 01:11:27,069
Let's rip his gizzard
right out right now!

1022
01:11:27,107 --> 01:11:29,735
Throw him off the cliff!

1023
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:53,226
Oh, have mercy.

1024
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:57,028
The Lagoon Nebula?

1025
01:11:57,064 --> 01:12:00,625
But that's halfway
across the galaxy.

1026
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:04,803
A big door

1027
01:12:04,838 --> 01:12:06,964
opening and closing

1028
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,672
Let's see.

1029
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,167
Kinapis.

1030
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,840
Montressor spaceport.

1031
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,018
So that's how Flint did it.

1032
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:28,250
He used this portal to roam
the universe stealing treasure.

1033
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:30,688
But where'd he stash it all?

1034
01:12:31,959 --> 01:12:35,122
Where's that blasted treasure?!

1035
01:12:35,162 --> 01:12:37,322
Treasure! Treasure!

1036
01:12:37,363 --> 01:12:39,354
It's buried in the...

1037
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:43,732
Buried in the centroid
of the mechanism.

1038
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:47,568
What if the whole planet
is the mechanism...

1039
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:51,870
and the treasure is buried
in the center of this planet?

1040
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:58,603
And how in blue blazes
are we supposed to get there?

1041
01:12:58,647 --> 01:13:02,104
Just open the right door.

1042
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:22,131
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1043
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:35,279
The loot of a thousand worlds.

1044
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:41,411
We are going
to need a bigger boat!

1045
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:57,159
This is all seeming
very familiar.

1046
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,793
I can't remember why

1047
01:14:02,835 --> 01:14:04,132
B.E.N., come on.

1048
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,602
We're getting out of here, and
we're not leaving empty-handed.

1049
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:08,799
But... but, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1050
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,836
A lifetime of searching.

1051
01:14:13,877 --> 01:14:16,936
And at long last...

1052
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:20,810
I can touch it.

1053
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:22,043
Do you know what's strange?

1054
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,983
I can't tell you how
frustrating this is, Jimmy...

1055
01:14:24,019 --> 01:14:25,509
'cause there's something just...

1056
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:27,645
it's nagging
at the back of my mind.

1057
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,914
- Captain Flint?
- In the flesh!

1058
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:36,758
Well, s-sort of,
except for skin, organs...

1059
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:39,491
or anything that... that... that
resembles flesh...

1060
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:41,521
that's not there.

1061
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:43,624
And yet it's so odd. You know?

1062
01:14:43,668 --> 01:14:46,727
I remember there was
something horrible

1063
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,829
Flint didn't want
anyone else to know

1064
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:52,864
but I... I just can't
remember what it was

1065
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:56,274
Oh, a mind
is a terrible thing to lose!

1066
01:14:58,446 --> 01:15:00,936
B.E.N.,
I think I just found your mind.

1067
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:02,175
Hold still.

1068
01:15:02,215 --> 01:15:05,412
Jimmy, your hands
are very, very cold.

1069
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:10,854
Hello.

1070
01:15:10,889 --> 01:15:13,483
You know, Jimmy,
I was just thinking...

1071
01:15:13,525 --> 01:15:16,049
I was just think...

1072
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:19,119
It's all flooding back!
All my memories!

1073
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:20,891
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits...

1074
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,831
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

1075
01:15:25,101 --> 01:15:28,092
Speaking of which...

1076
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:31,163
Flint wanted to make sure...

1077
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:32,604
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure...

1078
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,902
so he rigged
this whole planet...

1079
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:37,239
to blow higher than
a Kalepsian kite!

1080
01:15:48,019 --> 01:15:49,919
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!

1081
01:15:49,954 --> 01:15:51,477
You go back and help
the captain and Doc!

1082
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:54,854
If I'm not there in 5 minutes,
leave without me.

1083
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:58,053
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.

1084
01:15:58,094 --> 01:16:01,221
Unless he looks at me
like that.

1085
01:16:01,262 --> 01:16:02,593
Bye, Jim!

1086
01:16:09,103 --> 01:16:12,503
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1087
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:13,664
No!

1088
01:16:23,147 --> 01:16:25,876
Come back here, ya blighters!

1089
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:45,662
All my life, I dreamed
of an adventure like this.

1090
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:47,689
I'm just sorry...

1091
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:50,929
I couldn't have been
more helpful to you.

1092
01:16:50,969 --> 01:16:52,937
Oh, don't be daft.

1093
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:56,701
You've been very helpful.
Truly.

1094
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:01,938
I feel like such
a useless weakling...

1095
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:04,538
with abnormally thin wrists.

1096
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,774
Excuse me, brutish pirate.

1097
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:09,780
Yes, you. I have a question.

1098
01:17:09,818 --> 01:17:12,047
Is it that your body
is too massive...

1099
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:13,610
for your teeny-tiny head...

1100
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:16,087
or is it that your head
is too teeny-tiny...

1101
01:17:16,122 --> 01:17:18,989
for your big, fat body?

1102
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:21,117
I pummel you good!

1103
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,458
Yes, I'm sure you will,
but before you do...

1104
01:17:23,495 --> 01:17:26,520
I have one more question.
Is this yours?

1105
01:17:34,771 --> 01:17:36,965
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!

1106
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:39,964
Jimbo!

1107
01:17:41,176 --> 01:17:45,010
Aren't you the seventh wonder
of the universe?

1108
01:17:45,046 --> 01:17:47,479
Get back!

1109
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:55,520
I like you, lad,
but I've come too far...

1110
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:57,920
to let you stand
between me and me treasure.

1111
01:18:17,839 --> 01:18:20,535
Oh, no, you don't!

1112
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:30,442
What?

1113
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:35,984
Jimbo.

1114
01:18:38,856 --> 01:18:40,982
Reach for me now!

1115
01:18:41,023 --> 01:18:43,992
Reach!

1116
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:45,789
I... I can't!

1117
01:18:54,602 --> 01:18:56,296
I...

1118
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:06,003
Oh, blast me for a fool!

1119
01:19:28,772 --> 01:19:30,569
Silver, you gave up?

1120
01:19:30,607 --> 01:19:34,474
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.

1121
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:36,340
Aloha. Jimmy!

1122
01:19:38,647 --> 01:19:40,478
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes...

1123
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:43,506
and thirty-four seconds
till planet's destruction!

1124
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,847
You're doing fine, Doctor.

1125
01:19:44,885 --> 01:19:47,114
Now ease her over
gently... gently!

1126
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:52,685
We were better off
on exploding planet!

1127
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,924
Take us out of here, metal man!

1128
01:19:56,961 --> 01:19:58,451
Aye, Captain!

1129
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:04,863
Captain, you dropped from
the heavens in the nick of...

1130
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,630
Save your claptrap
for the judge, Silver!

1131
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:19,706
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!

1132
01:20:19,746 --> 01:20:21,508
Thrusters at only 30%
of capacity.

1133
01:20:21,547 --> 01:20:23,481
30%? That means we're...

1134
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:26,609
We'll never clear
the planet's explosion in time.

1135
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:37,391
- We gotta turn around.
- What?

1136
01:20:37,427 --> 01:20:40,328
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!

1137
01:20:40,363 --> 01:20:42,660
Pardon me. Jim.
But didn't that portal open

1138
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:44,859
onto a raging inferno?!

1139
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,868
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.

1140
01:20:47,902 --> 01:20:50,564
I'm gonna open a different door

1141
01:20:51,905 --> 01:20:53,202
Captain, really, I don't see
how this is possible...

1142
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,400
Listen to the boy!

1143
01:20:55,442 --> 01:20:58,001
One minute, twenty-nine seconds
till planet's destruction!

1144
01:20:58,043 --> 01:21:01,534
- What do you need, Jim?
- Just some way to attach this.

1145
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:04,070
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.

1146
01:21:05,683 --> 01:21:07,912
There you go.

1147
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,145
There you go.

1148
01:21:10,253 --> 01:21:12,652
OK. Now,
no matter what happens...

1149
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:15,156
keep the ship heading
straight for that portal.

1150
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:18,057
Fifty-eight seconds!

1151
01:21:24,932 --> 01:21:27,024
Well, you heard him!

1152
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:30,399
Get this blasted heap
turned 'round!

1153
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,994
Doctor,
head us back to the portal.

1154
01:21:33,038 --> 01:21:34,403
Aye, Captain.

1155
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:58,753
Go to the right! The right!

1156
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:02,386
I know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!

1157
01:22:04,597 --> 01:22:06,461
Twenty-five seconds!

1158
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,834
No! No!

1159
01:22:16,305 --> 01:22:18,102
Come on, lad.

1160
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:22,407
Seventeen seconds!

1161
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:38,787
Seven

1162
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:41,883
six five four

1163
01:22:41,926 --> 01:22:44,451
three... two...

1164
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:55,527
Yeah!

1165
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:58,562
You done it. Jimmy!

1166
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:02,200
You done it, boy!

1167
01:23:02,242 --> 01:23:04,836
Didn't I say the lad
had greatness in him?

1168
01:23:17,087 --> 01:23:20,784
Unorthodox,
but ludicrously effective.

1169
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:22,689
I'd be proud to recommend you

1170
01:23:22,725 --> 01:23:26,421
to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you

1171
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:29,396
Just wait until your mother
hears about this!

1172
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:31,591
Of course, we may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

1173
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:35,500
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!

1174
01:23:35,536 --> 01:23:36,832
I know you don't like
touching...

1175
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:40,101
but get ready for a hug,
big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!

1176
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,607
Hey, you hugged me back.

1177
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:48,441
Oh, I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

1178
01:23:54,685 --> 01:23:57,653
Does anyone have a tissue?

1179
01:23:59,095 --> 01:24:02,257
- Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
- I know.

1180
01:24:02,297 --> 01:24:04,561
You never quit. Do you?

1181
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:07,328
Jimbo!

1182
01:24:07,368 --> 01:24:09,427
I was merely
checking to make sure...

1183
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,597
our last longboat
was safe and secure.

1184
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,401
Well...

1185
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:20,171
that should hold it.

1186
01:24:20,212 --> 01:24:23,703
I taught you too well.

1187
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:29,241
If you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1188
01:24:29,286 --> 01:24:34,382
Little morphy here,
he's a free spirit.

1189
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:38,153
Being in a cage,
it'd break his heart.

1190
01:24:55,774 --> 01:24:59,174
What say you ship out
with us, lad?

1191
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:01,540
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver...

1192
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:06,343
full of ourselves
and no ties to anyone!

1193
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:12,916
You know,
when I got on this boat...

1194
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:17,049
I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second...

1195
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:21,423
but, I met this old cyborg...

1196
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:24,918
and he taught me that
I could chart my own course.

1197
01:25:27,598 --> 01:25:29,190
That's what I'm gonna do.

1198
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:35,865
And what do you see
of that pal of yours?

1199
01:25:35,906 --> 01:25:37,395
A future.

1200
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,034
Why...

1201
01:25:40,076 --> 01:25:45,103
look at ya,
glowing like a solar fire.

1202
01:25:45,146 --> 01:25:47,875
You're something special, Jim.

1203
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:52,044
You're gonna rattle the stars,
you are.

1204
01:26:00,892 --> 01:26:03,792
Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

1205
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:12,998
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?

1206
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,195
See ya around.

1207
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:27,271
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

1208
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:32,579
I need you to keep an eye
on this here pup.

1209
01:26:34,953 --> 01:26:37,580
Will ya do me
that little favor?

1210
01:26:37,621 --> 01:26:39,179
Aye-aye, Captain.

1211
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:48,289
Oh, and one more thing.

1212
01:26:49,765 --> 01:26:52,096
This is for your dear mother...

1213
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:55,227
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1214
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:57,437
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1215
01:26:57,438 --> 01:27:00,565
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1216
01:27:00,607 --> 01:27:03,166
Why, Jimbo, lad...

1217
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:06,075
when have I ever done otherwise?

1218
01:29:12,204 --> 01:29:16,731
It's good to see the sun
and feel this place

1219
01:29:16,774 --> 01:29:20,972
This place I never thought
would feel like home

1220
01:29:21,012 --> 01:29:23,275
And I ran forever

1221
01:29:23,313 --> 01:29:25,508
Far away

1222
01:29:25,549 --> 01:29:30,144
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone

1223
01:29:30,186 --> 01:29:33,916
Somehow the world has changed

1224
01:29:33,955 --> 01:29:36,082
And I've come home

1225
01:29:36,124 --> 01:29:40,355
To give you back the things
they took from you

1226
01:29:40,394 --> 01:29:42,384
And I feel you now

1227
01:29:42,428 --> 01:29:44,623
I'm not alone

1228
01:29:44,664 --> 01:29:50,898
I always know where you are

1229
01:29:50,936 --> 01:29:53,335
When I see myself

1230
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:59,866
I always know where you are

1231
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:04,846
Where you are

1232
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,940
And I found something
that was always there

1233
01:30:08,983 --> 01:30:13,578
Sometimes it's got to hut
before you feel

1234
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:17,988
But now I'm strong.
And I won't kneel

1235
01:30:18,024 --> 01:30:22,016
Except to thank
who's watching over me

1236
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:26,224
And somehow I feel so strong

1237
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:30,199
And I've begun to be the one

1238
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:32,463
I never thought I'd be

1239
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:34,663
And I feel you now

1240
01:30:34,704 --> 01:30:37,137
I'm not alone

1241
01:30:37,172 --> 01:30:43,235
I always know where you are

1242
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:45,802
And when I see myself

1243
01:30:45,846 --> 01:30:52,181
I always know where you are

1244
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:57,586
Where you are

1245
01:30:57,622 --> 01:31:01,149
Now it's all so clear

1246
01:31:01,192 --> 01:31:03,489
And I believe

1247
01:31:03,527 --> 01:31:07,394
That everything's been
opened up to me

1248
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,489
And I feel you now

1249
01:31:09,532 --> 01:31:11,829
I'm not alone

1250
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,834
I always know

1251
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:20,397
I always know where you are

1252
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,772
And when I see myself

1253
01:31:22,809 --> 01:31:29,145
I always know where you are

1254
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:31,172
And when I feel the sun

1255
01:31:31,216 --> 01:31:37,744
I always know where you are

1256
01:31:37,787 --> 01:31:40,221
And when I see myself

1257
01:31:40,256 --> 01:31:46,490
I always know where you are

1258
01:31:46,528 --> 01:31:52,226
Where you are
