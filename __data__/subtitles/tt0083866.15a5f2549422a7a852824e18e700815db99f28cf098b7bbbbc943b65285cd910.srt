1
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,632
Ready?

2
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:11,097
Ready.

3
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,570
Wait, Mom. Don't look.
Okay.

4
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,747
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

5
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,087
That's great.

6
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,502
Stay here.

7
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:00,472
Ouch.

8
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,932
Stop that! No! Don't!

9
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,399
Ouch.

10
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:07,357
It's a fake knife. It's a fake.

11
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,402
Ouch.
Okay.

12
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:16,608
All right.

13
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,288
You look great!

14
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:21,951
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,750
Thank you.

16
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:35,221
Be back one hour after sundown. No later.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,805
'Bye.

18
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,688
Gertie, come here. Come on.

19
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,256
Trick or treat?

20
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,387
Trick or treat?

21
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,576
Home. Home.

22
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,500
Home.

23
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:56,127
Be back one hour after sunset. No later.

24
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,178
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

25
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,337
You got to cover me.

26
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,931
Well, come on. Help me.

27
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,512
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

28
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,127
It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!

29
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,258
E.T!

30
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,056
Not so high! Not so high!

31
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,348
Don't crash, please.

32
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:03,846
I really can't believe you did this.

33
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,275
Your father's going to hear
about this one.

34
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,540
Mexico.

35
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:09,368
Boo!

36
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,546
Trick or treat?

37
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,137
Bull's-eye.

38
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,685
Good shot.

39
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,443
Where's Elliott?

40
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,021
I'm asking you a question.

41
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,912
Anyways, why would Elliott go to the forest?

42
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,200
Why would he do such a thing?

43
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,084
Get in the car.

44
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,414
Get in the car, now.

45
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,124
E.T., it's working.

46
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,296
It's working!

47
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,799
Home.

48
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,515
You did it!

49
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:49,928
It's working!

50
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:51,846
Home.

51
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:56,267
E.T., it's working!

52
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:42,274
We have to go now, E.T.

53
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:44,945
We're so late already.

54
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,784
We have to go home now, E.T.

55
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,210
You should give them some time.

56
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,633
Ouch.

57
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,969
You could be happy here.

58
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,012
I could take care of you.

59
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,513
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

60
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,730
We could grow up together, E.T.

61
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,281
Home.

62
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:34,862
Home.

63
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:09,528
Home.

64
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,533
Home.

65
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,516
E.T?

66
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,272
E.T?

67
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,824
How was he dressed when last seen?

68
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,542
He was dressed as a...

69
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,124
...hunchback.

70
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,049
Hunchback.

71
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:17,968
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

72
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,591
Any family problems or recent arguments?

73
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,846
My husband and I just separated recently...

74
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,812
...and it hasn't been easy on the children,
but...

75
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,558
My father's in Mexico.

76
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,942
But run away, I...

77
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:44,368
Where would he have gone?

78
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:45,783
Elliott.

79
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,664
Oh, Elliott!

80
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:51,747
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

81
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,253
Oh, my. You're so hot.

82
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,462
Run up and draw him a bath. Quick, Gert.

83
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,218
Sorry I yelled at you.

84
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,013
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

85
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:10,429
Is he here?

86
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:15,395
You've got to find him.
Where is he?

87
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,943
In the forest.

88
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:20,404
At the bald spot.

89
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,864
You've got to find him.

90
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,864
E.T!

91
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:19,785
E.T!

92
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,175
E.T!

93
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:04,077
No!

94
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:05,757
No!

95
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,618
Mom, would you come with me?

96
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:40,541
What is it?

97
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,416
Mary, just come with me.

98
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,413
Michael, what?

99
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,915
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- What are you talking about?

100
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,498
Swear the most excellent promise
you can make.

101
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:51,921
Michael.

102
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,053
That's terrific.

103
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,144
Mom.

104
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,657
We're sick.

105
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,201
I think we're dying.

106
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,951
Michael.
Mom, it's okay.

107
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,166
Downstairs.

108
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,629
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

109
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,581
He won't hurt you.

110
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,384
Michael, get her downstairs.

111
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,178
It's the man from the moon.

112
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,256
The man from the moon!

113
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:45,937
You don't know him! You don't know him!

114
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,894
We can't leave him alone.

115
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,058
This is my home!

116
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:24,241
Home.

117
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,317
Home.

118
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:11,490
The Collagen Unit,
report to the Blue Level immediately.

119
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:47,313
Does he sleep?
I don't know.

120
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,446
What's the matter with Elliott?

121
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:52,816
Have you noticed any sweating?
No.

122
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,075
Has it lost hair?
He never had any hair.

123
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:58,158
Are the children all right?

124
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,871
Did it build or write anything?

125
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:02,455
No.

126
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:06,122
You say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

127
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:10,379
He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

128
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,212
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

129
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,841
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

130
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:23,976
We've identified
his primary carrier protein.

131
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,609
It's definitely not albumin.

132
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:28,694
The testing shows no deficits
on FNF and HTS testing.

133
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,824
EEG analysis shows complete coherence
and synchronization of brainwave activity...

134
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:34,237
...between subjects.

135
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:44,958
There's no response at 20 per kilo.
Let's move to hypertonic saline.

136
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,289
Cut five per kilo.

137
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:54,419
You have no right to do this.

138
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:57,675
You're scaring him.

139
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:59,553
You're scaring him!

140
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:01,054
Respiratory rate: 12.

141
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:03,931
Good air entry
but decreased tidal volume on the boy.

142
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:07,723
Put him on 025 liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

143
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,106
Temperature's dropped
from 20 to 17 degrees.

144
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,520
Get a hypothermia blanket
and some rags.

145
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,238
Leave him alone.

146
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:17,989
Leave him alone. I can take care of him.

147
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,409
...and set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

148
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,489
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

149
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,583
He's not refusing at all.
He needs anatropic support.

150
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,246
PH is down to 7.03.

151
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:31,500
He's got a metabolic acidosis. It could be sepsis.

152
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,588
We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

153
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:37,168
He needs broad spectrum coverage.

154
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,265
Elliott.

155
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,975
I've been to the forest.

156
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,818
He shouldn't talk now.

157
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,984
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

158
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,491
Elliott, that machine...

159
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:04,034
...what does it do?

160
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,616
The communicator?

161
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,619
Is it still working?

162
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,164
It's doing something.

163
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:16,800
What?

164
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,544
I really shouldn't tell.

165
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,506
He came to me.

166
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:25,008
He came to me.

167
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:28,937
Elliott, he came to me, too.

168
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:33,683
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

169
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,608
I don't want him to die.

170
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,073
What can we do that we're not already doing?

171
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,738
He needs to go home.

172
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,696
He's calling his people...

173
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,163
...and I don't know where they are.

174
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,334
He needs to go home.

175
00:22:56,381 --> 00:23:00,165
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

176
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:06,014
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

177
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:09,510
It's a miracle...

178
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:13,515
...and you did the best that anybody could do.

179
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm glad he met you first.

180
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,700
He's got DNA.

181
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,701
He's got DNA.
DNA?

182
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,543
He doesn't have four nucleotides like
we do. He has six.

183
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,747
I've got de-synchronization
of the two brain wave activities.

184
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:42,170
E.T!

185
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:45,710
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
Blood pressure's back up.

186
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,638
E.T.

187
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,599
Elliott.

188
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,184
He's speaking.
He's talking.

189
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:55,848
E. T...

190
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:58,100
...stay with me.

191
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,188
Please.

192
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,069
Stay.

193
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,691
Together.

194
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:08,357
I'll be right here.

195
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:10,777
I'll be right here.

196
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,075
Stay...

197
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:19,294
...Elliott.

198
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,416
Stay.

199
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:25,842
Stay.

200
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,013
Stay.

201
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,387
Stay.

202
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:38,012
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow.

203
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:39,729
How's the boy?

204
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,020
He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

205
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:47,814
They're separating.
Boy and creature are separating.

206
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:51,441
What does that mean?
Boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

207
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,405
E.T., answer me, please.

208
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,408
Please.

209
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,113
Just relax.

210
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:07,805
No!

211
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,442
E.T., don't go!

212
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,897
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

213
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:19,159
We can't get a pulse or blood pressure.
He's not breathing.

214
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,872
Leave him alone! You're killing him!

215
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,662
Leave him alone!

216
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,580
Let's move it!

217
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,878
Get the boy out.

218
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,500
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

219
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,513
You're killing him! You're killing him!

220
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,391
You're killing him! He came to me!

221
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,102
Any pulses?

222
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,561
He came to me!

223
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,653
Minimal breath sounds.

224
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,571
Calm down. Calm.

225
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,410
Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium?

226
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,749
Getting a pulse?

227
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,324
Compressed air. Compressed air's fine.

228
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:19,002
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

229
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:21,802
Defibrillate him.

230
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:28,848
Everybody, stand clear.
Clear.

231
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,645
We're losing him.

232
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,775
Quiet.

233
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,649
It's still defib.
Okay, let's go.

234
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:39,279
Let's go. Let's go.

235
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,157
Elliott?

236
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,160
Mom.

237
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,923
Let's continue CPR, please.

238
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,439
Would you people stand back?

239
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:30,280
Something's happening.

240
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,530
- They're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

241
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,534
Something is definitely happening.

242
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,454
Anybody have any ideas?

243
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,380
EKG's flat.
I'm going to call it.

244
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:45,006
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

245
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,799
I'm calling it. What time do you have?
15:36.

246
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:50,214
15 hours, 36 minutes.

247
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:52,267
Okay.

248
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,518
Let's pack him in ice.

249
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,348
Let's leave.

250
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:05,752
Is he dead, Mama?

251
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:08,041
I think so, sweetheart.

252
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,384
Can we wish for him to come back?

253
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,138
Yeah.

254
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:16,098
I wish.

255
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,428
I wish, too.

256
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:31,147
Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

257
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:38,035
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

258
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,993
He received intravenous lidocaine...

259
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:43,833
...intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip...

260
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,873
...2.7 percent sodium-chloride solution...

261
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,085
...catheters from the "A" line.

262
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,088
The intravenous line should be sent for culture.

263
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:55,882
He was monitored with a...

264
00:30:55,971 --> 00:31:00,882
...EEG and an EKG, he was defibrillated...

265
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,681
They're going to have to take him away now.

266
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:06,178
They'll just cut him all up.

267
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,437
Would you like
to spend some time alone with him?

268
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:29,959
Could we all step out for a minute,
please?

269
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:26,554
Look at what they've done to you.

270
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,477
I'm so sorry.

271
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:38,776
You must be dead...

272
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:42,449
...because...

273
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,368
...I don't know how to feel.

274
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,989
I can't feel anything anymore.

275
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,708
You've gone someplace else now.

276
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,421
I'll believe in you all my life.

277
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,725
Every day.

278
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:16,804
E. T...

279
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,814
...I love you.

280
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,304
Oh, my God.

281
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,519
E.T. Phone home.

282
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:07,739
Phone home.

283
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,318
Phone home.

284
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,532
Does this mean they're coming?

285
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:13,078
Yes.

286
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:18,743
E.T. Phone home. E.T. Phone home.

287
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,241
Stay.

288
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:22,121
Shut up.

289
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,292
Phone.

290
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:25,338
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

291
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,877
Phone! Phone!

292
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,759
Would you shut up?

293
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:31,133
Phone home. E.T. Phone home.

294
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:33,973
E.T. Phone home.

295
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,060
Phone home.

296
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,300
Phone home.

297
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:39,932
Elliott.

298
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:42,763
Stay.

299
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:44,269
Stay.

300
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:02,036
Elliott, why don't you come with me?
No.

301
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:05,585
No.

302
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:10,414
It's all right.

303
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,302
Would you like the flowers?

304
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,091
He's alive! He's alive!

305
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:24,138
He's glowing right here.

306
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,741
Are they gone, Mama?

307
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,490
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

308
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,825
What boys?

309
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:44,499
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

310
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,211
Give it to me now, Gertie.

311
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,387
Oh, my God.

312
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:08,348
Give me a hand with this.

313
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:18,691
- Where's your mask?
- Back here.

314
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,902
Well, get it on!
I'm trying!

315
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,038
Who are you?

316
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,753
I'm driving.

317
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:34,959
Open the door, son.

318
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,379
- There's a guy out here. What do I do?
- What are you waiting for? Let's go!

319
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,049
Let's get out of here!

320
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,136
I've never driven forward before!

321
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:57,359
Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground
at the top of the hill.

322
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:58,562
Let's do it!

323
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:01,241
Come on, Michael!

324
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:22,093
We'll all die, and they'll never give me my license.

325
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:26,516
Where's the playground?

326
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,474
It's near the preschool!

327
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:31,099
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets.

328
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:33,181
Mom always drives me.

329
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:34,894
Son of a bitch.

330
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:04,467
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

331
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:08,381
To the spaceship to the moon.

332
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,016
Quiet!

333
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,804
Oh, my God.

334
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:16,226
Stop the van!

335
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,984
Don't pull them off!

336
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:35,578
That did it!

337
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:26,954
Okay. He's a man from outer space...

338
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:29,464
...and we're taking him to his spaceship.

339
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:31,878
Well, can't he just beam up?

340
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:34,011
This is reality, Greg.

341
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,552
Keep her back!
No!

342
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:41,642
Hold her back!

343
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:44,483
No!

344
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,026
Where are they?

345
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:48,027
There's nobody here.

346
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,030
Where are we going?

347
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,663
To the forest!

348
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,121
Follow me!

349
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:37,484
We got them at the bottom of the hill.

350
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:55,003
This is Unit 302.

351
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,929
We've cut the kids off at the bottom of the hill.

352
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,741
Let's split up.

353
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,328
Okay!

354
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:36,127
Hang on!

355
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:58,440
We made it! Oh, shit!

356
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:39,311
Tell me when it's over!

357
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:53,474
Home.

358
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:43,188
Stop the car, Mama!

359
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:44,602
They're over there!

360
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:46,400
They're over there!

361
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:05,043
I just wanted to say goodbye.

362
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:08,587
He doesn't know goodbye.

363
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:13,333
Be good.

364
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:15,876
Yes.

365
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,250
Thank...

366
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:47,334
...you.

367
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,039
You're welcome.

368
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:17,692
Come.

369
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,495
Stay.

370
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:35,965
Ouch.
