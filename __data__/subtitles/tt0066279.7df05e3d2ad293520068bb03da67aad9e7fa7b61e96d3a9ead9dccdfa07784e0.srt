than when we first came.

329
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:24,558
- That's silly.
- Course it's silly.

330
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:27,933
So it's you, Pete.

331
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,016
- It's you.
- It's me what?

332
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,599
It's you that's been putting
the coal in the shed.

333
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,641
But where from Pete,
for heaven's sake?

334
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,516
From the coal heap of course,
they've got stacks of it there.

335
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:42,641
But that's stealing!
Don't you remember your catechism?

336
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,641
"Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"

337
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,099
It wasn't stealing.
It was mining.

338
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:49,933
I took from the top.
That's mining, not stealing.

339
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,219

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,724
Right.

- Of course, Doctor.
- Right.

round the corner. That's too late.

657
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,474
We could go round
and wave to the train.

658
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,224
We might wave anyway.

659
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,766
No. They'd only think it was us as usual,
we've waved so often before.

660
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,974
- Flannel petticoats!
- I beg your pardon?

661
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,391
- Flannel petticoats.
- Of course! Take them off.

662
00:57:56,225 --> 00:57:59,308
- Now.
- You're not going to tear them, Pete?

663
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,433
- Oh, shut up
- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.

664
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,599
If we can't stop the train,
there'll be an accident with people killed.

665
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:08,599
Now sticks, come on.

666
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:35,433
- I'll have two. It was my idea.
- They're our petticoats!

667
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:39,141
What's it matter who waves what
if we can only stop the train.

668
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,724
Stand firm and wave like mad.

669
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,808
Keep off the line, Bobbie.

670
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:56,641
They won't see us.
It's all no good.

671
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:01,558
- Stand off the line, Bobbie.
- It's all no good.

672
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:06,724
- Stand back!
- Not yet. Not yet!

673

- Stop!

674
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,808
Stop!

675
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,266
- Stand back.
- Stop!

676
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:31,433
Stop!

677
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:33,558
- Stop!
- Stop!

678
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:37,224
Stop.

679
00:59:39,517 --> 00:59:41,433
Stop...

680
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:44,099
Stop.

681
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,599
Stop. There's been an earthquake.
Don't move you'll all be killed.

No, the kids and bloomin' missus.

802
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:48,391
I've sold another story, darlings,

any more, he's got other things to keep.

but the kids and the bloomin' missus.

810

- His wife and children, Bobbie.
- It's the same thing, isn't it?

811
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:15,724
Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ
of endearment, isn't it?

812
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,308
- Term of endearment, Phyl.
- Yes.

813

We thought we'd make
a nice birthday for him.

And we agreed that next bun day
we'd ask if we could.

816
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,300
It would be rather nice to write his name
on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?

817
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:32,099
- Perks isn't a very pretty name.
- Albert's his other name, I asked once.

818
01:10:32,225 --> 01:10:33,808
I think Albert's a pretty name.

819
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,224
What's the matter with that?

820
01:10:41,392 --> 01:10:43,474
What about flowers?

821
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,224
He's got lots of flowers of his own,
hasn't he?

822
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:49,224
Yes, but it's always nice
to be given them.

823
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,349
Let's all just sit and think.

824
01:10:51,475 --> 01:10:55,974
No one's to speak
until they've thought of something.

825
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:04,099
- I've got it.
- What?

826
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:07,558
- Perks is so nice to everyone, right?
- Right.

827
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:11,266
So there must be lots of people
who'd like to help make him a birthday.

828
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,099
Mother said
we weren't to ask people for things.

829
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:16,433
For ourselves, she meant,
not for other people.

830
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:18,308
I think we should ask Mummy first.

831
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:20,974
There's no harm in it,
it depends how you do it.

832
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,308
I only hope Mr. Perks won't be offended
and think it's charity.

833
01:11:24,434 --> 01:11:26,266
Poor people can be very proud,
you know.

834
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:29,266
It's not because he's poor,
it's because we're fond of him.

835
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:31,872
All right, I'll look out some things
that Phyllis has outgrown.

836
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,433
- Will that do?
- I'm sure he'd love that.

837
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,641
Come back tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do.

838
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:39,641
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

839
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:40,933
Thank you, bye bye.

841
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:47,058
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

842
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,766
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

Ssh, be quiet!

910
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:55,308
I don't care. I won't stand it.
I tell you straight.

911
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:58,224
But, it's them children
you make such a fuss about,

not if it was angels from heaven.

We got on all right all these years
and no favours asked.

924
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:34,641
Right, you can tell me
what you mean by it.

925
01:16:34,767 --> 01:16:38,224
Have I ever complained of being short
as you starts this charity with me?

926

We thought you'd be so pleased, Mr. Perks.

927
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,683
I'll never try and be kind to anyone else
as long as I live.

928
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:46,641
- No, I won't. Not never!
- We didn't mean any harm.

so much as what you does.

We thought you'd love it.
We always have things on our birthdays.

931
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,535
Oh ay, from your own relations,
that's different.

932
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:54,974
No, not just our relations.

933
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,785
They're from all sorts of people
in the village.

934
01:16:56,809 --> 01:16:59,183
- And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.
- We did.

935
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:14,099
So you've been telling the neighbours
that we can't make both ends meet.

936
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:18,099
Now you've disgraced us as deep
as you can in the neighbourhood,

937
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:21,141
you can take that pack of tricks
back where it came from.

938
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,974
I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.

939
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,099
I don't doubt that you meant it kind

940
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:31,308
but I'd rather not be acquainted with you
any longer, if it's all the same to you.

941
01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:37,391
Look here.
We'll go if you like

942
01:17:37,517 --> 01:17:40,308
and you needn't be friends with us
any more, but...

943
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:43,391
We'll always be friends with you,
even though you're nasty to us.

944
01:17:43,517 --> 01:17:47,808
But before we go, let us show you
these labels to put on the things.

945
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:49,433
I don't want to see no labels

946
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:51,933
except proper luggage labels
in me own walk of life.

947
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:55,683
- Please let Bobbie show you the labels.
- All right, go on.

948
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:58,766
We wrote down everything
everybody said

949
01:17:58,892 --> 01:18:01,474
when they gave us the things
with the people's names on.

950
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,724
Because Mother said
that we ought to be careful because...

951
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,690
Well I wrote down what she said
and you'll see.

952
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:07,849
That's from Mother.

953
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,433
She thought Mrs. Perks might like
some of Phyllis' things.

954
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:15,641
"I can't do much..."

955
01:18:20,017 --> 01:18:24,933
Well that's all right.
I mean, your ma's a born lady.

956
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:27,099
We'll keep the little frocks
and what-not, Nell.

957
01:18:27,225 --> 01:18:28,349
Yes, Albert.

958
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:32,266
Then there's the perambulator
and the gooseberries and sweets.

959
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:33,808
They're from Mrs. Ransome.

960
01:18:33,934 --> 01:18:38,183
I can't send the pram back, Bert,
and I won't so don't ask me.

961
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:40,183
I'm not asking anything.

962
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:43,099
Then there's the shovel.
Mr. James made that for you himself

963
01:18:43,225 --> 01:18:45,183
and he says...

964
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,141
Oh, where is it?
Oh, yes, here.

965
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:50,224
- No er, you can read it.
- He says,

966
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,933
"You tell Mr. Perks it is a pleasure
to make a little trifle for a man

967
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:57,266
"as is so much respected."

968
01:18:57,392 --> 01:18:59,516
He's a good chap, that.

969
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:02,516
He's a very good chap, that.

970
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:05,099
He's not bad at all, that chap.

971
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:07,433
And everybody who gave anything
said they liked you

972
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,599
and thought it was
a very good idea of ours.

973
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:15,516
And nobody said anything about charity
or anything horrid like that.

974
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:18,974
We thought that you'd love to know
how fond everybody is of you.

975
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:23,849
And I've never so unhappy
in all my born days.

976
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,516
Goodbye.
Come on.

977
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:28,599
Stop!

978
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:36,641
I take back every word I've said
contrary to what you'd wish.

979
01:19:36,767 --> 01:19:38,474
- Nell?
- Yes, Albert.

980
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,099
Put the kettle on.

981
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:42,891
We'll take away the things
if you're unhappy with them.

982
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:44,224
I'm not unhappy about'em.

983
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,849
I don't know if I was ever better pleased.

984
01:19:47,975 --> 01:19:51,516
...Not so much with the presents
though frankly they're an A. 1 collection

985
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:53,641
but the kind respect
of our neighbours.

986
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:57,224
- That's worth having, eh Nell?
- I think it's all worth having...

987
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,683
And you've made a most ridiculous fuss
about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.

988

No, I haven't.

989
01:20:02,392 --> 01:20:04,868
If a man didn't respect himself,
no one wouldn't do it for him.

990
01:20:04,892 --> 01:20:07,641
But everyone respects you.
They all said so.

991
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:10,349
We knew you'd like it
once you understood.

992
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:16,933
Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?

- Yes, dear.

- Now if it had been charity...
- Oh, drat charity, Bert.

1014
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:42,766
Nobody won't offer you charity
however much you was to want it.

1015
01:21:42,892 --> 01:21:46,099
That were just friendliness,
that were.

1016

I reckon it's what people call
loving kindness.

Hello, Mr. Perks, how do mean?

Well I found these magazines, you see,

they're only collecting dust and...

Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.

There was a man in the office

Daddy always said
he didn't quite trust him.

1139
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:51,974
His mother's dead,
his father's in Northumberland.

1140
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,058
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,
won't you?

1141
01:33:54,184 --> 01:33:56,599
I told him I was sure you'd want us
to have him here.

1142
01:33:56,725 --> 01:34:00,058
- You always want to help everybody.
- Come along.

1143
01:34:10,392 --> 01:34:12,266
I'm glad you brought him here.

1144
01:34:12,392 --> 01:34:16,058
- Let's get him to bed.
- It will hurt a bit, won't it?

1145
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:21,683
I hope you don't think I'm a coward if
I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.

1146
01:34:21,809 --> 01:34:23,558

any more trouble.

There now!
Fancy not thinking of that, hm?

1173
01:35:57,725 --> 01:36:01,099
- Any hot water, Mrs. Viney?
- Righto love.

You all right?
There we are, that's it.

Well I never did!

1176
01:36:14,975 --> 01:36:17,558
This, my dears,
is Jim's grandfather.

Our own old gentleman!
I'm so awfully glad it's you.

1178

it could have been anyone.

You're not going to take
Jim away though, are you?

Not at present.

1182
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,683
Your mother has most kindly consented
to let him stay here.

1183
01:36:32,809 --> 01:36:37,308
I thought of sending a nurse but your
mother said she'd nurse him herself.

1184
01:36:37,434 --> 01:36:40,641
But we won't have anything to eat
if Mother doesn't write.

1185
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:42,766
That's all right, Peter.

1186
01:36:42,892 --> 01:36:44,641

01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:47,849
- Of course.
- Then I may tell them our arrangement.

1188
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:49,599
Sit down, my dears.

1189
01:36:52,059 --> 01:36:56,474
Your Mother, my dears, has consented
to give up her writing for a while

1190
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,808
and to become a matron of my hospital.

1191
01:36:58,934 --> 01:37:01,599
Does that mean we'll have to leave
Three Chimneys and the railways?

1192
01:37:01,725 --> 01:37:04,224
No, no, my darling. No.

1193
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:07,058
The hospital is here.

1194
01:37:07,184 --> 01:37:11,974
The Three Chimneys Hospital
and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.

1195
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,599
- Will Mother go on writing again?
- We shall see...

1196
01:37:15,725 --> 01:37:17,951
Perhaps something nice will happen
and she won't have to.

1197
01:37:17,975 --> 01:37:19,974
- But I like my writing.
- I know.

1198
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,099
Don't be afraid I'm going to try
and interfere but one never know.

1199
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:27,391
Very beautiful and wonderful things
do happen, don't they?

1200
01:37:27,517 --> 01:37:31,974
And we live most of our lives
in the hope of them.

1201
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,058
I got your letter my dear,
but it wasn't needed.

1202
01:37:43,184 --> 01:37:47,766
When I read about your father's case
in the papers at the time I had my doubts.

1203
01:37:47,892 --> 01:37:51,849
And ever since I've known who you were,
I've been trying to find out things

1204
01:37:51,975 --> 01:37:54,224
and I have hopes.

1205
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:57,641
- Oh...
- Yes, I may say, great hopes.

1206
01:37:57,767 --> 01:38:00,641
But keep your secret
for a little while longer.

1207
01:38:00,767 --> 01:38:03,974
Wouldn't do to upset your mother
with a false hope, would it?

1208
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:07,266
But it isn't false.
I know you can do it.

1209
01:38:07,392 --> 01:38:10,183
I knew you could when I wrote.
It isn't false hope, is it?

1210
01:38:10,309 --> 01:38:11,974
No, my dear.

1211
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,724
You don't believe Daddy did it?
Oh, say you don't believe he did.
