1
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,180
<i>Tonight is
the fucking night, okay?</i>

2
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,810
We've looked like shit for
years, and we are developing.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,770
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,980
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,440
We're getting out there.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,040
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,690
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,360
Man, speak for yourself.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,490
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,126
just like nobody wanted to fuck
me last year or the year before.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,410
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,610
I think that it's time.

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,700
Oh, really? It's time?

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,950
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,676
we've all been going
to school together?

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,790
I've been building tension.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,346
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,370
Yeah, okay.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,790
And just what would I say?

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,260
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,090
How's his penis?

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,090
Still awesome and big and
throbbing and, uh, like a male penis?"

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,930
They could have broken up,
you never know.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,640
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,270
I'm not doin' that with
Isabel, you know what I mean?

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,520
Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'
the long game with her, okay?

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,520
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna shake out.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,820
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,030
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,490
I show up, I'm in a little suit

31
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,570
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,810
It's probably white, okay?

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,290
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,370
What the fuck happened to her?

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,910
She's washed up.

36
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,880
I mean Jeff has run her ragged.

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,000
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,590
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,090
Josie, tick-tock.

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,356
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,140
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,500
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,590
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,060
I might have a good shot
that way.

45
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,500
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

46
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,250
What the fuck are you wearing?

47
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,530
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,320
I think you wanna be here.

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,740
Who said that?

50
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,416
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,410
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

52
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,910
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,966
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,080
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,556
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,960
You have Munchausen's.

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,670
Look, just follow my lead.

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,050
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh.

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,380
Oh.
You know what?

60
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,806
- Just keep going.
- How was your summer?

61
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,430
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

62
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,910
Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?

63
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,890
This school has such
a gay problem.

64
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,480
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,060
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,980
Like, look at Matthieu.

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,770
Rock on, man. Killin' it.

68
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,070
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

69
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,880
Thanks, bitch.

70
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,070
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

71
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,746
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

72
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,540
- Every show.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,870
Ooh. Popcorn.

74
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,070
Don't mind if I do.

75
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,930
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

76
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,260
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

77
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,470
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

78
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,951
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

79
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,310
yeah, it was good.

80
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,730
What are you guys doing here?

81
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,986
You guys never come to the fair.

82
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,110
What happened to your arm?

83
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,480
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

85
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,110
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

86
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,820
No, I just tripped and I...

87
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,830
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

88
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,370
Did you go to juvie?

89
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,166
<i>- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,716
<i>- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ...It's time to get ready,</i>

91
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,210
<i>get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!</i>

92
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,040
Oh, my God, what did you do?

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,630
<i>And the man
who will lead us to victory</i>

94
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,720
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

95
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,090
<i>shit-eating Huntington Ferrets,</i>

96
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,510
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

97
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,180
Jeff! Have my babies!

98
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,890
Jeff, fill me with your seed!

99
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,066
I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

100
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,690
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

101
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,210
What's the grossest animal?

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,230
Jeff, come sign my tits!

103
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,460
Eat my pussy!

104
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
That's right.

105
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,410
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

106
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,620
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,120
- Take this.
- No.

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,620
Really quick.
This is the moment.

109
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,500
Stop yelling at me!

110
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,260
Could you give that back
really quickly?

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
Hey, Brittany.

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,630
I am loving all the...

113
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,380
holes in your pants.

114
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
Thanks.

115
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,510
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

116
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,710
Thank you.

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,970
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

118
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,020
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,520
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- No, not that.

120
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,150
Brittany.

121
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,826
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel at all tonight?

122
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,150
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

123
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,350
I need to pull trig.

124
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,740
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

125
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,116
I'm gonna say something crazy.

126
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,570
I think you could eat food,

127
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,160
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,490
Mmm, gross.

129
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,160
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

130
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,460
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking disgusting. Ugh.

131
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,420
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

132
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,630
Oh, I don't know.

133
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,176
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

134
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,130
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

135
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,970
- Yes, you could.
- No.

136
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,010
No bun. Okay.

137
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,300
Um, Isabel.

138
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,600
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't think so.

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,430
I think so.
It was really good.

141
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,950
It was super funny.

142
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,460
You're just so...
You're skinny too, as well.

143
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,900
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

144
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah, you're skinny...

145
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,286
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

146
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,120
You probably should eat.

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,716
They're gonna send you to the
hospital with how skinny you are.

148
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,100
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

149
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,966
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

150
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,020
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
Fuck! Fuck!

152
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,720
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,260
You know what? I'm good.

154
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,260
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

155
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,720
If it's not happening here,

156
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,470
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

157
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,690
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

158
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,770
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

159
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,360
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,820
That's the only hope for me.

161
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,360
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,840
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

163
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,746
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

164
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,890
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

165
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,036
We're going to have
to join a church.

166
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,160
He'll be the gay pastor.

167
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,740
My whole life's fucked!

168
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,580
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

169
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,330
but everybody knows he's fruity.

170
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,750
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

171
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,460
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

172
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,130
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

173
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,476
but we try to make it work
for him, but he's not happy.

174
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,710
And yeah, guess what?

175
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,550
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

176
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,930
He's fucking the evangelist!

177
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,850
I don't wanna live like that.

178
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,680
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

180
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,480
- Isabel.
- Leave me alone!

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,036
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

182
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,110
- What?
- Look.

183
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,990
- Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

184
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,400
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

185
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,570
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

186
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,830
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

187
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,160
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

188
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,160
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes, come on.

190
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,790
...Irish Catholic.

191
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,210
And I'm regular Christian!

192
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,960
- Josie, ask her. Come on.
- PJ, stop.

193
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,840
You're hurting my head.

194
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,300
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

195
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,846
And it's giving me PTSD about all
the other times I've had migraines.

196
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,590
- Just do it now.
- No.

197
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,376
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you like a safety ride?

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,410
Isabel.

199
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,180
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

200
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,600
Isabel...

201
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,100
Get out of the car.

202
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,460
You can't tell me what to do.

203
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,310
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- Okay,

204
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,490
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

206
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,740
Move, you prick!

207
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,780
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

208
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,126
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

209
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,700
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

210
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,126
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly, but these aren't overalls.

211
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,460
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

212
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,130
Get out! Come on.

213
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,466
- I feel like we should just drive.
- Drive.

214
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,590
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

215
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,346
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

216
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,610
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

217
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,710
He's gonna move.

218
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,110
- We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

219
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,050
- Drive. He'll move.
- Just drive. Josie, go.

220
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,510
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

221
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,360
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

222
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,630
Jeff?

223
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Jeff!

224
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,570
- Are you...
- Are you okay?

225
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,916
When people move cars,
don't people move?

226
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,530
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

227
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,120
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

228
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,660
- Back up! Back up!
- We didn't even do anything.

229
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,000
No, come here.

230
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
- Man down! Man down!
- You!

231
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,580
Oh, my God.

232
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,466
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

233
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,590
We should go. Let's go.

234
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,050
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

235
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,630
Let's just kind of peel on out.

236
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,130
- Fine.
- What did you do to him?

237
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,050
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

238
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,390
You fucking cowards!

239
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,610
You better fucking run!

240
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,430
- I don't understand.
- What the fuck?

241
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,690
They're not gonna
get away with this!

242
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,360
<i>{\an8}Attention.</i>

243
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,280
<i>The library is out of use again.</i>

244
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Huntington shot up
our remaining books,</i>

245
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,160
<i>so there will be no reading
again this year. Thank you.</i>

246
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

247
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,250
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

248
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,080
I know I won't even digest it.

249
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I have to throw up."

250
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,300
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

251
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,420
She's like, "No, not, just...

252
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,020
Maybe, but not the bun."

253
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,030
Oh, it was just really sweet.

254
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,950
You had to be there.

255
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,090
I was there.

256
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,230
Are you serious?

257
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,940
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

258
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,600
You're the sidekick, not me.

259
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,650
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

260
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,670
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

261
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,280
Thanks.

262
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,956
Do you feel like people are
looking at us? Like, more than usual?

263
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,460
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

264
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,720
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

265
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,370
Hi.

266
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,160
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

267
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,710
What? Yeah.

268
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,466
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- All right, kiddos.

269
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,250
Welcome back to class.

270
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,130
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

271
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,420
That belongs to the school.

272
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,300
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

273
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,550
Nice try, PJ,

274
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,470
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

275
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,470
All right, check it out.

276
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,256
- Today I got a special lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

277
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Do what?

278
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,060
Holy shit. Is he okay?

279
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,460
Hey, you good, man?

280
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,780
What the fuck?

281
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,070
- Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

282
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,326
Meanwhile, back at the ranch...

283
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,570
Okay, so, did he fight back?

284
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,296
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

285
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,046
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

286
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,490
or anything, just let me know...

287
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,216
I heard you did something
to him, I just don't know what.

288
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,466
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

289
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,330
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

290
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,040
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

291
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
That's how, okay?

292
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

293
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,550
Overall bitch.

294
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,380
This is you.

295
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,340
God damn it, Jeff.

296
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,840
What the fuck?

297
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,310
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

298
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,180
<i>Hello, this is Principal Meyers</i>

299
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>with an important
Huntington update.</i>

300
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,730
<i>So, listen to this girl.</i>

301
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,820
<i>Last night, outside the fair,</i>

302
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,610
<i>a Huntington player
followed me home,</i>

303
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,820
<i>pinned me against my car
and punched me in the face.</i>

304
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,820
<i>And now my face
is totally fucked.</i>

305
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,990
Fuck.

306
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,916
<i>We haven't faced the violence
of Huntington for 20 years.</i>

307
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,410
<i>They think they can get
in our heads</i>

308
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,620
<i>by picking on our weak
and defenseless.</i>

309
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,676
<i>Well, we can't let them
break our spirit, folks.</i>

310
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,210
<i>Keep your heads in the game.</i>

311
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,410
They're gonna pork us!

312
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,710
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

313
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,226
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

314
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,720
Oh, great. More violence.

315
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,030
Just what this school needs.

316
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,620
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

317
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,600
- That's class?
- Latte.

318
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Get my shit.

319
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Solid class.

320
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,160
Hey.

321
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,110
Josie, right?

322
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,630
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

323
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,610
Um, weren't you there?

324
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,570
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

325
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,950
- and killed girls in juvie.
- Really?

326
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,410
Um, what did you think
about that?

327
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,950
<i>Excuse me.</i>

328
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,670
<i>Could the ugly, untalented gays</i>

329
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,630
<i>please report
to the principal's office?</i>

330
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,630
Guess that's you guys.

331
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,430
Hello, Principal Meyers. First
of all, I want to say, God bless...

332
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,880
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

333
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,590
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

334
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,050
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

335
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,890
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man this town has ever seen.

336
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,146
Sir, please, look in the mirror.

337
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,640
- Shush.
- Okay.

338
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,060
The homecoming game with
Huntington is nearly a month away.

339
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,616
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

340
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,190
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

341
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,656
- Twenty years.
- Couldn't be clearer.

342
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I think I can explain.

343
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,900
I can explain.

344
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,950
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

345
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,450
Ha! Sure.

346
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,910
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

347
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,250
Yeah, actually.

348
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,330
How come you can't buck up

349
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,040
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

350
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,210
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

351
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,960
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

352
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,550
Did you ever think of that, sir?

353
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,896
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

354
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,160
Okay. What? What? Don't buy
a gun. Nobody said buy a gun.

355
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,060
- Can we just calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

356
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,770
- You know what?
- What?

357
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,310
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

358
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,890
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

359
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,400
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

360
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,670
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

361
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,800
for...

362
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,760
for our self-defense club.

363
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,830
Self-defense... What is that?

364
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,290
- Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

365
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,340
- Well, here's the thing...
- Yes! Yes!

366
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,300
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

367
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,630
A fight club.

368
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,130
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

369
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,330
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

370
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,590
No, we don't. Shut up.

371
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,226
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

372
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,606
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

373
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,470
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

374
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,270
<i>while you perform
The Vagina Monologues.</i>

375
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,990
Just stay in your lane until you're
munching beaver at Wesleyan.

376
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,810
Yes, sir.

377
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,326
I can't believe they're letting
you guys start a fight club.

378
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,530
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

379
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,206
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

380
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,230
We're doing it.

381
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,030
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

382
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,620
Josie, did you see the way that
Isabel and Brittany were looking at us?

383
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,410
Also, you heard
the announcements.

384
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,620
Girls are terrified.

385
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,330
It's perfect. They need this.

386
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

387
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,170
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

388
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,596
Guys do that all the time, okay?

389
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,766
That's the point of feminism.

390
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,070
That's not the point
of feminism.

391
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,840
You also don't care
about feminism.

392
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,316
<i>Your favorite show is Entourage.</i>

393
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,680
You're missing the point!

394
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,856
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

395
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,396
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

396
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,020
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

397
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,520
About juvie?

398
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,526
- Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

399
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,946
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

400
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,190
I just didn't correct you.

401
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,490
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

402
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,956
You try to punch me in the
face, I stop it from happening.

403
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,950
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

404
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,200
Look, this is how we do this.

405
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

406
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,990
Which I've got covered.

407
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,120
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

408
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Hub-bub-bub-bub.

409
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,790
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

410
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,040
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

411
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,590
You know Stella-Rebecca?

412
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,510
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

413
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,636
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

414
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,630
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

415
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,470
- Josie.
- What?

416
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,970
- We're doing this.
- No.

417
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,680
Yeah. Listen to me.

418
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,606
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

419
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,440
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

420
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,100
They are grateful to us.

421
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,650
We build a community, we bond,

422
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,900
we share, we connect.

423
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,900
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

424
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,360
Next thing you know,

425
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,286
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

426
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,590
- Jeffrey!
- Josie...

427
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,700
Isabel knew your name.

428
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,790
- Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

429
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,000
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

430
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,630
we just run the risk of becoming

431
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,716
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

432
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,060
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

433
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,260
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

434
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,930
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

435
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,250
We're the lowest of the low.

436
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,810
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

437
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,770
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

438
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,440
There's a serious lack of
female solidarity at this school.

439
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,650
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

440
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,150
Yeah, I mean, we just felt like

441
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,830
there's a serious lack of
female solidarity at this school.

442
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,710
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

443
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,700
What's your plan here?

444
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,410
I don't need a plan.

445
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,590
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

446
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,880
Okay.

447
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,140
What's up, lads?

448
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,340
What the fuck?

449
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,420
- These girls are ugly.
- Okay.

450
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,930
Where is Stella?

451
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,550
She was booked
for a car convention.

452
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,180
What? It's a Monday.

453
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,850
Um, maybe we should go

454
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,210
before someone cool shows up?

455
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,640
Before I die? Pick one.

456
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,230
Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

457
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,190
I love David Fincher.

458
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,730
- Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

459
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,740
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

460
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,320
and stopped huffing paint.

461
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,160
She'll never stop huffing paint.

462
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,430
So, I thought we'd start...

463
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Um...

464
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,430
- Okay.
- Sorry.

465
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,620
All right.

466
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,870
Listen up, you
cunt-sucking pieces of shit.

467
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,630
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

468
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,460
Um, it's a self-defense club.

469
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,800
It's not really, "Fight."

470
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,380
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

471
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,090
and they're picking on the weak

472
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,760
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

473
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,470
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

474
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,640
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

475
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,940
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

476
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,600
Then, punch-bucket,

477
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,610
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

478
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,770
and we punch you
until you bleed.

479
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,820
Before that, perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

480
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,206
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

481
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,160
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

482
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,240
Juvie was way crazier.

483
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,330
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

484
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,450
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

485
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,290
I get up. I'm blind.

486
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,730
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

487
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,690
Broke her fuckin' nose.

488
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Josie?

489
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,730
Care to share?

490
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,360
Yeah, all right.

491
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,140
Juvie was insane.

492
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,470
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

493
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,450
so I took her outside and
I punched her till she died.

494
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,810
So, you killed a girl?

495
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,690
Uh, no.

496
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,860
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

497
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,200
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

498
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,160
when she came back
to life, so...

499
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,990
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl...

500
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,790
She came back to life.

501
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,550
Mmm. But I remember her being
dead for at least a couple minutes.

502
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,460
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

503
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,630
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

504
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,060
Josie, if you'll step forward.

505
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,380
No, I don't wanna do that.

506
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,556
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

507
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,970
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

508
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,550
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

509
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,896
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

510
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,060
They wanna see the punch.

511
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Who am I gonna punch?

512
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,520
Punch me. Just punch me.

513
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,190
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

514
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
I can punch you.

515
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,770
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

516
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,290
Something people
would always say,

517
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,446
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

518
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,520
Come on up.

519
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh!

520
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,670
Oh, fuck!

521
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,410
Will there an advisor
for this club?

522
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,090
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

523
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,080
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

524
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,140
where we punch each other
in the face?

525
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,110
The Holocaust. It happened.

526
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,800
Yes, it did.

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>But how? The seeds were sown
in the Treaty of Versailles,</i>

528
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,890
which y'all are gonna reenact while
I do some little reading over here.

529
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,780
I mean, he's perfect.

530
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,810
No.

531
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,100
- What?
- No.

532
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,690
Please.

533
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,616
Dude, we're not fucking
doing this. I broke your nose.

534
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,496
Yeah, and I've never had so
many girls look at me in my life.

535
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,610
Fuck! When did you show up?

536
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,110
Hey, guys.

537
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,660
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

538
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,700
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

539
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,666
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

540
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,620
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords and, like, knives

541
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,410
and, like, guns and stuff,

542
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,630
and you taught me how to
punch like that, then I wouldn't die.

543
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,130
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

544
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,380
But, unfortunately,

545
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,220
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

546
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,880
What? Why?

547
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I don't know.

548
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,760
Why? It was just
so empowering.

549
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,050
What was empowering?

550
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,020
Oh, my God, hi. Um...

551
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,270
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

552
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,400
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

553
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Isabel, let's go.

554
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,990
Hi, boo-boo.

555
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,450
I'm so strong.

556
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I mean...

557
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,540
Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.

558
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,050
Great class today.

559
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,050
Hey, uh, girl.

560
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,550
Thanks for coming in today.

561
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,840
We have to come in.
It's class.

562
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,050
Try telling Dimitri Walker that.

563
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,390
Little motherfucker came the first
week and I ain't seen him since.

564
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,980
Dimitri Walker committed suicide

565
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,730
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

566
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,230
Sure, he did.

567
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,650
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted to be our club advisor.

568
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,860
- What kind of club is that?
- It's a women's club.

569
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,800
We talk about women's issues.

570
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,970
For example, periods,

571
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
declining egg count,

572
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,230
skirts...

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,450
Skirts?

574
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,330
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

575
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,630
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

576
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,790
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

577
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,476
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

578
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,300
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

579
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,050
Listen. I'm kind of,

580
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,300
you know, retiling the bathroom.

581
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,970
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

582
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,970
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

583
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,770
Back to the club,

584
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,816
maybe this will be a great
way to take your mind off of stuff.

585
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
Can I be honest?
You're a man

586
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,030
who's not coping
with what's going on.

587
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,440
- Yeah.
- You know what?

588
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,070
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

589
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,280
And here's one thing

590
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,786
- my mom's always said to me.
- Mmm.

591
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,740
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

592
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,370
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

593
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,700
It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

594
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,796
- but you don't even come to the dang club.
- No.

595
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,750
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

596
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,176
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

597
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,170
You just say
you're doing something

598
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,010
and then you don't do
any of those things.

599
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,266
You know what I mean? You
say, "I support women." You don't.

600
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,720
Don't come. Yeah.

601
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,570
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

602
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
- Amazing.
- What?

603
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,810
- Yeah.
- Really?

604
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,160
- Okay.
- So cool.

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,980
How many girls go
to this school, again?

606
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,740
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

607
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,050
Hey, guys.

608
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,780
Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

609
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,910
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

610
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,960
Hey, ladies.

611
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,100
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

612
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,310
All right. Um...

613
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Hello, everybody.

614
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,630
Okay, excuse me.

615
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,090
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

616
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,380
Um...

617
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,610
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

618
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,250
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

619
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,700
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

620
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,170
There are serious rules that
we need to establish, 'kay?

621
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,050
First...

622
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,390
listen.

623
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,890
Second,

624
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,640
be on time.

625
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,210
Yeah.

626
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,090
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

627
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,130
What time is it?

628
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,930
- 3:30.
- 3:30!

629
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,610
Club starts at 3:15.

630
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,200
Not 3:16.

631
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,810
Not 3:17,

632
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,360
but the doors close at 3:15.

633
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,170
No exceptions.

634
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,820
I don't care if you're like...

635
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,660
"Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

636
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,450
because I... I need
to get a full ride

637
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,000
because my mom
lives in a trailer

638
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,250
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

639
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,420
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

640
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,040
Shut up, okay?

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,690
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

642
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,600
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

643
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,890
Nice.

644
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,850
Uh, we're just getting
started here.

645
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,540
So, um...

646
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,406
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

647
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,980
We're gonna do wrestling.

648
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,280
I think I need a volunteer.

649
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,120
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

650
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,230
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

651
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,706
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

652
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,046
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

653
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,290
Don't be late.

654
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,716
- But this week is good...
- Yeah. No worries.

655
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,966
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

656
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,176
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

657
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
This is a self-defense
class, right?

658
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,426
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

659
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,880
against, like, football players.

660
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,960
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

661
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,380
They're gonna pork us.

662
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,470
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

663
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,890
There's a cash prize, right?

664
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,850
I thought this was
to be part of, like,

665
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,240
a local underprivileged
female community.

666
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,060
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

667
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,690
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

668
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,036
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

669
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,400
So, uh, you know, like...

670
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,990
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

671
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,990
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

672
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,410
- Love that.
- Yeah.

673
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,510
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

674
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,250
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

675
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,610
I don't know about this shit.

676
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,000
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

677
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,090
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

678
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,530
- Look.
- We can take it slower.

679
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,950
- Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

680
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,550
Take that route.
Little slower.

681
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,100
Look. You just use your
natural instincts, just come at me.

682
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,360
Whatever you want, 'kay?

683
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,520
Oh, fuck.

684
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,850
Okay.

685
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,480
That's great.
I say that we go again.

686
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,150
- Oh!
- Ow, fuck! My back.

687
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,230
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

688
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,996
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

689
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,616
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

690
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,360
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

691
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
- No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

692
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,956
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

693
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,700
I know that,

694
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,580
you know, this is
a little messy right now

695
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,620
but, like, the only way

696
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,060
that we can learn how to defend
ourselves is by teaching each other.

697
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,380
Huntington is coming.

698
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,310
We need this.

699
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,800
I know that things
might seem scary,

700
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,030
but that's okay, because...

701
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,070
because...

702
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,140
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

703
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,860
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

704
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,230
- Right?
- Yes.

705
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,480
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

706
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,440
You are never gonna get
assaulted on your birthday again.

707
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,200
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

708
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,740
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

709
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,330
Yeah, absolutely.

710
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,530
And for me,

711
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,390
I'll be able
to kill my step dad.

712
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,790
- Awesome.
- Okay.

713
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,270
And if you believe in yourselves

714
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,420
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

715
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,500
I'm like,
"Let's fucking do this!"

716
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

717
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,090
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

718
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,550
So good.

719
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,050
Yeah! Yes!

720
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,450
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

721
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,230
Yes! Yes, queen, slay!

722
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,350
Yes! Yes!

723
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,690
Slay! Yeah!

724
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,430
Cool.

725
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.

726
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,530
Yeah, for sure.

You little bitch,

I told you.

766
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,126
I know. I feel like
if we keep it up,

767
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,910
we can actually take on
Huntington, you guys.

768
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,540
No, if we keep it up,
we can put our fingers

769
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,410
inside of each other. Grow up.

770
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,610
All right.

771
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,120
You know, PJ,

772
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,176
I feel like people are
actually liking more than just

773
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,040
the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

774
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,420
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

775
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,340
No, I mean, seriously, to
have a safe space like this,

776
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,930
it means a lot to people,

777
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,390
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

778
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,140
and actually get
to know these girls,

779
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,640
like, it would be
really important,

780
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,870
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

781
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

782
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,246
- Yeah.
- I love talking about my trauma.

783
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,280
I literally jack off
after every single

784
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,570
- therapy session.
- What?

785
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,370
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

786
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,796
<i>- Don't say "girls." It's you.
- Bonjour.</i>

787
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,750
I just wanted to say

788
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

789
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
It seems so supportive of women.

790
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,710
Especially the hot ones.

791
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,550
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

792
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,510
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

793
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,510
but we're getting a little close
to the game now and, um...

794
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,850
I'm just a bit concerned

795
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,970
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

796
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,370
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

797
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Okay.

798
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,860
So, we know
that the club has been a place

799
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,910
where we can feel
empowered physically,

800
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,700
but we also thought it could be

801
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,370
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

802
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,890
and talk about our feelings.

803
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,640
Okay, so who's been raped?

804
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,010
Just, you know, raise your hand.

805
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,730
Gray area stuff counts too.

806
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,860
Everybody knows the situation
with my step dad.

807
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,940
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

808
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,830
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new step dad, but...

809
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,630
fuck, whatever.

810
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,200
You know?

811
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,530
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

812
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,740
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

813
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,830
And then the form
tells me to call,

814
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,120
so I call and then they say they can't
get involved until he tries to kill me.

815
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,720
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

816
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,540
but that doesn't count.

817
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,630
So, it's just, like, annoying.

818
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,060
Been there.

819
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,460
We've all been there.

820
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,260
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

821
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,550
but I'm more annoyed

822
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,850
that everyone knows me for
being beautiful and popular

823
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,940
and no one knows that I'm
actually smart and super driven.

824
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,910
Like, I literally own a jewelry
business and no one talks about it!

825
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,940
See?

826
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,570
Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

827
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,530
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

828
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,200
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

829
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,120
It's been really, really dark.

830
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,296
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

831
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,630
get to know some new people who
actually want to, like, get to know me.

832
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,591
- I want to bring it back to Brittany for one second.
- I can go next,

833
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,230
if that's okay.

834
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,180
I don't really like talking
about juvie

835
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,100
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

836
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,270
You know, obviously, we
get a lot of props or whatever

837
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,870
'cause people think
it's so bad ass.

838
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,560
But, really wasn't.

839
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,240
I mean, unless you consider getting
hazed horrifically every single night,

840
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,570
like, bad ass. I mean, um,

841
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,950
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

842
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,040
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

843
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,080
fight people basically
every single night.

844
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,290
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

845
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,750
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

846
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,090
and, um, pipes as well.

847
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,300
And, um, we had to just, like,
fight people, sometimes to the death.

848
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,220
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

849
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,490
um, and that guilt probably will,
like, always shackle me forever.

850
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,600
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

851
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,440
Like, I don't have
to just let things

852
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,020
happen to me 'cause of you guys.

853
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,030
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

854
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,610
for what the club
has become and...

855
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,320
Um...

856
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,930
Just especially, you know,
from where we started and, uh...

857
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, sorry.

858
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,620
I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

859
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,870
I've never really,

860
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,290
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

861
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,050
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

862
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm going through a divorce.

863
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,680
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

864
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,180
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

865
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,320
men... men need therapy.

866
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,930
Yeah.

867
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,870
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

868
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
- Hey.
- Hey.

869
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,220
Um...

870
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,010
Thank you, um, for that.

871
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,430
Um...

872
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,040
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

873
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,420
but I was going to study for Mr. G's
women murdered in history test,

874
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,820
if you wanna...

875
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,360
Yeah.

876
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,660
Yeah, okay, sure.

877
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,590
Mom?

878
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,630
Mom?

879
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,030
Oh, hi, honey.

880
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,720
What are you doing home
so early?

881
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Uh...

882
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,480
Are you kidding me?

883
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,150
I had a long day.

884
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,190
Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

885
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,220
First club fundraiser.

886
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,890
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

887
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,310
Hello, ladies.

888
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,810
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

889
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,116
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

890
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,560
It's so weird.

891
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,150
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

892
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,400
Thanks, PJ.

893
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,110
Ah. We're havin' fun.

894
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,700
We're selling panties.

895
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,100
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

896
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Very nice.

897
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,120
Do you wanna, um, celebrate?

898
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,080
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

899
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,970
Um, I can't. Uh...

900
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,670
Isabel and I have plans, so...

901
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,880
You're hanging out with Isabel?

902
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,130
Yep.

903
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,390
Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

904
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,220
I have to keep up.

905
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,560
Hazel, what is wrong?

906
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,030
Are you constipated
or something?

907
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,270
I'm fucking tired.

908
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,600
My mom was up all night
fucking the meat head.

909
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,560
What meat head?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

910
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,156
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

911
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,540
He's like the crybaby.

912
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,900
With the balls?

913
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,300
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

914
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,050
He's like the main guy.

915
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Jeff?

916
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,540
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

917
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,000
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

918
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,670
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

919
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,790
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

920
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,490
I'm good.

921
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,170
Looking good, Stella!

922
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Are you gonna tell her?

923
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,970
Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

924
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,370
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

925
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,650
But isn't every kid from
Rock bridge Falls sent there?

926
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Hit me! Ow!

927
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,380
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

928
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,610
Got it. Thank you.

929
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,200
Jeff!

930
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,550
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

931
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,260
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

932
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,340
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

933
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,730
I wanted to...

934
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,390
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

935
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,330
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

936
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,830
Me too.

937
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,150
I think it's really impressive

938
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,370
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

939
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,830
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

940
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,300
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

941
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,540
You're really, really brave.

942
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,960
No.

943
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,380
No. No, no.

944
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,710
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl.

945
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,910
You're...

946
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Yeah, you're...

947
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,570
really, really brave.

948
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,070
What?

949
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,710
Actually, Isabel, uh...

950
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,650
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

951
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,190
There's something
you maybe should know.

952
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,500
Uh...

953
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,660
I mean it's pretty insane.

954
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,550
Okay.
What... what is it?

955
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,550
I just, I...

956
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,460
I heard Jeff is cheating on you.

957
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,730
Wait...

958
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,100
Wait, what?

959
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,390
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

960
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,480
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

961
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,360
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

962
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,070
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

963
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,950
like, constantly.

964
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,080
I mean, just at it with each
other, which is pretty fucked up.

965
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,160
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

966
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,170
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

967
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,790
Oh.

968
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,140
Thanks.

969
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,100
Jeff so hungy.
Hungy hungy, hungy.

970
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,730
Jeff so hungy.

971
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,950
Swoosh!

972
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,360
What the fuck is this?

973
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,640
Is there pineapple in this?

974
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,820
We talked about this, Janice.

975
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,300
Jeffrey's allergic to pineapple.

976
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,550
Eat a bag of dicks.

977
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,311
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
but this is the last straw.

978
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,690
How was last night?

979
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,850
Uh, bad, probably, I would say.

980
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,050
Wait, really?

981
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,040
She's walking really fast.

982
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
She usually walks a lot slower.

983
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,660
Hi.

984
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,340
Are you having sex
with Mrs. Callahan?

985
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,370
Baby, you look so beautiful.

986
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,540
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

987
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,920
Bad. Are you having sex
with her?

988
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,610
I'm... I'm...

989
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,590
helping her with her taxes.

990
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,150
Aren't you
in eighth grade algebra?

991
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,050
I can't answer that question

992
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,606
because I... I don't know
how to read.

993
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,830
She's asking you to your face!

994
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,270
Fuck, that usually works.

995
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,100
Are you cheating on me again?

996
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,310
Baby, no! No!

997
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,830
No, why would...
why would I do...

998
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,320
That was one time
with your sister, just once,

999
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,610
two, four times.

1000
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,530
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

1001
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,620
I promise you
I am not sleeping with her.

1002
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,120
I literally saw you yesterday.

1003
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,740
Shut up, nerd!
I fucked your mom!

1004
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,850
Mmm. Mmm.

1005
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,870
Wait.

1006
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,670
- Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

1007
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,090
I'm getting revenge.

1008
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,016
I'm gonna fuck up some football
players. And I'm buyin' a gun.

1009
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
Hell yeah.
I'll get my step dad's.

1010
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,140
What about, like, egging?

1011
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,686
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

1012
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,896
Ooh, we could cook 'em
and be like...

1013
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,120
- "You're cooked."
- Yes. Yeah.

1014
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,380
Or what about, like, a bomb?

1015
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,940
Like a...
like a super small bomb.

1016
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,500
I mean, they're super easy
to make,

1017
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,150
and I can just put it
under his car,

1018
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,470
and it can be a distraction.

1019
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,880
Yeah, Hazel, let's do terrorism.

00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,380
Fuck you.

1038
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,516
Sylvie, you can't just throw it.

1039
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,970
You have to fucking jump
with it.

1040
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,780
- I'm trying.
- Okay, watch me. Just...

1041
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,100
Damn, we're, uh...
We're really gonna scare them off.

1042
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,850
Nice! Nice!

1043
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,460
I think I'mma help Isabel
keep watch, so...

1044
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,190
Okay, well,
don't get distracted,

1045
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,050
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

1046
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,010
Thought you might want
some company.

1047
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,850
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1048
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,520
It's nice everybody's here,
like...

1049
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
vandalizing...

1050
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Jeff's house.

1051
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,530
It is nice.

1052
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,900
I, uh...

1053
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,490
Like, how are you doing?

1054
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,270
I mean,
I think it's for the best.

1055
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,400
But I did kind of miss
when he would touch my hair

1056
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,670
and go, like,

1057
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,990
"Shiny, shiny, shiny."
You know?

1058
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,590
I wanted to tell you
this before, but...

1059
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,040
I really appreciated
you fighting

1060
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,850
and speaking loudly
at my boyfriend.

1061
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,130
I really value

1062
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,980
when people use violence
and raise their voices for me.

1063
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,020
It's actually one
of my love languages.

1064
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
- Is the other one gifts?
- The other one is gifts.

1065
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,010
Um, I know

1066
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,780
everything is, like,
really fucked up and...

1067
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,450
you still probably miss Jeff,
which I get,

1068
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,820
but I just think

1069
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,420
you deserve way better, Isabel.

1070
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,280
'Kay, guys.

1071
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,006
Let's make sure we return
or donate these, okay?

1072
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,970
Does anybody know
where the fuck Hazel is?

1073
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,810
Like, 15 minutes?

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,590

Great. What are we supposed

Oh, you don't.
No, it's really all good.

1098
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,050
Jeffrey needed a new car,
anyway, so...

1099
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:48,550
don't worry about it.

1100
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,430
What's wrong, Josie?

1101
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,930
You seem a little off.

1102
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,900
Your club is over.

1103
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,820
You understand?

1104
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,910
Good.

1105
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,656
All right, well,
some of us clearly

1106
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,160
have a different definition
of egging,

1107
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,070
but if we keep our mouths
shut, stay calm, we'll be fine.

1108
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,830
They're gonna shut us down,
aren't they?

1109
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,280
What?

1110
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,950
No. We don't know that.

1111
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,786
- What... Why...
- Principal Meyers will believe

1112
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,370
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1113
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,290
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1114
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,340

1115
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,350

1117
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,170
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1118
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,380

1119
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,270
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

1120
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,760
And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1121
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,550
I mean, that was fucking insane!

1122
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,510
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1123
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,520
Wait. Stop.

1124
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,810
We don't... Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1125
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,900
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1126
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,610
All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1127
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,330
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1128
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,750
No matter what,

1129
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,370
this club has brought me
so much.

1130
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560

1131
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,680
so much more powerful and, um...

1132
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,640
protected.

1133
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,830
Me too.

1134
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,340
- Great.
- Oh, my God, PJ.

1135
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,170
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1136
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,426
what you wanted
out of this group,

1137
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,220
but I think the rest of us did.

1138
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1139
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,140
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1140
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,890
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1141
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,970
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1142
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,680
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1143
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,196
You really think that you're the
reason that we have this club?

1144
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,270
The reason? No.

1145
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,616
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1146
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,900
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1147
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,480
You're really ungrateful.

1148
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,706
You're so lucky that we
even let you be a part of this.

1149
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,380
PJ, you're a liar.

1150
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:54,040
Yeah, well, you have no friends,

1151
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,390
and a skank as a mom, so...

1152
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,940
Hazel.

1153
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,190
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1154
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,710
Hazel.

1155
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,530
Whoa.

1156
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,530
I love God.

1157
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,870
Yes, same.

1158
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,530
Yeah.

1159
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,800
Oh, my God, I always
wanted one of these.

1160
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,330
But my mom says they hide
your figure and make you look ugly.

1161
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,450
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1162
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,350
Like, as a joke or...

1163
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,500
whatever.

1164
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,700
Thanks.

1165
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:25,870
Yeah.

1166
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,390
Wow, you and PJ

1167
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,350
really have been
friends forever.

1168
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,160
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1169
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,980
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1170
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,870
PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I
think she's kind of like a mentor.

1171
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,840
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1172
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,840
She's so, like...

1173
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,260
like...

1174
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,450
You know?

1175
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,650
- Yeah.
- And you're...

1176
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,560
You're so, like...

1177
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,440
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1178
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,530
Josie...

1179
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,060
I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1180
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

1181
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,330
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1182
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,450
Wow.

1183
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,280
This is, um, a total shithole.

1184
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,180
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1185
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,750
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1186
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,150
they give you a tax break.

1187
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,140
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1188
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,430
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1189
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,640
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1190
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,140
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1191
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,230
of the 1999 Rock bridge team
every single night, so...

1192
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,290
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1193
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,680
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1194
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,210
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1195
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,730
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1196
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:15,980
Watch out.

1197
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,370
What?

1198
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,410
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1199
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,690
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1200
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,320
Your wrists are so small, and
the pen is so heavy that I'm like,

1201
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,740
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1202
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,820
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1203
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,950
with all the surface area

1204
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,180
that yours are taking up.

1205
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,290
Wow.

1206
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,836
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1207
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,250
Okay, does this hurt?

1208
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,386
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1209
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,130
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1210
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,596
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1211
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,660
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1212
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Um...

1213
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,910
Uh...

1214
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,370
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1215
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,800
Oh.

1216
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,590
Um...

1217
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,080
Yeah. Um...

1218
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,210
- I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1219
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:36,190
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1220
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,910
Um...

1221
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,500
I wanted to tell you something.

1222
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,190
What?

1223
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,920
Like, something that happened
last night.

1224
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,720
What happened?

1225
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,430
With Isabel.

1226
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Wait.

1227
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,230
Wait, seriously?

1228
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,650
That's... that's amazing.
That's...

1229
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,510
<i>Everybody,</i>

1230
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,270
<i>- even the fucking losers...
- Even the fucking losers!</i>

1231
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,100
<i>...make some noise!</i>

1232
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,650
I thought you were
super Christian.

1233
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,780
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1234
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,746
<i>All right, uh, so we're gonna
do the pep rally.</i>

1235
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,160
<i>First up, cheerleaders.</i>

1236
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,730
Football!

1237
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,390
<i>Whoo! Yeah,
thank you, ladies. Ooh!</i>

1238
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,930
<i>Thank you all for joining us
here today, folks.</i>

1239
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,970
<i>There's been some</i>

1240
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,060
<i>exciting stuff happening
at Rock bridge Falls recently.</i>

1241
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,260
Oh.

1242
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,650
<i>How many of you</i>

1243
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,650
<i>know about that little girl
fight club that could?</i>

1244
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,030
Ay, there go my girls.

1245
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,280
<i>Well, do we have
a surprise for you.</i>

1246
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,620
<i>We're gonna bring...
Where is she?</i>

1247
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,930
<i>Hazel down.</i>

1248
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,420
<i>One of the founding members.</i>

1249
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,750
<i>To show us everything
the club's taught her</i>

1250
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,260
<i>in a fun little challenge.</i>

1251
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,590
- Let's go, Hazel!
- Go, Hazel!

1252
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,450
- What is this?
- I... I don't know.

1253
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,990
<i>Hazel will be fighting Tucker,</i>

1254
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,750
<i>the school's number one boxer.</i>

1255
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,030
Wait, I thought I was gonna be
fighting PJ?

1256
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,030
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but don't be alarmed.</i>

1257
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,830
<i>Girls can do anything
guys can do, right?</i>

1258
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,220
Yeah, kick his ass!

1259
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,890
<i>Ready?</i>

1260
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,790
<i>- Fuck.
- Go.</i>

1261
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,200
Oh, my God.

1262
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,526
- You got this, Hazel.
- Come on, Hazel!

1263
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,460
You got it.

1264
00:57:58,930 --> 00:57:59,970
Shit.

1265
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,520
Whoo! Get him!

1266
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,696
- The fuck are you doing?
- Is she, like,

1267
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,770
sort of winning or...

1268
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,660
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1269
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,780
Fuck.

1270
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,360
Oh. Oh, my God.

1271
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,070
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

1272
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:35,550
<i>You may be wondering how
a girl under the training of...</i>

1273
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,750
<i>of two juvie convicted killers</i>

1274
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,290
<i>can't even stand up for
herself against a regular old guy.</i>

1275
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,600
<i>Well, truth is, they...</i>

1276
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,840
<i>they didn't go to juvie.</i>

1277
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,130
<i>No.</i>

1278
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,810
<i>There's no record of them there.</i>

1279
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,600
<i>And according to Hazel...</i>

1280
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,480
<i>...they never fought
anyone at all.</i>

1281
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,480
<i>And you know what else?</i>

1282
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,130
<i>They didn't start the club
to empower women.</i>

1283
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,160
<i>They did it
to fuck cheerleaders.</i>

1284
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,220
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

1285
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,430
<i>It is such a shame.</i>

1286
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,880
<i>We were really rooting
for you girls.</i>

1287
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,420
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1288
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,090
<i>Okay.</i>

1289
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,340
<i>- Thank you for attending...
- Hazel!</i>

1290
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,106
<i>- ...today's pep rally. Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!
- Is she okay?</i>

1291
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,390
<i>- Hazel!
- Whoo!</i>

1292
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,110
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

1293
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,710
Is that true?

1294
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,190
That's why you started this?

1295
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,860
No, no, no.

1296
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,570
Not... not entirely.

1297
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,280
Not entire... Okay.

1298
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,290
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1299
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,930
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1300
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,250
The point of the club

1301
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,170
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1302
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,300
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1303
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,846
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1304
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,130
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1305
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,900
This is the second wave
all over again.

1306
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,270
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1307
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,730
PJ made me do this.
I didn't want to.

1308
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,130
I would never want to do this.

1309
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,130
You're pathetic, Josie.

1310
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,250
Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1311
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,500
All right, look.

1312
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,880
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1313
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,170
I just look like this.

1314
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,420
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1315
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,340
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked y'all group

1316
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,590
and what y'all stood for.

1317
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,260
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1318
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,600
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1319
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,440
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1320
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,810
Is this about the time I said

1321
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,950
Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?

1322
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,360
Because it's true.

1323
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,610
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1324
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,010
but you never hear about them.

1325
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,030
And then it's like,

1326
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,410
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

1327
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,080
"We, like, make less money."

1328
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,120
"We had to lose
our last names."

1329
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,580
"I love you."

1330
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,716
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1331
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,170
"Oh, I love the mint green
back splash in the kitchen."

1332
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,460
And all of a sudden,

1333
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,340
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1334
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,220
and suddenly, the fucking
kitchen is lime green.

1335
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,680
I think...

1336
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,180
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1337
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,680
Oh, you look confused, like
how I'm confused right now,

1338
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,430
on how you created a fucking
fight club to get some cooch.

1339
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,690
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1340
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:53,650
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1341
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,076
you know what I'm talking about?

1342
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,326
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1343
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,110
of that neck and all type of...

1344
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:01,230
Sorry, I just don't know if you're
supposed to be talking to us like that.

1345
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,660
Just, like, as a teacher...

1346
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,330
Man, I knew women were evil.

1347
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,430
Motherfuckers always tellin'
me like, "No, that's not true."

1348
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,470
But time and time again...

1349
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,010
Women ain't nothing
but the fuckin' devil.

1350
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,300
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1351
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,570
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1352
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:30,430
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1353
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,770
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1354
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,070
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1355
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,610
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1356
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,410
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1357
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,110
and then he wouldn't be so upset

1358
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,626
and then whatever the fuck just
happened would not have happened.

1359
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,490
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1360
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,080
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1361
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,140
Well, I mean, yeah, it was
your idea to start the whole club.

1362
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,840
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1363
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,920
You know that.

1364
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,010
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1365
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,840
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1366
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,600
about girls betting on you
to fight other girls with shivs.

1367
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,480
You're just mad
because I did this.

1368
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,560
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1369
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,020
Without you.

1370
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,946
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1371
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,320
ever.

1372
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,040
I'm the one who made it
happen for you.

1373
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,990
You know what's so funny
about this whole fucking thing,

1374
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,320
all your little schemes,

1375
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,370
all your,
"Oh, we'll have our year

1376
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:33,660
and we'll fuck so many
girls," and whatever?

1377
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,130
Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1378
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,500
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1379
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,170
Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.

1380
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,720
Does it even matter?

1381
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,930
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1382
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,390
Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

1383
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:50,810
Just find some other girl

1384
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,120
to fucking jack off to
and do nothing about.

1385
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,370
Cool. Yeah, I will.

Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1433
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,200
Hey, Rhodes.

1434
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:52,710
Do you have a minute to talk?

1435
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,410
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1436
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,260
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1437
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,410
Like, for advice?

1438
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,410
I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

1439
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,770
You're too old for this shit.

1440
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,130
Girl, when I was in high school,

1441
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,800
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1442
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,090
And back then it was worse

1443
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,970
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1444
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,090
Not for being
gay and untalented.

1445
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,970
Mmm.

1446
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,850
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1447
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,950
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1448
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,810
And I used to say,

1449
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,190
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1450
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:25,600
Look, that's not the point.

1451
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,800
You want some advice?

1452
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,570
Invest in yourself,

1453
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,530
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1454
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,530
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1455
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,860
I just, um...

1456
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,200
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1457
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,620
So, like...

1458
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,370
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1459
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,580
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1460
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,000
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1461
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,810
it's just gotten more sad.

1462
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,630
Okay, um...

1463
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,510
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1464
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,510
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1465
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,710
I wouldn't do that.

1466
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
Why not?

1467
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,890
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1468
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:03,090
Well, I'm guessing they've been fucking
people up for the past month, right?

1469
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,600
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1470
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,236
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1471
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,040
I don't know. Football?

1472
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,110
Game? Tackle?

1473
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,340
Oh, girl.

1474
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,910
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1475
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,010
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1476
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,870
How you don't know...

1477
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,710
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1478
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,880
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1479
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,000
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1480
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,380
It's called quartering.

1481
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,920
I know... I know
what it's called.

1482
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,050
So, tonight, I'm stayin' inside

1483
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,590
and double boltin' those doors.

1484
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,560
If you ever grab a...
Nah, I don't care.

1485
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,690
I didn't understand a word

01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,970
Oh, my God.

1491
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,140
- Hey.
- How did you find me?

1492
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,010
Why are you breathing so heavy?

1493
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,600
Okay. I know we're not
in a great place right now...

1494
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,980
Yeah, because I'm pissed.
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1495
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,360
Okay, well, I just still think
we need to talk

1496
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,270
about everything
that's, like, going on.

1497
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,480
Yeah, cool, well,
I don't wanna hear it, so...

1498
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,570
Okay, maybe you
should reconsider

1499
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,160
because I saw Rhodes,
she says hi, by the way.

1500
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,680
She said this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

1501
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:45,330
Apparently, every time
Huntington plays Rock bridge,

1502
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,540
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

1503
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,830
The pets?

1504
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,830
It's bloodlust, man.
That's not the point.

1505
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,080
Sounds like I should get

1506
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,346
- the fuck out of here now. Okay?
- No.

1507
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,630
PJ, seriously, come on.

1508
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,266
We need to get
the club back together,

1509
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,760
so we can save them.

1510
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,960
What?

1511
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,390
Sorry, you're saying
you want me and then you

1512
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,930
and then all of the girls
that fuckin' hate us

1513
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,140
to get together and save
some fucking football player,

1514
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,560
who we hate?

1515
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,270
Circle of bad vibes.

1516
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,076
Okay, well, obviously, why
would you lay it out like that?

1517
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,100
Because it sounds insane.

1518
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,940
'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1519
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,170
Because we made these girls
trust us and then we humiliated them.

1520
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:25,700
They deserve a shot
at showing everybody

1521
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,330
what they know,
what they learned,

1522
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,890
how fucking cool they are.

1523
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,720
Let's do this for the club.

1524
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,060
What do you say?

1525
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,250
Can we save the damn day?

1526
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,510
Wow.

1527
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:42,710
Pulling out the necklace

1528
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:44,740
- in the final fuckin' hour.
- Well...

1529
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Yeah.

1530
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,480
Mmm. Nice.

1531
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,860
<i>Rock bridge, this is the
most important day of your life.</i>

1532
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,940
<i>Forget your wedding,
forget your funeral,</i>

1533
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:00,690
<i>fuck your bar mitzvah.</i>

1534
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,610
<i>This is what matters.</i>

1535
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,570
<i>Game day, let's do this!</i>

1536
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,930
<i>- Let's go, Vikings!
- We're almost there.</i>

1537
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:15,210
Okay, first off, PJ has
something to say to Hazel, so...

1538
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:18,050
The apology. Do the apology.
Do the apology, instead.

1539
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,670
Okay.

1540
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:22,270
I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

1541
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,050
And I'm sorry

1542
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,930
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

1543
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,850
in front of all of your friends.

1544
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:36,540
And I'm sorry for being
an asshole a lot of the time.

1545
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,440
Most of the... All of the time.

1546
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,950
And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

1547
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:48,380
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1548
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,760
and I really appreciate it.

1549
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,350
Do you forgive me?

1550
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,420
Yes.

1551
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,186
I don't want to interrupt
this gorgeous moment

1552
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,800
but we don't have time now

1553
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,430
because I got information from
a very confidential source

1554
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,100
that Huntington
is trying to kill

1555
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,470
someone on this team tonight.

1556
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,736
What are you even
talking about, Josie?

1557
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,930
Nobody's even over there.

1558
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,850
Oh, my God,
nobody is even over there.

1559
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,600
Well, that is obviously
a red flag.

1560
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,020
Are we not reading that
as a red flag? That's crazy.

1561
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,150
- What?
- Please, Annie.

1562
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,830
Even though
you're a Black Republican,

1563
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,030
you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

1564
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,206
I mean, obviously I know that.
You think I don't know that?

1565
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,030
Then help us figure this out.

1566
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,700
We need to stop the game.
We need to save them.

1567
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,100
Wait, wait, hang on.
Hazel...

1568
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:36,970
we need a distraction.

1569
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,460
Oh, now you want a bomb.

1570
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,420
<i>♪ Hey, here we go! ♪
Oh, fuck.</i>

1571
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,580

1576
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,180
I know you really must
hate me right now,

1577
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,690
but the club needs you.

1578
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,010
To what? Have sex with them?

1579
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,230
Guys, we really,
really need you. We do.

1580
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:03,030
In your fucking dreams, PJ.

1581
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,790
Which you don't deserve to have.

1582
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,280
When you sleep,

1583
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,240
<i>- it should be, like... Total darkness.
- Rock bridge, are you ready?</i>

1584
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,160
- Oh, fuck.
- Wow, okay.

1585
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,360
Okay, wait, seriously,

1586
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,750
maybe if you
just listened to us.

1587
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,420
- Just listen to us. Whoa!
- Brittany.

1588
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,000
<i>- Here comes your team!
- Isabel.</i>

1589
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,130
I wouldn't be asking you
if this wasn't important!

1590
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,590
We don't have time for this.

1591
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,340
- Josie, come on.
- Hazel!

1592
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,846
<i>- Okay, now that you're all...
- Ugh. Uh...</i>

1593
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,110
<i>...warmed up,
I want you guys...</i>

1594
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,380
Is it the red wire?

1595
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,760
Shit, or is it the yellow?

1596
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,220
<i>...Shawshank your way out.</i>

1597
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,646
<i>- Put your hands together...
- You got this, Jeff.</i>

1598
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,896
<i>- ...and shake your tanks.
- You got it!</i>

1599
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,950
Hazel! It's starting!

1600
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,850
<i>Jeff!</i>

1601
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,070
Jeff! Eat my pussy!

1602
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,270
Come on, come on!

1603
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,030
<i>Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!</i>

1604
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:49,400
- Hurry, Hazel!
- It's gonna blow.

1605
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,370
{\an8}- Hazel, come on!
- Hazel!

1606
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:53,830
Hazel, come on!

1607
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,060
- Hazel, it's not working.
- Hazel, it's not going.

1608
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,420
- Oh, no.
- Fuck. Fucking...

1609
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,886
- Maybe turn it off...
- Maybe hit it?

1610
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:04,910
No. Give me space. Stop.

1611
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,230
Turn it off and then back on.

1612
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,650
Jeff!

1613
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:13,800
<i>I want you to rub
Vicks VapoRub on your tanks</i>

1614
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,180
<i>and dance around like
the fruitbats that you are!</i>

1615
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,310
Okay, plan B. We need to get
the cheerleaders to make out.

1616
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,116
Wait, okay, which cheerleaders
do you think?

1617
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,480
It's a distraction.
We need a distraction.

1618
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,780
- Guys.
- Hey, guys.

1619
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,070
Guys, kiss each other.

1620
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,496
Make out.
Make out with each other!

1621
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,560
We need to delay the game.

1622
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,140
Guys! Make out
with each other!

1623
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,840
<i>Everyone, get your guns
out, hide your children</i>

1624
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,650
<i>because here comes Huntington.</i>

1625
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,430
- Fuck you! Bitch!
- What the frick is up?

1626
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,310
- Yeah! Get back!
- Yeah! Wake up, pussy!

1627
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:03,940
Hold me back!

1628
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,060
You're so lucky!
You're so fucking lucky.

1629
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:08,570
Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!

1630
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,770
What do we do?

1631
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,700
Look, look, look.

1632
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,150
Oh, wait. I'm gay.

1633
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,150
Okay, yeah, I'm not.

1634
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,220
I just like gay porn.

1635
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,030
This is nothing
like porn at all.

1636
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,120
Wait.

1637
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,860
Is porn even real?

1638
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,250
Can we cut the gay shit
and get this show on the road?

1639
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:08,460
I came here for some good man-on-man
grappling and slapping football!

1640
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:11,170
<i>Can everybody stop
looking at the dyke parade?</i>

1641
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:16,050
<i>Who do I have to blow to
get this game started already?</i>

1642
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:19,510
<i>- Yes!
- Now make 'em eat a bag of urine cakes.</i>

1643
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:22,140
Look, I found empty
barrels of pineapple juice.

1644
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,270
There is pineapple here.

1645
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,120
So, they're gonna
poison Jeff then.

1646
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,440
Where the fuck is it?

1647
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,070
Fuck, I'm thinking really quick.

1648
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,996
What if it's in their mouths
and they're swishing it around

1649
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,900
and then they're gonna
spit it out mid-game?

1650
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,360
- What?
- I hate to say it,

1651
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,036
but it might have something
to do with their semen.

1652
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,410
Obviously, it does not.
What is wrong with you?

1653
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,910
They kissed on the mouth.

1654
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,290
- With tongue.
- As a distraction,

1655
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,960
and we can do it again
if people are asking.

1656
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,960
- Wait, when was this?
- The bomb didn't work,

1657
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,560
and there was no
other distractions!

1658
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,216
- Yeah, there was...
- And because we were...

1659
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,960
- They're gonna spray the field.
- What?

1660
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,840
- Okay, we're gonna have to run.
- - No!

1661
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,226
- We're gonna have to run. We're gonna have to run.
- We can't run. No!

1662
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,260
No!

1663
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,840
- Oh, my asthma.
- No, please!

1664
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,040
You don't have asthma.

1665
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,850
I feel like I have asthma now!

1666
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,560
Cover the sprinklers.

1667
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,760
I got it.

1668
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Oh, fuck!

1669
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,530
Get back here,
you fuckin' weasel!

1670
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,670
I'm sorry.

1671
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,230
You saved me.

1672
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,520
You're... you're welcome?

1673
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:43,940
Oh, no.

1674
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,740
- I... Would...
- Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh.

1675
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:49,950
Are you okay?

1676
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,780
Yeah.

1677
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,940
- Whoa.
- Hazel!

1678
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,600
- Hazel! Hazel! Look out!
- Hey.

1679
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,010
It's pineapple juice!

1680
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,590
It's pineapple juice!

1681
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,146
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- 'Scuse me.

1682
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:32,100
Turn it off!
Please just turn it off!

1683
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:46,390
Yes.

1684
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,740
Yes!

1685
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,200
Yes, this is the Viking way!

1686
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,220
Yes, thank you, thank you.

1687
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,140
You did it.

1688
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,920
You fucking saved me.

1689
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,230
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1690
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,270
Thanks.

1691
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,120
- What is...
- I mean...

1692
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,310
- Okay.
- I guess we did it.

1693
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,900
We did that shit!

1694
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,100
I mean...

1695
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,180
Really proud of you.

1696
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,040
I'm proud of us.

1697
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,340
I do wanna say, um,

1698
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,410
I feel like you killed that guy.

1699
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:37,080
Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed...

1700
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,280
I think we killed...

1701
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,120
- You killed that guy...
- No.

1702
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,880
- Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.
- No. Oh, my God.

1703
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,560
Yeah, we killed a couple.
We killed...

1704
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,420
we killed a lot of guys.

1705
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,186
I... Let's just...
We'll process it later.

1706
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,210
- Much later.
- Later.

1707
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:50,740
- Yeah.
- Um...

1708
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,900
Do you wanna...

1709
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,200
Yeah.

1710
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,820
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1711
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,400
You don't have to forgive me
at all or anything.

1712
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,070
But I, like, really want
you to know how sorry I am.

1713
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:13,280
I was kind of insane,

1714
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,660
and the sheer amount
of lies I told is...

1715
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,370
is shocking,

1716
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,970
and it doesn't excuse
what I did.

1717
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,810
But I really liked
getting to know you.

1718
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,170
And I still really like you.

1719
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,850
- I just...
- You know, you didn't have to start, like, a whole

fight club just to date me.

1721
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,850
You could have just,
like, talked to me.

1722
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:41,390
Oh. Okay, uh,
I don't really know

1723
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:44,110
how true that is.
