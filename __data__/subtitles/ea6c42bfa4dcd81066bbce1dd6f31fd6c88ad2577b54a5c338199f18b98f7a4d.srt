00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,711
I can't--
Yeah, they're not coming.

350
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,548

00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:52,754
GARFIELD: Huh?

355
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,488
-(harmonica squeals)
-Am I dead?

356
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,526
Are you an angel?

357
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,096
(panting)

358
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,968
Please, take me.

359
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,404
I am ready to go
to that... (sobbing)

360
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:13,373
to that all-you-can-eat buffet
in the sky.

361
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,679
VOICE: What? Listen,
I'm going to swing you out,

362
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:20,849
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

363
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,884
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

364
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,084
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

365
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,687
cutting a rope
over a 40-foot drop?

366
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,987
-(Nolan giggling)
-VOICE: No time.

367
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,724
We got to get out of here
before they come back.

368
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,760
(barking)

369
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,394

370
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,668

Come on, Junior.

372
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,805
(gasping)

373
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,172
-CAT: Wait here, Junior.
-(sirens wailing)

374
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,876
-CAT: I'll be right back.

375
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,444
VOICE: (echoing)
I'll be right back.

376
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,950
(gasps) You.

377
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,786
(stammers) Hey, Junior.

378
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,421
-Huh?
-"Who is he?"

379
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:04,124
This is Vic. My "father."

380
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,561
Look, Junior, I know
how you might be upset.

381
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,228
Upset? Why would I be upset?

382
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,031
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

383
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,066
I'm probably just overreacting.

384
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,402
-(metallic screeching)
-(screaming)

385
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,438
(screeching continues)

386
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,748
Oh, no, not her.

387
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,181
Okay, follow me, Junior.

388
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,984
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

389
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,853
You lost the privilege
of telling me what to do

390
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,120
a long time ago.

391
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,422
-Hello, Vic.
-(Garfield gasping, screaming)

392
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:36,858
Oh, dang it.

393
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,492
Scare cam.

394
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,028
(laughing)

395
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,796
Oh, you should've
seen your faces.

396
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,964
(gasps) Ooh.

397
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,666
(laughing)

398
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,535
Okay, boys, show me.

399
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,202
Hello, Vic.

400
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,705
-(gasping, screaming)
-Oh, dang--

401
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,140
(laughing)

402
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,877
Post that ASAP.

403
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,211
(laughing)

404
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:00,715
(stammering)

405
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:03,083
What? Uh, hey, Jinx.

406
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,420
I haven't seen you since-- Oh.

407
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:10,190
W-Well, no hard feelings,
though, right?

408
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,561
Oh, I don't think so.

409
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,497
I'm a hugger. Oh!

410
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,667
Part of me wants to be mad
at her for kidnapping us,

411
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,035
but you got to love her energy.

412
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,236
(gasps) Where are my manners?

413
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,607
Chop-chop, gentlemen.
Look alive.

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,341

(gargling)

418
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,889
Ah. Perfection.

419
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,958
You know, I was so delighted

420
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,961
that you accepted
my invitation here tonight.

421
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,931
Well, throwing us in a burlap
sack wasn't exactly an Evite.

422
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,899
Vic, you're so quiet.

423
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,702
Are you feline sad?
Cat got your tongue?

424
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,971
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

425
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,007
Excuse me, uh, how do you two
know each other?

426
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,240
Let me handle this, Junior.

427
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,043
Oh, don't "Junior" me.

428
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,979
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

429
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,547
-(scoffs)
-Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

430
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:09,651
Anyway, can somebody please
tell me what is going on?

431
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,019
Well, we really don't
need to get into...

432
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,087
(shushes) I'll take this one.

433
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,722
(clears throat,
breathes deeply)

00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,891
(solemn tune playing)

435
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,061
What?

436
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,462
I'm from a small town
outside London

437
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,332
that you've probably
never heard of.

438
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,202
Oh, I scratched and clawed
my way through hard times

439
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,106
to come here with one dream.

440
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,240

You have to know that.

(laughing)

480
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,352
So, your purpose was
to escape jail

481
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,354
and get involved
with charities?

482
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,091
No. My purpose was... (purrs)

483
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:31,626
revenge.

484
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,827

485
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,562
Oh, I see.
I went the other way with it.

486
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,329
I'm kidding.

487
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,365
Another cat would be
bent on revenge,

488
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,001
but I'm, uh...
Ooh, how would you put it?

489
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:44,839
Evolved, compassionate and
incredibly self-actualized.

490
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,339
Bingo. (laughs)

491
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,408
I had such trouble finding him,

492
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,477
and when I discovered
you were his son,

493
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,514
I had no choice but
to kidnap you to lure him here.

494
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,716
No, listen, I totally get it.
It's-it's all--

495
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,719
It's all part of being
associated with Vic.

496
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:02,455
So, what do you need from him
to make this right?

497
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,991
I simply want him to pay back

498
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,392
the quart of milk
I lost that night,

499
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,727
and we'll call it even.

500
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,829
I can do that.

501
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,030
What he can't do
is raise a child.

502
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,598
-Just one quart.
-Just one quart.

503
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,699
-Done.
-Done.

504
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,134
For every day
I was in the pound.

505
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,236
-What, now?
-Nice twist. Well played.

506
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,771
Uh, how long were you
in the pound again?

507
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,272
Four years, seven months
and two days.

508
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,607
Oh! That long?

509
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,243
All right, I'm gonna do
the math here in my brain.

510
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,111
Uh, the way you do that is...

511
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,847
-Odie?
-(barking)

512
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,850
1,675 quarts of milk.
Exactly right, Odie.

513
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,118
We both came up with it
at the exact same time.

514
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,754
Where am I gonna find
that much milk?

515
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,723
Well, I suggest you go back
to the place

516
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,357
you double-crossed me.

517
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,327
Lactose Farms.

518
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,529
Wow. Well, good luck, Vic.

519
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,599
(chuckles) I'll leave you two
to work out the fine print.

520
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:47,068
We'll just see ourselves out.
Odie?

521
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,805
Ah, no.
You're all going to do this.

522
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,106
What? Wait, why me?

523
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,774
He's the one who abandoned you.

524
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,344
Yes, but this is
more than a one-cat job.

525
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,612
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

526
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,780
of low-life cat burglars
he could ask.

527
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh, I'm sure he does, but if
I'm being completely honest,

528
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,652
seeing how miserable
you make one another

529
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,854
brings me endless satisfaction.

530
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,990
Oh, well, thank you
for your honesty.

531
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,424
And if I don't go?

532
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,629
You can stay and have a
playdate with Roland and Nolan.

533
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:17,732
Okay, boys... (gasps) go play.

534
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:18,966
(growling)

535
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,142
Ma'am, I think
this is an opportunity

536
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,911
to take a deep,
cleansing breath

537
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:33,581
and repeat
your anger management mantra.

538
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:36,851
(coughs)

539
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,388
(clears throat) Anyone else
have any objections?

540
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,290
(gulps) Nope, I'm good.

541
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,658
Thanks for the opportunity.

542
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,593
-Excellent.
-(growling)

543
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,129
Now, you boys have 72 hours.

544
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,564
(glugging)

545
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,566
-(exhales sharply)
-(glass shatters)

546
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,935
Or else.

547
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:56,804
I-I can't believe
this is happening.

548
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,639
I don't see you for years,
and when I do,

549
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,074
you pull me
into a life of crime.

550
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,376
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head, too.

551
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,577
Well, that's the difference
between us,

552
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,746
because I never wanted
to see you again.

553
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,381
Now, I-I totally understand
your anger.

554
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,016
But if you give me
a chance to explain,

555
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,752
you'll see I am not
the bad guy you think I am.

556
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,888
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley.

557
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,790
-It wasn't like that.
-It was exactly like that!

558
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,625
No, it wasn't.
Let me tell you what,

559
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,026
-Junior...
-No, no. Ah!

560
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,962
I don't want to hear it.
This whole thing with Jinx?

561
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:24,497
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

562
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,635
Can't let you do that.

563
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:30,838
We'll be watching you.

564
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,039
Like a hawk.

565
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:34,942
(hawk screeches in distance)

566
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,545
(Garfield yelps)

567
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,883
(groans) Is today a Monday?

568
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,019
'Cause it feels
an awful lot like a Monday.

569
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,087
It's Thursday.

570
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,254
Not to me it's not.

571
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,390
Look, I know this isn't ideal,

572
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,158
but we have to do this.

573
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,794
So let's just try and make
the best of our time together.

574
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,597
Our time together?
What are you talking about?

575
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,132
Once we get this milk,

576
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,267
I want you out of my life.
Forever.

577
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,702
All right, just relax.

578
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:02,937
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

579
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,239
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

580
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,707
This will be
a quick grab and go.

581
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,209
You'll be back home
before you know it.

582
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,744
-(laughs)
-(sighs)

583
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:13,047
So how do we even get
to Lactose Farms?

584
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,448
It's way out in the country.

585
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,283
You ever jumped a train?

586
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,918
I've never jumped.

587
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,788
Look, if jumping a train
is too hard, just say it.

588
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,190
-(scoffs) How hard could it be?
-Exactly.

589
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:26,894
(laughs) This is gonna be fun.

590
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,496
(birds chirping)

591
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,765
JON: (yawns) Garfield?

592
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:31,932
Odie?

593
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,167
Hello?

594
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,737
Garfield, how many times
have I told you

595
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:39,240
to close the refrigerator door?
Gar--

596
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,009
Wait, there's food
on the floor.

597
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:45,112
(gasps) He's never
left food on the floor.

598
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,248
Garfield?

599
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,251
Garfield?

600
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,086
-(door creaks)
-Garfield?

601
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,221
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

602
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,891
Garfield!

603
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,026
-(train horn blowing)
-(Garfield grunting)

604
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:01,395
(groans)

605
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,064
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

606
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:04,899
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

607
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,635
the direction of the sun
and various angles.

608
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:10,371
Yes, I say we jump the train
from right here.

609
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,540
Didn't I just say that?

610
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,907
I've seen it on television
a million times.

611
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,175
We'll need a hundred feet
of rope.

612
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,376
Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay, great.

613
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,744
Uh-huh. Yep.
We'll throw the rope

614
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,046
-over that branch right there.
-Branch. Uh-huh. Got it.

615
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,182
GARFIELD: Can you follow me?
All right?

616
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,683
And then, timing it just right,

617
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,286
we swing over
as the train passes by

618
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,054
and land on top of the car.

619
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,722
-Boom.
-VIC: Or...

620
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,225
-we can do this.
-(screaming)

621
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,094
VIC: Odie, jump, boy.

622
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:34,428
(grunts)

623
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,696
Huh?

624
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,831
Uh-oh.

625
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:37,965
(screaming)

626
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,434
Whoa!

627
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,269
(screaming)

628
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,172
(meowing, whacking)

629
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,608
Part of me wants to help him.

630
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,311
No. This is how he learns.

631
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:56,083
(chuckles)

632
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,986
(gasps, screams)

633
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,788
I don't know.
It's kind of pricey.

634
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,723
-How does it handle?
-(Garfield screaming)

635
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,391
Whoa! I'll take it!

636
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:06,927
(screaming)

637
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,462
Whoa!

638
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,231
(yelping)

639
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,735
(screaming)

640
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,141
See? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

641
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,210
(hoarsely) You and I have
different definitions of fun.

642
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,247
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Hello?</i>

643
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,748
Oh, finally. Hello!

644
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,618
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>You've reached Find My Pet.</i>

645
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,185
<i>If your pet is lost,</i>
<i>we're here to help.</i>

646
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,621
Mm-hmm. Hi, yes. Great.

647
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:35,322
Okay, uh, my orange tabby
and my dog are both missing,

648
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,591
and I-I need your help.

649
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:37,825
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Please listen carefully,</i>

650
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,759

00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,462

00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,696

654
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,964
<i>-ess-pray even-say.</i>

00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,132

656
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,834
What do I press to talk

657
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,503
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Your call</i>

658
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,871

-DEEP VOICE: <i>1,346</i>

659
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,206
(in normal voice)
<i>...people ahead of you.</i>

660
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,608
Wha-- What?

661
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:55,610
Garfield, where are you?

662
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,945
(train horn blowing)

663
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,417
Okay, Vic, you got
to figure this out.

664
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,986
(sighs) Jinx can't be trusted,

665
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,956
and you got to keep
Junior safe.

666
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,193
You just got to figure out
a way to get him out of this.

667
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,462
GARFIELD: (clears throat)
Ah. Tell me, is it a burr?

668
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:17,498
It hurts.
Ah, you pulled my hair.

669
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:18,732
-Ow, ow, ow.
-(sighs)

670
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,334
GARFIELD: Is that--
Is it a bug?

671
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,703
A bug? (screams)

672
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,371
-Ow. Ow. Owie. Ow.
-Hmm?

673
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,439
GARFIELD: Odie, Odie.

674
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:27,374
(screaming)

675
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,010
(sighs) Okay. Ah.

676
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:31,445
(grunts)

677
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,049
(chuckling)

678
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,219
You know what, Junior?
This is gonna be good for you.

679
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,921
-What'll be good for me?
-What we're doing.

680
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,122
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

681
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,659
from a dairy to pay back
a deranged cat.

682
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,494
What part of that is
going to be good for me?

683
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,531
All of it.
You can't even imagine

684
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:51,232
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

685
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,801
-Oh, yeah. Name one.
-Well, for starters,

686
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:57,071
you already know
how to get on a moving train.

687
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,740
(laughing)

688
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,876
(clears throat)
I found it funny.

689
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,779
All I'm saying is that
to break into a dairy,

690
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,147
it's gonna take a few skills

691
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,483
I'm guessing a rounded,
mush-filled, overly-pampered

692
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,687
indoor cat like you
doesn't have.

693
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,689
So, we need to toughen you up.

694
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,891
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

695
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,261
You've obviously never been
in an Olive Garden

696
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,762
that's run out of breadsticks.

697
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,065
Anyway, I'm never gonna need
those skills

698
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,167
-you're talking about.
-But you'll have them.

699
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,802
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

700
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,238
or anything else, ever again.

701
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:32,973
You are missing the point.

702
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,576
You're going to learn
to improvise,

703
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,976
think on your feet,
develop moves

704
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,812
that'll come in handy out there
in the real world.

705
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,949
I wouldn't be in the real world
if it wasn't for you.

706
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,818
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

707
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,021
No. I would be asleep at home.

708
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:49,990
Missing out on life altogether.

709
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:53,060
Look, I'm just a dad trying
to teach his son some skills.

710
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,428
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

711
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,031
You can't make up for
five years of not being around.

712
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,832
-Ah, yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

713
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,401
-I think I can.
-In fact, you can't.

714
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,935
-Yes, I can.
-You really can't.

715
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,672
With your attitude, I can.

716
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,006
Ah! Okay, whatever, "Dad."

717
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,842
-Wow. Great lesson. Ugh!
-Hmm.

718
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,411
GARFIELD: I'm done
talking to you.

719
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:11,579
You do not know me.

720
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:13,280
You don't know
the first thing about me.

721
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,783
I am not pampered.

722
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,918
I'm not anything
you think I am.

723
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:24,992
Okay. I'm just gonna say

724
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,361
that blanket is not
the best idea.

725
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,996
Ah, fantastic, thank you.

726
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,831
I'll take it from here.

727
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,568
(Garfield gasping)

728
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:35,202
Get them off, get them off!

729
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,539
Ah! Get them off me!

730
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,908
Wait, what are you doing?

731
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,143
(gasps, sputters)

732
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:44,445

733
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,348
-What did you do?
-Cedar chips.

734
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,550
Spiders hate them.

735
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,752
See?
Another life skill learned.

736
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,687
I-I-I, uh...

737
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,488
I think the words
you're looking for are...

738
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:55,590
"Thank you, Pops."

739
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:56,957
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

740
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,660
Oh! Here's our stop.

741
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,194
Really? Where?

742
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:01,663

743
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,263

Uh, no clue
who you're talking about.

771
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,791
He's one of the mascots
of Lactose Farms.

772
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,092
See? On the side of the barn?

773
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,830
I'll bet he knows
how to get into that place.

Leave him alone.

775
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,999
Seems to be in a period
of meditation or depression.

776
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,168
Yes, he does. Hmm.

777
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,872
This calls for tact,
sensitivity and diplomacy.

778
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,373
Oh, yeah? And where are we
supposed to get that?

779

here's the thing.

Me and my crew back there,
we're in a bit of a bind.

794

Got ourselves in a situation.

Oh, you know,
a couple quarts of milk.

851

Now, pay attention.

Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

862
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,664
And here are the two places
you need to go.

863
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:41,035
First, the truck with your milk
is back here.

864
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:44,072
And this delicate buttercup
is my Ethel.

865
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,574
My North Star
and reason for living

866
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:49,610
is being kept by
those barbarians in...

867
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,746
a petting zoo.

868
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,214

00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:59,120
this snail,
the refrigeration room.

871
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:01,455
This toadstool
is the loading dock

872
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,991
where you'll find the keys
to the trucks.

873
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,292
Wait, what's the pine cone?

874
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:07,494
The pine cone is
the cheese and butter room.

875
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,897
Ooh, cheese is
my love language.

876
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:11,231
Now, for this briefing,

877
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,233
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

878
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,170
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

879
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:18,840
-Oh!
-You are the majestic bullfrog.

880
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:21,909
(croaks)

881
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,778
Oh, yeah, that feels right.

882
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,981
OTTO: You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

883
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,883
-And you...
-Wait for it.

884
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,718
OTTO: ...are roadkill.

885
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,956
Huh? What? Oh. (laughing)

886
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,257
No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto.

887
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,060
Giving your new
best friend roadkill.

888
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,829
Seriously, though,
wh-what's my real token?

889
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:43,631
That is your real token.

890
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,233
Now, if you have
any chance of succeeding...

891
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,299
Wait, can I, uh-- Excuse me.

892
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,367
Can I switch
to something living?

893
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:48,936
Like, like the snail
or the cricket?

894
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,238
You should've spoken up sooner.

895
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,439
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

896
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,709
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

897
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:56,244
Come on, Roadkill, focus.

898
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:59,213
Oh, really? You give Vic
the majestic bullfrog.

899
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,348
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk.

900
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,317
And then you give me,
your new BFF, roadkill?

901
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,386
I mean, it feels disrespectful,
not gonna lie.

902
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,022
What makes you think he's dead?

903
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:09,791
My eyes.
I have eyes and can see.

904
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,193
It's a possum. They're masters
at playing dead.

905
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,861
Well, then,
little Daniel Day-Possum here

906
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:14,996
should do
Shakespeare in the Park.

907
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,296
Things aren't always
what they seem.

908
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,732
You're right.
But in this case, they are.

909
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,534
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

910
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,802
Oh, do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

911
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:22,904
Do possums play possum?
Is that what they do?

912
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:24,639
Yes. Possums are very clever.

913
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,108
Yeah, I'm sure he was until
the day he ate a pickup truck.

914
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,576
Uh, just ignore him.

915
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,244
Please, continue.

916
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,713
I'll just put this back
where you had it, mm-hmm.

917
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,749
The straightest line
to the loading dock

918
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:36,316
is through the snail here,

919
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,718
then the cricket there,

920
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:40,588
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

921
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,758
Each of these rooms have their
own set of unique challenges.

922
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,325
Well, why can't we just go
straight through the pine cone?

923
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,761
You don't want to go
through the pine cone.

924
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,096
Looks like the straightest shot
is through the pine cone.

925
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,731
You like walking
with those feet, do you?

926
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:53,601
You a fan of
unimaginable pain and misery?

927
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,703
Then go through the pine cone.

928
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,005
Stay away from the pine cone.
(clicks tongue) Got it.

929
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,740
Once you're inside
the facility...

930
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,309
("Mission: Impossible Theme"
playing)

931
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,844
OTTO: <i>...you will enter</i>
<i>the electrical room.</i>

932
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,445
<i>There you will locate</i>
<i>the air vent.</i>

933
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,517
<i>Pop the grate and climb up.</i>

934
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:15,823
<i>Then you'll crawl through</i>
<i>a maze of vents</i>

935
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,390
<i>and drop down...</i>

936
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,161
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

937
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:23,463
<i>Next, you will need to hurl</i>
<i>your body over a 30-foot drop</i>

938
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:26,267
<i>to a series of hand rungs.</i>

939
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,536
<i>You'll propel yourselves</i>
<i>hand over hand</i>

940
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:32,039
<i>and drop down</i>
<i>directly into a loading dock.</i>

941
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:36,510
<i>From there, you'll locate</i>
<i>the keys to the milk truck.</i>

942
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,113
<i>Drive that truck to the</i>
<i>west pasture of the complex,</i>

943
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:40,748
<i>cut the lock on the gate,</i>

944
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:43,284
<i>and find the closest thing</i>
<i>we have</i>

945
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,419
<i>to an angel here on earth.</i>

946
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,926
<i>You'll escort my sweet Ethel</i>
<i>onto the truck</i>

947
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,362
<i>and drive her to freedom.</i>

948
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:55,930
(music ends)

949
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:59,133
It's going to take mad skills
to get that milk

950
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,602
and free my dear, sweet Ethel.

951
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:04,572
Clearly, this one is qualified
for the mission.

952
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,509
But I have some serious doubts
here about all of... this.

953
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:10,011
He's pointing to you,

954
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,078
-Roadkill.
-(growls)

955
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:12,880
Let's get to work.

956
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,015
(Garfield sighs)

957
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,318
Stupid roadkill.

958
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,654
Hey! I'm working here!

959
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,690
Ugh, definitely a Monday.

960
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:25,293
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Your call</i>
<i>is fairly important to us.</i>

961
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,328
<i>If you've lost a cat,</i>
<i>please press one.</i>

962
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,664
<i>If your cat is orange,</i>
<i>please press two.</i>

963
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,699
<i>This doesn't really</i>
<i>accomplish anything</i>

964
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:34,802
<i>but gives you the false sense</i>
<i>that we're engaged with you.</i>

965
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:36,137
(whimpering)

966
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,505
(moaning)

967
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:41,976
OTTO: All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

968
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,211
that you'll need to master

969
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,380
in order to break into
Lactose Farms.

970
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:49,417
Number one, develop
lightning-fast reflexes.

971
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,718
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

972
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,852
on the other side of that wall,

973
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:54,288
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

974
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,456
Yeah, no, no, no.
Depends what kind of pasta.

975
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,860
This pebble represents
danger you may encounter.

976
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,096
You need to grab it
before it grabs you.

977
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,463
(scoffs) It grabs me.

978
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,599
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

979
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:06,466
Too slow!

980
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,269
Ow. What was that for?

981
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:09,704
Being able to grab the pebble

982
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,306
could be the difference
between life and death.

983
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,474
All right,
let me try that again.

984
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,277
(grunts) Ha! Got it!

985
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,713
Ah! Now, what was that for?!

986
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,414
It's never just
about the pebble.

987
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:21,782
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

988
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,452
Your head's got to be
on a swivel at all times.

989
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,853
You got to be ready
for anything.

990
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,755
I was ready.
He changed the game.

991
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,224
Sounds like
someone's making excuses.

992
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:35,296
And what was that about
being ready for anything?

993
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,530
You were distracting me!

994
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,366
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

995
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,600
You should have
seen that coming.

996
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,569
Toes on the line.
Guard your grill.

997
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,037
Cover your stomach.

998
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,673
There are surprises around
every corner at Lactose Farms.

999
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,209
You need to stay alert.
Too slow.

1000
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,777
A baby could have
seen that coming.

1001
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,114
-Too slow. Too slow.
-(blows landing)

1002
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,584
-(slurping)
-OTTO: Too slow!

1003
00:41:56,717 --> 00:41:58,719
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

1004
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,087
if you can't survive
this training.

1005
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,990
-Are you for real?
-Wh-What kind of dairy is this?

1006
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:06,627
The kind of dairy that
requires teamwork to survive.

1007
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,829
Danger could be anywhere,
gentlemen.

1008
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:09,964
(yells)

1009
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,233
You've got to be ready
to outrun it.

1010
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,768
(screaming)

1011
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,507
-(train horn blowing)
-Here comes the pain.

1012
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,708
-Left, right, left, right.
-You're confusing me.

1013
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,643
(screaming)

1014
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:25,813
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1015
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,314
(bees buzzing)

1016
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:28,616
(screaming)

1017
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,519
Shh.

1018
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,454
(screaming)

1019
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:34,555
(crashing)

1020
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,290
(crunching, groaning)

1021
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:39,093
I think I'm gonna need rehab.
Oh!

1022
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,561
(moaning)

1023
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:42,596
(sighs)

1024
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,265
If this is going to work,

1025
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,500
these two have to be
on the same page.

1026
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,102
I'm out of ideas.

1027
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,303
You got any?

1028
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,574
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere,

1029
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,476
getting beaten up
against my will

1030
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,312
by a former celebrity steer.

1031
00:42:58,446 --> 00:42:59,747
-Odie?
-Hmm?

1032
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,249
Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

1033
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:05,386
Odie, can you tell Vic that
I collapsed on this tree first

1034
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,921
and that he needs
to find another one?

1035
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:11,492
Odie, can you tell my son that
I will gladly find another one

1036
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,694
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

1037
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,496
Odie, can you tell my father

1038
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:16,697
that he wouldn't be
lying in pain

1039
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:17,865
if he led a better life

00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:10,364
Well, then, still seem like
a prank to you?

1219
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,232
Eh, that last part
did a little.

1220
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:14,035
What's our next move, Chief?

1221
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,371
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

1222
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:20,273
and formulate
an ingenious plan.

1223
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,377
And you go get my car waxed.

1224
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:26,313
Well, well, well,

1225
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,983

Margie Malone.

1226
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:32,152
We're having
company tomorrow.

1227
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:35,023
I guess I better take out
my finest china

1228
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,257

a heaping plate...

1229

What are those for?

1232
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:50,370
For us to communicate

1233
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:54,307
once you're inside
the belly of the beast.

1234

-(growls)
-Uh... 'kay.

1235
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:59,947
Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

1236

(sighs) Indoor cat.

1237
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:03,785
These are better.

1238
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,252
It just feels like Bluetooth
would be better.

1239
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:06,353
These are better
than Bluetooth.

1240
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:07,922
These-these are better
than Bluetooth?

1241
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,091
They're equal.

1242
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,826

-Do you copy?
-(barks) Mm-hmm.

1247
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,604
Of course you can hear him.

1248
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,373
He's standing
three feet away from you.

1249
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,676
Oh, I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

1250
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,579

00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,392
-(laughs)
-(P.A. bell chimes)

1388
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:19,960
WOMAN OVER P.A.:
<i>Workers, your break ends</i>

1389
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,228
<i>in five minutes.</i>

1390
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,232
Okay, Otto,
we're in the loading dock.

1391
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:26,400
Where are the keys?

1392
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:27,536
OTTO: <i>They should be</i>
<i>hanging on</i>

1393
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,303
<i>a pegboard</i>
<i>on the far wall.</i>

1394
00:59:29,437 --> 00:59:30,571
(barks)

1395
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:32,339
What do you mean
we have a problem?

1396
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:33,808
Uh, pegboard's empty.

1397
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:35,009
OTTO: <i>Empty?</i>

1398
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:36,511
MARGE: Now, would you

1399
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:38,345
look at this.

1400
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:40,748
Three misguided stray pets

1401
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,716
trying to steal
a truck of milk.

1402
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,787
Never a dull moment at
this dairy, is there, Margie?

1403
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,689
Well, you're looking for these,
aren't you?

1404
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:50,624
Well, here you go, then.

1405
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:56,864
So how's this gonna
play out, fellas?

1406
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:59,133
The easy way
or the hard way?

1407
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,236
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm up for either.

1408
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:06,006
Follow my lead.

1409
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,174
Huh? What?

1410
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:14,415
(groans)

1411
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:16,350
-(neck cracks)
-Who's next, then?

1412
01:00:16,484 --> 01:00:17,586
(screams)

1413
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:19,753
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

1414
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,223
Crazy eyes?
Tragic sense of fashion?

1415
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,357
Yeah. How did you know?

1416
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:24,792
Marge Malone.

1417
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:26,260
<i>Ethel!</i>

1418
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:27,562
ETHEL: (echoing) <i>Otto!</i>

1419
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,430
She's not just my nemesis.

1420
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,632
She's also my enemy.

1421
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:33,667
Love to hear about it,
but right now, what do we do?

1422
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,102
Get those keys.

1423
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:37,304
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

1424
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,874
-MARGE: Come here, you!
-(grunting)

1425
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:45,880
-(growling)
-(both whimpering)

1426
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,285
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style.

1427
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:52,853
(grunts)

1428
01:00:55,222 --> 01:00:56,423
(electricity crackling)

1429
01:00:56,558 --> 01:00:58,092
(screams)

1430
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,631
No, no, no, no.
You're not getting away.

1431
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:03,998
I've already called the pound.

1432
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:06,700
Your days of thievery
end today.

1433
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,935
(alarm blaring)

1434
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:10,104
COMPUTER:
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1435
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:13,440
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1436
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:16,143
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1437
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,646
Otto.

1438
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,080
COMPUTER:
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1439
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,716
Attempted perimeter breach.

1440
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,186
Junior, sorry about this.

1441
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,720
Sorry? For what?

1442
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:28,088
-(grunts)
-(Garfield shouts)

1443
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:30,858
-(Marge gasps)
-(grunts)

1444
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:31,992
Vic?

1445
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,468
What are you doing?

1446
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:45,272
Vic!

1447
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:47,708
Don't you go. Vic!

1448
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,243
(electrical whirring)

1449
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:50,811
Please!

1450
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:54,949
(Marge panting)

1451
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:58,352
Send security
to the loading dock.

1452
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:05,359
(gasps)

1453
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:07,161
(shouts)

1454
01:02:07,294 --> 01:02:08,362
(gasps)

1455
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:09,830
Otto.

1456
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:15,903
You do not want
to try me today, mister.

1457
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:19,840
(roaring)

1458
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,946
(screams)

1459
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:28,983
Get him!

1460
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:48,035
(intense music playing)

1461
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:58,412
-(alarm beeping)
-(screaming)

1462
01:02:58,546 --> 01:03:00,214
(tires squealing)

1463
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:06,521
(panting)

1464
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:07,622
Whew.

1465
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:09,056
JINX: Welcome back...

1466
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,292
(chuckles)

1467
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:12,893
...Victor.

1468
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:18,767
Oh, hey, Jinx.

1469
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:21,536
Why are you here?
I-I was bringing this to you.

1470
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,203
Were you?

1471
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:24,639
Really?

1472
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:25,939
Yeah, of course I was.

1473
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:27,609
That's what
we agreed to, right?

1474
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:28,942
Mm.

1475
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,011
(sighs)

1476
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:33,947
So, you and me
square now?

1477
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:36,283
(chuckles) Not quite.

1478
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:39,019
There's still the matter
of those five years

1479
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,455
-I lost because of you.
-What?

1480
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,357
But I thought
this settled that.

1481
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,627
(laughs)

1482
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,796
It was never about the milk.

1483
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:50,364
It was about you getting
caught trying to steal it

1484
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,734
and being sent
to the pound.

1485
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:55,169
Like I was.

1486
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:59,039
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer.

1487
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:01,308
Like I did.

1488
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:03,578
Oh.

1489
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:05,714
I see.

1490
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:07,515
And I'm guessing
you have an idea about

1491
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,651
how that should happen.

1492
01:04:09,784 --> 01:04:13,287
As a matter of fact, I do.

1493
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,096
I can't believe
he did that.

1494
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:24,932
He ran out
and he left me.

1495
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:29,002
Again.

1496
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:31,171
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

1497
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,140
it was a lie.

1498
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,309
All of it.

1499
01:04:37,746 --> 01:04:39,213
(sighs)

1500
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:42,383
How could I have been
so stupid?

1501
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:45,386
(sighs)

1502
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,289
MAURICE:
Oh, come on, kid.

1503
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:51,593
Don't beat yourself up.

1504
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:54,796
Vic, man,
we've all been burned by Vic.

1505
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:55,996
-(overlapping agreement)
-Yeah, that's right.

1506
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,533
Burned every cat I know.

1507
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,569
Ah, yeah, the one thing
about Vic you can count on

1508
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:03,470
is that you can't
count on him.

1509
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:04,773
Tell me about it.

1510
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:06,373
MAURICE: Yeah,
I'll tell you about it.

1511
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,878
Long story short,
we all used to run in a pack

1512
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,912
until we had to kick him
out the crew.

1513
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,548
(overlapping agreement)

1514
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,283
Like I said,
couldn't count on him.

1515
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,519
Sounds about right.

1516
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,420
He'd leave
in the middle of a job

1517
01:05:19,554 --> 01:05:21,321
just to go see his kid.

1518
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:24,091
Yeah, he said he wanted
to check up on him,

1519
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,059
make sure
he was doing okay.

1520
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:27,361
OLIVIA:
But get this:

1521
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:28,996
he'd never actually visit.

1522
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,566
He'd just sit across the street
from his kid's house

1523
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:32,901
in a giant oak tree.

1524
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:34,134
That never happened.

1525
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,905
He'd watch that kid
eat and eat and eat...

1526
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:38,540
He'd put a notch
in the bark...

1527
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:41,341
-...and eat and eat...
-...every time he was there.

1528
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:42,844
Oh, yeah. Sure, he did.

1529
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:46,548
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

1530
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,015
Said that it was
his kid's...

1531
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:50,752
CATS:
Family dinner night.

1532
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:52,687
(overlapping chatter)

1533
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,593
Okay, hate to
tell you guys...

1534
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:01,061
I guarantee
that never happened.

1535
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:03,765
Okay? You all fell for
another one of Vic's lies.

1536
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,700
We all have.

1537
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:07,669
Because that's
what he does best.

1538
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,538
(Odie barks)

1539
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:12,841
(barks happily)

1540
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,876
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

1541
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:16,678
Quick, pick the lock
on my cage.

1542
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,246
-Garfield, there you are!
-(gasps) Jon!

1543
01:06:19,379 --> 01:06:21,315
(crying) Oh, take me away
from all of this.

1544
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,884
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

1545
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:24,418
You want this one, too?

1546
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,653
Oh, yes, I do.

1547
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:27,287
You sure he's yours?
He didn't have a tag.

1548
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:29,990
JON: Uh-huh, yeah.
Oh, he has a tag.

1549
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:32,392
Huh? I have a collar
and a tag?

1550
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:34,729
-How long have I had those?
-POUND WORKER: Okay.

1551
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:35,797
I'm just gonna
need you to hold...

1552
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,600
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

1553
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,501
The Jon who was on hold
is dead!

1554
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,402
Do you understand?

1555
01:06:42,537 --> 01:06:43,972
(whoops)

1556
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:47,140
That's right.
I'm back, baby.

1557
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:49,744
("Good Life" playing)

1558
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:52,379
I was just talking about you,
wasn't I?

1559
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:57,050
Oh, I've missed you, too.

1560
01:06:58,485 --> 01:06:59,821

01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:50,217
Did you expect to take
us on all by yourself?

1751
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:53,721
No. I brought takeout.

1752
01:15:53,854 --> 01:15:55,156
What?

1753
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:56,791

Roadkill, the net
is too tight.

01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:13,787

-JINX: Ooh-hoo, I want to find

1816

the perfect place for them
to make the biggest splat.

01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:43,317

-Hey, hey, Junior.

Get ready. Almost there.

1820
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:49,758
Sorry my rescue
didn't work out.

1821
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:53,294
No, you gave me
another chance.

1822
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:55,162
That's all that matters.

01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,605
Now, now!
Drop them now! (gasps)

1825
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:05,540
What are you waiting for?

1826
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:09,877
Their love for one another
indicates that,

1827
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,046
despite their
current circumstance,

1828
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:13,947
-they are at peace.
-(grunts)

1829
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:17,151
-Because they are together.
-So?

1830
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:19,754
If the point of your revenge
was to hurt them,

1831
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,922
it has done the opposite.

1832
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:23,924
It's actually
textbook irony.

1833
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:27,227
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

1834
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,395
(grunts)

1835
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,632
You two are still
as weak as you were

1836
01:20:30,765 --> 01:20:32,966
when I found you sniveling
in the pound.

1837
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,469
(imitating Roland)
Oh, no one will adopt us.

1838
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,404
I never grew
into my folds.

1839
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,808
I hide behind them because
I'm socially awkward.

1840
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,308
(imitating Nolan)
Please, somebody love me,

1841
01:20:41,442 --> 01:20:43,243
even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

1842
01:20:43,377 --> 01:20:46,113
and have the attention span
of a bloody goldfish!

1843
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:49,016
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

1844
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:51,418
I even spoke
with this ridiculous accent

1845
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,320
to make you feel
more at home.

1846
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:54,689
But no more.

1847
01:20:54,823 --> 01:20:56,725
(in New York accent)
I'm New York, loud and proud.

1848
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,992
I love myself the way I am,

1849
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:02,029
and I'm a big,
brave boy, baby!

1850
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:04,898
And I've been working on
my attention span.

1851
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:06,467
(gasps)
Is that a hot-air balloon?

1852
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:09,838
(groans) You two are

1853
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,239
-worthless!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1854

(whimpers)

1859
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,965
(growls)

1860
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,413
Might I just say,

1861
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:54,982
as someone else
with a zaftig figure,

1862
01:21:55,115 --> 01:21:56,751
you have a
beautiful body, sir.

1863
01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:59,554
-Whoa!
-Oh, dear.

1864
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:01,656
(all screaming)

1865
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,326
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

1866
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,530
There's something about your
cadence that really throws me,

1867
01:22:08,663 --> 01:22:09,597
but thank you.

1868
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:10,931

Tee-hee.

01:22:22,943 --> 01:22:24,813
-(panting)
-(chuckles)

1873
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,916
Tossing me off the train.
Did not see that coming.

1874
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:29,316
Well, when you live
in the wild,

1875
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,719
you got to keep your head
on a swivel.

1876
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,822
-Right.
-Mmm.

1877
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,957
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

1878
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:39,627
And that had
bird poop on it. (spits)

1879
01:22:39,761 --> 01:22:41,995
Hey. You good, Roadkill?

1880
01:22:42,864 --> 01:22:44,364
Mm, not quite.

1881
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:47,301
There's one last thing
to take care of.

1882
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:48,703
Cut to...

1883
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:51,972

1886
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:03,551

<i>heavier than a broken heart.</i>

1887
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:05,854
<i>On nights like this,</i>
<i>you can't swing a cat</i>

1888
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:08,121
<i>without hitting</i>
<i>shady characters</i>

1889
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:11,425
<i>making shady deals</i>
<i>all over town.</i>

1890
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:17,532
<i>Oh, but this night</i>

1891
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:19,934
<i>Justice was about to be served.</i>

1892
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:24,706
<i>With a helping of retribution</i>
<i>on the side.</i>

1893
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:27,509
Is that... (clears throat)
the package?

1894
01:23:27,642 --> 01:23:29,309
(distorted voice) It is.

1895
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:32,312
Then we have a deal.
(whistles)

1896
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,785
(distorted voice) No one
will come looking for her?

1897
01:23:37,919 --> 01:23:38,853
MARGE: Nope.

1898
01:23:38,987 --> 01:23:40,053
I did what you said.

1899
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,823
I burned her paperwork,

1900
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:44,224
and then shredded it
and burned it some more.

1901
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,094
It's like she never existed.

1902
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:48,763
Except for the image
of her face

1903
01:23:48,897 --> 01:23:50,598
on millions of
dairy products.

1904
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:55,102
(cowbell jingling)

1905
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:08,315
(panting)

1906
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:10,818
This...

1907
01:24:10,952 --> 01:24:12,587
(distorted voice)
...never happened.

1908
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:14,421
Agreed.

1909
01:24:15,857 --> 01:24:17,090

I know you planned
the milk truck heist

1912
01:24:20,662 --> 01:24:22,195
and then tried to throw
those innocent cats

1913
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,898

-...I'm sorry.

1942
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:50,718
For misjudging you.

Everything bad that happened
to us the last three days?

1947
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:03,097
You know, you had your hand
in a few bad decisions

back there, too, but...

I should go.

01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:25,119
Yeah, yeah.
Um, I mean, unless...

1957
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:26,921
-you'd want to come in?
-Nah. No, no.

that would work.

I'm an outdoor cat.

No, I just, I figured that...

No, no, no, no,
I get it.

1962

But, you know, uh,
I got this thing

I got to go do, so...

No, I'm-I'm very
busy, too. Yeah.

-In the kitchen.

You're back! What is going on?

1981
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:13,400
Are you okay?
I was so worried.

1982
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:15,136
You know, I was gonna add
more locks to the door,

1983
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:16,671
you know, try to keep you in,
but then I thought,

1984
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:18,773
"Well, what if they wanted
to be outdoor pets?"

1985
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:20,508
Do you want to be
free-range?

1986

Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:23,811
Oh, I really missed you guys,
and I got to say,

1988
01:27:23,945 --> 01:27:25,079
it's great to be
together again,

1989
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:26,914
-the whole entire family.
-Mmm.

1990

what the last few days

1991
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:30,184

1995
01:27:35,556 --> 01:27:36,824
