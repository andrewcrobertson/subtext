00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,377
-[Harper] Gonna pick you up in the city.
-<i>All right.</i>

174
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,755
-Hey, I'll see you in New York, okay?
-<i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

175
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,840
[adventurous music playing]

176
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,099
[engine starts]

177
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,449
[Harper] We have
16 days out there on the road.

178
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,662
I'm sure a lot of things will come up,
but... it... it's weird.

179
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,622
We are good friends. [chuckles]

180
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,293
But are we?
Like, it's a weird thing to say.

181
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,004
I was always Harper Steele.

182
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,339
So Will was always
friends with Harper Steele.

183
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,011
But there was this persona
that he was also friends with

184
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,597
that I don't particularly like
or need right now.

185
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>Harper, I made it onto the flight.</i>

186
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,100
<i>Um...</i> [clicks tongue]

187
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,227
<i>All systems go.</i>

188
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,981
[Will] So many of us don't know
what the rules of engagement are.

189
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,610
And in terms of our friendship
and our relationship,

190
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,820
it's... it's... it's uncharted waters.

191
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>I'll see you later. Bye.</i>

192
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,496
[Harper] I don't know why
he picked some weird spot.

193
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,958
Maybe it's just a celebrity thing.
He doesn't like to be out in the open.

194
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,588
What the fuck? Oh my God.

195
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,007
[Will] Yeah.

196
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
You made it.

197
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,847
-[car door closes]
-Thanks for picking me up.

198
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,350
-[Harper] What is this?
-Yeah. Van Cortlandt.

199
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,601
-Oh, that's...
-Remember?

200
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,519
-[Harper] Oh, hey, old buddy.
-How are ya?

201
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,479
I do remember.

202
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,899
-Remember all our...
-Yeah, we golfed up here two times.

203
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,901
I still have my... my card.

204
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,403
My New York City golf permit.

205
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,656
-[Harper] Wanna get in a round?
-Let's get in a round.

206
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,699
-[Harper] Okay. Oh Jesus.
-[laughing]

207
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,661
-You look great, by the way.
-[Harper] Oh, hey, thank you.

208
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,912
I love your jacket.

209
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,373
-I'm an expert packer.
-Oh yeah. That's...

210
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,125
-There we go.
-Yeah, no. That'll stay.

211

[both chuckling]

212
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
I can't wait to get in this.

213
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,299
How does this baby handle?

214
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,009
-[Harper] Uh, shittily.
-[laughs]

215
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,429
-[Harper] It handles shittily.
-Shag carpet everywhere.

216
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,723
-[Harper] So comfortable.
-Oh, it's so luxurious.

217
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,184
-[Harper] So luxurious. Let's go.
-All right, let's go.

["Amoreena" by Elton John playing]

219
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,533
I'd say we're gonna leave the city,
but I wanna have breakfast with my kids,

220
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,702
and then we'll hit the road after that.

221
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,210
[Will] I'm excited to see your kids again.
I haven't seen them in a long time.

222
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,169
[E] Hey!

223
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,462
-[Harper] Hey!
-[Will] Hi, guys.

224
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,840
-[E] Good morning.
-[Will] Good morning.

225
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,134
-[E] How you doing, buddy?
-Good to see ya.

226
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,969
Emma, I haven't seen you...
When was the last...

227
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,889
I saw you at <i>SNL</i> one time, I think,
like, maybe three or four...

228
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,684
-Before the pandemic.
-[Will] I met you even before that.

229
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,686
-You guys were all super little.
-[Emma] Yeah.

230
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,731
And at one point,
you brought out a little tiny saxophone?

231
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,648
-I did?
-Yeah.

232
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,859
And you started doing a bit, like...

233
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,902
[singing] ♪ <i>Playing in a family band</i> ♪

234
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,028
-Really?
-And then...

235
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,532
-I didn't know you could play.
-[Will] Then I played a little instrument.

236
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,745
And you two just stared at us like,
"This is not funny, nor is it good."

237
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,038
[all laughing]

238
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,249
-[Will] Now here's the dilemma.
-[Harper] Okay, uh-oh.

239
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,834
-There's a Greek omelet.
-Yeah.

240
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,502
And there's an Athenian omelet.

241
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,004
-[Will] The...
-[giggling]

242

-[server] Hello. Take your order?
-Hello.

243
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,758
-Yes.
-[server] What shall I get you?

244
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,136
-Okay.
-Do you have sis... some tzatziki?

245
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,054
-Yeah, we do.
-[Will] Oh!

246
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,099
-It's a Greek diner.
-For the table. Tzatziki for the table.

247
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,226
-[Harper] No...
-No, not for the table.

248
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,687
-[server] Thank you so much.
-Thank you. Thank you.

249
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,691
Um... uh... What... So...

250
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,235
I wanna be clear.

251
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,155
Harper, you still... Harper's still Dad.

252
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,532
Harper's still Dad, still Pop.

253
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,533
-[Will] Pop.
-Pop.

254
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,118
But pronouns, she.

255
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,453
-[E] She.
-[Emma] Yeah.

256
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,706
Harper's still Dad because she said
she was Dad, you know?

257
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,251
How... how did you give the news?
Did you guys all get together?

258
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,544
-[Harper] No.
-No, email.

259
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,837
-Just like you.
-Oh.

260
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,256
I was at Popeyes.
I was picking up my biscuit.

261
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,342
-[Will] Right.
-And I go, "Holy shit."

262
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,385
-[Will] Holy shit.
-"I gotta pull over for this."

263
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,556
[Emma] I mean, when the divorce happened,
we kind of knew a little bit.

264
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,310
We got that note about... from Harper
about how we might find women's clothes.

265
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,437
She was wearing women's clothes.
I was like, "Okay."

266
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:38,609
And then after that, we got the full,
you know, "I'm using she/her pronouns."

267
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,820
-[Will] Yeah.
-So it felt gradual to me.

268
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,238
It didn't feel like a shock.

269
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,073
For the most part,

270
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,408
you guys just took it in stride.
Or was it...

271
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,036
-It was easy to accept immediately.
-[Will] Right.

272
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,663
But, um, for me,

273
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,500
I think I had a moment of, like, um...

274
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,461
My dad was
my only sort of masculine representation,

275
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,880
and so I sort of idolized that
in a weird way.

276
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,508
Still my dad, but I think, for me,

277
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,469
the only thing I lost
was that masculine figure,

278
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,346
but you don't really need it.

279
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,641
-[server] Food is here!
-[Will] Gorgeous.

280
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,601
-You're gonna love it.
-[Will] You called it.

281
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,063
-[server] And tza-tza-tza-tza...
-Yes. Everyone, get your own.

282
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,858
-Yes! Tza...Yeah, tza-tza-tza...
-[server] Tzatziki!

[laughter]

284
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,237
-[Will] Aah.
-[Harper] You guys know what we're doing?

285
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,613
-Yeah.
-[Harper] Okay.

286
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,616
Are you guys worried about me
on this trip at all?

287
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,495
[child 1] I think I'm more worried
about your mental health.

288
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,747
I'm more worried
about your physical safety.

289
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,665
-[Harper] Yeah.
-Like...

290
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,962
But also, the things you love scare me
sometimes. Being in the middle of nowhere.

291
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,046
-Yeah.
-Especially...

292
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm actually learning to be
a little more afraid of that stuff.

293
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,676
After this transition, it's scary.

294
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,262
I'll be honest, I wrestle with, like,
"Why am I doing this?"

295
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,723
And, um, at first, I was like,
"I'm not gonna do it."

296
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,142
And then I just started to think about,

297
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,021
like, well, coming out
was really hard for me,

298
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,107
and, um, it may be... stupid,

299
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,612
but I felt like that might be a good way
for me to come out more, basically.

300
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,654
-Yeah.
-[Harper] Like...

301
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,198
Does it help to know I take jujitsu?

302
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,035
-Yeah.
-[Will] Twice a month.

303
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,829
Could you demonstrate something
or send a video?

304

'Cause I... I... I don't see it,

305
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,083
but I could... I guess I could see it, but...

306
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,378
I usually don't like to do my practice
on a full stomach.

307

Yeah, we gotta get going, but I really...

I could talk to you guys
on the phone tomorrow.

to be on this trip with you.

358
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,595
{\an8}[Harper] That first week,
we went downstairs to lunch.

359
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,474
And there was
just something about the two of us

360
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,143
where we were
kind of on the same wavelength

361
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,686
in a lot of different ways...

362
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,856
[Will] I do remember
I was trying to get to know everyone.

363
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,692
And there was a group of people
looking at me or like,

364
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,820
"We don't get what this guy does.
He doesn't seem that funny."

365
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,364
[Harper] They all thought
Will Ferrell was a dud.

366
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
[chuckling] But, you know, I just...

367
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,702
I knew that Will was not the dud.

368
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,663
[Will] You were just an ambassador for me

369
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,042
to be like, "No, don't write him off.
He's actually really funny."

Lots of food, lots of scripts.

372
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,423
[Harper] We've been around each other

373
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,926
in a lot of circumstances
that are very strange.

374
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,386
My whole writing career,
my whole creative life,

375
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,016
I performed as a character named Andrew.
That's the way I think about it, at least.

376
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,605
And so coming out to my friends
was especially hard.

377
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,652
And I really can't tell
if they think I'm Harper.

378
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,947
I think they might think
that I'm still Andrew,

379
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,323
and now I wear dresses.

This is very heartening for me. I...

387
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,052
When I came out,
all of you responded. Everyone...

388
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,263
-Tim was a little negative. But...

we're gonna cut down to Indianapolis.

-Absolutely true.

-I fear it. I do fear it.
-[Tina] Sure.

415
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,365
Um, Will knows that I like shitty bars,
I like truck stops.

416
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
-I like the lowest, worst places.

-Not safe for you anymore.

[Will] I'm curious
how you settled on your name.

447
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,996
And... So my first impulse
was to make it easy on everyone else.

448
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,207
You know? Like, this...

449
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,295
I'm... I'm... I'm like, "Hey, I'm... Hey,
there's nothing weird going on over here."

-"So I'm just changing..."
-"Nothing to see."

451
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,091
"Nothing to see.
I'm just gonna change Andrew to Angie."

452
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,884
-"You guys, that's pretty easy."
-Yeah.

453
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,014
And then I was driving down
to my first electrolysis thing,

454
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,266
and I was saying the name in my head,

455
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,768
and it just sounded like
wet cardboard to me.

456
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,813
-Yeah.
-It sounded like, "Ugh. This is wrong."

457

-And I was like...

-You literally had a visceral reaction.
-I did. I said it out loud.

I was saying them out loud.
I said, "Harper."

That's it. That's what it's gonna be."

what would you do?

My real name is John William.

-But my folks called me Will.
-Yeah.

473
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,697
And I remember in first grade,

474
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:50,410
there were six or seven kids
who either had the name Mike or Steve.

475

Oh, okay.

476
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,913
And I just was like, "Please."

477
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,499
-"Why can't I be a Mike or a Steve?"
-"Or a Steve."

478
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,002
-Those names were cool and tough.
-"Why do I have this weird name?"

479
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,213
-And hard. Yeah. I would...
-Like Steve.

480
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,297
"What's up, Steve?"

481
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,423

Ooh, I'm nervous.

497
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,882
[Harper] Yeah, me too.

498
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,261
The next 15 minutes, we could be
talking with President Joe Biden.

499
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,889
-How do you think we're getting in there?
-'Cause of this.

500
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,433
-The moneymaker.
-Yeah.

501
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,811
Is the president in there?
We just wanna say hi to the president.

502
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,354
Hey! Joe!

503
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,231
No, no, he's not there.

504
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,775
["Wires" continues playing]

505
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,363
[Harper] You know, for years,
I crossed this country in a dress,

506
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,906
but I never let anyone see me.

507
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,909
So if I had to get out and get gas,

508
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,329
there's this furtive,
and embarrassing, and hurried attempt

509
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,165
to throw on
a pair of overalls or something.

510
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,500
-And look like a guy and...
-[Will] Yeah.

511
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,462
[Harper] I used to bring
an emergency set of clothes with me.

512
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,798
The fear of having a cop pull me over
for a speeding ticket...

513
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,716
[siren wails]

514
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,050
...and be dressed as a woman was...

515
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,469
-It was horrible.
-[Will] Right.

516
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,761
[Harper] Now... [chuckles]

517
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,972
...going out into the world just as me,

518
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:38,268
without any chance
of going stealth as Andrew again,

519
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:43,315
I will see the country that I love
as myself, which I've never done.

520
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,567
[poignant music playing]

521
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,785
If you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second
here to look through some old journals.

522
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,912
Okay.

523
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,707
Whoa, look at your journals.

524
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,752
When did you start journaling?

525
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,964
It wasn't till I felt
my life was kind of falling apart.

526
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,177
And this one, uh,
it's called "Journal Number One."

527
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,555
It's called
"Unmentionables and Other Private Stuff."

528
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
[Will] Why did you type it
instead of longhand?

529
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,063
[Harper] I did it
because I wanted to just put it down.

530
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,357
-Bad writing and all. Mistakes.
-[Will] Yeah.

531
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,484
-Run-ons.
-[Harper] All kinds of mistakes, yeah.

532
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:32,447
-[Will] Stream of consciousness, yeah.
-This one's about my therapist.

533
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,201
"My therapist today
batted down my silly notion

534
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,411
that I might be a girl instead of a boy."

535
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,330
-[Will] Wow.
-"She's not buying it."

536
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,832
"At one point,
she said I was living in fantasy."

537
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,750
[Will] Wow.

538
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,670
[Harper] "The weird feelings
of sickness and dread I described to her

539
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,090
while I'm dressed in my male clothes
didn't make any sense to her."

540
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,969
"She needed me to describe the feelings
to her, which I couldn't."

541
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,263
"She seemed to think
dressing up like a woman

542
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,182
has a lot of defiance and anger in it."

543
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,725
"She's got a theory."

544
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,478
"I, on the other hand,
am losing faith in theories."

545
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,191
-Let's see. That's seven years ago.
-[Will] Wow.

546
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,365
[poignant music fades]

547
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,201
-[Harper] I'll get snacks. You get chairs.
-All righty.

548
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,495
[distant quacking]

549
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,667
[quacking, squawking]

550
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,051
[Will] You got us a lot of stuff.

551
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,929
Well, we're on the road, buddy.
Pringles. You like Pringles?

552
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,099
-I do. I love Pringles.
-I didn't know which Pringles you liked.

553
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,310
You ready for this one? Fuego.

554
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,436
[snickering] Okay.

555
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,520
[both chuckling]

556
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,733
-I am not having Fuego Pringles.
-Yeah, you are. Yeah. Yeah, you are.

557
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,568
Oh, Scorchin' BBQ.

558
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,819
[both chuckling]

559
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,156
-Oh, part of the Scorchin' line.
-That's... Oh yeah. The whole Sco...

560
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,450
-[Will] We've gotta ration these.
-[both laugh]

561
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,619
'Cause we may never
run into another Walmart.

562
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,912
[Will] 'Cause in case
we have a... a flat tire,

563
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
we gotta ration.

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,332
[Harper] Yeah, exactly.

565
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,462
Uh, I was gonna ask you
'cause I was thinking about it. Um...

566
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:16,718
Were you a little worried about
how to talk to me when I came out to you?

567
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,017
Sometimes, I think
that... people who aren't trans,

568
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,479
I think they're sometimes afraid
to say the wrong thing around me.

569
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,481
-That's what I'm getting at.
-[Will] Yeah.

570
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,775
And I didn't know when I first saw you,

571
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,320
and I was just curious
if there was anything there that...

572
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,447
I probably was...

573
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,660
um...

574
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,580
-Yeah, probably a little nervous.
-[Harper] Okay.

575
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,707
-[Will] In the sense...
-I mean, I was nervous.

576
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,293
-I'm in a dress.
-Yes.

577
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,961
It's like... That was terrifying.

578
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:57,842
Yeah, I... I... I guess I was...
I was worried about what... If there...

579
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,678
What the new ground rules were.

580
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,389
-[Harper] Okay, yeah.
-If there were any.

581
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,059
-[Harper] Yeah.
-Uh, if it was... um...

582
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,354
You know.

583
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,527
Yeah, just how much
had quote/unquote changed,

584
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,821
or was the same or what, you know.

585
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,782
[Harper] Yeah, that's a difficult one,
the changing and the sameness and...

586
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,034
There are no ground rules with friends,
I'm telling you.

587
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,369
That's what I need you to know.

588
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,787
-But that's what...
-Yeah.

589
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,499
-You immediately put me at ease.
-Yeah.

590
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,503
Yeah, I don't... Well, 'cause I...
'cause I know there's no ill intention.

591
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,006
So whatever you say,
I could not possibly be angry.

592
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,175
-Yeah.
-[Harper] Um...

593
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,054
What else did I get here, buddy?
I got more Pringles.

594
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,639
Philly Cheesesteak.

596
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,144
-[man] Man! You're the man!
-[Harper] What about the woman?

597
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,478
What about the woman?

598
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,815
-You're still the woman.
-[Will] Yes! Still the woman! Yeah!

599
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,358
-[man] Whoo!
-Whoo!

00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,448
[Harper] Oh, there she goes. Gah!

603
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,951
-[Will chuckles] She's back in business.
-Back in business, oh yeah.

604
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,413
Is there some reason

605
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,999
why we're not stopping
at greasy diners every morning?

606
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,586
-[Will] I don't know.
-It's my favorite kind of restaurant.

607

00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,675
Hey there.

00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,095
-[Will] Hi, how are you? Thank you.
-[server] Sit wherever you like.

610
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,222
[Will] Kimberly, you like it all?

611
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,142
-Our best one is, we got the All-Star.
-Yeah.

612
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,103
-Done deal. That's what I'm getting.
-Two eggs, wheat, white, raisin toast.

613
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,607
Bacon, ham, or sausage.
You get a waffle or a biscuit and gravy.

614
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,941
-Two of those.
-Absolutely.

615
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,693
-Wait.
-No, no, no, no, I'm just kidding.

616
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,862
And how about you, sir?

617
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,739
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

618
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,074
-[Kimberly] Ma'am. I am so sorry.
-That's okay.

619
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,953
Ah, but that's quite all right.
I'm gonna get the, um, All-Star Special.

620
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,748
All right. Thank you very much.
And I'll take your menus.

621
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,957
-You're welcome.
-Great.

622
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,875
[Kimberly] Yeah.

623
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,252
I have an order.

624
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,298
I don't like being misgendered that much,
but what can I do, pal?

625
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,260
-It's, uh...
-[Harper] You know what?

626
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,595
It's gonna ha... I mean...

627
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,056
It is gonna happen.
You know what you should do?

628
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,392
You should go, "What do you want,
little lady who's a woman?"

629
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,604
-Huh. "And for the little lady."
-[Harper] "Now for the little lady..."

630
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,356
-You don't have to.
-The little lady.

631
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,983
-[Kimberly] Who has wheat?
-Uh, I got the white.

632
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,985
-I got the wheat.
-Wheat? There you go.

633
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,240
You excited for the game tonight,
by the way?

634
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,992
I'm excited. But I'll be honest.

635
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,788
Walking through all those bros
in a bro-ey environment

636
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,374
has been my hardest part of my...

637
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,168
-Right.
-My, um, transition.

638
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,546
I was that person.
I went to basketball games.

639
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,464
-I know... I know the culture.
-Right.

640
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,216
And I'm gonna go back in that culture,

641
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,845
and there's a lot of that still in me
that does not like what's happening.

642
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,265
-[Will] Yeah.
-And I'm not totally comfortable with it.

643
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,808
[suspenseful music playing]

644
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,560
-[Will] Here we go.
-Here we go.

645
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,604
[Harper] When I walk
into that basketball stadium...

646
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,982
-You look fantastic.
-[Harper] Oh, thank you.

647
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,192
-[Will] I love the jacket.
-I worked on it.

648
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,737
...I am a woman,
and that's how I need to be seen.

649
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,533
But I'm not sure...
It's just they may not see me that way.

650
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,451
This is an odd thing to say.

651
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,620
-I may not see myself that way.
-Mm-hmm.

652
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,289
[Harper] But you sort of running point

653
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,417
makes this a fuck of a lot easier
than if I was just alone,

654
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,086
and I gotta keep that in mind
throughout this trip.

655
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,464
'Cause, obviously,
I'm getting a little free pass here,

656
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,884
but I'm not saying
it's not gonna be difficult.

657
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,927
[suspenseful music continues]

658
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:38,146
[Harper] I gotta tell you,
we've been to a lot of Laker games.

659
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,063
[Will] Yeah.

660
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,984
[Harper] I've never seen Jack Nicholson,
I've never seen Leonardo DiCaprio,

661
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,904
I've never seen Vince Vaughn
at a basketball game

662
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,739
sitting next to their trans friend.

663
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,783
-[Will] Right.
-[Harper] I've just never seen it myself.

664
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,453
[buzzer sounds]

665
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,540
[player 1] Yo!

666
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,253
It's so complicated
because I used sports all the time

667
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,634
to let people know that I was not a woman.

668
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:13,598
I mean, not that women can't like sports,
but I was trying to... you know...

669
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,143
-Yeah, try... You were always... Yeah.
-I was trying to be that guy.

670
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,145
[Harper] By doing that all the time,

671
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,564
I did learn a lot about sports,

672
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,025
and I do kind of like it. [chuckles]

673
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,986
[buzzer sounds]

674
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,696
-[Will] Oh!
-[cheering]

675
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,198
-Yeah!
-Yes!

676
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,283
Wow.

677
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,244

[cheering, whistling]

681
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,670
What do we think of the Sixers?

[Pacer fans booing]

683
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,173
What do we think of the Pacers?

[Pacer fans cheering]

685
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,510
-Sixers!

-Pacers!
-[Pacer fans cheering, whistling]

687
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,600
I wanna thank you, Indianapolis.
I'm here with my friend Harper Steele.

688
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,686
-She just transitioned.
-Wait, we're off. We're off.

689
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,771
-[woman shouting indistinctly]
-[Harper] We're off.

690
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,232
Indy, you've showed us nothing but love.

691
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,484
-[chuckles] We're off.
-Thank you!

692
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,777
[man] Woo-hoo!

[commentator 2] <i>Just over there,

696

<i>so we can start the game.</i>

697
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,208
So you're working your way across
the country? How do you end up here?

698
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,877
[Will] Harper and I
have known each other for 30 years,

699
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,131
and we're, uh,
we're going across the country.

700
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,176
-To basketball field houses or anything?
-No, this was just...

701
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,805
This is our first
professional sporting event

702
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,432
since Harper's transition.

703
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,227
So the Pacers were nice enough
to allow us access.

-[man] Oh man, it's started.

706
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,822
Wait, was that the governor of this state?

707
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,740
Mm-hmm.

708
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,286
What's his name?

709
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,582
Eric Holcomb.

710
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,876
-Holcomb?
-Yep.

711
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,085

-[Will] Here's where I dropped the ball.
-[Harper] Oh, okay.

725
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:54,383
I obviously didn't anticipate
meeting the governor of Indiana.

726
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,468
Oh, yeah.

727
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,429
-And I... He asked what we were doing.
-Right.

728
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,390
And we told him,
and he seemed... he seemed to...-

729
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,142
-Okay with that.
-Be, "Oh, great."

730
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,521
And I... I wish I had
the wherewithal to go, like,

731
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,232
"What's your stance on trans people?"

732
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,191
Or "What's..."

733
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,443
I actually didn't know
he was the governor,

734
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,530
and then, later in the conversation,
someone said something...

735
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,366
And I did. I heard, like,
"I want you to meet the governor."

736
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
-Oh!
-And I'm like, "Oh."

737
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,994
This must happen to you a lot.

738
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,622
The photo you don't wanna be in.

739
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,665
[Will] Yeah.

740
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,917
-I don't get that very often.
-[Will] Right.

741
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,004
And someone comes in, and there's
someone down there on the floor snapping.

742
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,798
"This person's with Will Ferrell."

743
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,509
But then I'm in this photo
with this governor,

744
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,469
and I don't know his politics.

745
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,346
-Right.
-And, uh, I mean...

746
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,640
-That was the thing. That was...
-No...

747
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,100
That was my negative take...

748
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,561
That was the one place
where I was like, "I should've..."

749
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,564
Just to see what he happened to say.

750
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,149
Yeah.

751
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,943
[Will] So walking into that arena...

752
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:54,861
Yeah.

753
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,155
-20,000 people, right?
-Yeah.

754
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,573
[Will] How did that feel?

755
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,369
I know that all of this
is going to make it easier for me

756
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,538
to walk into these kind of places later.

757
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,456
I did it. It's done.

758
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,335
I'm sort of looking for some of that
a little bit more on this trip.

759
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:16,215
Like, I'm gonna have to peel off
a few times and just...

760
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,551
-[Will] Sure.
-So I can feel what it feels like.

761
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,635
By yourself, right?

762
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,345
-Yeah, of course.
-Yeah.

763
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,055
[pensive country music playing]

764
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,395
[Harper] It's fascinating to me.

765
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,565
There's so many trans people out here
all around the country,

766
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,817
living their lives in these places.

767
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,735
[Will] Yeah.

768
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,737
[Harper] To me,

769
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,699
connecting with more people like that
would be something I would like to do.

770
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,493
Oh, we're heading to Peoria.

771
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,705
There's, uh, a woman there
we're gonna meet named Dana Garber,

772
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,208
who, um, transitioned later in life,

773
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:56,464
and she has been deeply involved
in the trans community in Peoria,

774
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,882
which is fascinating to me

775
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,508
because I did not know...

776
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,426
Of course.

777
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,969
...any trans people growing up.

778
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,887
Yeah.

779
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,145
[Harper] Thanks for having us
in your city, in Peoria.

780
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,313
[Dana] Yeah.

781
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,940
Are you from here originally?

782
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,317
-Yeah, this is Pekin right here.
-[Will] Okay.

783
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,110
And I've been here my whole life.

784
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,028
-Oh wow.
-[Dana] Yep.

785
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,031
[Harper] Did you transition like me?

786
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,407
Ki... I'm 61. So...

787
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,368
-And I'm 65.
-[Harper] Okay.

788
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:29,205
I started... I came out to my family
when I was 55.

789
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,873
Okay. Wow. Okay, so it's...

790
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,875
-[Will] So very similar to Harper.
-[Dana] Yeah.

791
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,463
I know from my own experience,
but I'm gonna guess that was really tough.

792
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,757
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-[Harper] Yeah.

793
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,928
Yes. So I knew a long time ago
that, you know,

794
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,847
that I should have been a girl.

795
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,849
On my first day of kindergarten,

796
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,103
I walked in and I sat down with the girls.

797
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,273
So the teacher's talking about
class rules, you know.

798
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,608
-Yeah.
-So she took us to potty.

799
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,068
And I got in the girls' line.

800
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,570
She grabbed me by the hand
and said, "No, baby."

801
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,156
"You gotta go in the boys' line.
You're a boy."

802
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,285
And everybody started making fun of me.

803
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,287
So I got, like, a panic attack,

804
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,248
and I went in the bathroom,
threw up and everything.

805
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,084
And the teacher came in there,
like, "Are you sick?"

806
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,545
And she called my mom,
and my mom came and got me.

807
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,340
And I... I told her what had happened.
And she said, "Honey, you're a boy."

808
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,136
"You can't go in there with the girls.
You got different body parts and stuff."

809
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,346
-And I didn't know that, you know?
-[Harper] Right.

810
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,098
It wasn't about body parts.

811
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,059
You know,
it was about who I am in here, so...

812
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,021
You know, it's like,
what was wrong with me, you know?

813
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:39,191
I used to pray to Jesus
every night when I was in grade school,

814
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,820
you know, fix me or kill me,
one or the other, you know?

815
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,322
-It was horrible.
-[Harper] Yeah.

816
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,241
[Dana] It was like,
"Why am I like this?" You know?

817
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,868
[gentle music playing]

818
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:54,749
Got in a really bad place mentally,
and I got pretty suicidal for a while.

819
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,001
-[Harper] Yeah.
-And I thought the only way...

820
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,879
I thought,
"I don't really wanna die," you know,

821
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,424
"but I don't
wanna go on like this either."

822
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,843
So that's when I started counseling,

823
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,138
and my counselor was really awesome.

824
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,476
She's more like, "If you wanna do this,
then try it," you know?

825
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:18,689
Because I wasn't living
my auth... authenticity, you know? So...

826
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,607
[Harper] Yeah.

827
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,986
Um... Now, my experience was that I had a...
kind of not a good therapist.

828
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,030
-You know how that works sometimes.
-Yeah.

829
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,157
And, uh, much later,

830
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,993
I got a... a better... A gender therapist,

831
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
and we kept talking.

832
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,289
And it was still a year,
but once I got to...

833
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,792
my est... my first estrogen pill...

834
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,001
This is silly to me.

835
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,544
-I'm sure any person...
-[Dana chuckles]

836
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,838
But that first estrogen pill
is like, "Ta-da!"

837
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,216
"Magic! Ah, this is
the most amazing feeling."

838
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,426
-You're not feeling anything for months.
-Wow.

839
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,429
But I just like...
mentally, I was just like... like,

840
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,265
"Why did I wait so long?
I love this." You know?

841
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,767

-[Harper] Yeah.

in this community at times, or...

843
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,527
[Dana] I think I've had a few incidents.

844
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,321
My voice gets me misgendered a lot,
and I just...

845

-[Will] You hate your voice.

-[Harper] Yeah.

851

and I'm really thinking,

852
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,639
was I doing this for me
or for society, you know?

981
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,190
[Will] Fantastic. I love it.

982
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,740
-[Harper] Hi.
-Hello.

983
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,826
-[Harper] Huh?
-[both chuckle]

984
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,371
-[Eleanor] Good to see you.
-This is my friend Will Ferrell.

985
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,998
-Hi, Will.
-[Will] How are you?

986
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,501
Oh, should this be a housewarming gift?

987
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,878
[Eleanor] Oh, thank you.

988
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,381
-[Will] Do you like Pringles?
-[Eleanor] I love Pringles.

989
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,635
All right, just around the corner.

990
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,095
[Harper] Okay.
Bathroom in there, by the way.

991
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,932
-Thank you. This is great.
-[Harper] Yeah.

992
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,769
Eleanor, what was your reaction
when you got the news?

993
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,187
I was totally surprised.

994
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,522
Um...

995
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:02,194
And I think my reaction was... sorrow.

996
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,779
[Will] Uh-huh.

997
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,864
And the reason I felt sorrow

998
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:11,870
was I thought about how much pain
Harper must have suffered over the years.

999
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,123
And also knowing, like, immediately

1000
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,126
how stressful that moment was
of coming out.

1001
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:23,465
And so the most important thing to me
was not to be so careful in my response

1002
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,967
but to respond quickly.

1003
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,884
You did.

1004
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,388
So she knew
it's not something I need to think about.

1005
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,598
-I'll talk to you more later.
-[Will] Yeah.

1006
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,978
I think what you said,
which was so... heartening...

1007
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,064
[chuckles] ...was, "Oh good.
I've always wanted a sister."

1008
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,775
-I did say that, yeah.
-[Harper] That's what you said.

1009
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,193
Pow. Just like that.

1010
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,739
I was gonna tell a funny story,
though, because I always think of this.

1011
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,992
I think it was around eighth grade.

1012
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:55,455
Eleanor gave me a pair of her bell-bottoms
that she didn't want anymore,

1013
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,292
and they were white, frilly bell-bottoms.

1014
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,462
And once I got 'em,
they were my favorite article of clothing.

1015
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,339
I wore them all around. I loved them.

1016
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,885
And I went to the skate park
with my skate friends.

1017
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,886
-[Will] Yeah.
-Uh...

1018
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,472
And we skated around that night,
and I was feeling good in my white...

1019
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,683
-[Will] In your white bell-bottoms.
-My bell-bottoms.

1020
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,770
And, uh, I come out of that skate park,
and it's like, uh...

1021
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,066
"Hey, we gotta come back next week.
They're doing it again next week."

1022
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,612
And someone goes,
"Yeah, but don't bring those faggy pants."

1023
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,529
[Will] Oh.

1024
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,408
And, uh, the pants disappeared
right at that moment.

1025
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,286
There's no part of you that was like,
"Shut up. These pants are cool."

1026
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,290
[Harper] So many times in my life, some,
probably, effort for Harper to get out

1027
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,708
was just squashed.

1028
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,460
-Yeah.
-[Harper] Over and over again.

1029
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,088
And I just remember that one
kind of clearly. So...

1030
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,300
Uh, Eleanor,
you haven't touched your Pringles.

1031
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,219
-Sour cream and onion.
-[Eleanor] Oh, I totally forgot.

1032
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,389
Are you familiar with their Scorched line?

1033
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,766
-[Eleanor] I'm not.
-Yeah.

1034
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,101
-That might be too much for me, yeah.
-[Will] I think so.

1035
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,853
-Oh, why thank you.
-[Harper] Mm.

1036
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,355
-Oh, a little taste of...
-Oh.

1037
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,773
Oh. Don't... Oh!

1038
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,690
[Will] Mm.

1039
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,693
-[crunching]
-And where did these come from?

1040
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,614
[Harper] We got them at a Walmart.
It was in Indianapolis.

1041
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,450
They taste different.
You can tell they're from Indiana.

1042
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:17,412
-[Harper] Oh yeah, definitely.

1045
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,045
Think my mother collected all those.

1046
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,588

1048
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,843
[Harper] These are little school photos of

00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,222
cute Harper Steele when she was confused.

1050
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,766
And this is probably around the age

1051
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,977
where I started to feel
just kind of weird.

1052
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,894
[Will] Yeah.

1053
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,523
[Harper] And, uh...
you just start to think to yourself

1054
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,192
that, uh, everyone feels the same way.

1055
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,819
So you're just kind of quiet...

1056
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,739
[chuckles] ...about the whole deal.
It's like, "We all feel that way, right?"

1057
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,661
Every time I see
a picture like this of me...

1058
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,082
I mean, here I am in the newspaper.
I used to ride a unicycle.

1059
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,169
I... I rode all over town,
Iowa City, on... on the unicycle.

1060
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,381
I love this photo. This is, uh...

as a little girl. [chuckles]

1062
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,971
I swear to God, I love this photo.

1063
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,765

This is the house that I grew up in.

1069
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,501
I used to skateboard. Did all
my early skateboarding tricks out here.

1070
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,588
-I used to do my pole-vaulting this side.
-Down this, like...

1071
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,591
Yeah, we had this...
I had... My mother built a little...

1072
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,677
Uh, she helped me build
a pole-vaulting mat

1073
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,055
out of a bunch of potato sacks and...

1074
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,848
-So you'd run down that way.
-Yeah. Choo.

1075
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,517
[Will] And then...
But in the backyard was where...

1076
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,269
-The puck was. Yeah.
-[Will] Okay.

1077
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,273
And I'd smack it, and I'd...
You know, seven feet.

[both laughing]

1081
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,785
I came home from City High one day,
and I was just kinda bored.

1082
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,496
So I started acting like I was drunk
on the way home.

1083
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,247
-[chuckles]
-And... Oh, I could ride that.

1084
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,874
Hey, can I ride that?

1085
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,877
Do you mind if she borrows your unicycle
just for a second?

1086
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,795
[kid] What?

1087
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,047
Could she just ride your unicycle
for a second?

1088
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:32,964
Why?

1089
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,050
-She knows how to ride one.
-[kid] Sure.

1090
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,468
-Yeah, thanks.
-Oh, that's awesome.

1091
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,261
I'm in heels,
so it might be a little hard.

-My name's Quinn. Yours?

-Cool.

[Harper] I like to have this up here,
so when I fall, it's gonna be good.

1095
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,813
She was bragging
about being able to ride a unicycle.

1096
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,315
Is that your mode of transportation,
pretty much?

1097
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,651
This was my mode of transportation
in junior high.

[music fades]

1143
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,759
[Will] So I was so curious.

1144
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,847
Just... I don't know, I just thought...
I... I... I never asked you, like...

1145
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,350
[Harper] Okay, go.

1146
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,310
-Go.
-How... how are your boobs?

1147
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,187
-As if...
-Now you got boobs.

1148
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,813
I love my boobs.

1149
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:58,276
When you woke up from that s... Was it...

1150
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,779
I like to think it was like...

1151
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,198
[both chuckling]

1152
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,951
Was it just like the heavens
were sing... in a way?

1153
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,329
I joke that I did puberty
in about four hours.

1154
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,330
[Will chuckles]

1155
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,291
But... as soon as I woke up,

1156
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,669
I was like,

1157
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,463
"This is amazing."

1158
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,381
Yeah.

1159
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:23,718
Every time I've done something that's
made me feel better in my own body...

1160
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,095
-Yeah.
-For myself...

1161
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,973
-[Will] It's amazing.
-There's... It... it... it... it's been...

1162
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,559
-[Will] Exhilarating. Yeah.
-Yeah. Guns a-blazing.

1163
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,020
-[Will] Yup. That's great.
-So...

1164
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,357
-So that was my experience with the boobs.
-Okay. What... Okay.

1165
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,858
So this... this is a big one,

1166
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,820
but... but maybe, you know,
maybe we save this for later.

1167
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,363
You are a friend of mine.

1168
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,324
I invite any friend of mine
to ask me these questions.

1169
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,326
I am not afraid to talk about it.

1170
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,290
Do you foresee wanting to have
other physical augmentation?

1171
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,627
-Possibly.
-[Will] In the future.

1172
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,880
[Harper] When I first started
thinking about transitioning,

1173
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,674
in terms of bottom surgery,

1174
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,801
I was like, "Well, I'm 61."

1175
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,721
"I'm not gonna be a..."

1176
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:12,350
"I'm not out there
with a super active sexual life, really."

1177
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,310
[Will] Yeah.

1178
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,104
-But there's also the dysphoric side.
-[Will] Yeah.

1179
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:21,484
Looking in a mirror and seeing something
that doesn't fit with how I feel.

1180
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,485
-So...
-[Will] Yeah.

1181
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,903
-[Harper] I don't know.
-Yeah.

1182
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,905
-[Harper] That's a tough one to answer.
-Right.

1183
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,492
But, uh... Was there
any more boob questions you needed?

1184
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,287
-[Will] No, but I did wanna ask, however...
-Okay.

1185
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,164
Have you been to the...

1186
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,876
have you been in Nordstrom's Rack
since you've gotten your own rack?

1187
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,253
-Very good. Very... Very good.
-Ha-ha!

1188
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,714
And Will Ferrell wins
the Best Joke of the Year award.

1189
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,718
Thank you. I knew as soon as I said it,
I got Best Joke of the Year.

1190
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,262
I hate analyzing comedy
because it kinda ruins it.

1191
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,306
-In this case, it won't.
-You gotta break it down.

1192
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,141
-You do... [chuckles]
-[Will] You gotta.

1193
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,895
-"Harper, What exactly did he do there?"
-But let me explain how he got there.

1194
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,605
Will started with,

1195
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,316
"When you got your new rack."

1196
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,360
The connection is, "Did you go..."

1197
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,861
"...to Nordstrom?"

1198
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,529
-Ah!
-[both chuckling]

1199
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,782
-[Will] God. Wow.
-And the two racks, different racks.

1200
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,159
One of them's different,
but they're the same rack.

1201
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,535
-[Will] Wow.
-Yeah.

1202
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,913

00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,796

-[Will] Seen any famous people today?

1204
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,880
-[woman] No.
-[Will] Okay.

1205
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,673
-[woman] Just you.
-[Will chuckles gleefully]

1206
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,967

-[Harper] Yeah!

1207

-[Harper] Fireworks world!

1208
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,808
-[Will] This is gigantic.
-[Harper] Oh my God.

-Holy Nishiki!
-[laughs] I want something dangerous.

Yeah, that's it.
Honey Badger. It's the Honey Badger.

1213
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,945
-Set it down.
-Yep.

1214
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,155
Pull the fuse,
or pull the sticker off the fuse.

1215

-You're gonna light that, then run away.
-Light, and book.

How many clean undies do you have left?

I'm getting down to the...

-Yup, yup.

[Will] So...
we're heading to Meeker, Oklahoma.

1223
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,734
[Harper] Uh-huh.

1224
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,864
[Will] And this is in the category
of places you would have visited

1225
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,407
and not thought twice about.

1226
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,826
And so what are you feeling?
What are you thinking?

1227
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,954
I'm nervous and anxious, like...

1228
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,666
You know I love these kind of places.

1229
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:46,463
You know that I spent my life
driving back and forth across the country,

1230
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,256
going to little towns like this,

1231
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,967
stopping in bars,
drinking, meeting people.

1232
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,761
But I just don't know if I can anymore.

1233
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,187
Okay.

1234
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:07,275
[Will] So you... You're gonna call me
if... if it's feeling dicey.

1235
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,443
I'm gonna... You know what?

1236
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,154
-I'm gonna put it on speed dial.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,198
-[Harper] And you come running in.
-Yep.

1238
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,991
[Harper] With that mug of yours.

1239
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,328
-[Will] I could go in with you right now.
-No.

1240
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,081
I would feel better if that were the case,
but I just wanna try this thing.

1241
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,543
I'm not gonna have an exper...
I won't be able to try this on my own.

1242
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,420
-I might as well try it now.
-Yeah.

-Dominique. Harper Steele.

-All right. I heard about you.

-Yeah.
-[Dominique laughs]

1261

I haven't heard about her.
Sorry about that.

-Okay.

Y'all from Oklahoma?

1264
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,079
No, no, no it's all right. I've been...

1265
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:47,292
That's why I came in here.
I've been in a lot of bars in my life, so...

1266
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,878
Trying to feel like if I can go back
to bars since I transitioned.

-[Dominique] Iowa!

1272

I... I... Thank you.

1277
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:23,578
I like... I like, uh, Iowa more,
but I can't make any money there.

01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,288
-So...
-[Dominique] Oh really?

1279
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,123
[Harper] Yeah, I write for TV.

1280
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,794
I'm gonna text my friend.
He's parking the car out there.

[Will] Hey. Hi.

1285
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,556
[Harper] I want you to meet these guys.
These are my friends.

-Is this Will Ferrell?
-[woman 1] Yes, it is.

-Not a bro though.
-She.

-Oh. Sorry.

You can try again.

-Yeah.
-[Harper] Yeah.

1294
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,991
About a year and a half ago,
I transitioned.

1295
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,454
And now Will wants to kind of go out
in the middle of the country with me.

1296
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,290
-Oh my goodness. That's great.
-That's cool. Hey, it's...

1297
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,043
I like your support for your friend.

1298
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,755
No, that's amazing.
There's not a lot of that nowadays.

1299
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,924
-You know?
-[Will] Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

positive that to connect with
a woman or a man,

1375

I would have to lie and hide myself."

-Yeah.

-Yes.
-Right? And you wanna...

1384
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:37,118
And you wanna go out
and go to the bar and pick up someone

1385
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,829
or be picked up, that kind of encounter.

-Yeah.

-[Will] Yeah.
-I'm 61.

1389

But I would love to be
in a relationship again.

are you interested in a trans woman?

-Sure.

-Okay, yeah. Gotcha. Okay.

but the type is the one that...

-It's a blank canvas at this point.
-Yeah.

in the morning, drink coffee in bed,

and talk about the stupid movie
we watched the night before.

I know that sounds corny.

very... wrong to me,

and, I mean, the crowds
that come around you so quickly.

1466
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,360
[sobs gently]

1467
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,238
Oh boy.

-[Will breathes shakily]
-Oh! Okay.

1469
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,201
I feel like I let you down in that moment.

1470
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,078
-Oh, no, no, no.
-You know?

1471
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,079
And... [hesitates]

1472
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,040
I was like, "Oh shit. I got..."

1473
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,210
[sniffles] "We gotta worry
about Harper's safety."

1474

[solemn music playing]

1478
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,440
[Harper] I was gonna read
some of the tweets we've been receiving

1479
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:02,568
since we started this trip.
You wanna hear this one?

1480
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,361
"Ah, very important

1481
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,406
you have another gender bender
for the kids to see."

1482
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,243
"It's so trendy and cool,
even Will Ferrell's doing it."

1483
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,289
"It really sucks that Will Ferrell
shows up to his first Pacers game

1484
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,540
with a trans woman."

1485
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:17,791
"Who's that dude?"

1486
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,377
Oh yeah, yeah. Here's a good one though.

1487
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,629
"Will Ferrell stopped in Iowa City today."

1488
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,382
"He and Ryan Reynolds are making
a road trip documentary

1489
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,176
supporting trans kids and rights."

1490
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,844
[chuckles] Ryan's...

1491
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,556
I didn't realize
Ry... Ryan's a part of everything.

1492
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:34,558
-Oh, here's one just about you.
-Okay.

1493
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,101
-Wanna hear this one?
-Yes, please.

"Great,
a satanic Illuminati pedophile in Iowa."

1495
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,483
[chuckles softly] And that's me?

1496
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,568
Yeah. How do you feel about that?

1497
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,866
It just feels ridiculous. I don't...
I have no emotional... I mean...

1498
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,788
That stuff, you can't underestimate
the damage that all that does.

1499
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,792
When you're trans,
you ingest a lot of that shit,

1500
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,377
and it sits in your head.

1501
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,921
-Those tweets are in my head.
-Yeah.

1502

[solemn music continues]

1503
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,854
When... when hatred is pointed
at me and trans people,

1504
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,899
they're like, "You're not a woman."

1505
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,526
"You'll never be a woman."

1506
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,280
Okay, I... you know,
I am a trans woman. I'm fine with that.

1507
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,242
-But I am feeling something, you know?
-Yeah.

1508
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,869
And it's not unhealthy.

1509
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,456
It's made me actually healthier
in many respects.

1510
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,291
-Yeah, yeah.
-It saved my life, I think.

1511
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,210
And I'm not joking about that.

1512
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,715
Did you come really close
at any point to... to...

1513
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,637
I know you had dark thoughts,
but suicidal though... I mean, did you...

1514
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,599
Was it that intense at times?

1515
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,644
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1516
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,729
-Yes, I, uh...
-Yeah.

1517
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:06,525
[Harper] I'm gonna say...
six years ago, maybe,

1518
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,652
I went to the gun place,

1519
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,488
and... [chuckles] ...the guy,

1520
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,615
he asked me, uh,

1521
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,828
"Is it for, uh, targets,
or is it for, uh, security?"

1522
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:21,498
And I was like, "Oh," uh,
'cause I know nothing about guns.

1523
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,334
-Me neither. [chuckles]
-Right, and I'm like, "Um..."

1524
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,920
"Uh... well, yeah, maybe both."

1525
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:29,381
"I'm in a kinda isolated house."
I'm trying to lie.

1526
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,217
So I picked it up,
and I was looking at it,

1527
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,802
and I was super scared.

1528
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,096
-Golly.
-I walked out of there.

1529
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,640
I was just like,
"Okay. I'm gonna come back."

1530
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,017
"I'm gonna think about it."

1531
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,644
Up until the moment,
really, I transitioned,

1532
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,855
I didn't wanna have a gun around me.

1533
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:48,233
-Because it could be an impulsive thing.
-[Will] Yeah.

1534
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:52,279
Because there was definitely moments
where I thought, "I wish I had that gun."

1535
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,033
But the moment I transitioned,

1536
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,618
all I wanted to do was live.

1537
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:58,619
-Oh.
-Just live.

1538
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,537
Live and... and continue on the path...

1539
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,539
Oh my God. I got this free gift.

1540
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,665
...being really who you are.

1541
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,583

-Wow.

I feel such a strong
Albuquerque connection with Harper

1546
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,839
because I was here working on <i>MacGruber</i>

1547
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,343
when we all first found out
that you were transitioning.

1548
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,931
And it was here
exactly one year ago today.

1549
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,685
[Harper] I will say

1550
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:08,355
part of me feels like I should have
made that decision 40 years ago,

1551
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,358
but I wouldn't have met you guys.

1552
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:15,529
I would not have gotten hired at...
started a comedy world, probably.

1553
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,906
-I would have had a different life, so...
-Yeah.

the same thing I'm feeling? A little...

-Yeah.

1641
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,139
-Harper transitioned...
-I transitioned, and we're just sort of...

1642
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,184
We're kinda discussing
what that means for our friendship.

1643
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,938
-Do you mind if I ask you a question?
-[Harper] Yeah, good. I would love it.

1644
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:22,818
I'm just wondering how early you knew,
how early you wanted to.

1645
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,779
I think growing up in Iowa,

1646
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,908
it was so impossible
to think something like that.

1647
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,702
-Uh-huh.
-[Harper] So I just think I couldn't...

1648
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,372
I thought I was weird.
I knew something was weird about me.

1649
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,040
I definitely knew that and...

1650
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:41,795
But I also came around to thinking
that... the kind of weird I was was normal.

1651
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:46,383
So about ten years ago, it just started
to explode in me a little more.

1652
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:47,968
-And I just...
-Wow.

1653
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:51,388
I kept fighting it and fighting it
and talking to therapists and...

1654
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,431
-Yeah.
-You know what?

1655
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,934
-I'm a retired therapist.
-[Harper] Oh. Oh, okay.

1656
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,145
I had a patient very early in my career,

1657
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,524
so now we're talking... 30 years ago,

1658
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,109
and he came in and said,

1659
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,571
"I'm happily married. I love my wife."

1660
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,488
[Harper] Yeah, yeah.

1661
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,824
"But I dress in her clothes
whenever I can."

1662
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,535
-[Harper] Yeah.
-"And I don't think I'm..."

1663
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,163
"I don't... I don't...
I don't know what I am."

1664
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,875
-Yeah, yeah. How did you work through it?
-Yeah.

1665
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:23,378
-I was very closed-minded about it.
-[Harper] Yeah, yeah.

1666
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:27,173
Sort of afraid
to go into really unknown territory.

1667
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
-It was unknown to me.
-[Harper] Yeah.

1668
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:32,596
Can I tell you, I had a therapist
like that that sort of stopped me.

1669
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:33,680
Ah, I... [sighs]

1670
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,849
[Harper] And... and... and again, I'm not...

1671
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:39,102
I stopped myself enough
that I don't blame anyone.

1672
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,105
-Yeah, that's...
-I tried to be open and supportive.

1673
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:45,233
But I know
that a lot of my subtle messages were...

1674
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,443
[Harper] Of course.

1675
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:49,613
-But I've got this my whole life.
-"But you love your wife and..."

1676
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,114
[Harper] Yeah, I know. So...

1677
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,533
-"You love your wife, your life."
-[Harper] Yeah.

1678
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,660

-[woman] You know?

1679
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,246
-Surgery is a huge...
-[Harper] "Can you manage it?"

1680
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:03,126
Yeah. I know that I was a blockade
in that man's... in that person's life.

what would the name of the beer be?

-Yeah.

01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:43,124
I have something very special
for my good friend Cornelius Danderhoff.

1691
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,003
-Oh!
-It's a coat.

1692
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:49,756
It's a beverage jacket.

It's a... a beverage...

01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,720

think of Dolores as a beverage.

But I don't know
how you wanna think of it.

in a perfectly fitting suit, I think.

I... I do believe that you mean that. Right?

and things in my underwear or in a Speedo

1740
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,742
is that I'm a fairly modest person.

That's why I was excited no one was here.

1745
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:37,841
'Cause I put the Speedo on, I used to be
kind of like comedically out of shape.

01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:42,632
-I don't want people to know it's me.
-So are you trying to change...

1790
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:43,841
-I'm Will Ferrell.
-Oh.

1791
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,135
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-Very nice to meet you. Yeah.

1792
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,720
So, yeah, I just...

1793
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,807
Tonight, we wanna go to dinner
without a famous person.

1794
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,058
-I see, okay.
-Yeah.

1795
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,019
[man] Probably stick away
from some of the brighter colors

1796
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,938
so it doesn't draw attention to you.

1797
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:00,191
-Right.
-So do something more natural.

1801
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:16,207
This looks like... not someone who lives
in Vegas, but someone who visits, right?

1802
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,294
[Harper] That's interesting.

1803
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,587
-Dress sizes are crazy, don't you think?
-Yes.

1804
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,382
-[Harper] I'll try that one.
-That is cute.

1805
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,217
-Right? Thank you.
-Yeah, it is.

1807
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,723

William.

1815
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,347
[Harper chuckling] Oh my God.

1816
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,767
What is going on?

1817
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,394
Oh my God.

1818
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:22,273
I'm not Will. I'm David Abernathy.

1819
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,234
Oh, David Abernathy.
Do we have a reservation tonight?

1820
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,444
[Will] We do.

1821
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,071
-Oh my God.
-[Will snickers]

1822
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,954
Oh, thank you, David.

1823
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,415
-You sit here.
-Okay.

1824
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:40,917
And there.

1825
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:43,544
Thank you.

1826
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:46,923
Oh.

1827
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:48,549
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, sir.

1828
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,718
-[Will] Hello.
-Welcome to the SW Steakhouse.

1829
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,637
-[both] Thank you.
-What a pleasure to have you.

1830
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,098
-Thank you.
-Thank you. I'm David. This is Harper.

1831
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,808
Hi, David. Hi, Harper. I'm John.

1832
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,434
-Hi.
-[server] Pleasure to meet you both.

1833
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,520
-[Will] I'm David Abernathy.
-You're Dav... Sorry?

1834
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,398
-David Abernathy.
-David Abernathy. I'm John Bortles.

1835
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,983
I... I managed Bette Midler
for a little while.

1836
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,027
-[John] Oh wow.
-And Air Supply.

1837
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,029
-Glad to have you.
-[Will] Wait.

1838
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:13,866
-I believe we'd love... two Montagues.
-[Harper] A Montague.

1839
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,370
Excellent choice. I'll get that started.
One of our signature drinks.

1840
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,247
Cheers to, uh...

1841
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,791
-[Harper] Cheers to our little experiment.
-Yeah.

1842
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,627
I don't know if it's working or not.
I can't tell.

1843
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,087
[Will] I can't either, but...

1844
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,551
This whole trip, obviously,
you're taking the heat off me.

1845
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:32,677
-[Will] Yeah.
-Um...

1846
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,557
And that's just not the life
of a real trans person.

1847
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,892
But when I was in the Goodwill today,

1848
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:44,981
I just felt way more comfortable,
and that's a bit of a result of this trip.

1849
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:46,524
-Yeah.
-For sure.

1850
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,317
-Like...
-[John] Another cocktail?

1851
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:52,321
Yeah, I would love a,
uh... just a glass of... of Cab.

1852
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,365
Thanks, John.

1853
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,995
[Harper] Okay,
it's a complicated subject for me.

1854
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,414
Sometimes, the better my makeup looks,

1855
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,833
the worse I feel about my face.

1856
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:06,252
Well... But you look...

1857
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,255
You look great.

1858
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:14,385
But there's something about...
the slow process of getting

1859
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,971
used to who I am...

1860
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:17,889
[Will] Yeah.

1861
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,143
...that the... "prettier" I get,

1862
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,770
the more I see the flaws.

1863
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:28,649
I know what you mean. It's like, "Okay,
I'm putting 'my best foot forward...'"

1864
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,736
[Harper] Right.
And I don't feel like I... I can... Yeah.

1865
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,821
It's making me very self-aware of my...

1866
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,031
[Will] Right.

1867
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:37,533
...unfortunately, very masculine face.

1868
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,744
So I look in the mirror, and I...

1869
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,955
-It's like this is getting closer.
-[Will] Yeah.

1870
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:47,084
But now I'm like,
"Wow, I got a... I got more to do."

1871
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,339
But having spent almost two weeks
with you now, I'm just like...

1872
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,175
I'm just sorta like...

1873
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:56,969
"I'm just with Harper."

1874
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,639
I'm forgetting...

1875
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:02,058
-[Harper] The dead name?
-The dead name.

1876
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,435
It's just getting fully...

1877
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:09,440
replaced, and I don't... I don't know.

1878
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,399
I mean,

1879
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:12,944
thanks.

1880
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:17,823
Do you feel lucky sitting across the table
from someone who looks like this?

1881
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:22,495
I feel very fortunate
to be sitting across the table

1882
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,664
from Bette Midler's old manager.

1883
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,123
-[Will] Old manager.
-Yeah.

1884
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,085
-Do you think John... Oh, here comes John.
-[Harper] Okay, good.

1885
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,421
You think John knows it's me?

1886
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,302
-[John] Nickel & Nickel Cabernet. Enjoy.
-Thanks, John.

1887
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:39,804
My pleasure.

1888
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,556
[Harper] Mm.

1889
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,476
John is suspicious. So just be honest.

1890
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,979
-[Will] John's onto me.
-Yeah, John... [chuckling]

1891
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,106
[both chuckling]

1892
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:52,650
["Wagon Wheel"
by Old Crow Medicine Show playing]

1893
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:10,960
Imagine someone
who goes on a trip with a friend

1894
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,795
and is up for anything and everything.

1895
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:13,754
Stop.

1896
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,799
And there's literally one thing
they wanna do.

1897
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,595
-One fun thing. That's it.
-We've done so many good things.

1898
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,764
One fun thing that they dreamed about,

1899
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,558
that <i>they</i> journaled about.

1900
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:29,186
You never said
you journaled about Dunkin' Donuts.

1901
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,022
I did journal about Dunkin' Donuts.

1902
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,231
"Dear journal..."

1903
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,066
If I could go, today's the day.

1904
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,277
"...I have discovered something called..."

1905
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,655
"Something that's changed my life.
It's a place called Dunkin' Donuts."

-"Each donut is my friend."

1907
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,994
-No. [laughing]
-"I finally found my... my place."

1908
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:50,958
[Harper sighs]

1909
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,713
-Whew.
-[Will] This feels like a long way to go.

1910
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:57,965
[Harper breathing heavily]

1911
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:01,510
-[muttering]
-Are you okay? Want me to take the other...

1912
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:04,055
-Yeah, could you carry all this?
-[both chuckling]

01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,432
-[poignant music playing]
-[Harper] Oof!

[bird of prey screeching]

1915
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:10,936
[Harper sniffs]

1916
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:23,199
So... there's a few passages in my journal

1917
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:26,243
that I just felt like
just talk to this very place.

1918
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,748
[Harper] 11/27/15.

1919

of uncertainty."

in small hidden houses away from the world

1922
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:45,971
where I can create and live in peace."

1923
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,060
"I fantasize about owning
an apartment in Mojave, California."

1924
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,438
"I'm fixated on moving to Mojave."

1925
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,400
"I can't get it out of my mind."

[Harper] "In December,
I found a house in Trona, California."

1928
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:14,083
"It cost ten thousand dollars,
and I couldn't stop obsessing over it."

1929
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,627
"I offered to buy it,

1930
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,588
and now it looks like I will own it."

1931
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:24,969

walk around like a woman."

How... how long have you had it?

1935
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:09,430
I bought it about six or seven years ago.

1936
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,015
[sighs]

1937
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:13,934
[sniffles, sighs]

1938
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,318
Oh my God. [sniffles]

1939
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,153
Yeah. Um...

1940
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,200
And I just was looking for, uh...

1941
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:33,329
some place to go where I could

1942
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,998
get away from people and...

1943
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,502
There's something I liked about this.

1944
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:44,381
[Will] That it was just so...
so far away from everything else?

1945
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,384
Yeah, it was just hidden
in a downtrodden community, and...

1946
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:48,302
[Will] Yeah.

1947
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:50,554
I felt I...

1948
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:54,016
kinda fit in out here.

1949
01:36:54,099 --> 01:36:54,934
[Will] Mm-hmm.

1950
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:57,394
Because...

Yeah. [sniffles]

of these people, too,

and walk around this house,

01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:05,650
We're gonna go down
to the beach here, and, uh...

2118
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,028
-Well, we're just checking in.
-Yeah.

2119
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:09,780
Hey, anything you wanna send us

2120
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:13,075
in the next anywhere from two
to eight minutes would be great.

2121
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,661
-Look at that. There it is.
-[Will] Yeah! Yeah!

2122
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,330
-[Harper] The ocean.
-Beautiful.

2123
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,460
-[Harper] It does feel good, right?
-Yeah.

2124
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:26,630
-[Harper] I mean, it's a long drive.
-Yeah. I know. [chuckles]

2125
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:27,798
[Harper] You know?

2126
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:31,635
Oh!

2127
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:33,970
-Wow.
-[Will] That's great.

2128
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,603
We've dropped these chairs
in some very nice places, haven't we?

2129
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:43,271
-Yeah.
-The Grand Canyon.

2130
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:45,148
-[Will] Yep.
-The Mississippi River.

2131
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,358
[Will] Mighty Mississippi.

2132
01:46:46,858 --> 01:46:49,069
[Harper] On a... In a Walmart parking lot.

2133
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:55,659
-I will never forget this.
-Yeah.

2134
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:57,661
We'll never forget this trip.

2135
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:03,667
Because if it's in a week
or six months from now...

2136
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,584
Yeah.

2137
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,838
...the joy... [chuckles]

2138
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:08,797
Yeah.

2139
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:12,342
...the joy I'm gonna feel just seeing you.

2140
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:17,889
Which I always felt, but it's like,
man, I really got close to my friend Will.

2141
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:20,058
-[Will] I still...
-Yeah.

2142
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:23,687
I'm gonna think of something tomorrow
that I forgot to ask you.

2143
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,189
I'm gonna think
of a bunch of stuff I should've said

2144
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,691
that I wanted to tell you.

2145
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,651
-But...
-We have time.

2146
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:32,028
-[Will] We have time and...
-I mean, yeah.

2147
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,494
I got you a little present.

2148
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:42,581
-[Harper] You did?
-Yeah.

2149
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,708
Because one of...

2150
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:48,962
We've obviously had
this back-and-forth on beauty.

2151
01:47:49,045 --> 01:47:49,880
Yeah.

2152
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,508
-And... being okay with...
-Yeah.

2153
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,927
With kind of, you know...

2154
01:47:57,804 --> 01:48:01,183
Whether it's makeup
or finding the right dress, it... it...

2155
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:05,770
making yourself feel good
as a woman, beautiful.

2156
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:09,441
So... I thought to myself,

2157
01:48:09,524 --> 01:48:12,277
"I know what I wanna get Harper
at the end of the thing."

2158
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:15,739
Her own pair of diamond earrings.

2159
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:18,325
-Not diamond earrings. Really?
-[Will] Yeah.

2160
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,912
[chuckles emotionally, sniffles]

2161
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,371
[tearfully] Oh my God.

2162
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:26,166
So...

2163
01:48:29,377 --> 01:48:30,212
Just to...

2164
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:32,672
[Harper sniffles]

2165
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:35,383
Just as kind of obviously
a memory of the trip,

2166
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:37,260
but just, like, it's okay to...

2167
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:42,766
It's okay to feel pretty
and do nice, pretty things for yourself.

2168
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,810
Oh jeez. [chuckles, sniffles]

2169
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,193
[chuckles emotionally]

2170
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:55,195
-I don't... Jeez.
-[Will giggles]

2171
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,073
It's just so cool. [chuckling]

2172
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,283
-It's just so sweet.
-[Will chuckles]

2173
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,702
-[both chuckling]
-[Harper] You know?

2174
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:04,037
This is very special.

2175
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:07,207
-I'm going in. I'm going in!
-[Will] Whoa!

2176
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:08,333
[Harper chuckles]

2177

2178
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,088

Dolores.

2180

[Will] Cornelius.

2181
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:21,096
So what's next?

2182
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:23,807
[Harper] For me,

2183
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:27,310
tomorrow, I'm running it back.

2184
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:30,564
I gotta get back to New York,
so I'm gonna drive back across.

2185
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,191
What are you doing, by the way?

2186
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:36,361
[Will] I've literally got nothing.
I'm wide open.

2187
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,031
-You wanna go back with me?
-Yeah, let's just run it back.

2188

-New route. Great.

2189

-Yeah.
