It's got a deep throat, Frank.

522
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,601
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

523
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,810
Tiger shark.

524
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,855
A what?

525
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,440
We can start breathing again.

526
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,793
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

527
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,026
Oh, you bet he is.

528
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,736
What is this bite radius crap?

529
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,196
That is a big mouth.

530
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,300
You stuff your frigging
head in there, man,

531
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,326
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

532
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,832
All I'm saying is that it
may not be the shark.

533
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,084
It's just a slight...

534
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,629
I want you to meet Matt. This
is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.

Matt's from the
Oceanographic Institute.

536
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:52,674
Nice to meet you.

537
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,342
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

538
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,721
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

539
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,015
Hammerheads, white
tips, blues, makos.

540
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,102
And the chances that these
bozos got the exact shark...

541
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,104
There are no other
sharks like this here.

542
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,106
It's 100-to-1.

543
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,819
I'm not saying that this is not
the shark. It probably is, Martin.

544
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
It's a man-eater. It's
extremely rare for these waters.

545
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,366
But the fact is, the bite
radius on this animal

546
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,910
is different than the
wounds on the victim.

547
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,081
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

548
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,708
We all want to be sure, okay?

549
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,418
What I want to
do is very simple.

550
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,296
The digestive system of
this animal is very slow.

551
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,505
Let's cut it open.

552
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,507
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

553
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,050
is bound to still be in there.

554
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,094
And then we'll be sure.

555
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,144
It may be the only
way to confirm it.

556
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,563
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

557
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,274
This is not the
time or the place

558
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,944
to perform some kind of a
half-assed autopsy on a fish.

559
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,532
And I am not going to stand
here and see that thing cut open

560
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,494

that a girl got killed

was a shark out there.

But you let people
go swimming anyway.

but still my boy is dead now.

Yeah, I love them.

613
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,362
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

614
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,197
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

615
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,450
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

616
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,369
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

617
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,079
who proceeded to eat my boat.

618
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,209
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

619
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,730
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

620
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:07,089
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

621
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,634
When I was on the
beach, I turned around

622
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,677
and actually saw my
boat being taken apart.

623
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,347
Ever since then, I have
been studying sharks

624
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:18,184
and that's why I know that I'm
going to go to the Institute tomorrow

and tell them that you still
have a shark problem here.

tell them that? Sorry.

You told me the
shark was caught.

I heard it on the news. I
heard it on the Cape station.

630

They caught a
shark, not the shark.

631

Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

632
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:37,286
And probably not the
shark that killed the little boy.

633

today by cutting the shark open...

about 10 feet from the beach?

Yeah.

00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,310
And that before people
started to swim for recreation...

652
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,564
I mean, before sharks
knew what they were missing

653
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,942
that a lot of these
attacks weren't reported?

654
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,277
That's right.

00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,157

the feeding is good

until the food
supply is gone, right?

happen to agree with.

have one more drink
