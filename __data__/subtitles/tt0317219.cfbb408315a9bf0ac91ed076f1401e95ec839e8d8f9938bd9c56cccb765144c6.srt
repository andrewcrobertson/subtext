00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,160
[male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,600
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,200
[cars whizzing past]

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,000
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,680
I eat losers for breakfast.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,680
[car accelerating]

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,200
Breakfast.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,360
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,160
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,760
[cars whizzing]

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,760
I am lightning!

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
[pounding on door]

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
[male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,760
[♪ Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,560
[engine revving]

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
[engine revs]

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,440
[crowd cheers]

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
Ka-chow!

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
[cars zooming]

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,080
[cars whooshing]

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,320
[both scream]

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
[all cheer]

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Get your antenna balls here!

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,320
Go, Lightnin'!

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. [whistles]

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,680
[air wrench whirring]

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Uh! [screams]

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
[engine revs]

32
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,160
- [male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [crowd cheers]

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Right, Darrell.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
heading into the final race
of the season.

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,560
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

42
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,840
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,480
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,200
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,800
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

48
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,000
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,400
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
But everyone knows him now.

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,760
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
Three cars, one champion!

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
[breaks screeching]

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,400
No you don't.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
- [chuckling]
- Hey!

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
- [tires squealing]
- [crowd booing]

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
What a ride!

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
[chuckling]

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
[female] I love you, Lightning!

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,920
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [screaming]

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,960
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,280
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
[crowd gasps]

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,000
[screaming]

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
[giggling]

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,760
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,880
[both screaming]

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,000
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,920
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Not in one piece, that is.

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,920
[exhaling]

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Yeah!

77
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Lightning! Oh!

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,960
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,520
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah! Ka-chow!

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,000
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

82
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,360
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
[air wrench whirring]

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,480
[chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,480
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,640
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,280
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,680
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,960
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,400
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

97
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
[crowd cheers]

98
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Come on, come on, come on!

99
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,360
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,120
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [male] What?

101
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,320
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,640
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,920
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,640
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

106
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,280
[cars whizzing]

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,000
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,280
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

110
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,560
[crowd cheers and whistles]

111
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,880
[screaming]

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [tire blows]

113
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

115
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,520
- You fool!
- [grunts]

116
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,360
[male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Go, go, go!

118
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
- [grunting]
- [tire blows]

119
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,800
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

120
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,160
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

121
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,080
Come on. [grunting]

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,160
[gasping]

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,880
[growling]

126
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,240
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,120
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

129
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
Lightning!

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,400
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

132
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,520
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
[tape jittering]

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
[slow motion drone]

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

136
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

137
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,080
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

138
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,600
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Tell me about it!

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,400
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,920
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,880
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

143
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,880
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,080
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

145
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,840
What? Oh, yeah, right.

147
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,960
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

148
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

149
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

151
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,960
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

153
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,080
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

155
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,720
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
[crowd laughs]

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,760
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

158
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh, whatever.

159
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,600
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

160
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,840
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

163
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,600
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

164
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,240
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,120
In your dreams, Thunder.

166
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,280
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,200
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,560
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

170
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
- Give us the bolt!

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

177
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Thank you, King.

178
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

179
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
It's the least I could do.

180
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

181
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,840
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

189

Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

190
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,760
You got more talent in one lug nut

191

in their whole body.

- But you're stupid.

- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

194

You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

195
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,960
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

196

[voice dwindling] and you let them
do their job, like they should.

Yes!

[Bob] ...we have a three-way tie.

that must be really embarrassing.

214
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,840
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

215
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,320
[Bob] Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

216
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,600

all of you out there! Thank you!

California gets Dinoco all to himself.

219

No, you rock, and you know that!

Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
Huh?

225
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

227
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,640
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Gotta make your personal appearance.

229

And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

232
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,360
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.

233
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Wow! Look at that shine!

234

I met this car from Swampscott.

238

He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

239

This is not good for my image.

241
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,480
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

242
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

- You were booking!

251
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

Looking good, Freddie!

Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,680
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

258
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,760
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

260
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

261
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
because the track is always lit.

262
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
is arriving at the track.

410
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

411
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,640
What's your strategy?

412
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
- [crowd gasps]
- [cameras clicking]

413
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,400
What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?

414
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,280
McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.

415
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,320
- McQueen was reported missing.
- ...to race an unprecedented...

they have no idea where he is.

417
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,440
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

418
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,680
I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

419
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,840
[German accent] Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!

420
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,880
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?

421
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,040
[groaning] Oh, boy.

422
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,160
Where am I?

423
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,840
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

424
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,040
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

425
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,840
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

426
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,800
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

427
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,840
- What's going on here? Please!
- [chuckling] You're funny.

428
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,960
I like you already. My name's Mater.

429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Mater?

430
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,480
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

431
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,800
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

432
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Uh...

433
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,360
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

434
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,440
What?

435
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,280
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

436
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,600
Where are you? Shoot!

437
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,240
You're in Radiator Springs.

438
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,680
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

439
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Oh, great. Just great!

440
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,240
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

441
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,120
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

442
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,160
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

443
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,960
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

444
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,280
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

445
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
- Cool!
- Mater!

446
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,800
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

447
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,400
To not to.

448
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

449
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

450
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,000
[chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

451
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Ah!

452
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,040
[Sheriff] The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

453
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

454
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,080
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

455
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
- Fascist!
- Commie!

456
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,960
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

457
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,800
I gotta get to California, pronto.

458
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,040
Where's your lawyer?

459
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,400
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

460
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,600
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

461
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,360
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

463
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,200
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

464
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Show-off.

465
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- [door banging]

466
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
- [gasping]
- All right,

467
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,520
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

468
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,480
I want his hood on a platter!

469
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

470
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

471
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,800
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

472
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm...

473
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,320
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

474
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,760
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

475
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,480
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

476
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

477
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,360
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

478
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

479
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,960
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

480
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,440
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

481
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

482
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,640
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

483
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

484
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

485
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,520
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

486
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,160
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

487
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
- [revving]
- Agh! Ow!

488
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

489
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,480
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

490
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,320
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

491
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

492
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

493
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
Ka-ching!

494
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
Ah!

495
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll keep that in mind.

496
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

497
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,280
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

498
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
You know her?

499
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,040
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

500
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
What?

501
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,280
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

502
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,200
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

503
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,920
What do you want, Sally?

504
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,400
[sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

505
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,600
No. I know his type. Racecar.

506
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,720
That's the last thing this town needs.

507
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,320
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

508
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,320
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

509
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
Here she goes again.

510
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,560
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

511
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,280
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

512
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,160
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

513
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

514
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,440
Ignore him.

515
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,920
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

516
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

517
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,160
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

518
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
And if no one can get to you?

519
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,120
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

520
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,040
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

521
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,520
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

522
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,120
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

523
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

524
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,920
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

525
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,520
- [all] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

526
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,440
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

527
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,760
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

528
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,040
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

529
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

530
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Oh, he can do it.

531
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,080
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

532
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,640
[all] Fix the road!

533
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,240
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

534
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,600
[all cheer]

535
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,840
[honking] Order in the court!

536
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,400
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

537
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
- [all] Yeah!
- No!

538
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,840
[VW van] Nice ruling.

539
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,120
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

540
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,040
[chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

541
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

542
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,640
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

543
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,360
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

544
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,160
[gurgling]

545
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

546
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

547
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,520
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

548
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,880
What? This place is crazy!

549
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,120
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

550
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,160
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

551
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
What?

552
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,880
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

553
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
You gotta be kidding me.

554
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,320
You start there where the road begins.

555
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
You finish down there
where the road ends.

556
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,920
[Mater] Holy shoot!

557
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

558
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,480
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

559
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,720
Five days?

560
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,720
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

561
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,760
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

562
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,320
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

563
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,560
[grunting]

564
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,040
[tires squealing, engine revving]

565
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,640
[Lightning] Freedom!

566
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,480
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

567
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,560
...and then...
then took the boot off.

568
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,400
Whoo-hoo!

569
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

570
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,080
California, here I come! Yeah!

571
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Oh, feel that wind.

572
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes!

573
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
[sputtering]

574
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,720
No. No, no, no.

575
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

576
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
How can I be outta gas?

577
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
[chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

578
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,800
[stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?

579
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,240
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

580
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,200
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

581
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,000
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

582
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,160
Hey, Sheriff.

583
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,480
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

584
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,080
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

585
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,000
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

586
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,920
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

587
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,800
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

588
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,640
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

589
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,600
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

590
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,000
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

591
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,320
That's why we made him the judge.

592
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,640
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

593
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,120
Now, I'm not one to brag

594
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,480
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

595
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh!

596
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,880
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

597
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,760
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

598
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,080
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

599
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,840
- [snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

600
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
That won't be necessary.

601
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,640
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

602
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,360
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

603
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Where's he goin'?

604
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,280
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

605
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,840
I shouldn't put up with this.

606
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

607
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,920
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

608
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,360
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

609
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,080
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

610
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

611
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,520
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

612
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

613
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
I must scream it to the world!

614
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,040
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

615
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,680
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

617
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,400
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

618
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,800
Is that what I think it is?

619
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
[Sally] Customers.

620
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,200
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

621
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,600
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

622
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,520
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

623
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,160
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

624
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,760
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

625
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,520
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

626
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,960
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,720
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

628
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

629
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,080
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

630
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,200
How can we help you?

631
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,320
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

632
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,600
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

633
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,120
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

634
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,040
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

635
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,160
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

636
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,280
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

637
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,080
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

638
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,320
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

639
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

640
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,120
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

641
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,560
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

642
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,800
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

643
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,600
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

644
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,120
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

645
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

646
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,360
No we just topped off.

647
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,320
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

648
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,800
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

649
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,240
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

650
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,480
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

651
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,840
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

652
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,240
Maybe ghost flames!

653
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,880
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

654
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,840
- [both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

655
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,960
[chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

656
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
Ow!

657
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,800
[laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

658
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,120
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

659
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

660
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,360
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

662
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,840
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,120
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

664
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,880
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,360
No, not really. But listen.

666
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

667
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,720
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

668
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,600
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

669
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,840
- [locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

670
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,760
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

671
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

672
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm becoming one of them!

673
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,960
- [Lightning echoes]
- [sighing]

674
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,200
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

675
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

676
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,920
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

677
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,720
- That's good.
- ...after a Piston Cup update.

678
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,720
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

679
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,240
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

680
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,480
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

681
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,320
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

682
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
[electronic music]

683
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
[laughing]

684
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

685
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Ha-ha!

686
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah!

687
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,840
[crowd shouting and cheering]

688
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,040
[girls chattering and giggling]

689
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,440
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

690
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,720
[gasping] Oh!

691
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,160
Let me get this straight.

692
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,160
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

693
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,960
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

694
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,120
I got a road to finish.

695
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,840
[grunting and revving]

696
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,400
- He's done!
- Done?

697
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,800
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

698
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,080
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

699
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

700
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,320
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

701
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,480
Oh!

702
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,480
[vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

703
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

704
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,840
- Oh!
- [blubbering]

705
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Red.

706
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,120
Who do you think you are?

707
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,520
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

708
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,000
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

709
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,520
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

710
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,240
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

711
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

712
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,120
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

713
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,000
- What?
- [chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

714
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,400
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

715
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,200
If I win, you do the road my way.

716
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,800
Doc, what're you doin'?

717
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't mean to be rude here,

718
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,800
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

719
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,360
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

720
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,120
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

721
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,400
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

722
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,960
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

723
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,960
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

724
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,560
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

725
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,760
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

726
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,600
and no lollygaggin'.

727
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,240
Speed. I'm speed.

728
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,920
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

729
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,000
[Luigi laughs]

730
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,920
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

731
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,560
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

732
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,440
The race is only one lap, guys.

733
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,040
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

734
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,920
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

735
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,080
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

736
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,240
Gentlemen...

737
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,680
...start your engines!

738
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
[engine sputters]

739
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,400
[revving furiously]

740
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,840
- ¡Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

741
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,000
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

742
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,640
Luigi?

743
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,960
[chuckling] On your mark, get set...

744
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

745
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,000
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

746
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,480
[giggling]

747
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,960
[cheering]

748
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,800
Huh?

749
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,960
Doc... the flag means go.

750
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,400
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

751
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,200
Doc, what are you doing, man?

752
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,800
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

753
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,040
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

754
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,880
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

755
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
You got your tow cable?

756
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,280
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

757
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,680
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

758
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,400
[yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

759
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,160
No, no, no, no, no!

760
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,720
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

761
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,760
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

762
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,280
[revving]

763
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

764
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,360
- I'm confused.
- [chuckling]

765
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,520
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

766
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,840
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

767
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,440
[gasps] Ah!

768
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

769
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,360
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

770
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,400
I can make a little turn on dirt.

771
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,880
You think?

772
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,440
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

773
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,960
Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!

774
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,040
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

775
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

776
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,000
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

777
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,640
Nah, not me, Flo.

778
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,200
I'm on one of them there special diets.

779
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,880
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

780
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,720
"You race like you fix roads."

781
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,560
[grunting] I'll show him.
[grunting] I will show him!

782
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,240
- [tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

783
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,920
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

784
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,680
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

785
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,480
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

786
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,600
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

787
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,960
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

788
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,040
Wow.

789
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,080
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

790
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,360
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

791
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,480
Yes! Uh, amazing!

792
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,560
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

793
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,800
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

794
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,480
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

795
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,640
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

796
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,960
[Italian] È bellissima! It's beautiful!

797
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,760
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

798
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,000
Boy, I tell you what.

799
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,880
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

800
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,640
Doc, look at this!

801
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,640
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

802
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,160
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

803
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
Guido, look at Luigi!

804
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,560
This is fantastico!

805
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,080
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

806
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,480
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

807
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,840
That crazy old devil woman.

808
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,680
[sighs] Oh!

809
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,600
She's right!

810
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,240
- Ah!
- Guido!

811
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,080
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

812
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,160
Well, now... where the heck is he?

813
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,200
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

814
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,680
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

815
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,120
and asked me if he could
come down here.

816
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,560
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

817
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,480
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

818
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,480
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

819
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,640
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

820
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,120
I'll keep an eye on him.

821
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,080
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

822
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,600
[engine revving]

823
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
[screaming]

824
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,760
[spitting]

825
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,920
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

826
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

827
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,160
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

828
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,720
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

829
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,840
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

830
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,040
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

831
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,760
I'll put it simple.

832
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,000
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

833
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,440
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

834
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,320
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

835
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,000
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

836
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,200
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

837
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,320
[groans]

838
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,800
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

839
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,080
Hmm...

840
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,200
Whoa!

841
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,000
- Oh!
- [car crashing]

842
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,440
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

843
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,360
[screaming] Ow!

844
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,080
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

845
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,240
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

846
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,720
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

847
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,720
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

848
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,200
- Oh, Guido, è bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

849
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,600
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

850
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,160
[grunts, passes gas]

851
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh, Lord.

852
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,920
- [chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

853
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,160
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

854
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,520
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

855
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,400
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

856
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,960
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

857
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
[groaning] Oh...

858
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,480
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

859
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,080
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

860
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,440
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

861
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,800
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

862
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
You make-a such a nice new road.

863
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,640
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

864
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,320
Even though you not a Ferrari.

865
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,480
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

866
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,400
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

867
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,040
[chuckling] I like your style, eh?

868
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,640
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

869
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,200
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

870
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

871
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,120
Ramone, Ramone!

872
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,280
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

873
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,360
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

874
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,080
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

875
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,840
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

876
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,760
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

877
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,120
[exhales deeply]

878
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,360
Ah!

879
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,560
Stop! Let me...

880
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,760
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

881
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,920
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

882
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,280
Stop, stop! That's cold!

883
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,880
Help! Please! Stop!

884
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,280
- [coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

885
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,800
What was that for?

886
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,000
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

887
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,600
If you do, you gotta be clean.

888
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,160
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

889
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,960
What, I...? I don't get it.

890
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,640
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

891
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,960
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

892
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,640
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

893
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,600
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

894
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,080
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

895
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,400
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

896
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,640
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

897
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,200
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

898
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,400
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

899
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,840
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

900
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,600
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

901
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,000
Cone number one, if you want.

902
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,520
Oh...

903
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,360
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

904
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,520
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

905
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,760
[both chuckle]

906
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

907
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,160
Gonna... Yeah.

908
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,480
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [gasps]

909
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,040
Good-lookin' girl.

910
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,400
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

911
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,000
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

912
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,560
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

913
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,760
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

914
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,000
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

915
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,640
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

916
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,000
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

917
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,840
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

918
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,880
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

919
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,320
I can handle anything.

920
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,240
- [whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

921
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,040
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

922
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,560
- [tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

923
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,600
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

924
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,520
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

925
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,480
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

926
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,960
Wait, Mater!

927
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,080
OK, here's what you do.

928
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,600
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

929
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,160
And they do the rest. Watch this.

930
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,040
- [honking loudly]
- Oh!

931
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,280
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

932
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,160
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

933
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,120
[laughing loudly]

934
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,320
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

935
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,200
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

936
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,880
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

937
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,480
- [honking]
- Oh!

938
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,160
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

939
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,120
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

940
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,160
[laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

941
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, your turn, bud.

942
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,480
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

943
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,760
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

944
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,800
[clucking]

945
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,320
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

946
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,280
[snoring]

947
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,800
- [revving engine]
- Oh!

948
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,240
[all exclaiming and mooing]

949
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,160
[all gurgling]

950
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,280
[all backfiring]

951
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,160
[angry mooing]

952
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,000
[mooing]

953
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,720
That's Frank.

954
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,800
- [bellowing angrily]
- [shouting]

955
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,560
- [mooing]
- [engine revving]

956
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,200
[Mater laughing]

957
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,960
Run!

958
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
- Here he comes, look out!
- [bellowing]

959
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,640
[laughing] Whoa!

960
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,240
[screaming]

961
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,600
Run! He's gonna get ya!

962
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,000
[Mater laughing]

963
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,080
Oh! Customers!

964
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,760
Oh!

965
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,200
Ah, no, no, no.

966
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,000
Oof! Oh!

967
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,440
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

968
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,000
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

969
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,360
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

970
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,360
Oh, yeah... yeah.

971
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,520
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

972
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,800
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

973
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Oh...

974
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,200
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

975
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,560
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

976
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,520
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

977
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,320
- Where, where?
- [laughing]

978
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,960
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

979
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,240
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

980
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,480
- Way.
- Come on, look...

981
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,000
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

982
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,680
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

983
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,640
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

984
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,720
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

985
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,320
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

986
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

987
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,800
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

988
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,760
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

989
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,960
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

990
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,680
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

991
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,160
Mater? Mater!

992
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,840
- Mater!
- [laughing]

993
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,400
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

994
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880
[screaming happily]

995
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,200
Oof!

996
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,680
[blubbering] Yee-hee!

997
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,000
[chuckling] He's nuts.

998
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,560
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

999
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,040
Just need to know where I've been.

1000
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,240
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

1001
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

1002
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,640
[chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

1003
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,240
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

1004
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,480
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1005
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,920
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1006
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,000
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

1007
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,600
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

1008
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,360
with private helicopters.

1009
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,720
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

1010
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,920
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

1011
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,320
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

1012
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,600
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

1013
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,600
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1014
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,280
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1015
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

1016
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

1017
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,040
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

1018
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,960
In what?

1019
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
My best friend.

1020
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,960
See you tomorrow, buddy!

Ah, number one!

1027
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,440
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

1028
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,920
[both scream]

1029
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,640
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

1030
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,800
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

1031
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,000
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

1032
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,840
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

1033
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,600
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

1034
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,680
Something about a helicopter ride.

1035
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

1036
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,880
- Did you mean it?
- What?

1037
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,000
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

1038
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,080
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

1039
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Uh-huh.

1040
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,440
You know... Mater trusts you.

1041
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,200
Yeah, OK.

1042
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,920
- Did you mean that?
- What?

1043
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,640
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

1044
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,360
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

1045
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Yeah, OK. G'night.

1046
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,520
[groans] Oh...

1047
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,840
Hey, thank you.

1048
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,800
What did you just say?

1049
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,720
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

1050
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,640
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

1051
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,240
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

1052
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,720
- G'night.
- Good night.

1053
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,400
Hmm.

01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,920
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

1057
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,840
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

1058

01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,160
I gotta get outta here!

1069

Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

1070
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,920
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

1071
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,440
[stuttering] I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

1072
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,680
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

1073
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,440
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

1074
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,960

Whoa, Doc.

1077
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,160
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

1078
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,840
What?

1079
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,760
He has a Piston Cup?

1080
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,600
Oh, my gosh.

1081
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,000
Three Piston Cups?

1082
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
- [Doc] Sign says stay out.
- [gasps]

1083
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,760
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

1084
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,920
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

1085
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,040
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

1086
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,640
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

1087
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,440
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1088
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,160
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

1089
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,960
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

1090
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,760
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

1091
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,280
You look.

You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

1094
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,680
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

1095
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

1096
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,800
- [Ramone] Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

1097
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,920
There he is.

1098
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

1099
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,000
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

1100
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,680
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

1101
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,000
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1102
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,400
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

1103
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,520
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

1104
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,200
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

1105
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,120
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

1106
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,520
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

1107
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,760
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

1108
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,200
[Ramone] I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

1109
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,040
- [Mater] Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

1110
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,880
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

1112
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,720
- [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

1113
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,480
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

1114
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,760
Hmm... I trust him.

1115
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,000
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

1116
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,400
Yeah, a drive.

1117
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,600
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

1118
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,360
Ah... No. No, we don't.

[Flo] Mm-hm!

1122
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,240
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

1123
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,720
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

1124
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,720
That's so too much!

1125
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,240
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

1126
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
I don't know.

Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,120
You know, I don't get you.

1144
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,440
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

1145
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,680
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

1146
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,920
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

1147
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,560
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

1148
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,000
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

1149
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,440
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

1150
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,280
And you know what?

1151
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,000
It never felt... happy.

1152
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,680
Yeah. I mean... really?

1153
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,520
Yeah. So I left California.

1154
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,880
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1155
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,400
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1156
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,520
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1157
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,480
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1158
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,400
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1159
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,200
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1160
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,600
[inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

1161
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,360
- Oh.
- Yep.

1162
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,000
- Corvette?
- No.

1163
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,280
I fell in love with this.

1164
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,040
Whoa. Look at that.

1165
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,240

1332
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,560
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

1333
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,520
Just like in its heyday, right?

1334
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,920
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1335
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,960
[chuckling]

1336
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,800
Shall we cruise?

1337
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,200
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1338
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,760
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1339
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,160
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1340
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,120
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1341
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,520
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1342
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,880
[mooing]

1343
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,360
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1344
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,800
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1345
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,240
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1346
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,440
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

1347
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,880
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1348
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,280
Good evenin', you two.

1349
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,040
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1350
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,920
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1351
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,680
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1352
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,320
Not that. That.

1353
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,800
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1354
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,560
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1355
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,760
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1356
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,840
[all gasp]

1357
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,520
It's the ghostlight!

1358
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,160
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1359
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,520
McQueen, over here!

1360
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,360
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1361
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,560
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1362
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,360
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1363
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,400
[Sally] Stickers!

1364
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,640
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1365
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,200
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1366
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,440
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1367
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,120
Sally! Sally!

1368
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,240
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1369
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,080
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1370
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,520
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [horn honking]

1371
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,080
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1372
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,560
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1373
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,480
[chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1374
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,280
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1375
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,240
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1376
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,880
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1377
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,480
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1378
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,040
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1379
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,360
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1380
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,680
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1381
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
- Harv?
- Come on!

1382
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,400
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?

1383
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,120
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1384
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,400
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

1385
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,880
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1386
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,000
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1387
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,560
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1388
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,920
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

1389
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,520
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1390
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,800
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1391
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,040
Playtime is over, pal.

1392
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,960
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1393
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,720
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1394
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,440
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1395
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,640
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1396
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,360
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1397
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,720
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1398
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,800
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1399
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,600
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1400
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,440
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1401
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,800
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1402
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,720
Sally, I... I want you to...

1403
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,480
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1404
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,800
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1405
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,920
[groans, chuckles]

1406
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,200
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1407
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,520
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1408
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,840
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1409
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,640
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1410
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,920
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1411
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,360
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1412
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,520
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1413
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,800
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1414
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,960
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1415
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,560
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1416
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,040
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

1417
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,800
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1418
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,160
You don't belong there, anyway.

1419
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,240
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1420
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,960
[engine starts]

1421
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,240
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1422
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,760
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1423
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,280
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1424
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,440
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1425
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:25,240
Best for everyone or best for you?

1426
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:44,520
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1427
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,400
[light buzzing]

1428
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,400
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1429
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,760
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1430
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,080
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1431
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,600
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1432
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,240
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1433
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:01,680
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1434
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,280
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1435
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,720
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1436
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,000
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1437
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,040
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1438
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,480
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1439
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,640
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1440
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,360
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1441
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,520
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1442
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,680
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1443
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:32,720
[Mia] He's hot!

1444
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,480
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1445
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,640
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1446
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,240
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1447
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,240
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1448
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,080
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1449
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,280
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1450
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,360
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1451
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,320
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1452
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,640
[guard] Sorry, pal.

1453
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,960
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1454
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,560
I am speed.

1455
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,240
[cars whizzing]

1456
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,480
Victory.

1457
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,680
One winner, two losers.

1458
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,720
[engine revving]

1459
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:21,320
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1460
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,960
[birds singing]

1461
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,440
[knock on door]

1462
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,120
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1463
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,880
[gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1464
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,120
[indistinct chatter]

1465
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,040
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1466
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,720
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1467
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,200
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1468
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,640
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1469
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
[all shouting]

1470
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,840
[gulping]

1471
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,320
Uh-oh

1472
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,960
- [cheering, laughing]
- [giggling]

1473
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,200
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1474
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,560
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1475
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,760
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1476
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,240
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1477
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:38,360
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1478
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,640
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1479
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,880
[chuckling]

1480
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,280
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1481
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,240
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1482
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,320
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1483
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,560
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1484
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,480
Agh! Shoot!

1485
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,680
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1486
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,840
[crowd cheering]

1487
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,520
Come on, you can do it!

1488
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,600
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1489
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,040
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1490
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,320
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1491
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,680
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1492
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,120
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1493
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,920
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1494
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,280
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1495
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,200
- [soft music]
- [birds singing]

1496
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,640
[breaks squealing]

1497
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,760
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1498
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,880
[all gasp]

1499
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,360
[chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1500
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,920
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [all laugh]

1501
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,080
[groans]

1502
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,200
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1503
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,720
I don't think I...

1504
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,480
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1505
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,280
Doc?

1506
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,600
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1507
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,400
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1508
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,400
You said you'd never come back.

1509
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,040
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1510
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,000
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1511
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,960
[chuckles]

1512
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,480
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1513
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,800
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1514
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
Now, get back out there!

1515
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,120
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1516
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,480
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1517
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,720
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1518
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,480
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1519
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,960
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1520
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,600
[murmuring]

1521
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,560
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1522
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,400
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1523
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,120
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1524
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,560
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1525
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,360
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1526
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,720
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1527
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,320
[crowd cheering]

1528
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,400
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

1529
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,360
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1530
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,880
Hey, Doc!

1531
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,080
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1532
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,800
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1533
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,760
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1534
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,720
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1535
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,400
Vai! Vai, vai!

1536
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,400
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1537
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,880
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1538
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,000
[all laugh]

1539
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,640
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1540
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,920
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1541
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,120
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1542
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,960
What do you think of this?

1543
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,240
- [tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1544
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,800
What?

1545
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,680
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1546
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,720
- [laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1547
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,760
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1548
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,640
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1549
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,920
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1550
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,760
[chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1551
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,760
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1552
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,240
No, you don't.

1553
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,280
[tire blows]

1554
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,320
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1555
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,800
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1556
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,200
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1557
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,280
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1558
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,280
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1559
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,480
Guido! It's time.

1560
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,880
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1561
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,000
[air wrench whirring]

1562
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1563
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,160
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1564
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,840
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1565
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,600
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1566
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,720
- Yeah, baby!
- [all hollering]

1567
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,200
[Darrell] He's back in!

1568
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,520
Peet stop.

1569
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,840
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1570
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,200
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1571
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,680
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1572
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:31,240
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1573
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,600
This is it, kiddo.

1574
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,160
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1575
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,680
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1576
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,120
- Go!
- [revving]

1577
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,960
We'll see about that!

1578
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,080
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1579
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,080
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1580
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:05,200
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1581
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,240
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1582
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,960
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1583
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,560
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1584
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,720
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1585
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:25,040
[grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1586
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,280
- Oh, no!
- [crowd gasps]

1587
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,720
[breaks screeching]

1588
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,480
[engine idling]

1589
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,960
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1590
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,800
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1591
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,240
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1592
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,520
[grunting, moaning]

1593
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,000
What are you doin', kid?

1594
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,280
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1595
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,440
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1596
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,120
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1597
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,240
It's just an empty cup.

1598
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,920
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1599
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,680
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1600
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1601
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:45,800
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1602
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,160
- That's what I call racin'.
- [sobbing]

1603
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,680
[laughing]

1604
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,680
[crowd cheers wildly]

1605
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,160
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1606
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,840
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1607
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:14,400
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1608
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,880
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1609
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,400
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1610
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,400
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1611
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,600
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1612
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,880
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1613
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:33,560
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1614
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,960
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1615
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,480
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1616
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,200
- Boo!
- Boo!

1617
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:43,360
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1618
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,520
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1619
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,920
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1620
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,760
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1621
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,840
You're The King! Yeah!

1622
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,600
[crowd cheers]

1623
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:11,200
[laughing and cheering]

1624
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,720
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1625
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,560
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1626
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,440
Thanks, Doc.

1627
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,920
Hey, Lightnin'.

1628
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,600
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1629
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,600
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1630
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,400
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1631
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,600
But I didn't win.

1632
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:44,320
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1633
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,080
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1634
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:51,320
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [all laugh]

1635
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,160
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1636
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,960
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1637
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,200
I'm gonna stick with them.

1638
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,320
Well, I sure can respect that.

1639
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,560
Still, you know,

1640
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,480
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1641
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,120
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1642
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,600
Actually, there is one thing.

1643
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,520
Whoo-hoo!

1644
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,480
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1645
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,960
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1646
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,880
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1647
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,480
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1648
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,520
to get tires.

1649
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,840
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1650
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:53,080
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1651
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,440
