1
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,160
[male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,600
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,200
[cars whizzing past]

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,000
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,680
I eat losers for breakfast.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,680
[car accelerating]

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,200
Breakfast.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,360
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,160
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,760
[cars whizzing]

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,760
I am lightning!

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
[pounding on door]

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
[male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,760
[â™ª Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,560
[engine revving]

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
[engine revs]

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,440
[crowd cheers]

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
Ka-chow!

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
[cars zooming]

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,080
[cars whooshing]

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,320
[both scream]

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
[all cheer]

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Get your antenna balls here!

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,320
Go, Lightnin'!

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. [whistles]

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,680
[air wrench whirring]

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Uh! [screams]

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
[engine revs]

32
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,160
- [male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [crowd cheers]

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Right, Darrell.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
heading into the final race
of the season.

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,560
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

42
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,840
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,480
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,200
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,800
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

48
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,000
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,400
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
But everyone knows him now.

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,760
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
Three cars, one champion!

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
[breaks screeching]

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,400
No you don't.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
- [chuckling]
- Hey!

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
- [tires squealing]
- [crowd booing]

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
What a ride!

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
[chuckling]

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
[female] I love you, Lightning!

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,920
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [screaming]

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,960
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,280
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
[crowd gasps]

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,000
[screaming]

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
[giggling]

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,760
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,880
[both screaming]

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,000
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,920
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Not in one piece, that is.

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,920
[exhaling]

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Yeah!

77
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Lightning! Oh!

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,960
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,520
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah! Ka-chow!

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,000
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

82
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,360
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
[air wrench whirring]

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,480
[chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,480
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,640
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,280
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,680
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,960
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,400
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

97
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
[crowd cheers]

98
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Come on, come on, come on!

99
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,360
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,120
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [male] What?

101
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,320
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,640
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,920
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,640
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

106
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,280
[cars whizzing]

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,000
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,280
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

110
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,560
[crowd cheers and whistles]

111
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,880
[screaming]

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [tire blows]

113
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

115
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,520
- You fool!
- [grunts]

116
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,360
[male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Go, go, go!

118
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,000
- [grunting]
- [tire blows]

119
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,800
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

120
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,160
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

121
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,080
Come on. [grunting]

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,160
[gasping]

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,880
[growling]

126
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,240
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,120
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

129
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
Lightning!

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,400
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

132
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,520
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
[tape jittering]

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
[slow motion drone]

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

136
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

137
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,080
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

138
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,600
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Tell me about it!

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,400
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,920
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,880
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

143
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,880
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,080
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

145
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,840
What? Oh, yeah, right.

147
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,960
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

148
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

149
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

151
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,960
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

153
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,080
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

155
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,720
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
[crowd laughs]

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,760
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

158
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh, whatever.

159
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,600
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

160
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,840
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

163
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,600
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

164
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,240
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,120
In your dreams, Thunder.

166
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,280
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,200
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,560
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

170
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

171
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
Right in the lens.

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,200
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

173
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,600
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

174

175
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,800
[crowd chattering]

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

177
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Thank you, King.

178
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

179
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
It's the least I could do.

180
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

181
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,840
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

182
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Kch-i-ka-chow!

183
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

184
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,680
[both] We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

185
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,280
I love being me.

186
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,440
- [police] OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

187
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
[chuckles]

188
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,240
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

189
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,880
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

190
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,760
You got more talent in one lug nut

191
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,360
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

192
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,040
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

193
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,680
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

194
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,840
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

195
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,960
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,360
[voice dwindling] and you let them
do their job, like they should.

197
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,160
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

198
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
- Yeah...
- [electronic music]

199
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400

203
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Oh, Lightning!

204
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,480
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

205
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
Thank you, Mr. The King.

207

- [fanfare]
- [Bob] Ladies and gentlemen,

208
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

209
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
[revving] A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

210
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes!

211
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,400
[Bob] ...we have a three-way tie.

212
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,280
- [crowd cheers]
- [cameras flash]

213
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,080
[chuckling] Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

214
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,840
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

215
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,320
[Bob] Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

216
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,600
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

217
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,120
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

218
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
[whispering] Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

219
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,440
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

221
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Yep! All right! Got it!

222
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,160
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,880
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

224
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
Huh?

225
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

227
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,640
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Gotta make your personal appearance.

229
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,360
No. No! No, no, no, no!

230
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.

231
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,600
And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

232
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,360
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.

233
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Wow! Look at that shine!

234
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,000
Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!

235
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
Ka-chow!

[both laughing]

237
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,640
I met this car from Swampscott.

238
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,760
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

239
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
- You could see his dirty undercarriage.
- [crowd laughs]

240
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
[groaning] I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

241
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,480
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

242
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

243
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,480
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

244
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,960
[male 1] But remember,
all that salt and grime...

245
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

246
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,040
Hey, look! There he is!

247
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,080
Our almost champ!

248
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,800
[male 1] Get your rear end in here.

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,920
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,160
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

251
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

252
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Yes, I know. [chuckles]

253
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,840
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

254
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,520
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

255
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
Looking good, Freddie!

256
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,040
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,680
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

258
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,760
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

259
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,160
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

260
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

261
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
because the track is always lit.

262
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

263
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,320
[laughing]

You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

269
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,480
ran a great race today.

270
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,240
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

271
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,520
[whispering] And an insane
amount of luck,

272
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,080
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

273
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,240
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

274
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,760
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

275
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,080
Just like this year!

276
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,960
Not on your life.

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,760
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

278
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,880
California, here we come!

279
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,600

I needed this. Hello?

[male] Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?

Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

286
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,080
And it is such an honor
to be your agent

287
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.

perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!

I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.

290

Thanks, Harv.

291
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,880
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.

I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

Turn on your lights, you moron!

- Oh, maybe he can help me!

[backfiring]

370
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,640

[grunting] I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

374
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,320
Crazy hot-rodder.

We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway

as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,

409
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
is arriving at the track.

410
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

411
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,640
What's your strategy?

412
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
- [crowd gasps]
- [cameras clicking]

413
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,400
What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?

414
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,280
McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.

415
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,320
- McQueen was reported missing.
- ...to race an unprecedented...

416
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
[male] Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.

417
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,440
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

418
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,680
I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

419
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,840
[German accent] Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!

420
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,880
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?

421
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,040
[groaning] Oh, boy.

422
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,160
Where am I?

423
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,840
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

424
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,040
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

425
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,840
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

426
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,800
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

427
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,840
- What's going on here? Please!
- [chuckling] You're funny.

428
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,960
I like you already. My name's Mater.

429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Mater?

430
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,480
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

431
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,800
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

432
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Uh...

433
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,360
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

434
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,440
What?

435
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,280
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

436
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,600
Where are you? Shoot!

437
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,240
You're in Radiator Springs.

438
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,680
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

439
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Oh, great. Just great!

440
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,240
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

441
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,120
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

442
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,160
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

443
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,960
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

444
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,280
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

445
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
- Cool!
- Mater!

446
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,800
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

447
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,400
To not to.

448
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

449
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

450
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,000
[chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

451
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Ah!

452
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,040
[Sheriff] The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

453
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

454
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,080
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

455
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
- Fascist!
- Commie!

456
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,960
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

457
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,800
I gotta get to California, pronto.

458
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,040
Where's your lawyer?

459
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,400
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

460
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,600
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

461
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,360
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

463
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,200
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

464
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Show-off.

465
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- [door banging]

466
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
- [gasping]
- All right,

467
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,520
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

468
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,480
I want his hood on a platter!

469
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

470
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

471
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,800
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

472
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm...

473
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,320
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

474
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,760
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

475
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,480
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

476
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

477
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,360
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

478
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

479
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,960
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

480
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,440
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

481
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

482
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,640
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

483
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

484
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

485
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,520
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

486
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,160
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

487
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
- [revving]
- Agh! Ow!

488
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

489
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,480
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

490
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,320
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

491
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

492
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

493
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
Ka-ching!

494
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
Ah!

495
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll keep that in mind.

496
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

497
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,280
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

498
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
You know her?

499
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,040
She's the town attorney and my fiancÃ©e.

500
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
What?

501
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,280
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

502
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,200
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

503
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,920
What do you want, Sally?

504
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,400
[sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

505
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,600
No. I know his type. Racecar.

506
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,720
That's the last thing this town needs.

507
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,320
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

508
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,320
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

509
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
Here she goes again.

510
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,560
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

511
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,280
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

512
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,160
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

513
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

514
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,440
Ignore him.

515
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,920
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

516
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

517
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,160
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

518
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
And if no one can get to you?

519
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,120
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

520
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,040
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

521
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,520
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

522
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,120
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

523
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

524
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,920
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

525
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,520
- [all] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

526
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,440
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

527
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,760
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

528
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,040
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

529
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

530
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Oh, he can do it.

531
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,080
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

532
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,640
[all] Fix the road!

533
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,240
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

534
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,600
[all cheer]

535
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,840
[honking] Order in the court!

536
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,400
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

537
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
- [all] Yeah!
- No!

538
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,840
[VW van] Nice ruling.

539
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,120
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

540
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,040
[chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

541
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

542
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,640
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

543
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,360
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

544
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,160
[gurgling]

545
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

546
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

547
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,520
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

548
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,880
What? This place is crazy!

549
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,120
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

550
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,160
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

551
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
What?

552
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,880
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

553
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
You gotta be kidding me.

554
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,320
You start there where the road begins.

555
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
You finish down there
where the road ends.

556
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,920
[Mater] Holy shoot!

557
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

558
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,480
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

559
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,720
Five days?

560
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,720
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

561
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,760
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

562
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,320
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

563
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,560
[grunting]

564
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,040
[tires squealing, engine revving]

565
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,640
[Lightning] Freedom!

566
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,480
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

567
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,560
...and then...
then took the boot off.

568
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,400
Whoo-hoo!

569
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

570
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,080
California, here I come! Yeah!

571
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Oh, feel that wind.

572
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes!

573
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
[sputtering]

574
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,720
No. No, no, no.

575
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

576
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
How can I be outta gas?

577
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
[chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

578
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,800
[stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?

579
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,240
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

580
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,200
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

581
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,000
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

582
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,160
Hey, Sheriff.

583
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,480
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

584
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,080
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

585
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,000
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

586
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,920
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

587
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,800
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

588
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,640
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

589
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,600
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

590
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,000
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

591
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,320
That's why we made him the judge.

592
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,640
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

593
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,120
Now, I'm not one to brag

594
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,480
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

595
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh!

596
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,880
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

597
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,760
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

598
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,080
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

599
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,840
- [snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

600
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
That won't be necessary.

601
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,640
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

602
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,360
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

603
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Where's he goin'?

604
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,280
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

605
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,840
I shouldn't put up with this.

606
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

607
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,920
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

608
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,360
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

609
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,080
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

610
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

611
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,520
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

612
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

613
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
I must scream it to the world!

614
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,040
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

615
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,680
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

617
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,400
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

618
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,800
Is that what I think it is?

619
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
[Sally] Customers.

620
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,200
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

621
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,600
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

622
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,520
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

623
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,160
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

624
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,760
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

625
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,520
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

626
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,960
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,720
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

628
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

629
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,080
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

630
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,200
How can we help you?

631
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,320
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

632
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,600
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

633
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,120
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

634
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,040
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

635
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,160
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

636
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,280
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

637
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,080
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

638
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,320
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

639
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

640
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,120
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

641
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,560
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

642
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,800
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

643
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,600
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

644
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,120
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

645
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Stop at Flo's V-Eight CafÃ©.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

646
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,360
No we just topped off.

647
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,320
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

648
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,800
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

649
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,240
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

650
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,480
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

651
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,840
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

652
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,240
Maybe ghost flames!

653
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,880
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

654
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,840
- [both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

655
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,960
[chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

656
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
Ow!

657
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,800
[laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

658
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,120
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

659
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

660
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,360
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

662
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,840
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,120
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

664
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,880
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,360
No, not really. But listen.

666
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

667
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,720
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

668
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,600
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

669
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,840
- [locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

670
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,760
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

671
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

672
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm becoming one of them!

673
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,960
- [Lightning echoes]
- [sighing]

674
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,200
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

675
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

676
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,920
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

677
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,720
- That's good.
- ...after a Piston Cup update.

678
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,720
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

679
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,240
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

680
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,480
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

681
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,320
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

682
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
[electronic music]

683
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
[laughing]

684
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

685
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Ha-ha!

686
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah!

687
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,840
[crowd shouting and cheering]

688
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,040
[girls chattering and giggling]

689
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,440
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

690
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,720
[gasping] Oh!

691
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,160
Let me get this straight.

692
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,160
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

693
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,960
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

694
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,120
I got a road to finish.

695
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,840
[grunting and revving]

696
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,400
- He's done!
- Done?

697
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,800
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

698
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,080
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

699
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

700
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,320
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

701
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,480
Oh!

702
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,480
[vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

703
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

704
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,840
- Oh!
- [blubbering]

705
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Red.

706
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,120
Who do you think you are?

707
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,520
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

708
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,000
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

709
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,520
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

710
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,240
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

711
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

712
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,120
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

713
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,000
- What?
- [chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

714
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,400
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

715
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,200
If I win, you do the road my way.

716
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,800
Doc, what're you doin'?

717
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't mean to be rude here,

718
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,800
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

719
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,360
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

720
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,120
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

721
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,400
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

722
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,960
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

723
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,960
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

724
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,560
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

725
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,760
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

726
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,600
and no lollygaggin'.

727
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,240
Speed. I'm speed.

728
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,920
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

729
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,000
[Luigi laughs]

730
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,920
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

731
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,560
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

732
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,440
The race is only one lap, guys.

733
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,040
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

734
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,920
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

735
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,080
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

736
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,240
Gentlemen...

737
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,680
...start your engines!

738
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
[engine sputters]

739
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,400
[revving furiously]

740
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,840
- Â¡Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

741
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,000
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

742
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,640
Luigi?

743
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,960
[chuckling] On your mark, get set...

744
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

745
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,000
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

746
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,480
[giggling]

747
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,960
[cheering]

748
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,800
Huh?

749
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,960
Doc... the flag means go.

750
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,400
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

751
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,200
Doc, what are you doing, man?

752
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,800
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

753
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,040
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

754
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,880
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

755
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
You got your tow cable?

756
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,280
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

757
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,680
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

758
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,400
[yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

759
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,160
No, no, no, no, no!

760
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,720
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

761
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,760
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

762
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,280
[revving]

763
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

764
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,360
- I'm confused.
- [chuckling]

765
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,520
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

766
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,840
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

767
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,440
[gasps] Ah!

768
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

769
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,360
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

770
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,400
I can make a little turn on dirt.

771
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,880
You think?

772
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,440
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

773
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,960
Hey, Ã©se!
You need a new paint job, man!

774
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,040
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

775
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

776
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,000
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

777
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,640
Nah, not me, Flo.

778
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,200
I'm on one of them there special diets.

779
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,880
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

780
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,720
"You race like you fix roads."

781
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,560
[grunting] I'll show him.
[grunting] I will show him!

782
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,240
- [tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

783
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,920
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

784
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,680
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

785
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,480
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

786
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,600
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

787
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,960
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

788
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,040
Wow.

789
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,080
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

790
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,360
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

791
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,480
Yes! Uh, amazing!

792
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,560
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

793
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,800
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

794
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,480
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

795
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,640
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

796
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,960
[Italian] Ãˆ bellissima! It's beautiful!

797
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,760
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

798
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,000
Boy, I tell you what.

799
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,880
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

800
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,640
Doc, look at this!

801
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,640
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

802
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,160
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

803
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
Guido, look at Luigi!

804
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,560
This is fantastico!

805
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,080
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

806
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,480
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

807
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,840
That crazy old devil woman.

808
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,680
[sighs] Oh!

809
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,600
She's right!

810
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,240
- Ah!
- Guido!

811
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,080
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

812
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,160
Well, now... where the heck is he?

813
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,200
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

814
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,680
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

815
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,120
and asked me if he could
come down here.

816
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,560
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

817
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,480
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

818
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,480
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

819
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,640
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

820
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,120
I'll keep an eye on him.

821
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,080
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

822
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,600
[engine revving]

823
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
[screaming]

824
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,760
[spitting]

825
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,920
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

826
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

827
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,160
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

828
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,720
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

829
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,840
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

830
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,040
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

831
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,760
I'll put it simple.

832
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,000
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

833
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,440
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

834
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,320
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

835
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,000
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

836
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,200
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

837
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,320
[groans]

838
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,800
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

839
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,080
Hmm...

840
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,200
Whoa!

841
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,000
- Oh!
- [car crashing]

842
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,440
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

843
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,360
[screaming] Ow!

844
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,080
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

845
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,240
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

846
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,720
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

847
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,720
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

848
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,200
- Oh, Guido, Ã¨ bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

849
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,600
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

850
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,160
[grunts, passes gas]

851
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh, Lord.

852
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,920
- [chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

853
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,160
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

854
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,520
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

855
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,400
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

856
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,960
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

857
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
[groaning] Oh...

858
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,480
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

859
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,080
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

860
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,440
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

861
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,800
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

862
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
You make-a such a nice new road.

863
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,640
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

864
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,320
Even though you not a Ferrari.

865
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,480
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

866
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,400
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

867
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,040
[chuckling] I like your style, eh?

868
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,640
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

869
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,200
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

870
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

871
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,120
Ramone, Ramone!

872
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,280
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

873
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,360
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

874
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,080
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

875
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,840
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

876
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,760
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

877
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,120
[exhales deeply]

878
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,360
Ah!

879
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,560
Stop! Let me...

880
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,760
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

881
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,920
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

882
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,280
Stop, stop! That's cold!

883
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,880
Help! Please! Stop!

884
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,280
- [coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

885
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,800
What was that for?

886
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,000
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

887
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,600
If you do, you gotta be clean.

888
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,160
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

889
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,960
What, I...? I don't get it.

890
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,640
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

891
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,960
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

892
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,640
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

893
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,600
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

894
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,080
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

895
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,400
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

896
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,640
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

897
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,200
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

898
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,400
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

899
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,840
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

900
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,600
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

901
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,000
Cone number one, if you want.

902
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,520
Oh...

903
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,360
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

904
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,520
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

905
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,760
[both chuckle]

906
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

907
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,160
Gonna... Yeah.

908
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,480
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [gasps]

909
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,040
Good-lookin' girl.

910
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,400
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

911
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,000
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

912
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,560
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

913
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,760
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

914
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,000
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

915
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,640
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

916
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,000
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

917
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,840
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

918
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,880
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

919
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,320
I can handle anything.

920
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,240
- [whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

921
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,040
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

922
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,560
- [tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

923
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,600
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

924
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,520
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

925
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,480
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

926
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,960
Wait, Mater!

927
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,080
OK, here's what you do.

928
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,600
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

929
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,160
And they do the rest. Watch this.

930
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,040
- [honking loudly]
- Oh!

931
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,280
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

932
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,160
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

933
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,120
[laughing loudly]

934
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,320
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

935
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,200
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

936
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,880
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

937
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,480
- [honking]
- Oh!

938
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,160
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

939
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,120
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

940
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,160
[laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

941
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, your turn, bud.

942
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,480
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

943
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,760
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

944
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,800
[clucking]

945
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,320
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

946
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,280
[snoring]

947
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,800
- [revving engine]
- Oh!

948
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,240
[all exclaiming and mooing]

949
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,160
[all gurgling]

950
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,280
[all backfiring]

951
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,160
[angry mooing]

952
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,000
[mooing]

953
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,720
That's Frank.

954
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,800
- [bellowing angrily]
- [shouting]

955
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,560
- [mooing]
- [engine revving]

956
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,200
[Mater laughing]

957
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,960
Run!

958
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
- Here he comes, look out!
- [bellowing]

959
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,640
[laughing] Whoa!

960
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,240
[screaming]

961
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,600
Run! He's gonna get ya!

962
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,000
[Mater laughing]

963
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,080
Oh! Customers!

964
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,760
Oh!

965
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,200
Ah, no, no, no.

966
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,000
Oof! Oh!

967
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,440
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

968
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,000
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

969
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,360
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

970
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,360
Oh, yeah... yeah.

971
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,520
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

972
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,800
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

973
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Oh...

974
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,200
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

975
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,560
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

976
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,520
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

977
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,320
- Where, where?
- [laughing]

978
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,960
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

979
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,240
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

980
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,480
- Way.
- Come on, look...

981
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,000
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

982
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,680
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

983
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,640
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

984
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,720
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

985
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,320
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

986
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

987
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,800
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

988
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,760
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

989
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,960
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

990
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,680
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

991
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,160
Mater? Mater!

992
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,840
- Mater!
- [laughing]

993
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,400
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

994
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880
[screaming happily]

995
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,200
Oof!

996
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,680
[blubbering] Yee-hee!

997
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,000
[chuckling] He's nuts.

998
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,560
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

999
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,040
Just need to know where I've been.

1000
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,240
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

1001
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

1002
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,640
[chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

1003
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,240
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

1004
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,480
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1005
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,920
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1006
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,000
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

1007
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,600
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

1008
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,360
with private helicopters.

1009
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,720
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

1010
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,920
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

1011
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,320
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

1012
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,600
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

1013
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,600
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1014
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,280
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1015
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

1016
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

1017
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,040
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

1018
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,960
In what?

1019
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
My best friend.

1020
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,960
See you tomorrow, buddy!

1021

Ah, number one!

1027
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,440
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

1028
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,920
[both scream]

1029
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,640
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

1030
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,800
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

1031
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,000
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

1032
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,840
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

1033
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,600
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

1034
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,680
Something about a helicopter ride.

1035
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

1036
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,880
- Did you mean it?
- What?

1037
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,000
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

1038
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,080
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

1039
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Uh-huh.

1040
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,440
You know... Mater trusts you.

1041
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,200
Yeah, OK.

1042
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,920
- Did you mean that?
- What?

1043
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,640
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

1044
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,360
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

1045
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Yeah, OK. G'night.

1046
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,520
[groans] Oh...

1047
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,840
Hey, thank you.

1048
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,800
What did you just say?

1049
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,720
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

1050
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,640
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

1051
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,240
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

1052
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,720
- G'night.
- Good night.

1053
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,400

1056
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,920
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

1057
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,840
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

1058
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,840

- No! [gasping]

1068
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,160
I gotta get outta here!

1069
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,560
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

1070
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,920
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

1071
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,440
[stuttering] I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

1072
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,680
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

1073
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,440
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

1074
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,960

01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,360
Whoa, Doc.

1077
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,160
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

1078
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,840
What?

1079
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,760
He has a Piston Cup?

1080
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,600
Oh, my gosh.

1081
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,000
Three Piston Cups?

1082
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
- [Doc] Sign says stay out.
- [gasps]

1083
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,760
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

1084
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,920
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

1085
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,040
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

1086
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,640
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

1087
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,440
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1088
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,160
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

1089
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,960
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

1090
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,760
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

1091
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,280
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

1093
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,840
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

1094
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,680
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

1095
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

1096
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,800
- [Ramone] Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

1097
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,920
There he is.

1098
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

1099
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,000
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

1100
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,680
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

1101
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,000
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1102
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,400
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

1103
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,520
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

1104
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,200
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

1105
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,120
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

1106
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,520
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

1107
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,760
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

1108
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,200
[Ramone] I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

1109
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,040
- [Mater] Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

1110
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,880
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

[gas bell rings]

1112
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,720
- [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

1113
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,480
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

1114
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,760
Hmm... I trust him.

1115
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,000
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

1116
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,400
Yeah, a drive.

1117
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,600
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

1118
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,360
Ah... No. No, we don't.

[Flo] Mm-hm!

1122
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,240
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

1123
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,720
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

1124
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,720
That's so too much!

1125
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,240
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

1126
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
I don't know.

1127
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
Whoa! Yes.

Wheel Well.

on the mother road.

Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

1143
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,120
You know, I don't get you.

1144
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,440
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

1145
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,680
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

1146
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,920
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

1147
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,560
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

1148
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,000
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

1149
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,440
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

1150
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,280
And you know what?

1151
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,000
It never felt... happy.

1152
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,680
Yeah. I mean... really?

1153
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,520
Yeah. So I left California.

1154
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,880
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1155
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,400
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1156
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,520
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1157
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,480
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1158
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,400
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1159
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,200
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1160
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,600
[inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

1161
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,360
- Oh.
- Yep.

1162
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,000
- Corvette?
- No.

1163
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,280
I fell in love with this.

1164
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,040
Whoa. Look at that.

1165
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,240
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1166
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,520
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1167
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,840
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1168
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,640
Oh, yeah?

1169
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,600
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1170
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,760
Really?

1171
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,520
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,

1172
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,440
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1173
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,080
How do you mean?

1174
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,520
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1175
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,800
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1176
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,280
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1177
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,000
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1178

They drove on it to have a great time.

[â™ª James Taylor: Our Town]

1180
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,040
Well, what happened?

1181
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,600
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1182
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,360
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1183
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,240
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1184
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,920
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1185
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,680
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1186
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,600
I had a great time.

1187
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,400
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1188

You're welcome.

Yeah, that's a good tractor.

you and I are the same.

We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1226

How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1227
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,400
You think I quit?

1228
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,680
[Lightning] Right.

1229

I went back expecting a big welcome.

"You're history."

Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1234

There was a lot left in me.

1235
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,560
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1236
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,040
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

I just never expected that
that world would...

1238

...would find me here.

and I will take it all back.

Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1245

on someone they can't count on.

don't even know who you are?

01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,880
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]

1332
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,560
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

1333
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,520
Just like in its heyday, right?

1334
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,920
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1335
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,960
[chuckling]

1336
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,800
Shall we cruise?

1337
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,200
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1338
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,760
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1339
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,160
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1340
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,120
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1341
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,520
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1342
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,880
[mooing]

1343
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,360
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1344
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,800
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1345
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,240
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1346
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,440
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

1347
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,880
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1348
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,280
Good evenin', you two.

1349
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,040
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1350
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,920
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1351
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,680
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1352
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,320
Not that. That.

1353
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,800
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1354
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,560
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1355
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,760
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1356
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,840
[all gasp]

1357
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,520
It's the ghostlight!

1358
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,160
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1359
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,520
McQueen, over here!

1360
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,360
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1361
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,560
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1362
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,360
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1363
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,400
[Sally] Stickers!

1364
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,640
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1365
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,200
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1366
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,440
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1367
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,120
Sally! Sally!

1368
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,240
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1369
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,080
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1370
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,520
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [horn honking]

1371
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,080
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1372
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,560
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1373
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,480
[chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1374
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,280
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1375
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,240
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1376
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,880
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1377
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,480
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1378
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,040
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1379
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,360
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1380
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,680
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1381
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
- Harv?
- Come on!

1382
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,400
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?

1383
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,120
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1384
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,400
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

1385
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,880
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1386
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,000
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1387
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,560
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1388
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,920
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

1389
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,520
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1390
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,800
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1391
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,040
Playtime is over, pal.

1392
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,960
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1393
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,720
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1394
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,440
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1395
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,640
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1396
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,360
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1397
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,720
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1398
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,800
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1399
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,600
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1400
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,440
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1401
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,800
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1402
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,720
Sally, I... I want you to...

1403
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,480
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1404
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,800
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1405
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,920
[groans, chuckles]

1406
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,200
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1407
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,520
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1408
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,840
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1409
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,640
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1410
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,920
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1411
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,360
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1412
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,520
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1413
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,800
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1414
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,960
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1415
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,560
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1416
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,040
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

1417
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,800
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1418
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,160
You don't belong there, anyway.

1419
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,240
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1420
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,960
[engine starts]

1421
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,240
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1422
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,760
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1423
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,280
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1424
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,440
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1425
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:25,240
Best for everyone or best for you?

1426
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:44,520
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1427
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,400
[light buzzing]

1428
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,400
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1429
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,760
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1430
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,080
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1431
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,600
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1432
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,240
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1433
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:01,680
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1434
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,280
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1435
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,720
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1436
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,000
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1437
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,040
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1438
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,480
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1439
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,640
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1440
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,360
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1441
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,520
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1442
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,680
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1443
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:32,720
[Mia] He's hot!

1444
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,480
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1445
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,640
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1446
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,240
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1447
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,240
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1448
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,080
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1449
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,280
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1450
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,360
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1451
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,320
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1452
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,640
[guard] Sorry, pal.

1453
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,960
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1454
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,560
I am speed.

1455
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,240
[cars whizzing]

1456
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,480
Victory.

1457
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,680
One winner, two losers.

1458
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,720
[engine revving]

1459
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:21,320
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1460
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,960
[birds singing]

1461
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,440
[knock on door]

1462
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,120
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1463
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,880
[gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1464
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,120
[indistinct chatter]

1465
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,040
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1466
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,720
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1467
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,200
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1468
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,640
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1469
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
[all shouting]

1470
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,840
[gulping]

1471
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,320
Uh-oh

1472
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,960
- [cheering, laughing]
- [giggling]

1473
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,200
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1474
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,560
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1475
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,760
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1476
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,240
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1477
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:38,360
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1478
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,640
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1479
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,880
[chuckling]

1480
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,280
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1481
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,240
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1482
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,320
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1483
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,560
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1484
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,480
Agh! Shoot!

1485
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,680
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1486
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,840
[crowd cheering]

1487
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,520
Come on, you can do it!

1488
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,600
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1489
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,040
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1490
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,320
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1491
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,680
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1492
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,120
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1493
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,920
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1494
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,280
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1495
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,200
- [soft music]
- [birds singing]

1496
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,640
[breaks squealing]

1497
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,760
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1498
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,880
[all gasp]

1499
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,360
[chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1500
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,920
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [all laugh]

1501
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,080
[groans]

1502
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,200
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1503
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,720
I don't think I...

1504
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,480
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1505
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,280
Doc?

1506
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,600
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1507
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,400
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1508
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,400
You said you'd never come back.

1509
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,040
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1510
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,000
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1511
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,960
[chuckles]

1512
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,480
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1513
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,800
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1514
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
Now, get back out there!

1515
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,120
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1516
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,480
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1517
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,720
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1518
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,480
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1519
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,960
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1520
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,600
[murmuring]

1521
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,560
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1522
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,400
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1523
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,120
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1524
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,560
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1525
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,360
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1526
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,720
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1527
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,320
[crowd cheering]

1528
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,400
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

1529
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,360
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1530
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,880
Hey, Doc!

1531
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,080
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1532
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,800
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1533
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,760
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1534
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,720
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1535
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,400
Vai! Vai, vai!

1536
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,400
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1537
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,880
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1538
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,000
[all laugh]

1539
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,640
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1540
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,920
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1541
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,120
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1542
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,960
What do you think of this?

1543
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,240
- [tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1544
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,800
What?

1545
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,680
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1546
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,720
- [laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1547
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,760
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1548
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,640
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1549
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,920
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1550
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,760
[chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1551
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,760
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1552
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,240
No, you don't.

1553
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,280
[tire blows]

1554
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,320
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1555
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,800
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1556
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,200
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1557
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,280
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1558
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,280
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1559
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,480
Guido! It's time.

1560
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,880
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1561
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,000
[air wrench whirring]

1562
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1563
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,160
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1564
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,840
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1565
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,600
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1566
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,720
- Yeah, baby!
- [all hollering]

1567
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,200
[Darrell] He's back in!

1568
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,520
Peet stop.

1569
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,840
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1570
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,200
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1571
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,680
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1572
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:31,240
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1573
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,600
This is it, kiddo.

1574
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,160
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1575
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,680
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1576
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,120
- Go!
- [revving]

1577
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,960
We'll see about that!

1578
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,080
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1579
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,080
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1580
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:05,200
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1581
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,240
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1582
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,960
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1583
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,560
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1584
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,720
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1585
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:25,040
[grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1586
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,280
- Oh, no!
- [crowd gasps]

1587
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,720
[breaks screeching]

1588
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,480
[engine idling]

1589
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,960
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1590
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,800
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1591
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,240
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1592
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,520
[grunting, moaning]

1593
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,000
What are you doin', kid?

1594
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,280
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1595
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,440
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1596
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,120
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1597
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,240
It's just an empty cup.

1598
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,920
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1599
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,680
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1600
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1601
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:45,800
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1602
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,160
- That's what I call racin'.
- [sobbing]

1603
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,680
[laughing]

1604
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,680
[crowd cheers wildly]

1605
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,160
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1606
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,840
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1607
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:14,400
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1608
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,880
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1609
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,400
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1610
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,400
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1611
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,600
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1612
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,880
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1613
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:33,560
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1614
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,960
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1615
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,480
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1616
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,200
- Boo!
- Boo!

1617
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:43,360
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1618
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,520
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1619
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,920
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1620
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,760
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1621
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,840
You're The King! Yeah!

1622
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,600
[crowd cheers]

1623
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:11,200
[laughing and cheering]

1624
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,720
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1625
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,560
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1626
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,440
Thanks, Doc.

1627
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,920
Hey, Lightnin'.

1628
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,600
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1629
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,600
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1630
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,400
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1631
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,600
But I didn't win.

1632
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:44,320
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1633
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,080
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1634
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:51,320
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [all laugh]

1635
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,160
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1636
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,960
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1637
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,200
I'm gonna stick with them.

1638
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,320
Well, I sure can respect that.

1639
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,560
Still, you know,

1640
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,480
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1641
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,120
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1642
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,600
Actually, there is one thing.

1643
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,520
Whoo-hoo!

1644
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,480
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1645
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,960
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1646
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,880
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1647
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,480
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1648
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,520
to get tires.

1649
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,840
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1650
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:53,080
Guido! There is a real

A real Ferrari!

Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1653
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:01,200
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1654
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,040
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

Just passin' through?

1659
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,640
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1660
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:32,000
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1661
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,840
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1662
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,360
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1663
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,240
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1664
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,840
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1665
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,040
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,240

What're you gonna do?

1672
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,280
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1673
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,080
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1674
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,760
Hmm... Nah.

1675
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,920

[Mater] All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1681
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,760
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1682
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,800
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1683
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,920
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1684
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,480
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1685
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,360
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

How can you be circus cars?

Wait a minute here.

over and over.
