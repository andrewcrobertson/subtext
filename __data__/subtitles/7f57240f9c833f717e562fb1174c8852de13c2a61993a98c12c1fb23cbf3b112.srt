3
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,583
I told you not to look for me.

4
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,583
Please, Father.

5
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,625
That's all I have.

6
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,833
The only proof of what they've done.

7
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,333
But she looks so...

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,583
Human.

9
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,583
But don't let yourself be fooled.

10
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,625
She wasn't conceived naturally.

11
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,583
<i>They found a volunteer.</i>

12
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,583
<i>Someone devoted.</i>

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,417
<i>But how did they...</i>

14
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,042
<i>No, please.</i>

15
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,708
<i>I can't...</i>

16
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,333
<i>I can't talk about that.</i>

17
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,417
What I can tell you...

18
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,125
is that the pregnancy happened quickly.

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,750
She'll be in her teens now.

20
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,000
They're just waiting until she's old enough.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Old enough for what?

22
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,792
Old enough for what?

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,208
Now, please.

24
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,458
I can't do this anymore.

25
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,458
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

26
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,292
I can't.

27
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,500
But please don't let it touch me again.

28
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,208
Father?

29
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,750
Father Harris?

30
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,083
Father?

31
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,333
Hiding won't absolve your sins.

32
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,875
You think I want to be forgiven?

33
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,625
I don't want to be forgiven, Father Brennan.

34
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,125
I just want it all to be over.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,333
You'll understand...

36
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,667
soon enough.

37
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,125
Father, are you all right?

38
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,083
I'm fine.

39
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,625
Father.

40
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,833
- Margaret Daino?
- Yes.

41
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,708
- I'm Father Gabriel.
- Hello.

43
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,542
Cardinal Lawrence sent me to fetch you.

44
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,583
- Oh, sure. Thank you.
- Let me help you with that.

45
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,417
He's in the car outside.

46
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,167
I have heard so much about you.
I feel like I already know you.

47
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,625
Maggie!

48
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,958
I'm so happy to see you.

49
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,208
Me too.

50
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,208
It's so beautiful here. It's like a dream.

51
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,542
Well, wait till you see the actual city.

52
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,208
Look at you. It hasn't been a year...

53
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,500
and somehow, you've found a way to grow up
even more.

54
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is that all you've got?

55
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,000
That's it.

56
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,083
Well, my word. Come on.

57
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,083
I'll show you to your new home.

58
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,500
So, what do you think?

59
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,833
It's wild.

60
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,583
Everything's so different.

61
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
Every street that we pass,
there's something to look at.

62
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,208
I just wanna explore.

63
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,542
Isn't it beautiful?

64
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,500
What better place
for you to be taking the veil?

65
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,250
It's wonderful to see you, Maggie.

66
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,832
Even when you were little,
I knew you were destined for great things.

67
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:44,708
See if you can get around them, Damiano.

68
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,833
These protests have picked up recently,
I'm afraid.

69
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,750
What are they protesting?

70
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,667
For the workers,
it's about conditions and wages.

71
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,917
But for the students, well...

72
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,917
it's a rejection of authority...

73
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,500
even the church.

74
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,292
The world is changing, Maggie, very fast.

75
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,750
The younger generation no longer turn to us
for guidance, I'm afraid.

76
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,875
But it's a challenge we've embraced.

77
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,500
Perhaps you'll play your part
and help earn back their trust.

78
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,125
I'll try.

79
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,917
This is Sister Silva, the Abbess.

80
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,875
And she'll take good care of you.

81
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,042
Hello.

82
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,000
Welcome to our family.

83
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,250
Thank you.

84
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,750
Come. Come with me.

85
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,542
Let me give you a tour.

86
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,792
We're so happy to have you here.

87
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,167
This way.

88
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,333
We take care of girls.

89
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,833
Girls only.

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,875
A total of 62.

91
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,250
Babies to 18 years of age.

92
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,625
Come this way.

93
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,333
The state has contracted with us
to take in many unmarried women...

94
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
who are about to give birth.

95
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,417
We have our birthing facilities
here in the hospital wing.

96
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,833
Come, come.

97
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,542
Our doctor will likely deliver this baby
within the week.

98
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,333
Sister Anjelica.

99
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,750
This is Margaret Daino from America.

100
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,875
She grew up here.

101
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,750
Abandoned on our front steps...

102
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,125
and very ill.

103
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,958
But she's very devoted...

104
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,792
and she keeps all the children smiling.

105
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,625
And they all seem very happy.

106
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,542
I should see what the trouble is.

107
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
Of course.

108
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,875
Amen.

109
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,792
Hail Mary.

110
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,750
<i>Ave Maria</i> is my favorite, too.

111
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:17,792
What's your name?

112
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,125
I'm Margaret.

113
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,583
Hi.

114
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,333
What are you doing?

115
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,083
Get off of me!

116
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,750
There you are.

117
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,250
Have you been behaving yourself, Carlita?

118
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,208
Carlita.

119
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,375
Did you do that drawing outside, Carlita?

120
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,042
The one where the girl's floating
above the other girls?

121
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,167
I thought it was very nice.

122
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,583
Thank you.

123
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,625
Come.

124
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,083
Why is she kept alone like that
in the middle of the day?

125
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,292
It's safer.

126
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,208
She hurt another child just yesterday.

127
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,958
Luca will be your driver.

128
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,833
Rome has become a bit dangerous
with the protests.

129
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Hello?

130
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,542
By Your divine mercy,
rein in the power of evil.

131
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,208
Build us into living stones
of a culture of life...

132
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,292
who demonstrates in both deed and word...

133
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,083
the truth that every life, no matter
its conditions, is precious and unrepeatable.

134
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,458
Lord, speak to every human heart
and fill it with the conviction...

135
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,833
I am wanted.

136
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,542
I have a task in history.

137
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,583
I am accepted, and I am loved.

138
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,250
It is good that I exist.

139
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,333
Margaret's one of our
worst-behaved children...

140
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,458
What if she has another episode?

141
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,041
Then you must tie her to the bed.

142
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,041
Here. Let me show you.

143
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,458
Hi.

144
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,917
You must be Margaretta.

145
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,333
Yes.

146
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,750
I'm Luz.

147
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,750
Did I wake you?

148
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:18,917
No, no.

149
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,333
I was having a nightmare.

150
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,875
First night nerves?

151
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,167
Don't worry, same thing happened for me.

152
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,375
If we can't admit how we are feeling...

153
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,500
our dreams do it for us, right?

154
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,000
You're a novitiate?

155
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,167
Yeah.

156
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,625
I just figured a little exploration
is healthy before the big day.

157
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,833
I mean, I will be hiding this body...

158
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,333
under a habit for the rest of my life.

159
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,292
So, why not let it breathe a little now?

160
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,375
Coffee?

161
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,417
So how does a girl from...

162
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,500
Pittsfield. Massachusetts.

163
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:10,250
So how does a girl from Pissfield
end up in Italy about to take the veil?

164
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,542
Well, Cardinal Lawrence was a priest
at the orphanage that I grew up in.

165
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:21,125
And we got pretty close because,
well, I was somewhat of a problem child.

166
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,542
Wait.

167
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,042
Wait, wait, wait. You were a problem child?

168
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:26,917
Like how?

169
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,708
I don't know. I guess...

170
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,500
I mean, I used to get punished a lot.

171
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,458
And how did they punish you?

172
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,542
And where did you get these?

173
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,542
Hey.

174
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,167
And you are a nosy girl.
Do you know that?

175
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,542
Well, would they beat you?

176
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,292
Would they beat me?

177
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,542
No, not really.

178
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,250
I used to have a pretty active imagination.

179
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,375
I'd get so convinced sometimes
that what I was seeing was real...

180
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,417
that the sisters would need to...

181
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,667
subdue me.

182
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,917
But then Cardinal Lawrence
came to the orphanage...

183
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,500
and he was really great, you know.

184
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,292
He really helped me to see
that all that stuff was just in my head.

185
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,792
Things got a lot better for me after that.

186
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,208
For me...

187
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,667
it was a voice.

188
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,292
I was 16.

189
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,292
Just kicked out of the house.

190
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,375
It was so cold that night,
and I didn't know what to do.

191
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,833
And then...

192
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,792
this warm wind came...

193
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,250
out of nowhere.

194
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,208
And suddenly it was
as if His voice was all around me.

195
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,667
Inside me even.

196
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,958
So clearly.

197
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,292
And He told me it didn't matter
if I had no earthly home...

198
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,833
because my true home was with Him.

199
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,833
And for the first time in my life...

200
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,625
I felt like I belonged on this Earth.

201
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:35,500
Yes, but even with the most handsome milkman
in town...

202
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:39,250
we still had a whole group of us
who took the veil together.

203
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,833
Yes. Now, instead, girls go off to college...

204
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,333
and poor Luz is taking the veil alone.

205
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,000
And Margaret...

206
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,333
Margaret will be alone in the chapel, too.

207
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,208
Don't worry. I'll warm it up for you.

208
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,917
Warm up? What is this "warm it up"?

209
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
As if Mr. Milkman didn't teach you.

210
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,792
I'm sorry!

211
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,000
It's true!

212
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,500
Practice it again.

213
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,750
No, no, no. Shy American.

214
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:24,458
Say it with <i>passione.</i>

215
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,625
With <i>passione?</i>

216
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,458
Okay. All right.

217
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,042
Good?

218
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,042
Good.

219
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

220
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,417
What does it mean?

221
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,042
"I am a teacher and I love to teach."

222
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,667
Margaret. There you are.

223
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,375
I'm sorry I scared you.

224
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:47,083
Come on.
I have something to show you for tonight.

225
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,625
You're gonna love it.

226
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,958
There she is.

227
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,875
Oh, my God, you look hot.

228
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,292
- I look naked.
- Yes.

229
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,833
What do you mean, naked? You look gorgeous.

230
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,958
Come on.

231
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,250
Up with your foot.

232
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,125
The other one.

233
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,125
Mother Mary.

234
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,250
Don't be nervous. Can you stand?

235
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:28,458
No.

236
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,167
Yes, you can.

237
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,583
Perfect.

238
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,542
Luz?

239
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,125
Yeah?

240
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,542
I can't do this.

241
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,125
Tell me.

242
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,625
Have you ever been to a bar?

243
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:57,833
No.

244
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,542
- A disco?
- No.

245
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,083
Anything at all?

246
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,625
Because your whole life you've wanted
to give yourself only to Him, right?

247
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,667
Look, I know.

248
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,500
I know it's scary
coming out from under the habit...

249
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,042
but look at you!

250
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,583
You're a very beautiful girl, Margaretta.

251
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,333
And you have to understand that
about yourself.

252
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,792
If only to know what it means to give it up.

253
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,667
So, let yourself feel it. Okay?

254
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,500
Be brave.

255
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So...

256
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,958
To the bravest girl I know.

257
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,125
Go.

258
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,583
Do you still feel your feet?

259
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,625
Oh, my.

260
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,083
Do you still feel your feet?

261
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,542
Yes.

262
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,208
Okay. Another then.

263
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,375
Hello.

264
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,000
<i>Parlate italiano?</i>

265
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,000
What?

266
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,042
<i>Parlate italiano?</i>

267
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,875
No. Not when I'm drinking.

268
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:35,042
Too hard.

269
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,083
<i>Inglese, per favore, no?</i>

270
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:40,875
If you can.

271
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,292
I'm Alfonzo, and this is Paolo.

272
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,292
Hi.

273
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,833
We can buy you a drink if you want.

274
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:16,792
Excuse me.

275
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,542
Can I have a sip of that?

276
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,417
Yeah, eat it.

277
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,917
- Eat it?
- Yes. Eat it.

278
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,958
I was watching this movie
with my mother yesterday.

279
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,083
- Yeah?
- And...

280
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,958
and was with Barbara Streisand, and I just...

281
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,250
I don't know. I love her and...

282
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,917
- You do?
- I do.

283
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,833
- Barbra?
- I love Barbara. Yes...

284
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
- Barbara Streisand.
- Barbra?

285
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,125
Barbra, yeah.

286
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:47,917
I mean, it was the part
with the "Hello, gorgeous."

287
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,500
Hello, gorgeous.

288
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:50,500
Gorgeous.

289
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,917
Gorgeous.

290
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,583
What? Gorgeous.

291
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,292
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

292
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,208
You know, it's...
Sorry if I'm not a professional...

293
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,292
- It was good.
- ...like Barbra.

294
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,875
But what do you do?

295
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,125
Well, since you asked...

296
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,833
I am a butterfly...

297
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,208
...And I must fly!

298
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,542
Okay.

299
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,042
A butterfly? Well then,
I must not keep you from flying!

300
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,875
What?

301
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:40,542
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

302
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,542
Come on.

303
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:51,042
<i>This is the BBC World Service,
and it's the 3rd of June, 1971.</i>

304
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,583
<i>Riots have erupted in Rome...</i>

305
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,542
<i>with clashes between the far left
and far right groups escalating rapidly.</i>

306
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,417
<i>The unrest has caused widespread damage
to property...</i>

307
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,750
<i>and has left several people injured.</i>

308
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:05,958
<i>Italian authorities are struggling
to contain the violence and restore order.</i>

309
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,125
<i>Public transportation, factories,
and schools are heavily affected...</i>

310
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,458
Good morning.

311
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,875
Good morning.

312
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:13,917
Did you have fun last night?

313
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,208
Yeah.

314
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,417
I'm guessing
you've never drunk like that before.

315
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,000
I didn't, like, embarrass myself
or anything last night, did I?

316
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,333
No. No.

317
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Okay.

318
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,958
You were well-behaved.

319
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,958
Mostly.

320
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,375
Okay. I found you
before anything got out of control.

321
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,625
And for the record, I was a very nice friend.

322
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,167
You came home with me.

323
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,042
Thanks.

324
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,542
But it wasn't easy pulling you away from him.

325
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,042
What do you mean? I didn't...

326
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,917
Let's just say you took my advice to heart.

327
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,042
You were a very brave girl, Margaretta.

328
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:14,000
But, hey, don't worry.

329
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,792
It's our little secret. Okay?

330
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,042
Excuse me.

331
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,208
May I sit?

332
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,125
No, please, please stay.

333
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,042
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

334
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,042
My name is Father Brennan.

335
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,542
I apologize for startling you.
Please sit with me.

336
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,542
This will only take a few minutes.

337
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,625
Your name is Margaret Daino.

338
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,208
You work at the orphanage.

339
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,583
You're new there.

340
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,792
I don't understand. How do you know that?

341
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,667
It's about the girl. Scianna.

342
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,000
- Carlita?
- You must be very careful, Margaret.

343
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,542
Bad things will start to happen around her.

344
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,708
Evil things.

345
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,083
No, I have to go now.

346
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,750
No, no. Please, please. Come see me tonight.

347
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,708
Saint Rita cloister, room 42.

348
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,292
I'll tell you everything.

349
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,875
Good morning, <i>farfalla.</i>

350
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:19,917
Good morning.

351
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,333
What's wrong?

352
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,917
Nothing. Just a little tired, that's all.

353
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,708
Where's Carlita?

354
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,208
She's in the bad room.

355
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,000
The bad room?

356
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,375
Dirty.

357
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,500
Dirty.

358
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,458
Dirty.

359
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,500
Dirty.

360
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:47,958
Sister.

361
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,375
Sister, I need your help.

362
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,708
Carlita, she's locked in a room.

363
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,583
That's right.

364
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,625
She bit Sister Romano just this morning...

365
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,417
so she had to go to the bad room.

366
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,875
Sister, why is there a bad room?

367
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:17,292
Because some girls are bad.

368
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,542
This room is suffocating.

369
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,125
It's not meant to be pleasant.

370
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,792
The things we do aren't always pleasant...

371
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,083
but they are in the name of God.

372
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,875
Do you wanna talk
about why they put you in that room?

373
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,667
I'm bad.

374
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,375
You're bad.

375
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,083
Well, guess who else was bad.

376
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:11,792
Who?

377
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,042
You?

378
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh, yeah.

379
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,708
But you know what?

380
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,708
I realized that I'm not bad.

381
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,708
They just tell you that you are...

382
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,333
because you're not doing
what they want you to do.

383
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:39,542
Back then, I used to think that there
was something really, really wrong with me.

384
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,625
What did you do?

385
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,167
Well, I guess at first, I tried to run away.

386
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:56,750
But it didn't fix the feeling.

387
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,083
That's what I like about you, actually.

388
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:02,875
What?

389
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,542
What do you like about me?

390
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,417
I think that you feel
the same way that I felt.

391
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,625
But you're not scared, you don't run away.

392
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,167
You just...

393
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,375
You raise your little claws, and you fight.

394
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,000
Carlita, go to your room, okay?

395
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,542
I'll be right there.

396
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,167
No!

397
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,375
Everything looks all right.

398
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,375
You did say you didn't eat much
in the morning.

399
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,958
May be low blood sugar.

400
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,375
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

401
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:08,833
Sorry? Margaret, what for?

402
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:13,000
You wouldn't be the first to faint
witnessing the birth of a child.

403
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,583
Frankly, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

404
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,708
The miracle of life can be a messy business.

405
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,042
You guys mind if I join?

406
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,583
Carlita, did you do this drawing?

407
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,208
This part is mine.

408
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,292
It's a boy.

409
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,917
I don't think that
that's very appropriate, Sister.

410
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,708
You all right?

411
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:12,833
Yes?

412
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,375
Here. Let's go for a walk.

413
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,458
- Join the group.
- Oh, not today, girls.

414
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:36,625
- Come on!
- Okay.

415
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,500
No, no, no, not me.

416
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,125
It's all right. It's okay.

417
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,208
You ready?

418
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,042
It's all for you.

419
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,125
Oh, no.

420
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,083
No, no, no, don't. Don't!

421
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,083
Don't!

422
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,792
Oh, no!

423
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,250
Margaret. Come in.

424
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,667
Something happened, didn't it?

425
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,375
Yes.

426
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,167
One of the sisters took her own life.

427
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,625
You mentioned the name "Scianna."

428
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,083
That's right.

429
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,500
I assume you know these people.

430
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,833
The priest is named Spiletto.

431
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,292
He's a radical.

432
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,292
Yes, I've seen him.

433
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,458
Turn it over.

434
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,542
The baby in this photo is Carlita?

435
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,000
I believe so.

436
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,042
And this is why she's in danger?

437
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,750
I know these sisters.

438
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:33,458
They're women of God.

439
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,875
They belong to the Church.

440
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,250
Listen to me, Margaret.

441
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:40,125
The truth is there are two Churches.

442
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:44,083
The one that follows the teachings of Christ,
the one that you and I are part of.

443
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,250
And the other.

444
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:51,375
The Church that will turn a blind eye
to torture, to rape.

445
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,750
To commit murder in the name of God.

446
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,667
All in the name of supreme power.

447
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,000
What do you think that Church
is most frightened of?

448
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:01,667
The Devil?

449
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,000
Secularism.

450
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:08,000
We are living in unprecedented times.

451
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:11,000
Look at what's been occurring
in your very own generation.

452
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:14,250
A culture that is outspoken, rebelling.

453
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,000
Sometimes violently.

454
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:19,417
People are turning away from the church
in droves.

455
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:22,667
And, Margaret, you know as well as I do...

456
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,917
that belief is power.

457
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:28,667
Now, how do you control people
who no longer believe...

458
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,167
in your stories of fire and brimstone?

459
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,250
People who do not seem to fear?

460
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,375
You create something to fear.

461
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,292
This Church has maintained power
for generations.

462
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,083
Thousands of years.

463
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,625
And they will stop at nothing
to keep it that way.

464
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:56,417
So, a small, but very powerful group
of priests and bishops...

465
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,667
even higher...

466
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,333
they decided...

467
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,167
something drastic had to be done.

468
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,875
These priests...

469
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:11,542
...believe they can birth the Antichrist
and then control him.

470
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:16,292
Allow him to bring his dark forces
to bear on the world...

471
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:19,125
just enough
to drive people back to the Church.

472
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,625
That's insane.

473
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,875
Yes. Don't you see?

474
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:25,417
If no one believes such a thing can exist...

475
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,083
who will stand in their way?

476
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,042
What does any of this
have to do with Carlita?

477
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,750
I was excommunicated.

478
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,500
My contacts within the Church
are very limited.

479
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,708
That photo is all I have to go on.

480
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,458
But I believe the baby girl in the picture...

481
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,417
is to be the mother.

482
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:49,667
The mother of what?

483
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,250
Of the Antichrist?

484
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,792
Yes.

485
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,417
My God. You're crazy.

486
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,625
Though if I am right...

487
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,625
Carlita would have been born on the sixth day
of the sixth month at 6 a.m.

488
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:08,875
666.

489
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,542
It's the mark of the Devil
which she will have on her body.

490
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,125
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

491
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,958
They're keeping her files at the orphanage.
Locked away.

492
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,542
I need you to get them to me.

493
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,458
I need to know how she was born.

494
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,875
What do you mean, how she was born?

495
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,167
Listen to me, Margaret.

496
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,667
There is a beast they're mating.

497
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,333
A jackal. That's the father.

498
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,250
- I have to go now.
- No, no, Margaret.

499
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,458
If Carlita is, in fact, the mother...

500
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,917
the evil inside her
will do whatever it takes to stop us.

501
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,292
We must destroy it at all costs.

502
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,167
- Do you understand?
- No.

503
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,583
Carlita is a little girl.

504
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,000
And she is not pregnant.

505
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,042
But we're not talking about a human child!

506
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,042
It's almost June 6th.

507
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:54,500
Look, we haven't a lot of time
and I need your help.

508
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,083
No, you need a doctor.

509
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,125
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

510
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,500
Will you let go of my arm?

511
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,625
Margaret.

512
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:33,125
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

513
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,250
I need to talk to you about Carlita.

514
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,917
Do you know anything about her history...

515
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:44,958
or how she came to the orphanage?

516
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:48,833
Not off the top of my head. Why?

517
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:53,500
Do you know where I could find
that kind of information?

518
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:59,667
I'm afraid this is not really my area,
you know?

519
00:52:58,958 --> 00:52:59,958
What?

520
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:03,083
Why do you keep staring at me?

521
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:05,625
I'm not.

522
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:15,792
Will you come with me?

523
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:18,792
Come on.

524
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,000
I need to talk to you about something.

525
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:26,917
But before I do...

526
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,417
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

527
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,042
Okay.

528
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,875
Has anyone ever done anything to you...

529
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,667
that might have scared you...

530
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,167
or upset you?

531
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,833
I don't know.

532
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,042
What don't you know?

533
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:02,667
Sometimes I get this...

534
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,417
bad feelings.

535
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,708
I see...

536
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,375
I see things.

537
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:18,500
And I can't tell if they're real or not.

538
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,667
Listen to me.

539
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:25,000
When I was younger...

540
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,625
I used to have these...

541
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,667
horrible visions.

542
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,708
They were so terrible that I...

543
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:37,083
convinced myself that they were real.

544
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:42,833
But I learned that those thoughts...

545
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,917
they were just lies.

546
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,125
Just tricks that my brain
was playing on me...

547
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,500
because I was so unhappy.

548
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:53,667
This isn't a lie.

549
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,458
How can you know that for certain?

550
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,292
Carlita.

551
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,792
I'm sorry.

552
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:07,417
Carlita.

553
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,625
Carlita. I'm sorry.

554
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,583
There you are.

555
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,708
A riot's broken out.

556
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,083
We must go.

557
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,833
Listen. It's all right, girls.

558
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,667
It's okay. Stay close to me, okay?

559
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,542
Stay close to me, okay?

560
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,042
Carlita!

561
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Carlita!

562
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:57,792
Margaretta.

563
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:06,625
Sister Silva would like to see you
in her office.

564
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,500
Please take a seat.

565
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:23,542
Margaret...

566
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:28,458
Part of my job here is to look out...

567
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:32,667
for the well-being of all those
who are under my care.

568
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:36,667
I'm sure this will come as no surprise...

569
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,833
but I've become concerned.

570
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:42,833
I'm fine.

571
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,917
Perhaps I should have put it this way.

572
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,708
We are concerned.

573
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:56,458
Myself and Cardinal Lawrence.

574
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:01,583
We think it might be time for you
to take a step back.

575
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,708
And perhaps we postpone your vows.

576
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,833
What? No. Why?

577
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:10,042
We're also concerned
about your attachment to Carlita.

578
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,583
Carlita? But...

579
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,458
Cardinal Lawrence told me
about your troubles growing up.

580
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,208
Your hallucinations.

581
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:23,708
Perhaps being around Carlita
is not what's right for you.

582
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:28,500
Carlita is disturbed.

583
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:31,542
And her illness must not infect us...

584
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:33,542
as her caretakers.

585
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,750
And clearly, it has.

586
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:39,958
Wait.

587
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,000
I'm not ill.

588
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,708
I understand how hard you had to work...

589
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,750
to get to where you are.

590
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,542
It would be a shame to give it all up now.

591
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:56,250
I am the only one who cares about her.

592
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,750
- You don't let her play with the other girls.
- I've told you...

593
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:01,458
- You keep her in the bad room.
- ...we're only doing what's right for her.

594
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:02,917
The girl is sick in the head.

595
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,667
Because of you!

596
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,167
If there was any doubt in our decision...

597
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,458
you've all but confirmed it.

598
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:20,208
You're clearly unwell.

599
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,625
And, Margaret...

600
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:27,042
you will keep your distance from Carlita.

601
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,583
Or there will be consequences.

602
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,250
Stop the car, Luca.

603
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,333
I can just walk home from here, okay?

604
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,708
You don't have to wait.

605
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:54,292
Paolo.

606
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,750
Paolo!

607
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:57,667
Paolo!

608
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,167
No, no, no.

609
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,167
Paolo?

610
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,958
Just leave me alone, please.

611
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,042
Hey!

612
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,500
Sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know.

613
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:13,667
Really, I didn't know.

614
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:14,833
You didn't know what?

615
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,208
Just stop following me!

616
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:23,875
Paolo, talk to me.

617
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,333
Just look for the mark.

618
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:55,417
Okay.

619
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,500
All right. Oh, God. Okay.

620
01:01:58,958 --> 01:01:59,958
All right.

621
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,875
Hey, call an ambulance.

622
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,667
Call an ambulance.

623
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,542
- Help me.
- I'm gonna help you.

624
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:08,625
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

625
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,125
I'm gonna help you.

626
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,917
- I can't move.
- I know.

627
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,458
- I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
- I know. Okay.

628
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,875
- I'm scared.
- Paolo, you're gonna be fine, I promise.

629
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,333
I don't wanna die.

630
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,583
No, no, no. You're not gonna die,
you're gonna be okay.

631
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:26,417
You ready?

632
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:41,083
Oh, no, no.

633
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,833
Oh, God.

634
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,000
Oh, God.

635
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,708
Oh, no, God.

636
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,208
- Amen.
- Amen.

637
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,292
Amen.

638
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,458
Amen.

639
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,333
Oh, God.

640
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,208
Come on.

641
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,292
Oh, God.

642
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:13,958
Carlita.

643
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,833
Come with me, Carlita.

644
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,542
Okay, you go to the bed.

645
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,708
I am so sorry that I didn't believe you.

646
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,333
But I believe you now.

647
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:42,792
Okay?

648
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:43,958
I'm gonna keep you safe.

649
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:45,458
I'm gonna get you out of here.

650
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,042
Margaret.

651
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,250
Go, go, go. Over there.

652
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,208
- Margaret.
- You stay away.

653
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,417
- I know what you're doing.
- We don't want to hurt you.

654
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,500
Just put that down.

655
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,333
I know what you've done...

656
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,500
with the babies.

657
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:06,208
You stay away! No!

658
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,417
You stay away from me!

659
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,208
- Remain calm!
- No, no, no!

660
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,875
Please, please, I'm sorry.

661
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,917
No, no, no!

662
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:37,958
Not in there! Not in there! Not in there!

663
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:41,000
No! No! No!

664
01:13:44,542 --> 01:13:46,292
Let me out!

665
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,667
Please let me out!

666
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Please!

667
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,292
Breathe. Breathe.

668
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:21,792
...conviction: I am wanted.
I have a task in history.

669
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,958
I am accepted. It is good that I exist.

670
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,042
It is good to be a human being.

671
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,583
Let every human heart experience your love.

672
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,250
It's not real.

673
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:30,417
It's not real. It's not real. It's not real.

674
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,500
What's not real?

675
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:32,792
Who said that?

676
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:44,750
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

677
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,000
No!

678
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:03,125
Margaret. We have to go.

679
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,708
We have to go. I found the files.

680
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,042
We have to go now. It's just me.

681
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,417
It's just me.

682
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,250
Get me out of here.

683
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,875
Yes. I know. I know.

684
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,167
All right, all right.

685
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:24,292
Father Gabriel. Margaret.

686
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,125
I don't understand.

687
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:35,875
How?

688
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:40,208
Well done, Margaret. Well done.

689
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:42,708
Were you followed?

690
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:43,875
What? No.

691
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,208
I don't think so.

692
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,333
Luca, Margaret's driver, brought us.

693
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,542
We can trust him. He's keeping watch outside.

694
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,333
You two know each other?

695
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,500
- Yes.
- No.

696
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,500
He tried approaching me.

697
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,083
I thought he was crazy.

698
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,208
It is crazy.

699
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,833
Carlita.

700
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:05,375
We have to go get her.

701
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:06,542
No, it's not safe.

702
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,792
Not safe?

703
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,458
She's the one
who's not safe right now, Gabriel.

704
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,875
Margaret, after what just happened...

705
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,292
they're not gonna let us
anywhere near that orphanage.

706
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:14,667
Especially Carlita.

707
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,875
He's right.

708
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,917
It's only a matter of time
before they realize we've got these.

709
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:21,292
And when they do, they will come for us.

710
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,458
We have to help her.

711
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,167
The only path forward...

712
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:25,833
is to prove what they've done.

713
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,333
Otherwise, no one will believe a word we say.

714
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:38,167
There's so many of them.

715
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:39,333
Yes.

716
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,125
Too many.

717
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,292
I had no idea they'd gone to such lengths.

718
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,167
I don't understand.

719
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,167
They need a male.

720
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,667
They've only birthed females.

721
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:01,250
They've all died except for Carlita.

722
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:03,958
After all these years, so many failures...

723
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:10,667
They believe the only way is for the beast
to mate with its own offspring.

724
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,000
What is this?

725
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,208
I told you,
it's the photo from Carlita's birth.

726
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,375
No.

727
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,125
This.

728
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,125
It's the mark.

729
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,500
Carlita doesn't have the mark on her head.

730
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,208
Hers is here.

731
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,708
What are you talking about?

732
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:52,917
I've seen it.

733
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,458
{\an8}You see? Carlita.

734
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:58,625
{\an8}No mark.

735
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,500
The baby in this photo is not Carlita.

736
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:08,000
What does that mean?

737
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:10,958
Brennan?

738
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,167
I don't know.

739
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,250
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for...

740
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:20,167
then all we have to do is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

741
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,042
We must have missed something.

742
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,208
Right?

743
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,292
Where is it?

744
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,542
{\an8}Why do they all look like this?

745
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,208
{\an8}The father. He's not human.

746
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,667
It's her.

747
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,667
There was another survivor.

748
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,333
A sister?

749
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,542
Did you know about this?

750
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,708
No.

751
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,292
They must have kept it hidden away.

752
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:15,542
Look for the mark.

753
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,625
How did he know?

754
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,000
He knew where it was.

755
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,708
Margaret, Margaret. Hush.

756
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,958
Margaret. Margaret. Margaret.

757
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,708
Just let me have a look.

758
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:51,667
Let me look.

759
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:21,000
Somebody say something.

760
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:24,542
How is that possible?

761
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,625
She's been a ward of the Church
her entire life.

762
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:30,958
They must have moved her around
to cover their tracks.

763
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:33,208
Carlita must be too young...

764
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:36,125
so they brought Margaret back to Rome to...

765
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:37,292
To what?

766
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:41,167
To what?

767
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,833
- I have to get out of here.
- You can't leave.

768
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,125
- Don't touch me.
- Margaret...

769
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:52,917
- Don't you touch me!
- ...you can't just leave.

770
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,417
You touch me again, I'll fucking kill you!

771
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,542
I'm so sorry.

772
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:14,042
I'm so sorry this is happening to you,
my child.

773
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:17,333
But nothing will change
if you decide to leave.

774
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:21,375
It's June 6th.

775
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:22,542
Midnight.

776
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:24,208
They will be coming for you.

777
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:31,042
If this is true...

778
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,333
If I am pregnant...

779
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:40,667
then I need it out of me.

780
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,750
I need it out of me now.

781
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:55,375
Margaret...

782
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:57,333
you all right?

783
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:00,167
This doctor knows what he's doing?

784
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:02,958
He's experienced, yes.

785
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,583
Wait. Stop. What are you doing?

786
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:33,875
Don't stop.

787
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,833
Make like you're heading for the main road...

788
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,500
and then turn off before the arch.

789
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:50,958
Margaret.

790
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,875
What's happening to me?

791
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,917
Hello?

792
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:44,917
Hello?

793
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:48,458
Can anyone hear me?

794
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,625
Yes.

795
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,708
I can hear.

796
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:58,917
I can't tell if this is real or not.

797
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:03,333
This is very real, Margaret.

798
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,042
Can you untie me?

799
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,042
Soon.

800
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:11,792
Soon it will be all over, I promise.

801
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,083
No.

802
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,417
No, no.

803
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,375
You don't have to be afraid.

804
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:25,333
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

805
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,458
I've watched over you...

806
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,083
since you were a little girl.

807
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,500
The very first moment we met,
do you remember what I said to you?

808
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:45,375
That you, Margaret, were the bravest girl
I'd ever known.

809
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,792
Now you know how special you are to me.

810
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
To us.

811
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:57,917
The baby you're about to bear
will redeem the Church.

812
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:01,292
Will bring the people back to God.

813
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,750
All because of you.

814
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,875
Don't you understand, Margaret?

815
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,500
Your whole life, you've been searching...

816
01:35:10,667 --> 01:35:12,667
waiting for His voice.

817
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:16,875
But the truth is...

818
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:22,542
He was always there with you.

819
01:35:26,292 --> 01:35:29,000
He brought you here.

820
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,000
He chose you.

821
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,792
I... No.

822
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,083
There.

823
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,667
You're ready now.

824
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:00,208
Please know that I love you.

825
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:06,542
I'll be right here.

826
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,000
Stay down.

827
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:46,667
No, no.

828
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:50,208
No, no. Please.

829
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:04,000
Please, please, please.

830
01:38:04,542 --> 01:38:05,750
No.

831
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:09,083
No, no, no.

832
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:11,458
No, please.

833
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
Please.

834
01:38:16,667 --> 01:38:17,667
Please.

835
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,542
Help me, please.

836
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:54,750
Please help me. Please.

837
01:38:54,917 --> 01:38:56,292
Please, untie me.

838
01:38:57,542 --> 01:38:59,583
Please untie me, I'm in pain.

839
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,458
I'm in pain. Please.

840
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:08,833
Help.

841
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,250
Help me, please.

842
01:39:12,417 --> 01:39:13,750
Please help me.

843
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:16,583
Help me.

844
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:19,667
Help. I'm in pain.

845
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:23,375
What is it? A boy or girl?

846
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:34,500
There are two.

847
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:36,833
A girl...

848
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:42,208
And the other?

849
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:44,458
A boy!

850
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:50,667
We have him.

851
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:54,750
Help.

852
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:57,750
- Help. Help.
- Of course.

853
01:41:57,917 --> 01:41:58,917
Of course, my dear.

854
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:00,833
- I'm in pain.
- Of course.

855
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,458
Can I hold him?

856
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,208
You're sure?

857
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:18,333
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.

858
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:21,583
Bring him here.

859
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:25,583
She's right.

860
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:31,042
It is important for a child
to bond with its mother.

861
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:41,042
We all need the comfort of our mothers
in the beginning.

862
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:43,000
Don't we?

863
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:50,167
You did so well, my child.

864
01:42:57,167 --> 01:42:59,833
You are doing God's work.

865
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,583
He would be so proud of you.

866
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:05,083
Can't you hear Him telling you?

867
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,292
Don't you hear His voice?

868
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:13,458
No.

869
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,917
No, I only hear my own.

870
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:24,167
No!

871
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:53,125
Margaret.

872
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:56,250
Stop this.

873
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:02,208
Margaret, give me the baby.

874
01:44:03,917 --> 01:44:05,958
Just give me the baby.

875
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:17,792
No!

876
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:43,083
Burn everything.

877
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:44,917
Leave them both to die.

878
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,750
It's okay.

879
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:05,000
The man you are looking for.

880
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,333
The US Ambassador to Rome.

881
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:10,000
He will be the new father.

882
01:48:12,042 --> 01:48:15,125
<i>He and his wife will suffer a tragic loss...</i>

883
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:16,958
<i>and be in need of a child.</i>

884
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:23,125
<i>The boy will inherit their privilege...</i>

885
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:24,375
<i>and power.</i>

886
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:29,958
<i>Soon, his darkness will spread...</i>

887
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:34,292
<i>and the world shall be saved.</i>

888
01:49:10,417 --> 01:49:12,542
Baby, you're supposed to eat them.

889
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:13,875
You're supposed to eat them like...

890
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:15,625
Like that.

891
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:20,375
What are you doing?

892
01:49:22,542 --> 01:49:23,458
Come here.

893
01:49:28,292 --> 01:49:29,708
No, no, no. Here.

894
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:31,708
This.

895
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:32,958
No, not this.

896
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:34,125
You want one?

897
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:36,792
You want it?

898
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,708
Give it to Mama. Give it to Mama.

899
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:40,875
Give it to Mama.

900
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:04,417
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

901
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:09,000
I tried just to leave you be.

902
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:14,250
You need to go.

903
01:50:15,083 --> 01:50:16,292
Now.

904
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,875
I came to warn you.

905
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,625
They know you're alive.

906
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:26,375
You weren't supposed to survive.
None of you were.

907
01:50:26,833 --> 01:50:28,292
Especially the girl.

908
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,000
She'll be important, Margaret.

909
01:50:35,792 --> 01:50:37,375
I just want to be left alone.

910
01:50:39,167 --> 01:50:40,208
I know.

911
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:43,500
But they will come for you.

912
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,625
They've even given it a name.

913
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:06,833
Your son.

914
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,333
Damien.
