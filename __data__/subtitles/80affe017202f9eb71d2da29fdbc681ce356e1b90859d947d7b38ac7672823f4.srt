1
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,017
<i>Fuck.</i>

2
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,188
<i>What is an adult?</i>

3
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,458
<i>Becomin' one</i>
<i>didn't suddenly transform me</i>

4
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,860
<i>into anything outstanding</i>
<i>or significant.</i>

5
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,663
<i>I am 18 and</i>
<i>entirely unremarkable.</i>

6
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,101
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

7
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,801
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

8
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,437
<i>In this tomb of a house</i>
<i>left to me</i>

9
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,805
<i>by my brilliant</i>
<i>and selfish parents.</i>

10
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,342
<i>They're not dead...</i>

11
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,977
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

12
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,679
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,084
<i>Literature is my solace</i>
<i>in the solitude.</i>

14
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,586
<i>And writing is my only means</i>
<i>of escape.</i>

15
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>Because, you see...</i>

16
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,925
<i>I've never left the edges</i>
<i>of this town.</i>

17
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,995
<i>It's positively gothic,</i>
<i>really.</i>

18
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,098
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

19
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,601
<i>the interminable boredom</i>
<i>of her small village.</i>

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,904
<i>Lonely girl longs</i>
<i>to be meaningful.</i>

21
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,774
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,810
<i>Books make longing</i>
<i>seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

23
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,745
<i>It's greedy.</i>

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,382
<i>And I wear longing</i>
<i>like a fucking veil.</i>

25
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,567
<i>But today?</i>

26
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,803
<i>Today comes with</i>
<i>something new.</i>

27
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,571
<i>Something surprising.</i>

28
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,742
<i>Today I meet a writer,</i>
<i>like me.</i>

29
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,778
<i>A teacher.</i>

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,448
<i>One who somehow</i>
<i>found inspiration</i>

31
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,083
<i>in a place like this.</i>

32
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,318
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

33
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,826
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,628
<i>I suppose even graveyards</i>
<i>grow flowers.</i>

35
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,261
Good morning.

36
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,696
Morning.

37
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,201
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

38
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,370
I know. I don't like crowds.

39
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,670
Uh-uh...

40
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,108
-Do you live far?
-Close enough to walk.

41
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,210
-Oh, where's that?
-Lovell Hill?

42
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,912
You live in Lovell Hill?

43
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,813
-You know it?
-I just didn't think it was

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,350
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,717
Who says it is?

46
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,554
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

47
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,854
Wow.

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,558
It's enormous.

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,959
My parents are lawyers.

50
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,793
-Hmm, what kind?
-The expensive kind.

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,196
And you wanna be a lawyer?

52
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,365
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

53
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,599
What's your name?

54
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,934
Cairo Sweet.

55
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,069
-I'm Mr. Miller.
-I know.

56
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,405
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

57
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,473
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,074
Uh...

59
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,876
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

60
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,512
the holidays.

61
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,047
Got a chance to look it over?

62
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:40,981
I read it.

63
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,616
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

64
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,783
but I promise you
we'll get through it

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,419
as quickly as we can.

66
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,753
I read the whole list.

67
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,821
Wait, you read these?

68
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,493
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,594
I party hard.

70
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,797
-Winnie.
-Mm. Hmm, hmm.

71
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,567
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

72
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,700
Did you miss me?

73
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,203
I did not.

74
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,771
Well, that's too bad.

75
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,643
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

76
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,079
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

77
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,653
How boring.

78
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,955
Censorship is dead.

79
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,656
It can't exist
with the Internet.

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,790
And yet it does.

81
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,059
Do you know why?

82
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah.

83
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,262
Do you?

84
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,264
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

85
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,832
Not limitation.

86
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,401
Oh.
Excuse me,

87
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,802
but what's that you say?

88
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:40,074
You want
a chicken biscuit

89
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,543
and a Coke?

90
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,145
Mm. Well, you heard the boss.

91
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,549
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

92
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,317
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

93
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,686
No, thank you, Cairo.

94
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,853
Sweet of you to ask.

95
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,756
I see
what you did there.

96
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,692
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

97
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,994
Not.

98
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,562
Good one.

99
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,964
Like we've never heard
that before.

100
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,311
Jesus.

101
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,953
My God.

102
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,030
What you reading?

103
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,266
-Uh, nothing.
-Doesn't look like nothin'.

104
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,334
It's a student's.

105
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,435
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

106
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,603
How do you know it's a girl?

107
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,338
Oh, boys are too lazy
to read porn.

108
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,472
How do you know it's porn?

109
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,842
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

110
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,978
"She leaps off the couch

111
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,046
-"and pushes herself..."
-Boris.

112
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,580
"...between the girl and me.

113
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,717
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

114
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,052
-"that I can't move."
-Give me that.

115
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,486
-"Marcelle stretches..."
-Okay.

116
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,555
-"...her tiny split fig."
-That's quite enough...

117
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,855
-All right.
-...of your elocution...

118
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,591
-And test tomorrow, kids.
-I think.

119
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,060
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

120
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,594
-This coffee for me?
-Biscuit, too.

121
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,264
One of yours?

122
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,699
Oh, yeah,
that's one of yours.

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,766
One of mine. Exactly.

124
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,866
Christ!

125
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,202
I don't know what
you're doing,

126
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,470
-but it's some...
-Oh, you know. Come on, now.

127
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,072
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

128
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,139
-Man, that's good.
-"Oh, I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

129
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,240
-"I'm so smart."
-Can you not?

130
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,975
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

131
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,043
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>
<i>-</i> Boris. Boris. Come on.

132
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,178
"I'm better than most people."

133
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,112
-Stop, please.
-Is this her diary?

134
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,513
Oh, what do we have here?

135
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,315
Well, well, well.

136
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,518
<i>"Apostrophes</i>
<i>and Ampersands..."</i>

137
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:35,989
six abysmally
romantic short stories

138
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,858
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

139
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,262
-She has my book?
-Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,797
It would appear so.
It would also appear

141
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,099
she's the only one
who checked it out.

142
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,568
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

143
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,802
Well, you know,

144
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,003
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

145
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,206
No, you really can't.

146
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,241
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

147
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,043
They cut
the theater program.

148
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,644
But they kept you?

149
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,446
Along with
the other props, yeah.

150
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,282
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,408
-Hello, wife.
-Hello, husband.

152
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,313
Beatrice.

153
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,315
-What?
-Look at me.

154
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,822
Huh.

155
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,323
Red-Letter Day.

156
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,859
What, your school
finally get computers?

157
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:46,960
Better.

158
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,395
Indoor bathrooms?

159
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,763
A writer.

160
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,031
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

161
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,399
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

162
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,134
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

163
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,270
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

164
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,472
And, uh, guess what else?

165
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,573
<i>-Naked Lunch.</i>
-Mm-mm.

166
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,842
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

167
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,943
She...

168
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,179
She checked it out
of the library.

169
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,414
They carry your book
at the library?

170
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,250
Aw. Fuck.

171
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,922
<i>-A Confederacy of Dunces.</i>
<i>-</i> Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,823
Well, deep breaths.

173
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,090
Happy place.

174
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,560
My happy place
has all their heads

175
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,930
impaled on Montblanc pens.

176
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,464
Share your riches.

177
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,836
Hello, Amy.

178
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,737
What? Are you fucking joking?

179
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,206
I've been back and forth
all day

180
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,408
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

181
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,409
what it is they want

182
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,344
and somehow think
they can articulate

183
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,246
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

184
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,347
considering how they think

185
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,951
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

186
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,752
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

187
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,254
my teeth with a baby spoon.

188
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,789
-Mm.
-They can go

189
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,792
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

190
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,694
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

191
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,785
Here now.

192
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,722
Cheers.

193
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,790
Cheers.

194
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,061
Oh, that's so good.

195
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,332
Hey, you ever read, uh,

196
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,535
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

197
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,037
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

198
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,072
I had to throw it away.

199
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,108
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

200
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,809
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-...and the cum money?

201
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,344
That is choice.

202
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,881
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

203
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:50,717
"and wipe my cock on it."

204
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,389
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

205
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,324
"weighted with a coin."

206
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,860
-I love when you do magic.
-Mm.

207
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,161
You care to reenact?

208
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,297
I can papier-mache you...

209
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,433
with cum and money.

210
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,936
Oh, so you're expecting

211
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,170
-a heavy load, then, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,007
A full body of work.

213
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,508
Come here.

214
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,843
Dance with me.

215
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,564
You're so beautiful.

216
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,299
Shut up.

217
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,517
Oh, for fuck's sake.

218
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,453
Okay.

219
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,222
Will you take care
of those dishes?

220
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,290
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,425
I'll give you a handy later.

222
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,197
It's Pushkin, Amy.

223
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,832
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

224
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,302
What
a terrible weekend.

225
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,204
-Mm.
-Come on,

226
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,606
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

227
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,942
'Cause you're a puritan.

228
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,142
I feel like it's my duty

229
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,911
to punish the goodness
out of you.

230
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,212
God, you're a sadist.

231
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,546
I'm a public school teacher.

232
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,415
-Amen to that.
-Cheers.

233
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,885
Ooh, mama.

234
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,624
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

235
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,561
Why don't you go see?

236
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,032
Mm-mm.
I don't go in the kudzu.

237
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,100
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

238
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,567
That's why it grows so fast.

239
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,031
Good morning.

240
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,231
You always walk through
the woods alone?

241
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,366
That's a peculiar question

242
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,535
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

243
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,203
What, what are you,
uh, listening to?

244
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,106
-Celine Dion.
-Really?

245
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,707
Really.

246
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,808
But why?

247
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,376
-I'm sorry.
-Because she's great.

248
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,844
-Oh. Hmm.
-Ignore him. Ignore him.

249
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,679
-He wept aloud openly...
-Hmm.

250
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,414
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

251
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,549
-Hmm.
-...at my bachelor party.

252
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,384
-Remember that?
-I was drunk.

253
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,518
You were disconsolate.

254
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,820
You are a fucking traitor.

255
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,122
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

256
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,289
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

257
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,857
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,126
Uh, want a biscuit?

259
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,760
-Yeah, sure.
-There you go.

260
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,103
-It's good.
-Yeah?

261
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,204
-Do you make these?
-Yeah.

262
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,604
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

263
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,473
-Why not? I don't.
-Oh, you know.

264
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,841
-You'll figure it out.
-I won't.

265
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,409
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

266
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,311
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

267
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,215
On that...
Take my leave.

268
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,416
I shall bid you goodbye.

269
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,584
-Okay.
-Uh, you, bad bye.

270
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,752
-Well, goodbye.
-A bad bye?

271
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,154
Mm-hmm.
-But I love you though.

272
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:14,454
No, you don't.

273
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,859
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

274
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:24,831
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

275
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,016
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

276
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,484
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

277
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,988
I dressed up just for you.

278
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,091
What you want?

279
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:51,159
I wanna get into

280
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,227
-your physics class.
-Why?

281
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,294
You'd be really behind.

282
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,862
Don't you tutor?

283
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,497
You don't need lessons.

284
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,699
Then what do I need?

285
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,502
Um...

286
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,008
See what I can do.

287
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,308
'Preciate ya!

288
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,709
Hope so.

289
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,579
You are insane.

290
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,751
Here.

291
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,420
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

292
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,291
But you're a lesbian.

293
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,625
I'm an equal opportunist.

294
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,128
Mm.

295
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,595
Are you jealous?

296
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,463
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

297
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,899
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

298
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,735
Okay, chickybikky?

299
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,405
Okay.

300
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,083
So, you're a smoker now?

301
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,751
I'm smoking now.

302
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,322
No plans for it
to define me yet.

303
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,923
Where are your parents
this time?

304
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,757
Mumbai.

305
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,927
For how long?

306
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,828
Who knows?

307
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,097
Let me dress you up.

308
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:05,099
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

309
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,600
I give a fuck
about being smart.

310
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,602
You can be both.

311
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,872
What are you doin'?

312
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,009
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

313
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,476
into my Yale essay.

314
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,012
You dry?

315
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:20,447
Unqualified.

316
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,849
What's the subject?

317
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,952
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

318
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,055
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

319
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,723
Surviving the crippling ennui

320
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,058
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

321
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,159
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,560
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

323
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,629
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

324
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,064
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

325
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:38,266
I've had no achievement.

326
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,467
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

327
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,534
Boring.

328
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,138
-You have a 4.6 GPA.
-Boring.

329
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,373
And you've successfully...

330
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,439
-What?
-Well...

331
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,409
You've successfully, um...

332
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,145
Well...

333
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,846
Shit.

334
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:55,149
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

335
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,549
generationally wealthy gal

336
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,852
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

337
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,954
Fuck.

338
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,522
So...

339
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,792
Experience something.

340
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,726
Like what?

341
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,461
Something worth writing about.

342
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:13,267
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

343
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,670
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

344
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,604
Easy.

345
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,572
It becomes a conversation

346
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,675
about achieving emancipation

347
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,445
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

348
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,281
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

349
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,649
Haven't decided yet.

350
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,252
What's it to you?

351
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,386
Like, he's, like,

352
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,621
-twenty years older than you.
-So?

353
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,489
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

354
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,159
since the dawn of time.

355
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,830
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

356
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,366
What?

357
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,800
Your virginity.

358
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,702
Does it mean something to you?

359
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,539
I haven't decided yet.

360
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,109
Come to Winnie.

361
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,517
We're, like,

362
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,620
the fucking
American wet dream.

363
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,724
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

364
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,428
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

365
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,730
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

366
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,531
whose sexual standards
are mandated

367
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,968
by the shit porn he downloads.

368
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,103
That's deli meat.

369
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,872
I want a dry-aged

370
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,575
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

371
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,510
to take me to pleasure town.

372
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,646
Like...

373
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,216
Wagyu beef.

374
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,920
Hungee.

375
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,721
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

376
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:44,058
Why not?

377
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,961
He's fine.

378
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,197
He's like,
really fucking smart.

379
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:51,499
And he's kind.

380
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,968
Which means, as my first time,

381
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,603
he'd take his time

382
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,772
to get me all good and juiced.

383
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,908
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

384
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,379
You know,
the first time you have sex,

385
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:06,981
it's not supposed to hurt.

386
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,848
Right?

387
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,685
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

388
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,956
You likely won't even bleed.

389
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,926
Didn't know that.

390
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,827
That's because a woman's pain

391
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,896
is valued more
than her pleasure.

392
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,132
But that's a conversation
for another day.

393
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,233
My point...

394
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:30,938
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

395
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,941
I know what I'm looking for.

396
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:39,213
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

397
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,314
What do you mean?

398
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,715
I've never seen him look
at a student

399
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,151
the way he looks at you.

400
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,088
He sees you

401
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,855
even though
you hide in plain sight.

402
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:50,958
-Shut up.
-What?

403
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:51,926
-Stop!
-No.

404
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,428
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

405
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,996
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

406
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,898
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

407
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,601
No, you're being... Shut up.

408
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,342
I'd fuck you.

409
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,377
I know.

410
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:20,854
<i>"I was nothing</i>

411
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,689
<i>"but a bleached bone monument</i>
<i>beneath her.</i>

412
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,027
<i>"Human ruins</i>
<i>of a madman's love."</i>

413
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,165
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

414
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,170
<i>God, I'd give anything</i>
<i>to feel that.</i>

415
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,775
<i>What muse could inspire</i>
<i>this deranged yearning?</i>

416
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:51,986
<i>To inspire.</i>

417
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,787
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

418
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,727
<i>Could we be that</i>
<i>to each other?</i>

419
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,899
<i>What was I saying?</i>

420
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,370
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

421
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,206
<i>Feels good.</i>

422
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,608
<i>It feels pink.</i>

423
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,943
Never forget.

424
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,711
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

425
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,048
It's very big, it's very bold.

426
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:24,151
To us,
it might seem a little...

427
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,685
much.

428
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,323
If we don't stick
to the brief,

429
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,258
it gets a little bit woolly.

430
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,861
Uh, can you see me
after school, please?

431
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,465
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

432
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,301
<i>It's like a sugar cube</i>
<i>under the tongue.</i>

433
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,368
...a little better.

434
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,071
But worth persevering.

435
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,606
Colby, what?

436
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,208
<i>I want your attention.</i>

437
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,446
Uh, how's Bea?

438
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,714
She's, uh, she's Bea.

439
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,183
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

440
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,651
It's not.

441
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,320
You mean you're not.

442
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,988
No, she's, uh, she's occupied.

443
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:02,356
All right,
what time is dinner?

444
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:03,524
Seven o'clock.

445
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:05,059
And please take a shower.

446
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,193
Are you worried?

447
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,463
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

448
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,830
Top three worst nightmares.

449
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:13,601
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

450
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,603
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

451
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,938
Aw, cutie.

452
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:19,974
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,475
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

454
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,809
Check it out now.

455
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,820
-It's close, right?
-To?

456
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,022
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

457
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,390
-All right, man.
-Bye, Professor.

458
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:37,691
Love you.

459
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,474
Ooh!

460
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,076
F... Hi. Uh...

461
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:00,847
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

462
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,950
-I won't tell.
-That's generous, thank you.

463
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,719
Uh, hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

464
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,055
I'm waiting for Winnie.

465
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:10,124
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

466
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,359
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

467
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,728
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

468
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,598
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

469
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,899
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

470
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,269
What's Winnie doing?

471
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,504
She's applying to Vandy.

472
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,239
You would be pleased to know.

473
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,774
And are you?

474
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,276
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

475
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:32,446
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

476
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:33,547
Maybe.

477
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,582
From afar.

478
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,484
As it burns.

479
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,287
Like Nero.

480
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,890
Well, that's...

481
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:46,393
So, uh,
how far are we talkin'?

482
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,628
Yale far.

483
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,096
Yale far? My God!

484
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,098
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

485
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,933
and read Joan Didion or what?

486
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,968
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

487
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,174
You ever been to

488
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,909
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

489
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,644
No. What's that?

490
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:06,480
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

491
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:07,648
Victorian Village.

492
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,483
-What is that?
-What's...

493
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,051
What's that? It's blank.

494
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,653
Ca... How can you disdain

495
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,588
of what Tennessee has to offer

496
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:18,759
without conducting a thorough,
uh, cultural investigation?

497
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,260
Educated judgment.

498
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:23,863
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

499
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,632
Because they're bad?

500
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,868
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

501
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,071
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

502
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:32,940
Yeah.

503
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,676
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

504
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,177
I think you might
be surprised.

505
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,582
You wanted to see me?

506
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,083
This week's story,

507
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,887
uh, you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

508
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,223
I enjoyed this one.

509
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,261
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

510
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,030
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

511
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,236
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

512
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,408
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

513
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:10,077
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

514
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,045
"like a hypergiant star

515
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,680
"burning to ash.

516
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:19,119
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

517
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,488
"We are what we are.

518
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:25,092
"And all creatures must eat."

519
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,565
-Um...
-Damn. That, I mean...

520
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,267
I was not expecting that.

521
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,369
Um...

522
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,372
She's not reluctant.

523
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,641
She's resigned.

524
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,842
-To her death?
-No.

525
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,210
To the order of things.

526
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,079
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

527
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:48,549
-Phew. It's dark.
-It's nature.

528
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,017
That's true.

529
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,189
You memorized it.

530
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:56,523
Uh...

531
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,692
Well, I'm eidetic.

532
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,561
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

533
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:05,032
You are...

534
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,570
You're exceptionally talented.

535
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,906
-Do I get an A?
-Well, how about a jumpstart

536
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,307
on the midterm?

537
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:15,476
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

538
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,011
I want you to write
a short story

539
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,247
in the style
of your favorite author.

540
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:22,983
I think it could be
the highlight

541
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,751
of your portfolio submission

542
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,119
-to Vanderbilt.
-Yale.

543
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:27,621
-Vanderbilt.
-Yale.

544
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,356
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

545
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,059
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

546
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,360
Thought you would.

547
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,095
Good.

548
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,031
I read your book.

549
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,734
Oh, God. Well, uh...

550
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,040
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

551
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,076
found it, uh,

552
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:52,613
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

553
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,780
I would call it...

554
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,483
grand and tragic.

555
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,286
Okay.

556
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:02,122
Romantic horror.

557
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,360
That's, uh...

558
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:09,663
"She was an electric white

559
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,266
"noon-shadow moon

560
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,469
"casting cold light like water

561
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,471
"over the flat earth
of my face.

562
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,541
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

563
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,409
"But the moon,

564
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,645
"the moon...

565
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,281
"I stared until I was nothing

566
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:29,616
"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.

567
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:34,121
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

568
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,894
Well, you memorized that,
right?

569
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,005
That was too much.
That was weird.

570
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,172
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

571
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,675
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

572
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,610
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

573
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,414
which felt tangible.

574
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,150
Like I'd touched somethin'.

575
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:08,355
You know,
I haven't written anything

576
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,791
-in a very long time.
-Why not?

577
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,092
I don't know.

578
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,827
Do I know?

579
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:16,597
Mm?

580
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,865
Uh...

581
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,567
I guess I got married.

582
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,869
Started teaching.

583
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:28,208
I don't have anything else
to say.

584
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,111
You're uninspired.

585
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,380
-You judging me?
-I am challenging you.

586
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,248
That's my job.

587
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,192
-Hi, Winnie.
-Oh, no.

588
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,231
-Hungee.
-I think she's hungry.

589
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:52,666
She just doesn't use
real words

590
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:53,800
because she's a child.

591
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,306
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

592
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:00,707
-I knew it.
-Please don't start.

593
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:02,309
-Don't.
-Your hair looks good.

594
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,310
-I will not go...
-I'm more concerned...

595
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,778
...gently into the good night.

596
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,146
-No, I know. You look fine.
-Like you have.

597
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,381
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

598
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,248
that you got two damn phones
on the table

599
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:09,349
like you're a rapper.

600
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,751
This one
is my professional phone.

601
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,419
And the other one...

602
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,754
-The other one...
-...is for selling drugs.

603
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,222
-The other one is personal.
-Oh, yeah?

604
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:16,223
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

605
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,994
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

606
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,695
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

607
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,331
I'm getting angry now.

608
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:26,134
-Well...
-Well, hi.

609
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,102
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

610
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,670
So, what is the holdup?

611
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,238
-A fuck-up...
-Bea. Come on.

612
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:33,206
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

613
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,077
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

614
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:38,245
-On me.
-Another Maker's.

615
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,981
Okay, you got it.

616
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:41,782
-Coach?
-Blue Moon.

617
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,517
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

618
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,585
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

619
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:47,989
Oh, you think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

620
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,589
Gets me
a better grade.

621
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:51,425
Doesn't it?

622
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,393
-That might be true, yeah.
-Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

623
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,996
I'm good, Winnie.

624
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:56,097
Designated driver.

625
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:57,497
-Oh.
-Oh, really?

626
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:58,699
-Unless you wanna do it.
-First I'm hearing of this.

627
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:02,003
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

628
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,705
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

629
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:05,907
Boring?

630
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,175
What? And let
my students make their grades

631
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,475
with scholastic merit?

632
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,810
Do you really think
I'm boring?

633
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,211
In a good way.

634
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,447
Like a nice pastoral.

635
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:15,348
I'll get those drinks for you.

636
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:17,051
Yeah. "Pastoral."

637
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:18,385
She just called you a field.

638
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:19,586
At best.

639
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,688
-She's cute.
-Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

640
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:22,889
And she can paint.

641
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:24,357
She's in my morning class.

642
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:26,994
Oh, is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

643
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:28,762
That's Cairo.

644
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,796
-Cairo?
-Yeah.

645
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,298
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

646
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:33,201
He sure did.

647
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,170
-Is she pretty?
-Is she pretty?

648
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,005
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

649
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:39,406
Damn. Even worse.

650
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,308
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

651
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:44,112
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

652
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,747
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

653
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,315
And it's rare as well

654
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,850
-to be so engaged and so...
-Hmm. I bet is is. Yes.

655
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,451
-So worshipped.
-So worthy.

656
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,320
-Wanna be like me.
-She, in earnest

657
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:56,057
uses words
like "vituperation."

658
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,191
Please.

659
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,725
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

660
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,428
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

661
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,663
Bea, she's extraordinary.

662
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,532
-Okay?
-But enjoy it while you can.

663
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,367
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

664
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,237
Rural education
not as romantic

665
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,470
as you thought it'd be, huh?

666
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,805
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

667
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,573
<i>Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

668
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,143
-That's on you, man.
-Just cool stories

669
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,543
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

670
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,346
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

671
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:20,781
-Oh, he's judging you.
-Yes, he is. I feel it.

672
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,250
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

673
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,550
Are too.

674
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,253
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

675
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:26,686
"without inspiring the pupil

676
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:29,823
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

677
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,758
-Horace Mann.
-Ten points to Slytherin.

678
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:32,826
That's so rich.

679
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,361
I wanted to be a teacher.

680
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,428
You fell back on it.

681
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,265
And by the way,
I love teaching.

682
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,233
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

683
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,867
-Hey, than what?
-Writing.

684
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:43,104
-Goddamn, Beatrice.
-What does that mean?

685
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,504
You don't have kids.

686
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,372
-You don't have kids.
-You don't have

687
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:46,974
brain damage, right?

688
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,775
So, um, you stopped writing

689
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:50,777
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

690
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,914
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

691
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:54,648
I'm a writer.

692
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,250
You haven't put pen to page

693
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:58,085
since your stories got panned.

694
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,921
You're not a writer.

695
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:01,022
Hmm.

696
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,623
Well, okay.

697
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,325
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

698
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,961
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

699
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:08,095
It's that you don't.

700
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:11,232
You chose to be a teacher.

701
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,400
Why would I see you
as anything else?

702
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,971
'Cause you married a writer.

703
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,438
I did.

704
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:19,840
Didn't I?

705
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:33,955
<i>Why am I here?</i>

706
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,658
<i>It's not for the poetry,</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

707
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,598
<i>It's for the thrill</i>
<i>of something</i>

708
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,101
<i>that I've managed to go</i>
<i>my whole life without knowing.</i>

709
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,506
<i>An ache of anticipation</i>
<i>that you'll be here.</i>

710
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,014
<i>And it will mean something</i>
<i>that you are.</i>

711
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:04,885
<i>Be here.</i>

712
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,620
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

713
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,424
"Stay, illusion.

714
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,061
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

715
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,299
-Hi.
-Hi.

716
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,001
-Can I sit?
-Of course.

717
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,306
What's that you got there?

718
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:28,276
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

719
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,077
Said the barrister's daughter.

720
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:32,113
Do you know
all these people?

721
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:33,413
Uh, most of them.

722
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,615
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

723
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:38,019
Like group therapy?

724
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,955
Yeah, exactly that.

725
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,991
-Who's that fellow?
-That's Elliot.

726
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:45,725
Three-time Ostrander winner.

727
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,594
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

728
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,397
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

729
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:50,697
Hmm.

730
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:53,566
"It is my intention
to escape you

731
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,536
"and leave you far behind...

732
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:00,640
"...bereft of me and aching.

733
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,911
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

734
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:07,081
"Not quite heartache.

735
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,683
"Not quite homesick.

736
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:12,153
"Me-shaped and filled

737
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,188
"with the remnants of stars.

738
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:18,658
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

739
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,162
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

740
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:25,166
"The hideous pulse,

741
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,600
"the shouting blood,

742
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:31,138
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

743
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,273
"with wanting

744
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:36,643
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

745
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,648
"And yet
some part of me stays.

746
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:43,583
"Some bit,

747
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,585
"some parcel,

748
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,990
"some ash left behind.

749
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,793
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

750
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,932
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

751
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,636
"But they are not me.

752
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,807
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

753
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,215
"I will never fit there
again."

754
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:24,891
What?

755
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:27,861
I can see.

756
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:29,930
It was really something.

757
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,532
Hot dog.

758
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,734
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

759
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,803
Yes, I did.

760
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,872
Have more faith.

761
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,249
<i>What is the word?</i>

762
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,585
<i>It's not falling.</i>
<i>That's too stale.</i>

763
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,856
<i>It's more deliberate</i>
<i>than that.</i>

764
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:01,795
<i>It's recognition</i>
<i>of what we really are.</i>

765
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:06,067
<i>Ghosts.</i>

766
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,071
<i>You do see me.</i>

767
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:13,908
<i>And I see you.</i>

768
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:25,718
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

769
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:27,720
-Go inside.
-And miss Godot?

770
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,323
Gifts for the wallflowers.

771
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,890
-Oh. Okay.
-Mm. Hmm.

772
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,725
-Thank you.
-What's this?

773
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,062
-Coffee.
-No, no.

774
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:37,630
What's this? What is...
What's with the, uh, new look?

775
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,201
Thank you for this. It's,
uh... It's very generous.

776
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,136
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

777
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:43,938
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

778
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,973
-What flavor?
-Split fig.

779
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,109
Mm.

780
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,376
Excuse me.

781
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,810
-It's good.
-Come on, man.

782
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,146
You got
a little split fig in you?

783
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:54,448
-Not right now. Really?
-Caught in your throat?

784
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,550
-You know what you should do?
-What should I do?

785
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:57,884
You should make a logo
and sell these

786
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,619
to raise money for the team.

787
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:01,522
Don't laugh.

788
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:02,590
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

789
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:03,823
-Oh, yeah.
-He doesn't count.

790
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,593
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

791
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,627
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

792
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:08,728
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

793
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,030
She's really good
at that stuff.

794
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,966
-Really?
-Coach.

795
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,634
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

796
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,237
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

797
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,704
What's in it for you?

798
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,639
-What's in it for me?
-Mm-hmm.

799
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,510
Oh, well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

800
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,345
Connection. 5%.

801
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,848
-I'm the Biscuit Batter.
-No. Once more with pride.

802
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:32,153
-I'm the Biscuit Batter!
-Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

803
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,187
I'm the...

804
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:34,721
I'm gonna work on that.

805
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,190
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

806
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,492
-Y'all coming inside?
-You go ahead.

807
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,261
All right, suit yourself.

808
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,296
I'll suit myself. See you now.

809
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:43,730
Mm.

810
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:52,273
Hi.

811
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,942
Hi.

812
00:37:58,512 --> 00:37:59,746
You're sweet.

813
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:02,849
When it suits.

814
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:07,787
Please.

815
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,291
-Thank you.
-Mm.

816
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,481
What did he say
about the outfit?

817
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:36,317
He didn't have
to say anything.

818
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:39,220
Oh.

819
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,487
You ready? Can we go?

820
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:42,356
No. I need to stop
by his class.

821
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,824
Can I watch?

822
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,327
Oh, hi.

823
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:47,428
Hey.

824
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,728
How are you, kid?

825
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:52,499
Are you in a hurry?

826
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:54,235
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little, uh,

827
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:57,304
weekend vacation with my wife.

828
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:01,542
What do writers
do on vacation?

829
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,643
Uh, excuse me.

830
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,679
Um, well,
they pretend to write

831
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:07,314
someplace else, I guess.

832
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,718
Uh, can we talk about
the midterm?

833
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,086
Uh, sure, what's on your mind?

834
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:14,188
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

835
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:15,556
Okay. Who is it?

836
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,057
Henry Miller.

837
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:19,759
Provocative and,
uh...

838
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,229
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

839
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,864
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

840
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,133
You know, his decadence,

841
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,969
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

842
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,005
his, um,
destruction of convention.

843
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,340
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

844
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,946
-Do you not think I can do it?
-Look,

845
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:41,814
Miller is public enemy
number one

846
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:42,983
with the censors.

847
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,085
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

848
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:47,887
So?

849
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:52,526
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

850
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:58,232
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

851
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,235
Okay.

852
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,970
Okay, yes?

853
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,005
Okay, I trust you.

854
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,474
Write what you know,
little ghost.

855
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,448
Damn, I gotta go. Uh...

856
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:16,950
Do me a favor.

857
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,386
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

858
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:21,088
Take a recess.

859
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,657
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

860
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:25,693
Uh, listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

861
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,994
Bye, Winnie.

862
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,332
Don't do that.

863
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,068
Don't look at me like that.

864
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:38,972
Hmm...

865
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,108
"Oh..."

866
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,277
No, I never did that.

867
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,045
Stop.

868
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,315
Wait, Winnie, don't...

869
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:50,883
"Oh, Mr. Miller,

870
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:55,456
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

871
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:58,092
"and breakin' all the rules!"

872
00:40:58,158 --> 00:40:59,393
Okay, enough, enough.

873
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,095
You need to get off his desk.

874
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:02,796
I did not say it like that.

875
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:04,231
Oh, but you meant it
like that.

876
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,367
-No, I didn't.
-You're seducin' him,

877
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,268
you floozy.

878
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,404
We make a good double team.

879
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,473
Hi.

880
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,941
Am I interruptin'?

881
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,976
-We were just leavin'.
-Where's Jon?

882
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,745
Uh, where's Mr. Miller?

883
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:18,878
He left.

884
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:21,315
Shoot.
Oh, while I have you. Cairo.

885
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,350
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

886
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,284
And, uh, Winnie...

887
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:26,487
-I'd like your help too.
-With what?

888
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:27,688
Well, can you keep the secret?

889
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:28,756
Sure can.

890
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:29,857
I bake biscuits.

891
00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:31,091
He's gonna have
the baseball team

892
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,359

893
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:34,628
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

894
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,130
I think that's really cool.

895
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,365
-Really?
-I'd love to help.

896
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:39,867
Cool. All right.

897
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,135
I'll call you guys out
on your lunch period.

898
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,403
We can go over the specs.

899
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:44,304
Hey, um...

900
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:46,373
I think it'd be easier

901
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,709
if you just gave me
your phone.

902
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:51,378
I could text you the specs.

903
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:52,946
It'd be faster that way.

904
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,215
Okay.

905
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:56,583
Great.

906
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:00,087
Hey, can you call me?

907
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,823
Mm. Mm-hmm.

908
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,325
And now
you'll have Cairo's number.

909
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:06,960
Oh, good.

910
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,463
There is no reception
in here.

911
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,831
-Shit.
-Cairo, it's probably

912
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,399
just at the bottom
of your bag.

913
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,501
No, I just had it
a minute ago.

914
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,236
Well, it's Friday,

915
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,505

916
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,140

917
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,412

-My phone.
-My phone.

920
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:33,620
-Your phone.
-Your phone?

921
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:36,657
Your phone!

922
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,793
-Right. Sorry. Okay.
-Oh, okay. Okay.

923
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,795
-Well, that was my...
-Ah.

924
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,068
Baby, I'm gonna need
a few more minutes, all right?

925
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:51,238
Okay. Well, we were supposed
to leave 40 minutes ago.

926
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:52,673
I know.

927
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:55,209
If Amy did her fucking job...

928
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:56,743
...we could've left yesterday.

929
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,818
It's just not enough, Amy.

930
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:06,119
What the f...?

931
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:09,723
Yes, I'll hold.

-Hello?
<i>-Hi.</i>

933

<i>And whose phone</i>
<i>do I have?</i>

935
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:16,630
Cairo Sweet's.

936
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:18,765
Cairo. It's, uh...

937
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,702
It's Jon... It's Mr. Miller.

938
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:26,740
-Sticky fingers, Miller.
<i>-Uh...</i>

939
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:28,642
Uh, how are you?

940
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:30,010
I'm tethered to a landline.

941
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,778
<i>-Are you already gone?</i>
-Uh, well, should be.

942
00:43:31,845 --> 00:43:33,814
I don't give
a flying backwards fuck, Amy.

943
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:34,916
Just give 'em the first draft.

944
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:36,517
-Hang on.
-They'll think it's new.

945
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,185

I've, I've gotta drop

946

947
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,787
All right, take care of it.

948
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:42,189
Oh, get me some tampons

949
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:43,423
-Yeah.
-Organic ones,

950
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,691
-if you can find 'em.
-Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,527
Not you obviously, Amy. Fuck.

952
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:47,394
Get me a better deal,

953
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:48,729

you can plug my pussy.

958
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,241
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Okay.

959
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,410
Well, I'll drop it off
before we leave,

960
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:04,711

1076
00:52:58,546 --> 00:52:59,779
Good morning.

1077
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,354
Are you okay?

1078
00:53:11,058 --> 00:53:12,093
What's wrong?

1079
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:18,065
Your story.

1080
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,134
Oh.

1081
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,103
You didn't like it?

1082
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:26,840
You have to choose
another author.

1083
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,244
Why?

1084
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:32,879
This is inappropriate.

1085
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:35,648
"Inappropriate."

1086
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:36,951
What does that mean?

1087
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,652
Why did you write this?

1088
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,155
-You asked me to.
-Uh-huh.

1089
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:43,958
Okay.

1090
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:45,593
Why did you choose
that material?

1091
00:53:45,658 --> 00:53:47,495
You said,
"Write what you know."

1092
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,396
And this is what you know?

1093
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:51,031
This is...

1094
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:53,934
us.

1095
00:53:54,435 --> 00:53:55,469
No.

1096
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,271
This is... This is you.

1097
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:58,771
I don't...

1098
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:00,474
I don't understand this.

1099
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,243
Are you being serious?

1100
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,311
Okay. It's...

1101
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:07,314
It's about two like people
abnegating social convention.

1102
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,551
You know, it's commentary

1103
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:11,952
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

1104
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,221
that's super saturated
with pornography.

1105
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:17,424
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

1106
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:19,326
on young people's
expectations.

1107
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,829
It's about
inexorable attraction.

1108
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:26,367
It's layered.

1109
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,002
-This is pornography.
-Yes.

1110
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:30,870
So put it in your diary,
not on my fuckin' desk.

1111
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:34,008
Write a new story
with a new author.

1112
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:38,979
I'm not gonna indulge this.

1113
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,048
Are you talking about
the story or us?

1114
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,682
Both.

1115
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,155
You already have.
You inspired it.

1116
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,458
I can't accept it.

1117
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:55,062
But you can't or you won't?

1118
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,434
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

1119
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:01,535
-Hey. Hey.
-...and it looks like

1120
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:02,970
you're measurin'.

1121
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,507
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

1122
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:08,275
-and say what you mean.
-Rewrite it.

1123
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:09,343
Why?

1124
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,744
-You know why.
-Tell me.

1125
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,214
-Say it.
-If you don't rewrite this,

1126
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,648
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

1127
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:16,183
-Tell me why.
-I don't have to tell you

1128
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,284
a goddamn thing.

1129
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,357
It made you feel something
that scared you.

1130
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,792
-Don't put words in my mouth.
-Then say them yourself.

1131
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:28,162
Tell me what it made you feel.

1132
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,863
Incredibly foolish

1133
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:34,034
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

1134
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:38,305
What was I before you read it?

1135
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:50,184
A student.

1136
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,921
You built the world.

1137
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:58,492
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

1138
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,094
but in real life.

1139
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:04,064
You can't blur the lines

1140
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,466
and then expect me to see
a boundary

1141
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,533
when I suddenly cross it.

1142
00:56:10,803 --> 00:56:12,506
Let me be very, very clear...

1143
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,808
...with you.

1144
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:19,879
You're my student.

1145
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:22,216
And I'm your teacher.

1146
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:25,319
That's all.

1147
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:29,189
Any misconception of that
is something,

1148
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:31,824
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

1149
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,194
alone.

1150
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:09,829
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

1151
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,467
Yeah, I know what I said.

1152
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,269
You don't know anything
you say.

1153
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,843
-This is good.
-Mm-hmm.

1154
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:26,280
And you know it is.

1155
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:32,086
So, let's examine
the real issue.

1156
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:36,423
It's not my writing.

1157
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:40,527
It's yours.

1158
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,331
Good try.

1159
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,835
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

1160
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,103
What?

1161
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:51,405
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

1162
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:54,208
Right?

1163
00:57:58,278 --> 00:58:00,347
"Overreaching
without ambition."

1164
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:07,488
Do you know what that means?

1165
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,228
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

1166
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:19,299
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

1167
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,006
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

1168
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:29,543
are mediocre.

1169
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:35,949
You wanna fail me?

1170
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,420
I fucking dare you.

1171
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,291
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

1172
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:48,061
And you better know
what it means.

1173
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,433
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

1174
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:57,704
And if you're not very,
very careful

1175
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:03,444
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

1176
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,881
it will devour you
until you are as small

1177
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:09,249
as you pretend to be.

1178
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:14,521
And you will disappear.

1179
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,294
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

1180
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,329
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

1181
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,108
How disappointin' you must be

1182
00:59:35,175 --> 00:59:37,077
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

1183
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:46,653
No wonder you're here.

1184
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,772
<i>Heartbreak is</i>
<i>a slow-motion car crash</i>

1185
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,641
<i>set to Mozart.</i>

1186
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,444
<i>You know the one.</i> The Requiem.

1187
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,551
<i>It tastes like graveyard dirt.</i>

1188
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,691
<i>It smells</i>
<i>like burnin' flowers.</i>

1189
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:31,598
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

1190
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:07,267
How you doin', Professor?

1191
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,570
Had a bad day.

1192
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:24,217
-Oh, you want a drink?
-Thank you.

1193
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,225
What?
So, he was offended?

1194
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:34,528
He was affected.

1195
01:01:36,763 --> 01:01:37,864
Are you still into him?

1196
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:45,305
He's a pretender.

1197
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:50,377
You know, at least what

1198
01:01:50,444 --> 01:01:51,545
you see with Boris
is what you get.

1199
01:01:51,612 --> 01:01:54,381
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

1200
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,152
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

1201
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:00,687
and gas station sushi.

1202
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,659
Aren't you in love with him?

1203
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:10,430
Mm.

1204
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:16,136
What happened?

1205
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,510
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

1206
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,512
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

1207
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,648
Was it with her?

1208
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:29,716
Your acolyte?

1209
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:34,688
She drafted something

1210
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:38,291
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

1211
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:40,427
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

1212
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:42,195
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

1213
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:44,966
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

1214
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:46,566
not his subject matter.

1215
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:47,668
Oh.

1216
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:50,504
What's the subject matter?

1217
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,205
An English teacher
and a student

1218
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:56,144
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

1219
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,444
-and "cherry popping."
-Oh.

1220
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:59,312
Those words exactly.

1221
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:01,214
Show me right now.

1222
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,350
Don't...

1223
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:07,187
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

1224
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,792
You fuck Fillmore yet?

1225
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:16,396
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

1226
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,265
I tell you everything.

1227
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:26,606
<i>"For Jonathan.</i>

1228
01:03:26,673 --> 01:03:28,475
"Love, Cairo."

1229
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,880
Baby, it's a love letter.

1230
01:03:33,948 --> 01:03:35,582
She's got it bad.

1231
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,451
Tell me how she describes you.

1232
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:39,187
-You can read it right there.
-No.

1233
01:03:39,252 --> 01:03:41,254
You tell me.

1234
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:44,858
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

1235
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:47,894
And I want you
to do the thing.

1236
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:48,996
No. No.

1237
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:52,666
Tell me.

1238
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,271
Uh...

1239
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:00,240
-"Mr. Murphy...
-Oh.

1240
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:04,811
"...clever
and carelessly attractive...

"kept his thoughts to himself,
and his eyes at half-mast."

1242
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:12,285
Distract me.

1243
01:04:13,154 --> 01:04:15,522
What would the lady have?

1244
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,959
<i>"One might assume</i>

01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:24,898
<i>"vague institutional ennui."</i>

1247
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:26,299
Text Boris.

Are they?

1257
01:04:57,764 --> 01:05:00,067
Are all cunts equal?

1258
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:03,403
Or are some cunts...

1259
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,641
remarkable?

1260
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:10,310
Come on, you're, you're,
you're drunk.

1261
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:12,412
I'm indecent.

1262
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:19,921
Yeah, tell him

1263
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,022
you're drunk textin' him.

1264
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,557
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

1265
01:05:23,623 --> 01:05:25,525
and what
you might be doin' drunkenly.

1266
01:05:26,027 --> 01:05:27,061
Serious?

1267
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:29,429
Ask him what he's up to.

1268
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:36,670
Oh, we've got company.

1269
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:38,505
-They what?
-Hey, seriously.

1270
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:40,607
Stop leaving
this door unlocked.

1271
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:43,277
For your own safety, okay?

1272
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:44,544
-Mm-hmm.
-Hello.

1273
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:50,117
Get a room!

1274
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:51,451
What up, player?

1275
01:05:51,518 --> 01:05:53,386
-Slang? Get out.
-Fuck.

1276
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:55,388
Do you think he likes me?

1277
01:05:56,823 --> 01:05:59,559
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

1278
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:05,365
'Cause those are very
different things

1279
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:06,733
for girls who look like you.

1280
01:06:08,336 --> 01:06:09,937
I want both.

1281
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,382
You should tell him
you're with me.

1282
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:27,121
And that we're doing
what all girls do

1283
01:06:27,188 --> 01:06:28,222
when they're alone at night.

1284
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:31,025
Who is she?

1285
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:32,159
Not telling.

1286
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:41,468
"We are measuring
the depths of our sexuality

1287
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:44,771
"within the safe confines
of our friendship."

1288
01:06:45,739 --> 01:06:47,474
Why are you so mean?

1289
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,675
-Goddamn.
-Can I help it

1290
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:50,244
if every girl
you've ever dated

1291
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:52,146
owned a pair
of five-inch Lucite heels

1292
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:53,381
and was named after
a character

1293
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:54,714
in <i>The Baby-Sitters Club?</i>

1294
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:55,950
-No, I can't.
-No. You can't.

1295
01:06:56,017 --> 01:06:58,152
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

1296
01:06:58,219 --> 01:06:59,552
Yeah, you bein' a snob.

1297
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,588
You and I know
Kristy was great.

1298
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:03,391
He hasn't said anything?

1299
01:07:08,762 --> 01:07:11,365
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."

1300
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:12,832
So...

1301
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:21,741
Take off your shirt.

1302
01:07:25,845 --> 01:07:27,148
What?

1303
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:29,516
-Why?
-We are gonna make out.

1304
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:31,818
For him, not for you.

1305
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:36,890
Well, it can be
a little for me.

1306
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:48,468
How is this?

1307
01:07:51,172 --> 01:07:52,239
Yeah, good.

1308
01:07:57,111 --> 01:07:58,145
Your turn.

1309
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:09,823
Here ya go.

1310
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,896
Be a little closer
when I take this photo.

1311
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:20,134
Not like that. What, are you
a fucking Dutch clock?

1312
01:08:20,201 --> 01:08:21,235
I meant like this.

1313
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,571
Close.

1314
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:38,986
Ready?

1315
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,256
Send it.

1316
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,074
Are you gonna text Mr. Miller?

1317
01:09:34,241 --> 01:09:36,077
<i>"All warfare is based</i>

1318
01:09:36,477 --> 01:09:37,844

1321
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:13,680
Mm-mm.

1322
01:10:18,352 --> 01:10:19,719
You got a title yet?

01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,022
<i>Lesser Expectations</i>

1324
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,828
I mean, I don't know.

1325
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:31,298
Hi, Joyce.

1326
01:10:31,365 --> 01:10:32,600
-Another beer?
-Mm.

1327
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:34,135
No, I should go.

1328
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:35,402
-I should get outta here.
-Oh, come on.

1329
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:36,736
-Don't be boring.
-No. No.

1330
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:40,374
I got 45 pop quizzes

1331
01:10:41,108 --> 01:10:42,076
to fail.

1332
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:43,944
And we haven't even gotten
to fractals yet.

1333
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:45,613
Goddamn hopeless youth
of America.

1334
01:10:45,678 --> 01:10:47,348
Well, you're the one
who wanted

1335
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:48,748
to make a difference,
remember?

1336
01:10:48,815 --> 01:10:50,650
Hey, fools rush in.

1337
01:10:50,717 --> 01:10:52,319
-Where's Jonathan?
-Tithing.

1338
01:10:52,386 --> 01:10:54,054
All right, well, look,
tell him I had to run.

1339
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:55,289
Bye, kiddo.

1340
01:10:55,356 --> 01:10:56,390
Bye.

1341
01:11:02,795 --> 01:11:04,064
Joyce got the story.

1342
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,734
What?

1343
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,704
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."

1344
01:11:12,805 --> 01:11:15,409
...written at
the top, so, you know...

1345
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:17,478
there's no mistakin'.

1346
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:19,313
And she'd like to speak
to me formally

1347
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,781
about the necessary paperwork.

1348
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,684
Paperwork for what?

1349
01:11:25,685 --> 01:11:27,221
An incident report.

1350
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:28,322
Uh...

1351
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,424
I think she did it.

1352
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:33,793
Who did what, huh?

1353
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:36,964
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

1354
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,469
It's a short story, Jonathan.

1355
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:47,141
It's not
<i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>

1356
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:48,409
Mm-hmm. I know.

1357
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:54,248
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...

1358
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:56,550
it's the implication.

1359
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:59,653
Why if she can convince them

1360
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,922
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...

1361
01:12:03,756 --> 01:12:05,492
Well, I could lose my job.

1362
01:12:09,796 --> 01:12:11,831
That's not all you could lose.

1363
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:26,213
Did somethin' happen
between you?

1364
01:12:28,382 --> 01:12:29,483
Nothin' I invited.

1365
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:35,256
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

1366
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,459
They're full
of emotional violence

1367
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:41,061
-and vituperation.
-Mm-hmm.

1368
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,232
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1369
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:35,082
Have you seen Cairo?

1370
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,353
-I haven't.
-I haven't seen her.

1371
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,887
And I just thought...

1372
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,025
-maybe you had.
-I haven't. No.

1373
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:52,066
-You don't text?
-She tell you we do?

1374
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:55,035
Well, you know...

1375
01:13:56,836 --> 01:14:00,941
Cairo says everything...

1376
01:14:04,345 --> 01:14:05,379
And nothing.

1377
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:14,421
I don't understand
what's happening.

1378
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:19,993
Don't you, Winnie?

1379
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,920
How did it start?
In your own words.

1380
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,822
We recognized each other.

1381
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:51,291
She's exceptionally talented.

1382
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:54,762
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.

1383
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,363
Did you exhibit favoritism?

1384
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,766
-Give special mentorship?
-Of course.

1385
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,899
He was excited to give me

1386
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,468
the midterm assignment
in advance.

1387
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:03,771
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

1388
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:04,972
It's 25%.

1389
01:15:05,038 --> 01:15:07,174
Enough to destroy my GPA.

1390
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:08,675
<i>You do know</i>
<i>that Henry Miller</i>

1391
01:15:08,742 --> 01:15:09,777
<i>is not an approved author</i>

1392
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,011
<i>for public school study,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1393
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:13,480
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.

1394
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:14,648
You know that.

1395
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:16,250
I wanted to help her
stand out.

1396
01:15:16,316 --> 01:15:19,019
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

1397
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:22,189
Have you read his work?

1398
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,824
How often have you
been together

1399
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:25,893
beyond the classroom?

1400
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:27,394
We would see each other
before school,

1401
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:31,365
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

1402
01:15:32,566 --> 01:15:33,834
And what would you do?

1403
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:35,302
We would talk about literature

1404
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:37,971
and things that
we cared about.

1405
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:40,707
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

1406
01:15:40,774 --> 01:15:44,812
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

1407
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:45,879
And that, well, that...

1408
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,581
That's how it started,
I guess.

1409
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:48,949
Not...

1410
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:51,852
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

1411
01:15:53,353 --> 01:15:55,589
Do you see each other
socially?

1412
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:56,990
Absolutely not.

1413
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:59,326
We went to
a poetry reading together.

1414
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,094
Would you consider
yourself friends?

1415
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:02,496
Without question.

1416
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:05,399
We are as close,

1417
01:16:05,466 --> 01:16:09,369
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

1418
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:10,939
Have you ever been
alone together

1419
01:16:11,004 --> 01:16:12,206
outside of school?

1420
01:16:12,272 --> 01:16:13,942
Only a couple of times.

1421
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:16,009
Y... Yes, sort of.

1422
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:19,680
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone

1423
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:22,917
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,

1424
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:27,421
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

1425
01:16:27,488 --> 01:16:28,522
to Nashville.

1426
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:29,924
We didn't actually go,

1427
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:33,427
but, you know,
we were going to go.

1428
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:36,363
He came to my house.

1429
01:16:37,164 --> 01:16:38,398
Were you alone?

1430
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:43,036
Yes.

1431
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:45,372
My parents were out of town.

1432
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,740
What happened?

1433
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:50,210
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

1434
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:56,016
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

1435
01:16:57,751 --> 01:16:58,886
I returned her phone.

1436
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:00,554
Did you go inside the house?

1437
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:06,426
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

1438
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:08,595
When she sent the story,

1439
01:17:08,662 --> 01:17:11,131
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

1440
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,209
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

1441
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:24,177
uh,

1442
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:26,747
to defend my position here.

1443
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,417
'Cause there isn't.

1444
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:41,662
Jonathan...

1445
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,098
are you in love with her?

1446
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:50,637
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

1447
01:17:50,704 --> 01:17:52,739
It's not about my feelings.

1448
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:56,610
It's what she implies.

1449
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:58,412
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

1450
01:17:58,478 --> 01:18:00,847
-Oh, fuck me.
-...while you're sittin' there

1451
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:02,249
swiping through pictures

1452
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,817
-of naked students.
-Oh, he's so smart, everybody.

1453
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:04,953
That's why I deleted it.

1454
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:06,020
You deleted it.

1455
01:18:06,086 --> 01:18:07,454
-Oh, good.
-No. No.

1456
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:09,222
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

1457
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:11,358
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

1458
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:13,061
-Come on. Jesus.
-Oh, I'm shakin'

1459
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:14,361
in my fuckin' boots.

1460
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:15,796
You know the difference
between you and me?

1461
01:18:16,931 --> 01:18:19,566
You cannot identify the line.

1462
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:21,835
So, you cross it.

1463
01:18:22,502 --> 01:18:23,537
Right.

1464
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:25,505
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

1465
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,108
defensive.

1466
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:30,243
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

1467
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,311
You can't be serious.

1468
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,213
-Like you?
-Yes.

1469
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,049
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

1470
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:36,550
-Mm.
-I don't cross it.

1471
01:18:36,617 --> 01:18:38,752
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

1472
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:43,423
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

1473
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,959
You don't know... Oh, man,

1474
01:18:45,026 --> 01:18:46,727
you think
you're my collateral damage?

1475
01:18:48,629 --> 01:18:51,565
-All right, man. Just go, man.
-All right. No, no.

1476
01:18:51,632 --> 01:18:53,734
-Yeah, all right. I will.
-All right, yeah.

1477
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,769
-Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
-Thanks for your help.

1478
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:57,237
Appreciate that.

1479
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:13,186
I've been suspended.

1480
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:19,060
Did you fuck her?

1481
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:21,029
No.

1482
01:19:21,095 --> 01:19:22,930
Then what happened?

1483
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:26,400
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

1484
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,302
She handed in the story,

1485
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:31,304
which I obviously
could not accept.

1486
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:33,306
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

1487
01:19:33,373 --> 01:19:35,208
-That's how I understand it.
-Hm.

1488
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:36,476
So you flirted with her,

1489
01:19:36,543 --> 01:19:37,678
-and then, you rejected her.
-No,

1490
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:38,946
-it wasn't flirting.
-What was it then?

1491
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:40,514
It was affection!

1492
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:44,651
Well, are you
attracted to her?

1493
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,323
I'll tell you.

1494
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:54,996
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

1495
01:19:55,063 --> 01:19:56,530
who read your little book,

1496
01:19:56,596 --> 01:19:59,033
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

1497
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,802
You fucking fell for it.

1498
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:03,837
Finally. Finally!

1499
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:07,207
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

1500
01:20:07,274 --> 01:20:09,110
And you can't help
but get hard for it

1501
01:20:09,177 --> 01:20:10,444
because, what, now suddenly

1502
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,146
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

1503
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,246
Yes!

1504
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:16,383
She made me feel
worth something.

1505
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,751
What does that tell you?

1506
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:23,423
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

1507
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,960
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

1508
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:27,794
-Fuck you.
-Oh, be my guest.

1509
01:20:27,861 --> 01:20:29,997
Stop.

1510
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:31,832
-Did you?
-No, I didn't fuck her.

1511
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:33,000
Why do you look so guilty?

1512
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:34,135
I haven't done anything wrong.

1513
01:20:34,202 --> 01:20:37,504
Oh, didn't you?

1514
01:20:41,374 --> 01:20:43,510
God, I'm in hell.

1515
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:46,180
Well, make yourself at home.

1516
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:47,982
Why are you so punishing?

1517
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:49,583
You wanted her.

1518
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:51,551
I can read it all
in your face.

1519
01:20:51,618 --> 01:20:53,054
How can you see anything
in this state,

1520
01:20:53,121 --> 01:20:54,755
you fuckin' alcoholic?

1521
01:20:56,423 --> 01:20:58,960
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

1522
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:01,895
You are a cunt.

1523
01:21:01,963 --> 01:21:03,563
And you're a liar.

1524
01:21:03,998 --> 01:21:05,465
Liar!

1525
01:21:06,733 --> 01:21:09,436
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

1526
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:12,039
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

1527
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:15,209
like some middling
American hero.

1528
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:17,544
But, Jon, baby...

1529
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:20,714
you're the villain.

1530
01:21:25,318 --> 01:21:27,721
But you can't even see that,
can you?

1531
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,371
Don't you worry for me at all?

1532
01:21:45,839 --> 01:21:47,574
What would I possibly
worry about

1533
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:48,943
other than dying of boredom

1534
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:51,711
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

1535
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:55,549
You...

1536
01:21:56,284 --> 01:21:57,517
are...

1537
01:21:58,986 --> 01:22:00,021
vile.

1538
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,428
Why don't you write about it?

1539
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:36,790
Spit it out, Winnie.

1540
01:22:38,226 --> 01:22:39,593
What are you doing?

1541
01:22:41,262 --> 01:22:42,964
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

1542
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,499
Is that all?

1543
01:22:46,566 --> 01:22:48,035
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

1544
01:22:49,402 --> 01:22:51,438
if you wish to be
very literal.

1545
01:22:51,504 --> 01:22:53,773
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

1546
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:06,620
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

1547
01:23:06,686 --> 01:23:08,990
-Why?
-He underestimated me.

1548
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:11,524
I overestimated him.

1549
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:13,493
Are you okay?

1550
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,895
I'm inspired.

1551
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:18,798
-That's not funny.
-It is.

1552
01:23:19,432 --> 01:23:20,767
A little.

1553
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,837
-Please don't do this.
-Why?

1554
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,774
You're gonna ruin his life.

1555
01:23:28,309 --> 01:23:29,576
And for what?

1556
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:35,448
To avenge your rejection?

1557
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:39,153
To punish him?

1558
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:43,490
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

1559
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:45,458
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

1560
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,494
Yes.

1561
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:52,499
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

1562
01:23:56,237 --> 01:23:57,771
I'll testify against you.

1563
01:23:57,837 --> 01:23:58,872
No, you won't.

1564
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,909
Excuse me?

1565
01:24:01,976 --> 01:24:04,644
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

1566
01:24:05,913 --> 01:24:07,881
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

1567
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:09,716
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

1568
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:14,854
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.

1569
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:20,493
Oh, hey,
maybe we can double team.

1570
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:22,762
You played me.

1571
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:24,564
You knew what we were doing.

1572
01:24:25,132 --> 01:24:26,300
This is not what I meant.

1573
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:27,634
Isn't it, though?

1574
01:24:32,974 --> 01:24:35,642
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?

1575
01:24:35,709 --> 01:24:38,245
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.

1576
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,115
You're right.

1577
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:47,821
This is, to date,

1578
01:24:50,358 --> 01:24:51,858
my greatest achievement.

1579
01:25:08,175 --> 01:25:09,210
"In the end,

1580
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:13,713
