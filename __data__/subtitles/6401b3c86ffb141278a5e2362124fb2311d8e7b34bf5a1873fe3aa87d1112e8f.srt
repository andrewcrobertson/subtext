1
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,109
What's your
name again?

2
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,402
Chrissie.

3
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,321
Where are we going?

4
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,489
Swimming.

5
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,578
Slow up. Slow down.

6
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm not drunk!
Slow down!

7
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,669
Wait. I'm coming.

8
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,463
I'm coming.

9
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,508
I'm definitely coming.

10
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,676
Whoa.

11
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,302
Hold on. Whoa!

12
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,271
I can swim.

13
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,817
I just can't walk
or undress myself.

14
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,880
Come on in the water!

15
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,799
Take it easy.

16
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh, God, help!

17
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,055
Please help me!

18
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,183
I'm coming.

19
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,770
It hurts!

20
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,518
...<i>local</i>
<i>fishing reported good.</i>

21
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,686
<i>Amity Boat Rental Yard's</i>
<i>opening early</i>

22
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,855
<i>to prepare for</i>
<i>the annual seasonal rush.</i>

23
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,607
<i>This is WISS...</i>

24
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,906
How come the sun
didn't use to shine
in here?

25
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:28,287
We bought
the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

26
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,669
Somebody feed the dogs.

27
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,962
Right.

28
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,343
Do you see the kids?

29
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,434
They must be
in the back yard.

30
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,520
In Amity you say "yard."

31
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,984
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far"
from the "car."

32
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,029
How's that?

33
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,281
Like you're
from New York.

34
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,452
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.

35
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,704
You were playing
on those swings,
weren't you?

36
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,039
Those swings
are dangerous.

37
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,708
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.

38
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,502
I think you're
going to live.

39
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,213
It's not the prettiest
thing I've ever seen.
Hello.

40
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,090
Yes.
Can I go swimming?

41
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,467
Yeah, but let me clean
this thing off first.

42
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,721
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up,
or what?

43
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,182
Oh, no.

44
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,186
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about

45
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,565
15, 20 minutes.
All right?

46
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,150
Dry you off.
Okay.

47
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,902
Go on,
get a Band-Aid.

48
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,571
Got to go.
Missing person.

49
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,866
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

50
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,913
Listen, Chief...

51
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,706
be careful, will you?

52
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,832
In this town?

53
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,500
Hi, Dad.

54
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,377
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.

55
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,129
I want my cup back!

56
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,422
You'll get it.

57
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,926
Wave goodbye. Bye.

58
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,416
Nobody saw her
go into the water?

59
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,962
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

60
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,172
You mean,
she ran out on you?

61
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,382
No, sir.

62
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,552
She must've drowned.

63
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,722
Look, I reported it
to you, didn't I?

64
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,932
You live here?

65
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,100
No. Hartford.

66
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,019
I go to Trinity.
My folks live
in Greenwich.

67
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,354
Your folks were
born here, right?

68
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,897
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

69
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,983
They moved off
when my dad retired.

70
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,067
You an Islander?

71
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,235
No. New York City.

72
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,862
You here for the summer?
Come on.

73
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,752
Hold it.

74
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,766
Oh, Jesus.

75
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,587
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

76
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,924
Chief, what have
you got on?

77
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,926
If this new filing system
is to work,

78
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,928
you must keep
outdated stuff
off my desk.

79
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:15,014
Just the pending,
all right?
Yes, Chief.

80
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,850
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.

81
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,811
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been

82
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,314
karate-ing
the picket fences.

83
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:28,027
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.

84
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,875
The Fire Chief
wants you to go over
the Fourth of July...

85
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,169
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities

86
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,421
that the city fathers
are planning for today.

87
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,881
Right away.
Hendricks!

88
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,175
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

89
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,510
We never had any.
No?

90
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,013
There's a dead truck
with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

91
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,684
Just have him
fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

92
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,835
Look what
the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...

93
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,628
Glasses?
Yeah, glasses.

94
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,590
I'll call you later
in the afternoon.
I promise.

95
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,515
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.

96
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,976
The summer ginks
come down here in June.

97
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,937
You haven't got
one thing on here
I ordered.

98
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:49,275
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger,
no beach balls.

99
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,277
If I can't get service...

100
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,995
Chief, Polly sent me
to tell you

101
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,080
that there's a bunch
of Boy Scouts
out in Avril Bay

102
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,124
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.

103
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,668
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

104
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,461
Okay. Come on,
get out of there.

105
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,088
Take this stuff
back to the office

106
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,715
and get to work
on those signs.

107
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,177
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

108
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,803
Let Polly
do the printing.

109
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,971
What's the matter
with my printing?

110
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,390
Let Polly
do the printing.

111
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,892
Chief Brody!

112
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,730
What have you got there?

113
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,315
Listen, we had
a shark attack

114
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,025
at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

115
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,735
Fatal. I have to
batten down the beach.

116
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,447
Albert,
come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

117
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,831
Charlie, take me out
to those kids, will you?

118
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,608
Martin, you're going
to shut down the beaches
on your own authority?

119
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,401
What other authority
do I need?

120
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,903
Technically, you need
a civic ordinance

121
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,488
or a resolution
by a board of...

122
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,989
That's just going
by the book.

123
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,407
We're really
a little anxious

124
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,244
that you're rushing into
something serious here.

125
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,371
This is your first
summer, you know.

126
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,164
What does that mean?

127
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,210
I'm only trying
to say that Amity
is a summer town.

128
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,837
We need summer dollars.

129
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,464
If they can't
swim here

130
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,383
they'll be glad to
swim at the beaches

131
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,718
of Cape Cod,
the Hamptons,
Long Island.

132
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,137
That doesn't mean
we serve them
a smorgasbord.

133
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,641
But we've never had
that kind of trouble
in these waters.

134
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,559
What else could've
done that to that girl?

135
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,727
A boat propeller?

136
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,064
I think possibly,
yes, a boating accident.

137
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,732
That's not
what you told me
on the phone.

138
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,276
I was wrong.

139
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,278
We'll have to
amend our reports.

140
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
And you'll
stand by that?

141
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,072
I'll stand by that.

142
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:04,868
Martin, a summer girl
goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

143
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,496
She tires,
fishing boat
comes along...

144
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,706
It's happened before.

145
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,250
I don't think
you appreciate
the gut reaction

146
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,501
people have
to these things.

147
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,546
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting
to what I was told.

148
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,173
Martin,
it's all psychological.

149
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,553
You yell, "Barracuda!"
and everybody says,
"Huh? What?"

150
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,390
You yell, "Shark!"...

151
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,686
we've got
a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

152
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,898
Okay. You can
take us back now.

153
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,535
Here's mommy, here.

154
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,331
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

155
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,416
Let me see
your fingers.

156
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,419
Alex Kintner,
they're beginning
to prune.

157
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,421
Just let me go out
a little longer.

158
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,672
Just 10 more minutes.

159
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,882
Thanks.

160
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,594
There are no Islanders.

161
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,845
None of them are
from the island.

162
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,971
It's just a big bother.

163
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,014
They're bringing in...

164
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,349
All I want to know...

165
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,476
I just want to
know one simple thing.

166
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,102
When do I get to
become an Islander?

167
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,313
Ellen, never.

168
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,857
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander.
That's it.

169
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,309
<i>Nantucket Ferries...</i>

170
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,895
<i>...to Amity,</i>
<i>Martha's Vineyard</i>
<i>and Nantucket islands.</i>

171
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,399
<i>Monday to Thursday,</i>
<i>8:40, 1:15, 5:45</i>
<i>and 6:00 p.m.</i>

172
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,151
<i>Starting July 1,</i>
<i>8:30 p.m....</i>

173
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,240
Come back here.

174
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,793
- But don't
bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.

175
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,756
Martin, I know you got
a lot of problems downtown

176
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,926
but I've got
problems at the house
I wish you'd take care of.

177
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,594
One, I've got
some cats parking

178
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,762
in front of the house,
I can't get...

179
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,475
And that garbage truck
next to the office,
that's terrible.

180
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,187
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing
you can take care of.

181
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,315
You've done it before.
Come here a minute,
please.

182
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,112
Are you okay?

183
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,281
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,367
Listen, if the kids
going in the water
is worrying you

185
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,495
they can play out here
on the beach.

186
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,539
It's all right.
Let them go.

187
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,341
It's cold.

188
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,304
We know all
about you, Chief.

189
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,514
You don't go in the water
at all, do you?

190
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,058
That's some
bad hat, Harry.

191
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,858
Chief Brody,
you are uptight.

192
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,237
Come on. That's it.

193
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,332
<i>Oh, do you know</i>
<i>the muffin man</i>

194
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,666
<i>The muffin man</i>

195
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,169
Tippet!

196
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,034
Did you see that?

197
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,710
Blood!

198
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,050
Everybody out!

199
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,805
Get them out!

200
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,480
Michael,
get out of the water!

201
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,494
Alex?

202
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,266
We don't even know
if there's a shark
around here.

203
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,019
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.

204
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,479
I have to talk
to Mrs. Kintner.

205
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,273
Because this is
turning into a contest.

206
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:30,152
It's not just the <i>Gazette.</i>
She's advertising in
out-of-town papers.

207
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,364
I suggest we move back
to council chambers where
we'll have more room.

208
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,450
I'm responsible for
public safety here.

209
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,536
Then go out tomorrow
and see that
no one gets hurt.

210
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,372
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep
as I can.

211
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,208
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

212
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,211
Right in here, please.

213
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,506
Move on in, please.

214
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,648
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?

215
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:11,860
I have a point of view
and I think it speaks for
many of the people here.

216
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,492
Not only me,
because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

217
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,369
Let's have
some order.

218
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,373
Let's have order,
please.

219
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,084
Any special questions?

220
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,672
Is that $3,000
bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

221
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,466
I don't think
that's funny.

222
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,760
I don't think
that's funny at all.

223
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,261
All right.

224
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,683
That's private business
between you fishermen
and Mrs. Kintner.

225
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,229
Martin,
would you please...

226
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,356
Chief Brody.

227
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,528
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

228
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,363
What about
the beaches, Chief?

229
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,534
We're going to put on
the extra summer deputies
as soon as possible.

230
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,954
And then we're going to try
and use shark spotters
on the beach.

231
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,415
Are you going to
close the beaches?

232
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,294
Yes, we are.

233
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,049
We also plan to
bring in experts

234
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,635
from the Oceanographic
Institute on the mainland.

235
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,596
Only 24 hours.

236
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,764
I didn't agree to that.

237
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,393
Only 24 hours.

238
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,771
Twenty-four hours
is like three weeks!

239
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,965
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.

240
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,926
I'll catch this bird
for you.

241
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,345
It ain't going to
be easy. Bad fish.

242
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,681
Not like going
down to the pond

243
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,184
and chasing bluegills
or tommy cods.

244
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,146
This shark,
swallow you whole.

245
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:16,693
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.

246
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,112
And we got to
do it quick.

247
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,530
Got to bring back
the tourists

248
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,700
that'll put
all your businesses
on a paying basis.

249
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,787
But it's not
going to be pleasant.

250
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,040
I value my neck
a lot more than
$3,000, Chief.

251
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:35,378
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and
kill him for $10,000.

252
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,006
You got to
make up your minds.

253
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,550
Gonna stay alive
and ante up,

254
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:44,221
gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare
the whole winter.

255
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,058
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

256
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,061
There's too many captains
on this island.

257
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,897
$10,000 for me,
by myself.

258
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:59,402
For that,
you get the head, the tail,
the whole damn thing.

259
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,742
Thank you very much,
Mr. Quint.

260
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,913
We'll take it
under advisement.

261
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,460
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

262
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,548
ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,500
Oh, God, you scared me.

264
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,627
Oh.
Oh.

265
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:03,049
You know, Ellen,
people don't even know
how old sharks are.

266
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,303
I mean, if they live
2,000, 3,000 years...
They don't know.

267
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,597
Enough.

268
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,473
You're not going to
even be able to go
to sleep tonight.

269
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,809
Here. Come on.

270
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,312
Thanks.

271
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,065
Oh.

272
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,986
Oh.

273
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,323
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

274
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,657
Oh, yeah.

275
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,289
Mikey really
loves his present.

276
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,125
Where is he?

277
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,335
Sitting in it.

278
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,839
Good God.

279
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,970
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

280
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,183
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.

281
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,726
I'm helping Michael.

282
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,436
Get out of that boat!

283
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,189
Hi, Dad. Just a little
longer. Please?

284
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,774
It's his birthday.

285
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,858
I don't want him
on the ocean!

286
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,735
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.

287
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,195
He won't go
in the water.

288
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,699
I don't think he'll
go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

289
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,411
All right,
now don't say that.

290
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,748
I don't want that
to happen,
you know that.

291
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,126
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

292
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,380
the rules, before he
goes out on his own.

293
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,842
Michael,
did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

294
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,219
Now!

295
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,062
I'm tired.
Let's stop before
someone reports us.

296
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:44,025
Don't worry.
The Chief lives on the other
side of the island.

297
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,403
Am I coming in straight?

298
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,071
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.

299
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,164
We better
catch something,

300
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,417
this is my wife's
holiday roast.

301
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,210
Don't worry about it.

302
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,295
$3,000 buys
an awful lot of roast.

303
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,432
Come and get it.

304
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,979
The tide's
taking it right out.

305
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,275
Can't we go home?

306
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,171
He's taking it.

307
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,924
Go!

308
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,331
Charlie,
take my word for it,
don't look back!

309
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,041
Swim, Charlie!

310
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:11,172
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!

311
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,424
Come on, Charlie,
keep coming.
Keep swimming.

312
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,718
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.

313
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,013
I can't get up.

314
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,723
Give me your hand,
Charlie.

315
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,810
Help me!

316
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,979
Get your feet
out of the water!

317
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,077
Can we go home now?

318
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,840
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there trying to
catch their breath

319
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,176
and figure out how
to tell Charlie's wife

320
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,219
what happened to her
freezer full of meat.

321
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,972
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

322
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,725
Mrs. Kintner
must've put her ad
in <i>Field & Stream.</i>

323
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,102
Looks more like
<i>The National Enquirer.</i>

324
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,482
All right, hold it.
Hold everything.
I said, hold it!

325
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,740
Hello.

326
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,284
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

327
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,455
Say, I hope
you're not going out
with those nuts, are you?

328
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,586
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.

329
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,547
You have to move out
or he can't get out
at all.

330
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,926
Don't raise sail,
you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?

331
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,761
I got a paddle.
Scull it out of here.

332
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,388
Officer, wait a second.

333
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,893
How many guys
are you going to
put aboard that boat?

334
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,394
Whatever's safe,
right?

335
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,729
Yeah,
well that ain't safe.

336
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,814
Watch it,
that's dynamite.

337
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,358
What are you doing
with that?

338
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,484
Where are you going
with that?

339
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,319
I'm going on the boat.

340
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,155
Please, help me
get those guys out
of the boat, will you?

341
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,531
Sure.
Come on.

342
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,244
Gentlemen, the officer
asked me to tell you

343
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,578
that you're
overloading that boat!

344
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,081
Go on, get out of here.

345
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,791
You ain't going.
What do you care?

346
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,753
Can you tell me if there's
a good restaurant or hotel
on the island?

347
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,088
Yeah, you walk
straight ahead.

348
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,925
They're all
going to die.

349
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,595
Listen to me.
We've got some road
block signs outside.

350
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,847
You've got to get
somebody to help us.

351
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,809
Yeah,
get those road block signs
out on the highway.

352
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,187
Because we've got
more people down here
than we can handle.

353
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,440
What're you doing there?
These are your people.
Go talk to them.

354
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,442
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.

355
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,403
You see all
the license plates?

356
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,906
Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.

357
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,491
What happened to
the extra help...

358
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,993
It's not until
the Fourth of July.

359
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,577
Till then,
it's you and me.

360
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,955
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?

361
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,374
None of them are getting
out of the harbor alive.

362
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,959
That's what I'm saying.

363
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,128
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.

364
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,671
Everyone's having
a good time today.

365
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:57,880
Tell me about it.

366
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,173
Polly, I'll get
back to you.

367
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,926
Could you tell me
how I could find
Chief Brody?

368
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,052
Who are you?

369
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,097
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

370
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,726
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody.

371
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,853
Oh. I'm glad
to meet you.
Me, too.

372
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,730
I know you got
a lot on your hands.

373
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:14,939
What can we do
for you?

374
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,817
The best thing to do
is to see the remains

375
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,444
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

376
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,154
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me,
will you?

377
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,363
Sure.

378
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,868
Wait till we get
them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

379
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,328
There'll be some fun.

380
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,747
They'll wish
their fathers hadn't
met their mothers

381
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,582
when they start
digging the bottoms out

382
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,834
and slamming into
them rocks, boy.

383
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,004
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!

384
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,255
What's the matter
with you?

385
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,091
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

386
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,927
What are
these guys doing out here?

387
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,305
What are they
doing back there?

388
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,848
They're chumming
right now.

389
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,058
What the hell
is that?

390
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,642
They're tracking
the shark.

391
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,687
$3,000 divided
four ways is what?

392
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,358
Watch your starboard. Jesus!

393
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,199
Let's show Mr. Hooper
our accident.

394
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,455
"Victim identified
as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian."

395
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,831
And here's the way
we have it.

396
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,501
"Probable
boating accident."

397
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,050
The height and weight
of the victim

398
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,178
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

399
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,644
The torso has been
severed in mid-thorax.

400
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,229
There are no major
organs remaining.

401
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,897
May I have a glass
of water?

402
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,190
The right arm
has been severed

403
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,693
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss

404
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,821
in the upper musculature.

405
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,073
Thank you very much.

406
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,829
Partially
denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

407
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,956
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?

408
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,834
No. It was only
local jurisdiction.

409
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:04,632
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum

410
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,134
and portions of
the rib cage are intact.

411
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,845
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

412
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,265
This is what happens.

413
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,519
Indicates
the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>

414
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,523
possibly <i>longimanus</i>
or <i>Isurus glaucus.</i>

415
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,278
The enormous amount
of tissue loss prevents
any detailed analysis

416
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,865
however,
the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be considerably larger

417
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,451
than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

418
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,828
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

419
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,954
No.

420
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,706
Well, this is
not a boat accident.

421
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,585
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

422
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,962
And it wasn't
Jack the Ripper.

423
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,383
It was a shark.

424
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,528
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on
the state wire services.

425
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,655
See if Boston
will pick it up
and go national.

426
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,032
Call Dave Axelrod
in New York

427
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,867
and tell him
he owes me a favor.

428
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,828
This is the shot I want
with everybody
and the fish in it.

429
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,164
Guys, could we
please get organized?

430
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,500
I want to get
a picture for the paper.

431
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,709
Now, can we
just have the...

432
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,336
Ben Gardner get this?

433
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,087
No, we caught it.

434
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,175
That's swell.

435
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,593
It's a beauty.

436
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,055
Guys, please,
I need a picture
for the paper.

437
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,556
Clear out of the way,
please.

438
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,559
Just the guys
that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

439
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,062
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

440
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,856
Come on.
I need a picture
for the paper.

441
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,149
Could we get the sign,
please?

442
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,531
Kneel down,
just like in high school.

443
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,574
One row kneeling,
one row standing.

444
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,409
Come on,
just get out of the way.

445
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:57,787
Young fellow,
could you step out
of the picture?

446
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,622
Take your rake
with you.

447
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,792
We're ready.
Thank you.

448
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,002
Can you get that,
please.

449
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,295
How's that?

450
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,720
Larry, you won't
believe it.

451
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,222
What kind of
a shark is that?

452
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,473
I don't know.

453
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,141
I think it's a mako.

454
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,476
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

455
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,603
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

456
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,813
Tiger shark.

457
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,857
A what?

458
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,442
We can start
breathing again.

459
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:29,735
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

460
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,028
Oh, you bet he is.

461
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,738
What is this
bite radius crap?

462
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,198
That is a big mouth.

463
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,242
You stuff
your frigging head
in there, man,

464
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,328
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

465
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,835
All I'm saying is
that it may not be
the shark.

466
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,086
It's just a slight...

467
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,631
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn,
our mayor.

468
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,592
Matt's from
the Oceanographic Institute.

469
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,634
Nice to meet you.

470
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:55,344
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

471
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,724
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

472
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,018
Hammerheads,
white tips,
blues, makos.

473
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,104
And the chances
that these bozos
got the exact shark...

474
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,106
There are no other
sharks like this here.

475
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,108
It's 100-to-1.

476
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,821
I'm not saying that
this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

477
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,741
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare
for these waters.

478
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,368
But the fact is,
the bite radius
on this animal

479
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,912
is different
than the wounds
on the victim.

480
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,083
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

481
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,710
We all want to
be sure, okay?

482
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,420
What I want to do
is very simple.

483
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,298
The digestive system
of this animal
is very slow.

484
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,507
Let's cut it open.

485
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,509
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

486
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,053
is bound to
still be in there.

487
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,096
And then we'll be sure.

488
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,146
It may be the only way
to confirm it.

489
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,565
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

490
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,276
This is not
the time or the place

491
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,946
to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy
on a fish.

492
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,534
And I am not
going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

493
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:04,497
and see that
little Kintner boy
spill out all over the dock.

494
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,762
Chief Brody?

495
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,846
Yes?

496
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,648
I just found out

497
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,944
that a girl got
killed here last week.

498
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,988
And you knew it.

499
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,659
You knew there was
a shark out there.

500
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,621
You knew
it was dangerous.

501
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,624
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

502
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,297
You knew all those things,

503
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,053
but still my boy
is dead now.

504
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,310
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

505
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,568
My boy is dead.

506
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,325
I wanted you
to know that.

507
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,216
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.

508
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,428
No, she's not.

509
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,851
All right, fellows

510
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,895
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

511
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,897
before it stinks up
the whole island.

512
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:56,734
Harve, you and Carl
take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

513
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,099
Come here.

514
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,937
Give us a kiss.

515
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,146
Why?

516
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,484
Because I need it.

517
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,448
Get out of here.

518
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,701
Can I help you?

519
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,369
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?

520
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,996
I'm Matt Hooper.

521
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,539
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

522
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,124
Your husband's home?
Yes.

523
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,834
I'd really like
to talk to him.

524
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,502
Yes, so would I.

525
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,714
Come in.
Can I get you
some coffee?

526
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,007
No. Nothing, thank you.

527
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,758
Oh, wine. How nice.

528
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,362
How was your day?

529
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,453
Swell.

530
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,500
I got red and white.
I didn't know what
you'd be serving.

531
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,044
Oh, that's nice.

532
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,297
Is anyone eating this?

533
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,590
No.

534
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,517
My husband tells me
you're in sharks.

535
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,148
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it
quite put that way.

536
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,733
But yes, I am.

537
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,485
I love sharks.

538
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,611
You love sharks?

539
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,029
Yeah, I love them.

540
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,365
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

541
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,200
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

542
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,452
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

543
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,372
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

544
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,082
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

545
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,212
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

546
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,672
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

547
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:08,092
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

548
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,636
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

549
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,680
and actually saw
my boat being
taken apart.

550
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,349
Ever since then,
I have been
studying sharks

551
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:19,186
and that's why I know
that I'm going to go
to the Institute tomorrow

552
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,855
and tell them
that you still have
a shark problem here.

553
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,899
Why do you have
to tell them that?
Sorry.

554
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,609
I'm sorry,
I thought that...

555
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:26,986
You told me
the shark was caught.

556
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,655
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on
the Cape station.

557
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,324
They caught a shark,
not the shark.

558
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,411
Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

559
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,288
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

560
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,166
Which I wanted
to prove today by
cutting the shark open...

561
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,336
You may want to let
that breathe... Nothing.

562
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:04,273
You know, you'll be
the only rational man

563
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,066
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

564
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,318
Where are you going?

565
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,363
I am going
on the <i>Aurora.</i>

566
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,865
The <i>Aurora?</i>
What is that?

567
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,868
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

568
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,995
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

569
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,957
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

570
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:26,670
Martin sits in his car
when we go on the ferry
to the mainland.

571
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:28,964
I guess it's
a childhood thing.

572
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,716
There's a clinical name
for it, isn't there?

573
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,259
Drowning.

574
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,970
Is it true that most
people get attacked

575
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,306
by sharks in
three feet of water

576
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,016
about 10 feet
from the beach?

577
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,184
Yeah.

578
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:44,313
And that before
people started to swim
for recreation...

579
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,566
I mean, before sharks
knew what they were missing

580
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,944
that a lot
of these attacks
weren't reported?

581
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,279
That's right.

582
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,159
Now this shark
that swims alone

583
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,452
what's it called?
Rogue.

584
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,953
Rogue, yeah.

585
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,499
This guy,
he keeps swimming around

586
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,375
in a place where
the feeding is good

587
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,336
until the food
supply is gone, right?

588
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,921
That's called
territoriality.

589
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:12,257
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.

590
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,428
Then why don't we
have one more drink

591
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:19,014
and go down
and cut that shark open?

592
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:22,226
Martin?
Can you do that?

593
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:29,066
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

594
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,200
We start in
the alimentary canal

595
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,246
and open
the digestive tract.

596
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,152
Just like I thought.

597
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,236
What?

598
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,574
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.

599
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,164
He didn't eat a car,
did he?

600
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,373
No.

601
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,459
Tiger shark's
like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

602
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:32,504
Somebody probably
threw that in the river.

603
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,179
That's it.

604
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:45,100
I've got to
close the beach,
call the Mayor.

605
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,312
You got a bigger
problem than that,
Martin.

606
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,939
You still got a hell
of a fish out there

607
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,816
with a mouth
about this big.

608
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,489
How do we confirm that
by morning?

609
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:04,328
If he is a rogue,
and there's any truth
to territoriality at all

610
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,205
we got a good chance
of spotting him

611
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,998
between Cape Scott
and South Beach.

612
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,208
Where are you going?

613
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,709
To find him.
He's a night feeder.

614
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:11,835
On the water?

615
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,420
We're not gonna
find him on the land.

616
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,880
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

617
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,006
Yes, you are.

618
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,382
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

619
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,926
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.

620
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,730
I'm telling you,
the crime rate in
New York will kill you.

621
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,734
There's so many problems,
you never feel like you're
accomplishing anything.

622
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,820
Violence,
rip-offs, muggings.

623
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,072
The kids can't
leave the house.

624
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,282
You've got to
walk them to school.

625
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:45,369
But in Amity,
one man can
make a difference.

626
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:48,080
In 25 years,
there's never been

627
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,831
a shooting or a murder
in this town.

628
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,210
No kidding?
Want a pretzel?

629
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:55,170
Where are we?

630
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:58,257
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

631
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,594
Can you get
<i>The Late Show</i>
on this thing?

632
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,263
No, it's a closed
circuit TV system.

633
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:06,890
I have underwater
cameras fore-and-aft.

634
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:09,226
Who pays
for all this stuff?

635
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,727
The government?
The Institute?

636
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:12,854
This stuff costs
a lot of money.

637
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,775
I paid for this
mostly myself, actually.

638
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,652
You're kidding.
No.

639
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,988
You rich?
Yeah.

640
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,156
How much?

641
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,741
Personally,
or the whole family?

642
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:30,330
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you
to watch sharks?

643
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:34,209
Well, it doesn't
make sense for a guy

644
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,836
who hates the water to
live on an island either.

645
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,715
It's only an island
if you look at it
from the water.

646
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,758
That makes
a lot of sense.

647
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:49,474
What is
that thing doing?

648
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,894
Well, it's a fish finder.

649
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,063
It's probably just
a school of mackerel
or something,

650
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:57,149
all clumped together.

651
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,194
Wait a minute.

652
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,409
There's something else
out there.

653
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,827
What is it?

654
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,872
About 100 yards,
south-southwest.

655
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,283
That's Ben Gardner's boat.

656
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,618
You know him?

657
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,288
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

658
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,416
What happened?

659
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:04,758
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

660
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,927
Wait. Why don't
we just tow it all in?

661
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,638
We will. I just got
to check something out.

662
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,556
Hit the lights for me.

663
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,207
Let's tow it in.

664
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,460
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.

665
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,384
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

666
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,011
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

667
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,638
Don't touch any
of the equipment.

668
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,184
I'll be back
in two minutes.

669
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,732
This is a great white,
Larry. A big one.

670
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,693
Any shark expert
will tell you it's
a killer, a man-eater.

671
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:31,530
The situation is
that apparently
a great white shark

672
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,907
has staked a claim
in the waters
off Amity Island.

673
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,202
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food
in the water.

674
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,870
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

675
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,330
We've had
three incidents.

676
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,832
Two people
killed within a week.
It'll happen again.

677
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,001
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

678
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,045
Five people
were killed...
In one week.

679
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:48,380
Tell him
about the swimmers.

680
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,716
A shark is attracted
to the exact kind of
splashing and activity

681
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,636
that occurs
whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.

682
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,390
Opening the beaches on
the Fourth of July is like
ringing the dinner bell.

683
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,849
Look, Mr. Vaughn

684
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,644
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass

685
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,271
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.

686
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:05,855
It was the tooth
of a great white.

687
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:07,607
It was Gardner's boat,
all chewed up.

688
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:09,985
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

689
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,821
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

690
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,823
I didn't see it.
He dropped it
on the way in.

691
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,950
I had an accident.

692
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:20,287
And what did
you say the name
of this shark is?

693
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,541
It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias.</i>
It's a great white.

694
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,710
You don't
have the tooth?

695
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:30,797
Look, we depend on
the summer people
for our very lives...

696
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,967
You won't have a summer
unless you deal
with this problem!

697
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,220
We have to close the beach
and hire someone
to kill the shark!

698
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,097
We have to tell
the Coast Guard.

699
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,142
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

700
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,519
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

701
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,313
I don't think
either one of you

702
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,106
are familiar
with our problems!

703
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,400
I think that
I am familiar
with the fact

704
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,652
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

705
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:55,071
until it swims up and
bites you in the ass!

706
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:58,158
Wait a second!
There are two ways
to deal with this problem!

707
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:01,369
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

708
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:03,330
We have to
close the beaches.

709
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:04,539
Brody?

710
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,167
Sick vandalism.

711
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,338
That is
a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

712
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,549
I want those little
paint-happy bastards
caught

713
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,343
and hung up by
their Buster Browns.

714
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:19,471
That's it.
I won't waste my time
arguing with a man

715
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,764
who's lining up
to be a hot lunch.

716
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,140
I'm gonna see
you later, Brody.

717
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,309
Don't do this.
He's not...

718
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,779
What we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine,
an eating machine.

719
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,073
It's really
a miracle of evolution.

720
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:41,993
All this machine does
is swim and eat

721
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,746
and make little sharks.
And that's all.

722
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,749
Why don't you take
a long, close look
at this sign?

723
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,001
Those proportions
are correct.

724
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,336
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?

725
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:54,381
Get your name into
the <i>National Geographic.</i>

726
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,644
Larry, if we make
an effort today,

727
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,562
we might be able
to save August.

728
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:11,648
August?
For Christ's sake,

729
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,191
tomorrow's
the Fourth of July!

730
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,193
We will be open
for business.

731
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,195
It'll be one of the best
summers we've ever had.

732
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,239
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

733
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,533
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.

734
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,828
But those beaches
will be open
for this weekend.

735
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,811
I want to know
how many men
you're going to send.

736
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,105
There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane

737
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,733
when I have a great
white shark right here!

738
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,068
<i>We need men to</i>
<i>patrol the swimming area.</i>

739
00:53:57,152 --> 00:54:00,238
<i>We've got to have help.</i>
<i>Anybody with a gun</i>
<i>or a boat.</i>

740
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:14,961
Monday!

741
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,423
Is Chief Federal
Officer Feldman there?

742
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,592
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.

743
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,236
Operator, isn't there
a phone on the island?

744
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,529
Could you connect me,
please?

745
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:51,206
Come on, get him!

746
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,834
Careful on the beach.

747
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,214
Brody to Gotcha,
do you read me?

748
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,218
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

749
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:05,678
All right.
I'll get to them later.

750
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,351
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.

751
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,068
Brody to Daisy,
do you read me?

752
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,736
<i>Fascinating Rhythm,</i>
<i>do you read me?</i>

753
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,488
<i>Come in, Hooper.</i>
<i>What do you see?</i>

754
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,366
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

755
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:30,578
Amity Island has
long been known for
its clean air, clear water

756
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,872
and beautiful
white-sand beaches.

757
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,499
But in recent days

758
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,251
a cloud has appeared
on the horizon

759
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,253
of this beautiful
resort community.

760
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,755
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.

761
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,599
<i>That is very shocking</i>
<i>in the outfield.</i>

762
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:55,520
<i>Two balls, one strike,</i>
<i>runners at first and third...</i>

763
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,440
<i>Fly ball,</i>
<i>deep left field.</i>

764
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:03,111
<i>Jerry Christian goes back,</i>
<i>running back near the wall</i>

765
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,113
<i>and he takes it</i>
<i>for the out.</i>

766
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,161
Oh, hi, Larry.

767
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:13,746
Why aren't you
in the water?

768
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,834
I just put some
suntan lotion on,

769
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,794
and I'm trying
to absorb some...

770
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,629
Nobody's going in.

771
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:24,799
Please,
get in the water.

772
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,106
Mike, come here.

773
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:27,946
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor,
will you?

774
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,238
You and the other guys
take the boat

775
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,866
and put it
in the pond instead?

776
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,202
The pond is
for old ladies.

777
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,411
I know it's for
the old ladies,

778
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:37,789
but just do it
for the old man.

779
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:38,873
Please?

780
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:39,958
All right.

781
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,043
Thanks.

782
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,224
I've got Sean.

783
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,814
Michael! Wait!

784
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,735
Michael, I don't
like you no more.

785
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,539
I can stand Harry,
you know...

786
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:36,347
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?

787
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,765
Thought I saw
a shadow. Over.

788
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,519
<i>Hendricks,</i>
<i>this is Daisy here.</i>
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

789
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,273
False alarm.
Must be this glare.

790
00:58:56,534 --> 00:59:00,204
I'm pleased and happy
to repeat the news
that we have in fact

791
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,790
caught and killed
a large predator

792
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,792
that supposedly
injured some bathers.

793
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,627
As you see,
it's a beautiful day.

794
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:10,048
The beaches are open,
and people are
having a wonderful time.

795
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:12,717
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."

796
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:28,107
My God!

797
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,328
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!

798
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,998
<i>Get in there</i>
<i>as fast as you can!</i>

799
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,291
Red one.

800
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:48,336
<i>Martin, get them</i>
<i>the hell out</i>
<i>of the water.</i>

801
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,093
No whistles!

802
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,136
<i>Everybody, please,</i>
<i>get out of the water.</i>

803
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,679
<i>Everybody out of the water.</i>

804
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:03,184
<i>Don't push!</i>
<i>Everybody out of</i>
<i>the water, please.</i>

805
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,182
Come on!

806
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:05,496
<i>I want them out</i>
<i>of there, guys.</i>

807
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,499
<i>Give an answer, please.</i>
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

808
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,214
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.

809
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:19,594
Please, move back.
Give these people
some air.

810
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,929
Please, move back.

811
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,601
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids
with a cardboard fin.

812
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:30,396
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of
the water all right?

813
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:36,277
<i>Folks,</i>
<i>we had some practical joker</i>
<i>down there with a fake fin...</i>

814
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:39,071
Shark! A shark!

815
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,034
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!

816
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,285
Now what?

817
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,455
Michael's in the pond.

818
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:52,418
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something!
It's in the pond!

819
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,848
Hurry up,
get that done.

820
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:07,141
I can't do
a damn thing.

821
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,061
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle
that up there.

822
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,437
I'm doing it!

823
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:16,651
Hey, fellows,
haul in your sheet.
Make it fast.

824
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,241
You guys okay
over there?

825
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:24,825
In the pond!

826
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,995
Somebody get
a gun and shoot it!

827
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,538
Doesn't anybody
have a gun?

828
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,478
Is he dead?

829
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:36,564
No, he's not.
He's in shock.

830
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,847
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.

831
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,015
He can go home
in the morning.

832
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,433
Thank you.

833
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,102
How's my big kid?

834
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:16,187
I'm all right.

835
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,023
You going to
miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

836
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:20,358
Want me to bring
anything from home?

837
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:21,692
My cars.

838
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:22,777
What about ice cream?

839
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,861
Coffee.

840
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,958
Want to take him home?

841
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:41,796
Back to New York?

842
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:44,090
No. Home, here.

843
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,860
I'm sorry,
I'm truly sorry.

844
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,780
You got a pen, Larry?

845
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,199
Yeah, a pen, you know.

846
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,830
'Cause you're going
to do what you do best.

847
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,958
You're going to
sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

848
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,918
I don't know if
I can do that without...

849
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,963
I'm going to hire Quint
to kill the shark.

850
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:25,756
August?
What?

851
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,467
What are you
talking about?

852
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:30,970
Summer's over.
You're the mayor
of Shark City.

853
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,888
People think you
want the beaches open.

854
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:36,600
I was acting in
the town's best interest.

855
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,894
You were acting in
the town's best interest.

856
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:40,896
That's why you'll
do the right thing.

857
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,231
That's why you're
going to sign this,

858
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:45,359
and we'll pay that guy
what he wants.

859
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,907
My kids were on
that beach, too.

860
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,336
Sign it, Larry.

861
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,389
<i>$10,000.</i>

862
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,766
<i>$200 a day,</i>
<i>whether I catch him or not.</i>

863
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,893
<i>You've got it.</i>

864
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:22,396
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more
of this zoning crap.

865
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,898
You've got that.

866
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:27,735
One case
of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

867
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:31,071
Two cases.
And you get dinner
when you get back.

868
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,407
Champagne,
<i>pâte de foie gras,</i>

869
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,076
Iranian caviar,
and don't forget
the color TV.

870
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,709
Chief, you try this.
Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

871
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,252
Thanks.

872
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,714
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.

873
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:57,598
Excuse me, Chief.

874
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,949
Can't get a good man
these days, under 60.

875
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,451
All gone
at least 35 years.

876
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:18,953
Don't drink that.

877
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,287
Mr. Quint...

878
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:26,335
You're gonna
need an extra hand.

879
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,128
This is Matt Hooper.
I know him.

880
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:29,213
I've crewed
three Trans Pacs.

881
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:30,297
Transplants?

882
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:31,799
He's from
the Oceanographic Institute.

883
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,759
And an America's Cup trial.

884
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,386
Mr. Hooper,
I'm not talking

885
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:38,180
about pleasure boating
or day-sailing.

886
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:42,726
I'm talking about
working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.

887
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:46,105
I'm not talking
about hooking some poor
dogfish or sand shark.

888
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,274
I'm talking about
finding a great white.

889
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,651
Porkers?
Talking about porkers?

890
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:57,825
Just tie me
a sheepshank.

891
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:03,664
I haven't had to
pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

892
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:07,501
You didn't say how
short you wanted it.

893
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,088
How's that?

894
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,010
Give me your hands.

895
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,138
Dogfish?

896
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,600
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000
worth of fish in it.

897
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:25,728
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
and when he's finished
with that net

898
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,396
it looks like
a kiddies' scissors class

899
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,773
has cut it up
for a paper doll.

900
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,444
You got city hands,
Mr. Hooper.

901
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,446
You been
counting money
all your life.

902
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:39,033
I don't need this.
I don't need this
working-class-hero crap.

903
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:42,911
You're not going to do this
aboard the ship are you,
Mr. Quint?

904
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,540
Maybe I should
go alone.

905
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:51,545
It's my party.
It's my charter.

906
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:55,049
Yeah, it's your charter,
it's your party.
It's my vessel.

907
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:59,053
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot

908
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,388
and I'm captain.

909
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:06,894
I'll take him
for ballast, Chief.

910
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:10,814
You got him.

911
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:14,610
"Straight-jet,
killing lance.

912
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:19,657
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1,
handy billy, pliers, irons..."

913
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:23,619
Sample bottles,
dye marker, flares,
safety float

914
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,455
temperature gauge,
spear guns, SMG...

915
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,750
What are you?
Some kind of
half-assed astronaut?

916
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:41,762
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure,
all right?

917
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:48,519
Jesus H. Christ!

918
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,271
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted

919
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:54,024
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.

920
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:58,195
What have you got here?
A portable shower
or a monkey cage?

921
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,697
An anti-shark cage.

922
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,323
Anti-shark cage?

923
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,284
You go inside the cage?

924
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:11,125
Cage goes in the water?
You go in the water?
Shark's in the water.

925
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,627
Our shark.

926
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:20,175
<i>Farewell and adieu</i>
<i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

927
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:24,847
<i>Farewell and adieu,</i>
<i>you ladies of Spain</i>

928
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:30,811
<i>For we've received orders</i>
<i>for to sail back to Boston</i>

929
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:36,400
<i>And so nevermore</i>
<i>shall we see you again</i>

930
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:44,366
Did you take
your Dramamine?

931
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,492
Yes.

932
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:49,747
I put an extra
pair of glasses
in your black socks

933
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,540
and there's
the stuff for your nose,

934
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:54,251
the zinc oxide and
Blistex is in the kit.

935
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,003
Son of a bitch!

936
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,381
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.

937
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:01,341
Young girls just
ain't quite smart

938
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:02,885
like their
grandmothers were.

939
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,845
That's got to be Quint.

940
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:06,472
Colorful, isn't he?

941
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:07,848
He scares me.

942
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,394
Don't use
the fireplace in the den...

943
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,688
What am I going
to tell the kids?

944
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,860
Tell them
I'm going fishing.

945
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:28,202
Break it up,
will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!

946
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,706
Front, bow. Back, stern.

947
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:35,542
Better get it right,
squirt,
or I throw your ass

948
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:37,544
out the little round
window on the side!

949
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:40,756
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no
Boy Scout picnic.

950
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,550
See you got
your rubbers.

951
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:50,224
"Here lies
the body of Mary Lee
Died at the age of 103

952
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,310
"For 15 years
she kept her virginity

953
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,562
"Not a bad record
for this vicinity"

954
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:59,483
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!

955
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,821
If you see a shark,
Hooper, swallow!

956
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:11,745
Up periscope.
Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.

957
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,414
Damage control report.

958
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,584
Nor'easter coming,
bad news for
Madison Avenue.

959
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:20,045
I'm tired of that.

960
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,839
How's the missus, Chief?

961
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:26,468
If they don't
like you going out,
they'll love you coming in.

962
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:53,579
Keep that chum
line going, Chief.

963
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:56,456
We got five
good miles on it.

964
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:59,042
Who's driving
this boat?

965
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:00,627
Nobody. The tide.

966
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:04,548
One time, I caught
a 16-footer off Montauk.

967
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,049
Had to stick
two barrels in him.

968
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,969
Two to wear him down
and bring him up.

969
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,805
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

970
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:15,726
Radar, sonar,
electric toothbrushes.

971
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:20,147
Jesus H. Christ.

972
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:23,901
Chief, best drop
another chum marker.

973
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,467
Damn it, Martin!

974
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:50,886
This is compressed air.

975
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,512
What the hell kind
of a knot was that?

976
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,264
You pulled
the wrong one!

977
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:55,599
You screw around
with these tanks,

978
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,768
and they're going
to blow up.

979
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,895
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear

980
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,481
you've brought
out here, Mr. Hooper.

981
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,442
I don't know what
that bastard shark's
going to do with it.

982
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:06,985
Might eat it,
I suppose.

983
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:09,613
Seen one eat
a rocking chair one time.

984
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:17,079
Next time,
you just ask me which
line to pull, right?

985
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,337
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave

986
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:28,131
swims into the hole

987
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,803
comes out of the hole,
goes back into
the cave again.

988
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,639
It's not too good,
is it?

989
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:39,226
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.

990
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,186
Little brown eel...

991
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,516
I got it!

992
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:05,228
What?
Get behind me.

993
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:10,400
Hooper, reverse her!

994
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,236
Taking a hell
of a lot of line!

995
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,782
Chief, get the scoop
out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!

996
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,662
Hooper, reverse her!

997
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,753
Duck your head down.
We're swinging.
Get behind me again.

998
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:33,006
No more water.
I don't want you
to drown me.

999
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:37,052
Hooper,
you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!

1000
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:42,516
Hooper, neutral.

1001
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:51,691
Where'd he go now?

1002
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,277
He ain't fooling me.

1003
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:57,405
What's he yanking on now?

1004
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,866
Go on, try it.

1005
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,549
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart
or very dumb.

1006
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:23,723
Jesus...

1007
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,895
He's gone under.

1008
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:32,899
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone
under the boat.

1009
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,235
Yeah, it's too easy.

1010
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,613
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

1011
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:42,367
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!

1012
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:43,994
I don't think so.

1013
01:17:45,162 --> 01:17:47,122
Chief, put your gloves on.

1014
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:50,292
You put your gloves on,
both of you!

1015
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:55,005
Getting ready
to run out again.

1016
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,382
Quint, let it go.

1017
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,177
Maybe you're a big yahoo
in the lab,

1018
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,553
but out here
you're just supercargo!

1019
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:04,389
If you don't want
to backstroke home,
you get down here!

1020
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:07,392
You don't want
to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

1021
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:08,685
It's not a shark.

1022
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,812
The wire's showing.

1023
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:12,355
Unbuckle me.

1024
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,858
Get the other side.

1025
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,484
It's a tuna
or swordfish

1026
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,904
wasting our time.

1027
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:21,114
Take this rod.

1028
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:22,866
Hooper, give the Chief
a hand, will you?

1029
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:23,992
Right!

1030
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,118
Oh, shit!

1031
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:38,006
It may be a marlin
or a stingray

1032
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:40,842
but it's definitely
a game fish.

1033
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:53,980
Gaming fish?

1034
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,068
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

1035
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,861
Don't you tell me
my business again.

1036
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,154
You get back
on the bridge.

1037
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:03,782
Quint, that doesn't
prove a damn thing.

1038
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,992
It proves one thing,
Mr. Hooper.

1039
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:09,246
You wealthy
college boys don't have
the education enough

1040
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,081
to admit
if you're wrong.

1041
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:23,218
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?

1042
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,139
You lose one,
you rig one.

1043
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:35,313
Twelve minutes,
south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!

1044
01:19:35,397 --> 01:19:36,898
Aye-aye, sir!

1045
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:42,320
You see, what I do,
Chief, is I trick them
to the surface.

1046
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:44,447
And then
I jab at them.

1047
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:48,201
I'm not going
to haul them up
like a lot of catfish.

1048
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:50,120
Hooper, full throttle!

1049
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,872
I don't have to take
this abuse much longer.

1050
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,001
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.

1051
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:27,407
Start that chum line
again, will you?

1052
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:31,703
Let Hooper take a turn.

1053
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,705
Hooper drives
the boat, Chief.

1054
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,514
Stop playing
with yourself, Hooper.

1055
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:53,266
Slow ahead,
if you please.

1056
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,186
You heard him.
Slow ahead.

1057
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,196
Slow ahead.

1058
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:10,533
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and
chum some of this shit.

1059
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:30,595
You're going to
need a bigger boat.

1060
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,320
Shut off that engine.

1061
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:16,474
That's a 20-footer.

1062
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:17,767
Twenty-five.

1063
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,437
Three tons of him.

1064
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,111
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?

1065
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:29,612
Gotta get to work.

1066
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:32,449
How do we handle this?

1067
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,701
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.

1068
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:38,663
He's circling the boat.

1069
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:55,805
<i>This is Amity Point</i>
<i>Light Station to</i> Orca.

1070
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:57,056
<i>Come in,</i> Orca.

1071
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,058
<i>Orca</i>. Come in.

1072
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:01,060
<i>I have</i>
<i>Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>

1073
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,353
Put her on.

1074
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:04,939
Come on,
Martin! Move!

1075
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,399
I'm not
going out there!

1076
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:07,942
Beyond the edge
of the barrels.

1077
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:11,070
Go to the end
of the barrels,
further out.

1078
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,739
Further out!
Why?

1079
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,574
Go further out!
What for?

1080
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:16,409
Will you go to
the end of the pulpit?

1081
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:17,494
What?

1082
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:18,661
Will you go to
the end of the pulpit?

1083
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,664
I need something
in the foreground
to give it some scale!

1084
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:22,999
Foreground my ass!

1085
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,001
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.

1086
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,252
He just caught
some stripers.

1087
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:30,089
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet.
Over. Out.

1088
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:31,591
I'm not staying here!

1089
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:32,675
I'm begging you!

1090
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:36,054
God damn it!
Come here, darling.

1091
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:43,686
Chief,
I want you up
on the bridge,

1092
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,021
just take her forward,
steady.

1093
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:46,564
I've never steered
a boat in my life.

1094
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:49,400
Just watch my hand,
take her steady.

1095
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,363
Mr. Hooper, attach
the end of this line
to the first keg.

1096
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,449
I've got to
get a good shot at
that porker's head.

1097
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:14,259
He's coming.

1098
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:17,095
Hooper? Get clear
of the bow.

1099
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:23,226
Hurry up, will you?

1100
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:24,477
Your turn, Quint.

1101
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,688
Hooper,
where are you?

1102
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,652
Hurry it up now,
tie it on.

1103
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,406
He's coming
straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.

1104
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:37,991
Don't wait for me.

1105
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,496
Come on, Hooper,
hurry it up!
Tie it on!

1106
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,665
Now.

1107
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,712
Kill it!

1108
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:52,964
Now!

1109
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:55,967
Shoot!

1110
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,388
Time.

1111
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,433
What were you doing?
You knew I had

1112
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:05,935
to get a clean shot
right in the head.

1113
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:09,647
All right, let's see
how long that barrel takes
to bring him up.

1114
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:14,527
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!

1115
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:10,375
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?

1116
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:14,462
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here
until we find him again.

1117
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:17,215
We could radio in and
get a bigger boat...

1118
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:44,367
Don't you worry
about it, Chief.

1119
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:48,621
It won't be permanent.
You want to see
something permanent?

1120
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:58,798
You want to feel
something permanent?

1121
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:03,970
Just put your hand
underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

1122
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:07,223
Knocko Nolans,
St. Patty's Day, Boston.

1123
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:13,229
I got that beat.

1124
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:24,657
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through
my wet suit.

1125
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:27,744
Well, Hoop,
now, listen

1126
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:31,080
I don't know about that,
but I entered
an arm-wrestling contest

1127
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:33,916
in a bar
in San Francisco.
See this?

1128
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,543
I can't extend that.
You know why?

1129
01:27:35,877 --> 01:27:37,879
'Cause in the semi-final

1130
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,882
celebrating my
third wife's demise,

1131
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:42,925
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.

1132
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:57,356
Look at that.

1133
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:00,568
That's a bull shark.

1134
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:03,529
He scraped me when
I was taking samples.

1135
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,365
I got something for you.

1136
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:10,536
There's a thresher.
You see that?
A thresher's tail.

1137
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,747
Thresher?
It's a shark.

1138
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,794
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?

1139
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:18,878
I'll drink to your leg.

1140
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,047
So we drink
to our legs.

1141
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,555
I got
the <i>crème de la crème.</i>
Right here. Hold on.

1142
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:32,308
Here, you see that?

1143
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:34,435
You're wearing
a sweater.

1144
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:37,563
Right there.
Mary Ellen Moffit.

1145
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:40,483
She broke my heart.

1146
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:52,161
What's that one?

1147
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:53,663
What?

1148
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:55,206
That one, there.
On your arm.

1149
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,875
Oh.

1150
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,502
A tattoo.
I got that removed.

1151
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,295
Don't tell me.

1152
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,464
"Mother."

1153
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:10,471
What is it?

1154
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:18,646
Mr. Hooper, that's
the <i>U. S. S. Indianapolis.</i>

1155
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,155
You were
on the <i>Indianapolis?</i>

1156
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:29,615
What happened?

1157
01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:35,663
Japanese submarine
slammed two torpedoes
into her side, Chief.

1158
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:40,877
I was coming back
from the island
of Tinian to Leyte

1159
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,088
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

1160
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:50,011
1,100 men went
into the water.

1161
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,929
Vessel went down
in 12 minutes.

1162
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:57,226
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

1163
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:59,395
Tiger, 13-footer.

1164
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:02,356
You know how you know that
when you're in the water,
Chief?

1165
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,693
You tell by looking
from the dorsal
to the tail.

1166
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,155
Well, we didn't know.

1167
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,658
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret

1168
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:15,828
no distress signal
had been sent.

1169
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:25,546
They didn't even list us
overdue for a week.

1170
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:30,509
Very first light,
sharks come cruising

1171
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,930
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

1172
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:37,642
You know, kind of
like old squares

1173
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,310
in a battle like
you see on a calendar

1174
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:42,188
like the Battle
of Waterloo.
The idea was...

1175
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,898
the shark comes
to the nearest man

1176
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,776
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

1177
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,487
Sometimes the shark
would go away...

1178
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:52,448
but sometimes
he wouldn't go away.

1179
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:56,786
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right into you,
right into your eyes.

1180
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,873
You know, a thing
about a shark, he's got...

1181
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:05,336
lifeless eyes.
Black eyes,
like a doll's eyes.

1182
01:31:06,963 --> 01:31:10,466
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to
be living

1183
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,721
until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll
over white and then...

1184
01:31:17,223 --> 01:31:20,726
Then you hear
that terrible
high-pitched screaming.

1185
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:23,062
The ocean turns red.

1186
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:27,316
In spite of the pounding
and the hollering,
they all come in.

1187
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:30,736
They rip you
to pieces.

1188
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,577
You know,
by the end of
that first dawn...

1189
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,372
we lost 100 men.

1190
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:45,418
I don't know
how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

1191
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:48,587
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

1192
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:52,174
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend
of mine...

1193
01:31:52,258 --> 01:31:54,677
Herbie Robinson,
from Cleveland.

1194
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,514
Baseball player,
bosun's mate.

1195
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:04,645
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.

1196
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:10,109
He bobbed up and down
in the water just
like a kind of top.

1197
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,069
Upended.

1198
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:18,784
He'd been bitten in half,
below the waist.

1199
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:26,709
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

1200
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:29,920
He swung in low
and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

1201
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:31,213
Younger than Mr. Hooper.

1202
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:34,133
He saw us
and he came in low,
and three hours later...

1203
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:37,720
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

1204
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,639
That was the time
I was most frightened.

1205
01:32:41,307 --> 01:32:43,142
Waiting for my turn.

1206
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:47,271
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.

1207
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:51,442
So, 1,100 men went
into the water

1208
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,070
316 men come out.

1209
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:58,115
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.

1210
01:33:01,077 --> 01:33:04,830
Anyway,
we delivered the bomb.

1211
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:19,178
What's that?

1212
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:20,513
It's a whale.

1213
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:27,478
<i>Farewell and adieu</i>
<i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1214
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:33,901
<i>Farewell and adieu,</i>
<i>you ladies of Spain</i>

1215
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:42,243
<i>Show me the way</i>
<i>to go home</i>

1216
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:47,832
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>and I want to go to bed</i>

1217
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:54,130
<i>I had a little drink</i>
<i>about an hour ago</i>

1218
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:58,342
<i>And it's gone right</i>
<i>to my head</i>

1219
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:03,597
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1220
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:08,394
<i>By land, or sea or foam</i>

1221
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:13,941
<i>You will always hear me</i>
<i>singing this song</i>

1222
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:17,778
<i>Show me the way</i>
<i>to go home</i>

1223
01:34:19,572 --> 01:34:23,033
<i>Show me the way</i>
<i>to go home</i>

1224
01:34:23,117 --> 01:34:26,245
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>and I want to go to bed</i>

1225
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:28,914
<i>I had a little drink</i>
<i>about an hour ago</i>

1226
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:31,333
<i>And it's gone right</i>
<i>to my head</i>

1227
01:34:31,584 --> 01:34:33,836
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1228
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:36,589
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>

1229
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:40,009
<i>You can always</i>
<i>hear me singing...</i>

1230
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:44,597
Start the engines.

1231
01:34:54,773 --> 01:34:57,151
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!

1232
01:34:57,276 --> 01:34:59,612
He's busting the shaft.

1233
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:06,493
Put out the fire,
will you?

1234
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:17,796
Pump her out.
Done.

1235
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:27,723
Everybody on deck.

1236
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:28,933
He ate the light.

1237
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,601
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

1238
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:36,106
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

1239
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,566
Quint, come on.

1240
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,360
What's wrong with this?

1241
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:45,574
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that.
Watch for him.

1242
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,635
You okay?

1243
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:34,123
Chief,
more left rudder!

1244
01:36:35,124 --> 01:36:36,709
Pull your left hand down.

1245
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:39,837
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.

1246
01:36:40,004 --> 01:36:41,797
All of our
injectors got scored

1247
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,799
from the salt water
in the fuel.

1248
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:47,261
Yeah,
the housing's bent,
you can hear it.

1249
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:52,599
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good.
Once again now.

1250
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,313
Quint, there it is.

1251
01:36:58,272 --> 01:36:59,982
What do you say, Chief?

1252
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,776
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.

1253
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,200
I think he's
right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

1254
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:24,006
Quint, if we can
get close enough...

1255
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:27,176
I've got things on board
that'll kill it.

1256
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:30,137
Just want to
goose him up.
Come on.

1257
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:45,694
When he runs,
you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

1258
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:49,198
I've seen fingers
torn out at the knuckles.

1259
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:51,283
Whole sea's bones,
full of them.

1260
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:53,285
Give it to me a minute.

1261
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:11,261
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.

1262
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,430
Start the engine.

1263
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:17,351
Where are you going?

1264
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:18,977
I'm going to
make a phone call.

1265
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:27,903
Hello, mayday, <i>Orca.</i>
Coast Guard?

1266
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:31,740
Coast Guard,
this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you read me?

1267
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:34,326
Coast Guard,
this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you...

1268
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:41,959
Excuse me, Chief.

1269
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:45,754
That's great!
That's just great!

1270
01:38:45,838 --> 01:38:47,506
Now, where the hell
are we, eh?

1271
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:52,678
You're certifiable,
Quint, you know that?
You're certifiable!

1272
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,805
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!

1273
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,181
Boys,

1274
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:00,519
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

1275
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,814
Hook me up
another barrel.

1276
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,263
Bring her around
after him.

1277
01:39:53,113 --> 01:39:55,574
Full throttle!
Get me right up
alongside of him!

1278
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:58,952
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!

1279
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:18,263
Five degrees port.

1280
01:40:25,145 --> 01:40:27,105
All right,
hold your course.

1281
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,364
Five degrees port now.

1282
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:40,285
Hold your course.

1283
01:40:41,954 --> 01:40:43,205
Fast fish.

1284
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:44,456
Watch my hand.

1285
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:49,211
Be sure you watch
my hand! Follow me.

1286
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:53,048
Lad, you watch him now!
Starboard!

1287
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:56,134
Run him down, Hooper.

1288
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:04,643
Hard aport.

1289
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,148
Watch him. Starboard.

1290
01:41:34,965 --> 01:41:38,302
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and
he's going down again.

1291
01:41:43,932 --> 01:41:45,350
It's incredible.

1292
01:41:51,398 --> 01:41:53,317
They're up again!
Now what?

1293
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:04,953
Why don't we lead
the shark into shore

1294
01:42:05,037 --> 01:42:06,830
instead of him
leading us out to sea?

1295
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:13,003
Grab a couple of poles.

1296
01:42:15,297 --> 01:42:17,424
Hang on now,
we're going around.

1297
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:20,719
Into starboard. Easy.

1298
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,722
I'm going to
back her off now.

1299
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,599
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.

1300
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:32,230
All right, gentlemen,
snag them.

1301
01:42:37,486 --> 01:42:39,863
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.

1302
01:42:43,116 --> 01:42:45,744
Brody, bring your end
around the cleat.

1303
01:42:46,787 --> 01:42:50,332
That's right,
it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

1304
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:54,127
Stay clear of the line!

1305
01:43:01,885 --> 01:43:03,595
Watch it. Stand clear.

1306
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:16,233
Stand away from
those stern cleats!

1307
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:31,456
Back home we got
a taxidermy man.

1308
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,999
He's going to
have a heart attack

1309
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,752
when he sees
what I brought him.

1310
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,469
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.

1311
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:49,850
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.

1312
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,018
He's eating his way
through that line.

1313
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:53,979
He's working his way
right up to us.

1314
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:56,940
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1315
01:43:59,484 --> 01:44:00,777
Out of my way.

1316
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:06,992
Watch it.

1317
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:13,665
Untie this.
He'll pull out
the transom.

1318
01:44:17,502 --> 01:44:19,463
Make it fast! We got
another line in him!

1319
01:44:19,546 --> 01:44:21,506
I can't,
it's trying to run!

1320
01:44:22,883 --> 01:44:24,593
We better
get another line!

1321
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:26,678
Pull,
you son of a bitch!

1322
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:29,181
I hope your back breaks!

1323
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,141
Go ahead. Pull your
bloody heart out.

1324
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:33,185
Tie him off!

1325
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:40,692
It's impossible!

1326
01:44:41,902 --> 01:44:43,570
Boys, it's too tight!

1327
01:44:44,029 --> 01:44:45,822
He's pulling us!

1328
01:44:47,741 --> 01:44:49,659
We're breaking up
over here!

1329
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:58,543
We're breaking up!
Cut it!

1330
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:00,837
Watch your hands!

1331
01:45:02,214 --> 01:45:04,257
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!

1332
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,781
He can't stay down
with three barrels
on him.

1333
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:30,075
Not with three barrels,
he can't.

1334
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:31,743
What about us?

1335
01:45:32,285 --> 01:45:35,956
Hooper, get the pump
out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

1336
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:38,166
We're going to sink,
aren't we?

1337
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:41,211
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

1338
01:45:47,717 --> 01:45:49,261
Starting to go under.

1339
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:52,889
He can't with
three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1340
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:29,926
You ever have
one do this before?

1341
01:46:32,137 --> 01:46:33,263
No.

1342
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:07,631
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.

1343
01:47:12,761 --> 01:47:15,263
I'm going to draw him
into the shallows.

1344
01:47:15,347 --> 01:47:16,556
Draw him into
the shallow water.

1345
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,434
I'm going to draw him in
and drown him.

1346
01:47:19,684 --> 01:47:20,894
We're heading in, Brody.

1347
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:22,145
Thank Christ!

1348
01:47:29,945 --> 01:47:31,029
You ever had
a great white do that?

1349
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:32,447
No.

1350
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:40,622
How far do we
have to go?

1351
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:45,794
Don't put that much
pressure on it.

1352
01:47:55,971 --> 01:47:57,055
God damn it.

1353
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:58,848
Shut up.
Get back there.

1354
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:05,730
Hold on.

1355
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:26,001
<i>Farewell and adieu</i>
<i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1356
01:48:28,253 --> 01:48:33,091
<i>Farewell and adieu,</i>
<i>you ladies of Spain</i>

1357
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:39,848
<i>For we received order</i>
<i>for to sail back to Boston</i>

1358
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:42,600
You idiot,
you burned out
the bearings.

1359
01:48:44,269 --> 01:48:47,731
All right,
stop the boat. Stop it.

1360
01:50:27,539 --> 01:50:30,917
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1361
01:50:34,754 --> 01:50:38,842
I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate
into him.

1362
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:41,427
If I can get
close enough.

1363
01:50:43,888 --> 01:50:46,391
Get this little needle
through his skin?

1364
01:50:48,184 --> 01:50:49,769
No, I can't do that.

1365
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:53,648
If I can get him
close to the cage,

1366
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:54,899
I can get him
in the mouth.

1367
01:50:54,983 --> 01:50:56,526
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.

1368
01:50:56,609 --> 01:50:59,028
You got any
better suggestions?

1369
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:25,305
Easy.

1370
01:51:27,891 --> 01:51:29,100
Up she goes.

1371
01:51:30,476 --> 01:51:32,228
Ease her up.

1372
01:52:24,113 --> 01:52:25,573
Ain't got no spit.

1373
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:43,424
Try and keep him off me
until I'm lower.

1374
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:47,637
Okay, I'm ready.

1375
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:48,025
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!

1376
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,366
Pull it up. Pull it.

1377
01:56:05,293 --> 01:56:07,879
Pull him up.
Come on, Quint,
bring him in.

1378
01:56:11,174 --> 01:56:12,550
It's giving way!

1379
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:26,522
Rig something!

1380
01:56:29,525 --> 01:56:30,693
Got it?

1381
01:56:34,906 --> 01:56:36,073
It's coming.

1382
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:38,367
Slow it down.

1383
01:56:38,743 --> 01:56:40,036
Slower.

1384
01:59:51,977 --> 01:59:54,689
All right, come on.

1385
01:59:54,772 --> 01:59:56,315
Show me the tank.

1386
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:16,127
Blow up!

1387
02:00:19,296 --> 02:00:21,090
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1388
02:01:50,262 --> 02:01:51,388
Quint?

1389
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:53,808
No.

1390
02:02:03,067 --> 02:02:04,735
Can we get in
on those?

1391
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:12,827
What day is this?

1392
02:02:15,287 --> 02:02:17,665
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.

1393
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:21,418
I think the tide's
with us.

1394
02:02:22,002 --> 02:02:23,587
Keep kicking.

1395
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:29,093
I used to
hate the water.

1396
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:33,138
I can't imagine why.
