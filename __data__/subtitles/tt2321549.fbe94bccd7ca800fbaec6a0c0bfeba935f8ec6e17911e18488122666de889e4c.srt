1
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,321
Mum!

2
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,362
Mum!

3
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,820
Mummy!

4
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,446
Mum!

5
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:50,987
Mum!

6
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,462
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,230
"And he climbed down that chimney,

8
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,096
"straight into the huge black pot.

9
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:13,246
"And that was the end
of the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:20,022
Did they really kill the wolf, Mum?

11
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,822
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:25,105
I'll kill the monster when it comes.

13
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,238
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:31,688
It's time to go to
sleep now, sweetie.

15
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:33,230
It's very late.

16
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,230
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,898
"A long time ago...
just yesterday, in fact...

18
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:47,165
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,981
- What have you done?
- It's not broken. It just slipped.

20
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,355
I don't want you firing things
off in the house anymore.

21
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,522
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

22
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,989
Please don't!

23
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:14,774
Nothing in my hands.

24
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,397
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

25
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,981
Look at me, Mum!

26
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,231
Come on, Samuel.

27
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,564
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

28
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:24,482
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

29
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:28,065
- I don't want you making weapons anymore.
- It doesn't work if you don't look at me.

30
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:31,665
This monster thing has
got to stop, alright?

31
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:46,307
Don't do that!

32
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,032
Ready?

33
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,740
Come on.

34
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,191
Quick. You're late already.

35
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,982
What have you got in there?

36
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,248
See you later, alligator.

37
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,649
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

38
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,816
What?

39
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,775
One with your milk in it.

40
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,575
I don't want milk.

41
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,849
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

42
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,149
Just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

43
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,016
Get to work, woman.

44
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,608
Do you want a cuppa?

45
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,649
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

46
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,615
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

47
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,915
Right?

48
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:52,741
Amelia? Your son's
school is on the phone.

49
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,524
Oh, my God. Did he hurt anyone?

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,608
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

51
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,441
I'm going to have a
serious talk with him.

52
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,776
Mrs Fanning, we've had the talks.

53
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,484
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

54
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:13,351
We're going to have to
employ a monitor for him.

55
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,942
Monitor?

56
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,900
He'll be separated from
the other children.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,734
The monitor will supervise
him one-on-one.

58
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,108
Samuel won't cope with this.

59
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,567
He already feels so different.

60
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,442
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

61
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,567
Mrs Fanning,

62
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,025
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

63
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,901
You know, Samuel doesn't
need a full-time monitor.

64
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,150
What he needs is some understanding.

65
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,859
I have 24 other first
graders in that class.

66
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,360
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

67
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,984
I think I'll just
find another school.

68
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,484
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

69
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,526
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

70
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,317
that sees my son as a human being

71
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,317
and not just as another
problem to be gotten rid of.

72
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:53,317
That is very unfair.
We're only trying to help the boy.

73
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,777
Please stop calling him 'the boy'.

74
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,643
His name is Samuel.

75
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,109
We can see Ruby and Aunty
Claire at the park today.

76
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:12,193
You can play on that swing you
like for as long as you like, OK?

77
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,060
Mrs Bruen hates me.

78
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,901
No, she doesn't.

79
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:21,126
Just need a break, that's all.

80
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:25,685
Don't tell Aunty
Claire what happened.

81
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,334
I'll tell her later.

82
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:34,653
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

83
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,485
Sam, don't bother the lady.

84
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,109
No, no, no. That's alright.

85
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,984
We have to go home and see Daddy,
though, haven't we?

86
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:42,609
My dad's in the cemetery.

87
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,818
Oh. That's...

88
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,818
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

89
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,118
Samuel.

90
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:50,943
I'm sorry. He just...

91
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,818
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

92
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,943
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

93
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,477
We have to go.

94
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:01,868
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

95
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,026
The artist was so drunk, he vomited.

96
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,693
Right in front of his
own installation.

97
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,693
Lost all these sales.

98
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,693
You're not listening.

99
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,068
I am. I am.

100
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:14,610
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

101
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,610
Ruby! Don't play there. It's wet.

102
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,910
Mum! Mum!

103
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm gonna smash its head!

104
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:28,110
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

105
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:32,694
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

106
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:36,294
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

107
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:41,027
I was hoping Ruby would
change her mind.

108
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:44,277
She doesn't want a joint
party with Sam this year.

109
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,077
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

110
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,152
She wants to have a princess party.

111
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:50,452
Mum! Mum!

112
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:52,702
That's OK.

113
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:54,969
We don't have to come.

114
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,019
You can still come.

115
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,237
Mum!

116
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,444
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

117
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,529
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

118
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:05,329
Mum, I can go really high! Watch.

119
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,237
Maybe you want to celebrate his
birthday properly this year, anyway.

120
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:15,037
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

121
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:18,320
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

122
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,320
and then this birthday
thing rolls around

123
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,570
- and I end up feeling awful.
- I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.

124
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,028
We'll be fine.

125
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:27,195
We'll be absolutely fine.

126
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,862
Mum! Look at me!

127
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,703
Mama!

128
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,612
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

129
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,612
You look tired, little one.

130
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,946
Have you been in the wars today?

131
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,280
A few wars.

132
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:53,028
He's had a big day, that's all.

133
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,654
He's just exhausted.

134
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,487
Poor little sweetheart.

135
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:57,787
Bugsy.

136
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:59,654
Come here, little girl. Hello.

137
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,920
You look tired too, love.

138
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,579
You OK?

139
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:06,904
Nothing five years
of sleep wouldn't fix.

140
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,821
I'll put your rubbish
out for you, Grace.

141
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,571
No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.

142
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,237
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

143
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,680
You can choose one tonight.

144
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,614
Where did you get this?

145
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,080
On the shelf.

146
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,489
"If it's in a word or it's in a look,

147
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,422
"you can't get rid of the Babadook.

148
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:23,738
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

149
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:26,738
"then you can make friends
with a special one...

150
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:29,005
"a friend of you and me."

151
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:37,115
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

152
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:41,823
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks...

153
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,264
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

154
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:49,448
"That's when you'll know he's around.

155
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,914
"You'll see him if you look.

156
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,955
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

157
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,364
We might read another
one tonight, hey?

158
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,830
But you said I could choose.

159
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,380
"This is what he wears on top.

160
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:12,064
"He's funny, don't you think?

161
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,731
"See him in your room at night..."

162
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,572
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

163
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:24,655
Mum?

164
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:27,389
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

165
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,290
Mummy?

166
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:33,915
Mummy?!

167
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,323
"How sweetly they sung, telling
of the happiness and loveliness

168
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,490
"that lay at the bottom of the ocean

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,090
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

170
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,566
It's that time of
night again. Time...

171
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,450
If that's what the
doctor ordered, I...

172
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,250
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

173
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,441
Do you...

174
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:42,701
Mum!

175
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,535
- It's in my room!
- What is?

176
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:46,327
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

177
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:49,660
No, no, no. This is
not going to happen.

178
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,785
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

179
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,518
It's just a book.

180
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,585
It can't hurt you.

181
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,162
You've had a big day.

182
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,977
You're just exhausted.

183
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:08,651
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

184
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,426
Nothing bad's going to happen, Sam.

185
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,060
I'm gonna protect you.

186
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,219
Mum, it's 9:00.

187
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,495
He's not running a fever anymore.

188
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,629
No, no, no. My sister's
gonna take him. Put it back!

189
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,737
Put it back or it goes in the bin.

190
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,953
Sorry. What was that?

191
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:55,495
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

192
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

193
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,104
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

194
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:06,487
Samuel... no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

195
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,280
88. Number 88.

196
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,970
Two fat ladies.

197
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,754
Good, Elaine!

198
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:25,112
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

199
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,339
Number 11.

200
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,121
Who has number 11?

201
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:31,421
Legs 11.

202
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,738
Hey? See what else we've got.

203
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,671
5 billion.

204
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,371
Anyone got 5 billion?

205
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:57,071
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

206
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,330
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

207
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,080
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

208
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,346
Fine. Yeah. Just a
bunch of old people.

209
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,788
You don't have to be fine, you know.

210
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:15,655
Just a bit stressed at the moment.

211
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,272
Why don't you go home?

212
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:22,564
Old cranky bitch...
she goes after lunch.

213
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:23,538
I can cover for you.

214
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,805
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,872
I'll give you my pay.

216
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,789
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

217
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,856
You've got a sick boy.

218
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,814
Life's too short.

219
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,156
You're so sweet, Robbie.

220
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:42,305
- You should go.
- Yeah.

221
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,239
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

222
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,647
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

223
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:40,956
Rung you a million times.

224
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:41,998
What happened?

225
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:44,081
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

226
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,247
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

227
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,499
Just talking to the air...
even freaked me out.

228
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,539
I'm so sorry.

229
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,998
You need to get him to
see someone, Amelia.

230
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,916
It's not normal for a kid to
carry on with this rubbish.

231
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:55,373
It's not rubbish. It's real!

232
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:59,107
Don't you talk to your
Aunty Claire like that.

233
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:01,916
Where did you get those firecrackers?

234
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,832
You got them for me on the internet.

235
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,898
Well, that's the end of the internet.

236
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:10,456
If the Babadook was real,
we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?

237
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:14,082
It wants to scare you
first then you'll see it.

238
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,916
Well, I'm not scared.

239
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:19,041
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

240
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,574
That's enough.

241
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,290
You will be when it
eats your insides.

242
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,999
I've decided you're not having
your birthday with Ruby this week.

243
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,332
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

244
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:33,673
Samuel.

245
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:46,199
Ladies and gentlemen, Mum and Dad,

246
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,083
life is not always as it seems.

247
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,484
It can be a wondrous thing.

248
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:56,332
But it can also be very treacherous.

249
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,525
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

250
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:12,324
I'm gonna trap the
Babadook like this.

251
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:18,249
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

252
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:19,549
Samuel.

253
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,542
I was just putting something back.

254
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,000
- All your father's things are down there.
- He's my father.

255
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
You don't own him!

256
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:41,034
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

257
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,075
Can I come in?

258
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,675
Hey, matey. This is for you.

259
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,125
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

260
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:53,592
I'm not sick.

261
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,050
Oh. I-I thought...

262
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:59,250
No, he's not, actually.

263
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,334
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

264
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:03,377
You said that's not true.

265
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:04,918
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

266
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,050
- who still believe in monsters?
- I hate you!

267
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,450
She won't let me have a birthday party
and she won't let me have a dad!

268
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:26,845
Don't eat it.

269
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,893
The Babadook did it, Mum.

270
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,794
Go and watch a DVD and
I'll make something else.

271
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:48,127
- The Babadook did it!
- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

272
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:51,194
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,

273
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:57,010
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

274
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:01,002
Life is not always as it seems.

275
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,819
It can be a wondrous thing.

276
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,545
But it can also be very treacherous.

277
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:10,986
In this DVD,

278
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:15,986
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

279
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:20,345
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

280
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,946
Do you think this is funny?

281
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,270
Oh, no. No. No!

282
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,162
Give it to me!

283
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,571
Do you wanna die?

284
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:14,505
Don't let it in! Don't let it in!

285
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:18,213
Don't let it in! Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

286
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:19,880
Don't let it in!

287
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:33,998
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

288
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,132
I've already got this doll, Mum.

289
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,465
Now she's got a twin.

290
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:51,065
They can go shopping together.

291
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:55,489
Off you go.

292
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:59,057
He's just really tired.

293
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:06,199
Go and play right now.

294
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,798
Claire tells me you're a writer.

295
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,507
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

296
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:21,008
What kind of writing did you do?

297
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:24,965
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

298
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,382
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

299
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:28,840
It must be difficult.

300
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,300
I do volunteer work with
some disadvantaged women

301
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,049
and a few of them have
lost their husbands

302
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,449
and they find it very hard.

303
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,257
How's Richard's merger going?

304
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:45,124
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

305
00:29:45,608 --> 00:29:48,300
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

306
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,466
Tell me about it!

307
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,799
I don't even have time to go to
the gym anymore. It's ridiculous!

308
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,425
That's a real tragedy.

309
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,757
Not having time to go to the
gym anymore. How do you cope?

310
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:58,841
You must have so much to talk about

311
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:01,841
with those poor disadvantaged women.

312
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:15,632
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

313
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,832
I'm not hurting anybody.

314
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:20,932
Bye.

315
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:25,358
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

316
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,383
How would your mum
know if it's real or not?

317
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:35,425
She never comes to our house.

318
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:37,925
Mum told Dad she didn't
want to go to your house

319
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,800
'cause it's too depressing.

320
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,800
The Babadook would eat
your mum for breakfast.

321
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,342
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

322
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,550
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

323
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,967
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

324
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:53,550
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

325
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,010
Isn't it time you moved on?

326
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,550
I have moved on.

327
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,010
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

328
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,134
What strain is that on you, Claire?

329
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:04,925
You're not even good
enough to have a dad.

330
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,967
Everyone else has one and you don't.

331
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,634
I do have a dad!

332
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,509
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

333
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,593
and you never stop to ask
me anything about mine.

334
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:17,252
I do! I want to know how you are.

335
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:19,259
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

336
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,468
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

337
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:24,093
I can't believe you just said that.

338
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,634
You can't stand being
around him yourself.

339
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,134
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

340
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:32,542
- That's not true!
- And your mum doesn't want you.

341
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,276
No-one wants you.

342
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,469
What did you do?!

343
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:50,402
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

344
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,360
Is she alright?

345
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:57,892
Stay here and look after the children
or do you want another one to get hurt?

346
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:00,559
Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!

347
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:03,644
Mummy! Mummy!

348
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:05,976
Mummy!

349
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:10,461
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

350
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,178
There is no Babadook!

351
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,519
Get out!

352
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,136
- Get out!
- Samuel?

353
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:26,052
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

354
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,385
Get out! Get out! Get out!

355
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,345
Please help me!

356
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,345
There's something wrong with my son.

357
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:06,593
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsión.

358
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,469
That's when the brain overheats.

359
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,677
- It always looks worse than it is.
- I've never seen anything like this.

360
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,761
We'll have to wait until
the tests come back.

361
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,552
All his other results are normal.

362
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:19,486
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

363
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,470
Very committed to the monster theory.

364
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,737
That's an understatement.

365
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,302
All children see monsters.

366
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,128
Not like this.

367
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:31,762
And it's getting worse.

368
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:34,029
He's becoming aggressive.

369
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,054
He could see a psychiatrist.

370
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:37,678
I can refer you.

371
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,261
Takes a few weeks to get in.

372
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:40,927
That'd be great.

373
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:45,719
But can you just give
me something for now,

374
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,852
just to make him sleep?

375
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,769
Just until...

376
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,020
just until we get an appointment.

377
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:56,894
Please?

378
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:01,562
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

379
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:05,970
and when we go home tonight, this
whole nightmare will start up again

380
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,220
and I am really...

381
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,286
I'm really not coping.

382
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:15,880
I can give you a short
course of sedatives.

383
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,386
Just until the tests come back.

384
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:24,053
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

385
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,928
It's really bad.

386
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,405
These can make children feel foggy.

387
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:40,305
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

388
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:43,512
They'll certainly help
him sleep, though.

389
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:46,512
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

390
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,487
Why don't people like me?

391
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:53,530
Why do you say that?

392
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:57,546
Ruby said people don't
like me 'cause I'm weird.

393
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:02,513
Sometimes people say
things that aren't true.

394
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:11,588
You just need to take your medicine,
have a big sleep and not worry.

395
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,138
I don't want you to die.

396
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,264
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

397
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:22,064
Did you think that about
my dad before he died?

398
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:30,172
Just take your pill so
you can go to sleep.

399
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:32,597
I've got the day off tomorrow.

400
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,639
Maybe we could do something?

401
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:37,706
Will these make the Babadook go away?

402
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:41,597
I think so but you have to promise
me not to mention it again.

403
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:45,640
I promise to protect you if
you promise to protect me.

404
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,472
Then I won't mention it.

405
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:49,739
I promise to protect you.

406
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,106
Come on.

407
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,064
Come on.

408
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:14,765
Can you stay here with me?

409
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:16,232
Yes.

410
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,515
I love you, Mum.

411
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:20,482
Me too.

412
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:25,518
Her nose is broken in two places.

413
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,726
- She may need surgery.
- I'll pay for everything.

414
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,476
You can't even pay your own bills.

415
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,851
Look, I really have to go.

416
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,643
Claire, I think someone is
stalking me and Samuel.

417
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:35,943
What?

418
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:38,059
A book turned up at our place.

419
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,686
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

420
00:39:41,786 --> 00:39:43,476
and put it on our doorstep.

421
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:46,809
Amelia, I just can't
help you right now.

422
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,852
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

423
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,102
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

424
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:53,569
I have to go.

425
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,944
Claire!

426
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,527
Hello?

427
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:21,602
Babadook...

428
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,235
dook... dook.

429
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,569
Hi.

430
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:42,144
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

431
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:43,477
Can you tell us what happened?

432
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:46,410
Somebody sent me a children's book.

433
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:49,444
And?

434
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:53,687
And it contained violent
and graphic images

435
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,728
of my child and me being murdered.

436
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,728
Can we have a look
at the book, please?

437
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,061
I burnt it.

438
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:01,445
You burnt it?

439
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:03,812
Yes.

440
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:08,144
Well, unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do about it.

441
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:11,678
He's been making phone
calls to me as well.

442
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,271
What's he been saying?

443
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,338
Nothing, just making these... noises.

444
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:18,770
How do you know it's the same person?

445
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,227
Because of what he wrote in the book.

446
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:22,978
The book you burnt?

447
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:24,278
Yes.

448
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:42,778
OK.

449
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:46,186
Don't worry about it.

450
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,979
Did you get your things done?

451
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,144
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

452
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:01,936
That's why she shakes like this.

453
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:04,936
Samuel, you don't have to say
everything that goes through your head.

454
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:07,070
Oh, it's alright, love.

455
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,853
He wanted to know so
we talked about it.

456
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,186
He sees things as they are, that one.

457
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:16,895
Oskar was the same.

458
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,604
He always spoke his mind.

459
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,870
Do you have to keep
on bringing him up?

460
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,812
Hey, Bugsy.

461
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:32,078
Hey.

462
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,120
Hey!

463
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:42,015
Don't come in here.

464
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:57,230
I don't want to buy anything.

465
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,297
Are you Amelia Vanick?

466
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:00,356
Yes.

467
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:02,939
I'm Warren Newton and
this is Prue Flannery

468
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,731
from the Department
of Community Services.

469
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:06,772
My son's only been away for two days.

470
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:10,314
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

471
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,523
If I could just come
in and meet Samuel

472
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:15,690
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

473
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,490
I'm just in the middle of cleaning
up the house at the moment.

474
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:23,772
I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.

475
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,889
Hello, Samuel.

476
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:32,199
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

477
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:36,631
How are you?

478
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:40,307
I'm a bit tired from
the drugs Mum gave me.

479
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:44,148
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

480
00:44:44,665 --> 00:44:46,441
He had a fit yesterday.

481
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:48,841
I'm really tired, actually.

482
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,457
That's no good.

483
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,607
May I have a glass of water, please?

484
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:59,407
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

485
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,549
It's a real mess.

486
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,232
I just found this
cockroach infestation.

487
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:13,773
I normally have the house sprayed.

488
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,649
I did actually already
have it sprayed

489
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:18,482
but there's this hole in
the wall behind the fridge

490
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,348
and that's why I...

491
00:45:25,082 --> 00:45:27,650
I didn't mean a hole in the wall.

492
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,150
There was a hole in the wallpaper.

493
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,442
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

494
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:35,108
We've caught you at a bad time.

495
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,607
I'll leave you with this.

496
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:42,024
We're required to come back in a
week to talk through your options.

497
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:43,624
Here's my card.

498
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:48,015
Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.

499
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,157
- What was that noise I heard?
- I didn't hear any noise.

500
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,399
Wind howling, doors slamming.

501
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:20,732
I declare, I think this house is haunted.

502
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:23,166
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

503
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:26,116
Are you sick?

504
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,249
Oh, no, Granny.

505
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,166
It's only 6:00.

506
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:34,400
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

507
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,700
No.

508
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:39,992
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

509
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:45,958
You have to stay up
for a while, sweetheart.

510
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:04,908
Where's its mother, Skip?
Koalas don't leave their babies about.

511
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:08,058
- Are you off now, Dad?
- Yep. Soon as I fuel up.

512
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,318
Tell Jerry I'll keep
in touch on the radio

513
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:14,067
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

514
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:16,359
"And the Prince and the Princess

515
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,318
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

516
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:21,851
"for the rest of their days."

517
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:05,778
Babadook...

518
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:09,662
dook... dook.

519
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,286
What are we doing?

520
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:50,904
We're going downstairs.

521
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,171
- Why?
- Because we are.

522
00:50:12,171 --> 00:50:13,804
Iris, Iris, Iris.

523
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,328
No.

524
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:08,238
Glass and mirror attachment.

525
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:11,780
Clean and polish shower doors or
mirrors for a streak-free shine.

526
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,988
As part of your steaming special, we'll
even include the garment and upholst...

527
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:18,721
Oh, I don't want to give
it to anyone at work.

528
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,771
Alright. Give all my shifts away.
That's just what I need.

529
00:51:26,629 --> 00:51:27,905
I can't help it if I'm sick.

530
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,372
What do you expect me to do?

531
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,929
You do that!

532
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:50,172
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

533
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,230
I need to eat something.

534
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:03,172
I couldn't find any
food in the fridge.

535
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:08,139
You said to have them with food.

536
00:52:08,797 --> 00:52:10,830
I'm really hungry, Mum.

537
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:16,257
Why do you have to
keep talk, talk, talking?

538
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,714
Don't you ever stop?

539
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:21,672
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

540
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:25,864
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

541
00:52:25,964 --> 00:52:30,064
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

542
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:05,082
I'm so sorry.

543
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:09,015
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

544
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:12,231
I've had absolutely no sleep.

545
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,057
I didn't know what I was saying.

546
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,024
I'll cook you something. Hey?

547
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:22,116
What would you like?

548
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:24,249
I'm not hungry anymore.

549
00:53:31,216 --> 00:53:33,033
We really need to get
out of this house.

550
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:37,366
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

551
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:42,858
Do you want to go to Wally's?

552
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:45,866
You can have anything
you want. Alright?

553
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:49,266
Even ice-cream for
breakfast if you like.

554
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,351
Give it back! Give it back!

555
00:53:55,217 --> 00:53:58,183
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

556
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:01,156
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

557
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:02,890
Sit down, please.

558
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:10,032
Where are we going?

559
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:13,365
I just want to drive
for a little while.

560
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:28,624
Mummy! Mummy!

561
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:32,833
Babadook.

562
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:46,075
You ran straight into me!

563
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:50,341
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

564
00:54:51,342 --> 00:54:54,324
Oh, driving on the wrong side
of the road with a kid in the back.

565
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,791
You could've killed someone!

566
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:01,581
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Hey! Crazy bitch!

567
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:10,384
Hi, sweetheart.

568
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,583
Mum?

569
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:24,567
I can call Aunty Claire.

570
00:55:27,842 --> 00:55:30,542
I can call and she can come over.

571
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,500
Mum?

572
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:39,526
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

573
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,784
Mum. Mum, look at me.

574
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:13,559
It's nice and warm in here.

575
00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:19,835
I don't want you to go away.

576
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:23,876
I'm not going anywhere.

577
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,627
Mum?

578
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:49,169
Mum, I don't think we
should stay here tonight.

579
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:52,953
I can call Mrs Roach.

580
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,854
I don't want you to call anyone.

581
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:01,869
I just need to sleep.

582
00:57:06,678 --> 00:57:08,578
- Mum...
- Leave it!

583
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:42,703
There's something in the house.

584
00:57:56,805 --> 00:57:59,238
There's someone in the house!

585
00:58:54,012 --> 00:58:57,312
Mrs Roach can we come
and stay the night?

586
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,120
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

587
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:11,538
Has someone broken into the house?

588
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:14,621
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

589
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,538
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

590
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,538
Oh, I was so worried.

591
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,371
I told him not to call anyone.

592
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:22,289
He asked if you could stay the night.

593
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:25,121
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

594
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:28,521
I really have to go,
though, now, Gracie.

595
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:30,246
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

596
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:31,829
Yes. Talk soon.

597
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:33,896
No worries. Talk soon.

598
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:40,888
I told you not to call anyone and
you deliberately disobeyed me.

599
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:43,829
Do you want to frighten Mrs Roach?

600
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:46,038
An old lady who can hardly walk?

601
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:48,572
Do you want to make her sick?

602
00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:51,788
Get that bloody thing off!

603
00:59:55,847 --> 01:00:00,147
Is this the only way I can
trust you not to embarrass me

604
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,272
in front of our neighbours?

605
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,414
Is this what I have to do?

606
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,456
I'm sorry, Mummy.

607
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:23,706
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

608
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:25,306
What'd you say?

609
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:27,372
I said the Babadook...

610
01:00:27,472 --> 01:00:28,997
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

611
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:32,830
He's just something you've made
up in your stupid little head.

612
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,373
I just didn't want you to let it in!

613
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:38,640
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

614
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,665
Alright, Samuel?

615
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:43,206
Nothing is coming in here tonight.

616
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,506
Nothing!

617
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:23,315
I feel sick.

618
01:01:24,474 --> 01:01:28,107
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

619
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,374
Mum, I don't think I need...

620
01:01:30,474 --> 01:01:34,707
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

621
01:01:56,974 --> 01:01:58,174
Good boy.

622
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,050
Mum!

623
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:42,516
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

624
01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:48,157
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

625
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,883
Hey.

626
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:53,342
Hey!

627
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,833
Here we go.

628
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:24,950
There's more where that came from.

629
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:44,634
What's the secret?

630
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:49,917
- ...letter of Max's, didn't you?
- No, not for a minute.

631
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:51,792
Don't lie. You called
me a jezebel. Why?

632
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:54,001
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

633
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:55,668
With fresh meat.

634
01:03:57,892 --> 01:03:59,192
Only five...

635
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:04,243
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

636
01:04:04,602 --> 01:04:09,001
Police say the woman used a
kitchen knife to stab her son.

637
01:04:09,101 --> 01:04:11,168
His body was found in their basement.

638
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,919
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

639
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:17,452
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

640
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:20,126
Little is known about the tragedy

641
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:24,085
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

642
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:26,352
He had just turned seven.

643
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,177
Samuel?

644
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:48,352
Wake up, Mummy.

645
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:54,852
But you're the one
who's asleep, sweetheart.

646
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:01,977
Don't go down there.

647
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,036
It's not safe.

648
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:47,245
I thought you were dead.

649
01:05:49,437 --> 01:05:51,537
I thought you were dead.

650
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:08,537
We're gonna be together.

651
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:13,871
You just need to bring me the boy.

652
01:06:35,854 --> 01:06:37,421
You mean Samuel?

653
01:06:38,354 --> 01:06:40,520
You can bring me the boy.

654
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:45,479
You can bring me the boy.

655
01:06:46,978 --> 01:06:48,461
You can bring me the boy.

656
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:49,878
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

657
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:52,088
I think it's going to rain.

658
01:06:52,188 --> 01:06:53,388
No.

659
01:08:25,438 --> 01:08:28,938
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

660
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:41,931
Oh, no.

661
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:49,639
No! No!

662
01:08:58,315 --> 01:08:59,515
Bugsy!

663
01:10:51,482 --> 01:10:52,682
Samuel!

664
01:10:58,608 --> 01:10:59,808
Samuel.

665
01:11:01,942 --> 01:11:04,908
Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.

666
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:11,500
You don't want him to die, do you?

667
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:16,392
Samuel.

668
01:11:16,983 --> 01:11:19,083
Are you listening to me?

669
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:26,243
Let me in, you little shit!

670
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,600
Let me in!

671
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:30,051
Let me in!

672
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:31,351
Let me in!

673
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:32,892
Let me in!

674
01:11:56,944 --> 01:11:58,444
You little pig!

675
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:02,926
Six years old and you're
still wetting yourself.

676
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:05,092
You don't know how many times

677
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:08,426
I wished it was you,
not him, that died.

678
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,759
I just want you to be happy.

679
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,359
"I just want you to be happy."

680
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:18,617
Sometimes...

681
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:22,593
I just wanna smash your
head against a brick wall

682
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:25,460
until your fucking brains pop out.

683
01:12:25,944 --> 01:12:27,844
You're not my mother.

684
01:12:28,027 --> 01:12:31,927
- What did you say?
- I said you're not my mother!

685
01:12:32,235 --> 01:12:33,869
I am your mother!

686
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,420
Run, run, run, as fast as you can!

687
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:45,977
Get away!

688
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:49,585
Didn't I tell you not
to play with weapons?

689
01:13:37,028 --> 01:13:39,794
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

690
01:13:40,028 --> 01:13:42,094
I just wanted to make
sure you were OK.

691
01:13:42,194 --> 01:13:43,394
I'm OK.

692
01:13:45,194 --> 01:13:49,228
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

693
01:13:51,112 --> 01:13:55,303
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

694
01:13:55,403 --> 01:14:00,436
But I just wanted you to know that
I'd do anything for you and Sam.

695
01:14:00,612 --> 01:14:02,179
I love you both.

696
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:07,145
Samuel.

697
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,770
I'm sorry.

698
01:14:15,153 --> 01:14:16,970
I understand you're scared.

699
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:20,304
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

700
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,370
I haven't been good at all.

701
01:14:26,946 --> 01:14:29,246
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

702
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:37,062
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

703
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:42,722
We're going to stay there tonight.

704
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:44,455
Do you want that?

705
01:14:50,196 --> 01:14:52,896
I want to make it up to you, Sam.

706
01:15:04,405 --> 01:15:06,772
I want you to meet your dad.

707
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,137
It's beautiful there.

708
01:15:12,405 --> 01:15:13,972
You'll be happy.

709
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,979
Sorry, Mummy!

710
01:16:11,698 --> 01:16:12,898
Mum!

711
01:16:13,822 --> 01:16:15,022
Mum!

712
01:16:16,089 --> 01:16:17,923
I'm not leaving you.

713
01:16:21,614 --> 01:16:22,814
Mum? Mum?

714
01:16:31,447 --> 01:16:34,147
You said we'd protect each other.

715
01:16:40,197 --> 01:16:42,364
I know you don't love me.

716
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,097
The Babadook won't let you.

717
01:16:46,197 --> 01:16:48,031
But I love you, Mum.

718
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:51,647
And I always will.

719
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,923
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

720
01:17:10,073 --> 01:17:12,440
I don't want you to go away.

721
01:17:12,906 --> 01:17:14,140
No! No! No!

722
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,690
Mummy!

723
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:07,899
Mummy!

724
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:09,399
Mummy!

725
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:11,484
Mummy!

726
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:13,608
Mummy! Mummy!

727
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,900
Mummy!

728
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:18,067
Mummy!

729
01:18:56,285 --> 01:18:57,518
What is it?

730
01:18:57,701 --> 01:19:00,467
You can't get rid of the Babadook.

731
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,667
What do you want?

732
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:36,459
What do you want?

733
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,609
No.

734
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,660
Keep breathing.

735
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:27,243
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

736
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,151
No.

737
01:20:36,784 --> 01:20:38,101
I think it's gonna rain.

738
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:39,401
Stop!

739
01:21:28,369 --> 01:21:29,935
You are nothing.

740
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:44,453
You're nothing!

741
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:55,379
This is my house!

742
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:02,962
You are trespassing in my house!

743
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:17,178
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

744
01:22:26,995 --> 01:22:28,195
No!

745
01:23:12,914 --> 01:23:14,281
Mummy, don't!

746
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:21,488
Don't!

747
01:25:08,373 --> 01:25:10,856
Watch out for your
mum's leg, little one.

748
01:25:10,956 --> 01:25:12,856
He's fine. I've had the stitches out.

749
01:25:12,956 --> 01:25:14,690
What time's the party?

750
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,023
Any time after three is fine.

751
01:25:16,123 --> 01:25:17,940
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

752
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,240
Bye.

753
01:25:19,623 --> 01:25:20,823
Bye, Sam.

754
01:25:21,414 --> 01:25:23,691
That school's a good choice.

755
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:27,565
I've been doing a lot of reading about
it so I think Sam will be happy there.

756
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:31,314
He's been out of school over two
weeks now. It's time to get back.

757
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:34,981
We needed some time to
sort a few things out.

758
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:37,898
Are you having a party?

759
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:39,648
It's Sam's birthday today.

760
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:42,915
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

761
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,482
That's not true.

762
01:25:44,582 --> 01:25:47,108
Yes, it is. My first
party on the day.

763
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,708
That's unusual.

764
01:25:51,915 --> 01:25:55,233
My husband died the
day that Sam was born.

765
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:59,433
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

766
01:26:00,707 --> 01:26:02,692
Sam's just like his dad was.

767
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,816
Always speaks his mind.

768
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:09,149
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

769
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:13,949
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

770
01:26:16,415 --> 01:26:18,449
I'll take that for you.

771
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:39,116
Good shot.

772
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,483
Look, there's another one!

773
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,283
Where's your bowl?

774
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:48,992
Wow. You've got a lot today.

775
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,400
Am I ever gonna see it?

776
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,867
One day, when you're bigger.

777
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:06,858
You go outside, and you
don't come in until I tell you.

778
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:53,633
It's alright. It's alright.

779
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,617
It's alright.

780
01:28:31,709 --> 01:28:32,942
How was it?

781
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:35,651
It was pretty quiet today.

782
01:28:37,961 --> 01:28:39,161
Come here.

783
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,210
It's getting much better, Mum.

784
01:28:50,002 --> 01:28:51,202
Wait!

785
01:28:51,377 --> 01:28:53,144
I have a new trick.

786
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,527
Life is not always as it seems.

787
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:03,261
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

788
01:29:08,086 --> 01:29:11,119
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

789
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,760
Abracadabra!

790
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:28,002
How did you do that?

791
01:29:33,253 --> 01:29:35,487
Come here, you. Come here.

792
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:49,011
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
