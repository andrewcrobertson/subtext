1
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,335
I told you not to look for me.

2
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,672
Please, Father.

3
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,687
That's all I have.

4
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,899
The only proof of what they've done.

5
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,527
But she looks so...

6
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,612
Human.

7
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,035
But don't let yourself be fooled.

8
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,749
She wasn't conceived naturally.

9
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,508
They found a volunteer.

10
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,721
Someone devoted

11
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,642
But how did they...

12
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,893
No, please.

13
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,312
I can't uh...

14
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,483
I can't talk about that.

15
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,588
What I can tell you...

16
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,259
is that the pregnancy happened quickly.

17
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,559
She'll be in her teens now.

18
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,146
They're just waiting
until she's old enough.

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,399
Old enough for what?

20
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,069
Old enough for what?

21
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,862
Now, please.

22
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,748
I can't do this anymore.

23
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,918
I can't do this anymore.

24
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,461
I can't

25
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,716
But please don't let it touch me again.

26
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,357
Father?

27
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,991
Father Harris?

28
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,161
Father?

29
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,001
Hiding won't absolve your sins.

30
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,090
You think I want to be forgiven?

31
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,560
I don't want to be forgiven,
Father Brennan.

32
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,397
I just want it all to be over.

33
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,609
You'll understand...

34
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,195
soon enough.

35
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,619
Father, are you all right?

36
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,416
I'm fine.

37
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,974
Father.

38
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,507
Il volo sefte quattro due,

39
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,134
in arrivo da Milano Linate,

40
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,179
arrivera con quindici minuti dr ritardo.

41
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,555
- Margaret Daino?
- Yes.

42
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,308
- I'm Father Gabriel.
- Hello.

44
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,060
Cardinal Lawrence sent me to fetch you.

45
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,103
- Oh, sure. Thank you.
- Let me help you with that.

46
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,772
He's in the car outside.

47
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,066
I have heard so much about you.

48
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,609
I feel like I already know you.

49
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,279
Maggie!

50
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,283
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Oh, me too.

51
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,619
Oh, it's so beautiful here.
It's like a dream.

52
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,704
Well, wait till you see the actual city.

53
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,498
Look at you.

54
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,541
It hasn't been a year, and somehow,
you've found a way

55
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,918
to grow up even more.

56
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,461
Is that all you've got?

57
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
That's it.

58
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,631
Well, my word. Come on.

59
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,341
I'll show you to your new home.

60
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,082
So, what do you think?

61
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,375
It's wild.

62
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,044
Everything's so different.

63
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,838
Every street that we pass,
there's something to look at.

64
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,715
I just wanna explore.

65
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,008
Isn't it beautiful?

66
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,011
What better place
for you to be taking the veil?

67
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,181
It's wonderful to see you, Maggie.

68
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,558
Even when you were little,

69
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,352
I knew you were destined for great things.

70
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,108
See if you can get around them, Damiano.

71
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,195
These protests
have picked up recently, I'm afraid.

72
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,656
What are they protesting?

73
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,741
For the workers,

74
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,242
it's about conditions and wages.

75
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,286
But for the students, well,

76
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,539
it's a rejection of authority,

77
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,041
even the church.

78
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,837
The world is changing, Maggie, very fast.

79
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,048
The younger generation
no longer turn to us

80
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,382
- for guidance, I'm afraid.
- Ooh!

81
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,594
But it's a challenge we've embraced.

82
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,970
Perhaps you'll play your part

83
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,847
and help earn back their trust.

84
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,767
I'll try.

85
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,520
Come la treccia!

86
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,005
Tu devi essere la nostra bella Americana.

87
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,381
This is Sister Silva,

88
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,466
the Abbess.

89
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,551
And she'll take good care of you.

90
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,720
- Hello.
- Bellissima.

91
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,555
Welcome to our family.

92
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,766
Oh. Thank you.

93
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,850
Ooh.

94
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,355
Come. Come with me.

95
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,982
Let me give you a tour.

96
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,361
We're so happy to have you here.

97
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,784
This way.

98
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,911
We take care of girls.

99
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,538
Girls only.

100
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,581
A total of 62.

101
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,876
Babies to 18 years of age.

102
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,253
Come this way.

103
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,631
Buongiorno.

104
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,049
Buongiorno. Hello.

105
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,093
Buongiorno.

106
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,720
The state has contracted with us

107
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,056
to take in many unmarried women

108
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,683
who are about to give birth.

109
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,393
We have our birthing facilities

110
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,061
here in the hospital wing.

111
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,440
Come, come.

112
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,154
Our doctor will likely deliver
this baby within the week.

113
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,823
- Ciao, Lanoma.
- Salve.

114
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,534
- Come stai?
- Bene.

115
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,453
Tranquilla. Tutto va bene.

116
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,331
Pazienza, hmm?

117
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,336
Andiamo.

118
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,014
Sister Anjelica.

119
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,437
This is Margaret Daino from America.

120
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,655
She grew up here.

121
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,700
Abandoned on our front steps,

122
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,784
and very ill.

123
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,746
But she's very devoted

124
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,499
and she keeps all the children smiling.

125
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,293
And they all seem very happy.

126
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,755
Scusi.

127
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,341
I should see what the trouble is.

128
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,425
Of course.

129
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,346
Via dal cancello faccello.

130
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,265
La tua suora ・sempre gentilissima.

131
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,648
Amen.

132
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,567
Hail Mary.

133
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,619
Um...

134
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,538
Ave Maria is my favorite, too.

135
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,792
Il mo preferrito.

136
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,548
What's your name?

137
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,259
Come ti chiami?

138
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,932
I'm Margaret.

139
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,311
Mi chiami Margaret.

140
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,363
Hi.

141
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,637
Um...

142
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,139
What are you doing?

143
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,058
Get off of me!

144
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,607
Oh, there you are.

145
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,071
Have you been behaving yourself, Carlita?

146
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,075
Carlita.

147
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,204
Did you do that drawing outside, Carlita?

148
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,623
The one where the girl's floating

149
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,874
above the other girls?

150
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,045
I thought it was very nice.

151
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,473
Thank you.

152
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,518
Come.

153
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,776
Why is she kept alone like that

154
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,069
in the middle of the day?

155
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,278
It's safer.

156
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,115
She hurt another child just yesterday.

157
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,827
Luca will be your driver.

158
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,371
Rome has become a bit dangerous

159
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,747
with the protests.

160
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,446
Hello?

161
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,630
By Your divine mercy,
rein in the power of evil.

162
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,299
Build us into living stones
of a culture of life,

163
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,384
who demonstrates in both deed and word,

164
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,553
the truth that every life,
no matter its conditions,

165
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,055
is precious and unrepeatable.

166
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,349
Lord, speak to every human heart

167
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,558
and fill it with the conviction:

168
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,935
I am wanted.

169
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,645
I have a task in history.

170
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,688
I am accepted, and I am loved.

171
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,690
It is good that I exist.

172
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,535
Margaret's one of

173
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,370
our worst-behaved children...

174
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,500
What if she has another episode?

175
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,044
Then you must tie her to the bed.

176
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,090
Here. Let me show you.

177
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,630
Hi.

178
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,090
Mierda.

179
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,967
Ah, you must be Margaretta.

180
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,760
Yes.

181
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,346
- I'm Luz.
- Oh.

182
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,806
Did I wake you?

183
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,225
No, no. Um...

184
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,935
I was having a nightmare.

185
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,062
First night nerves?

186
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,231
Don't worry, same thing happened for me.

187
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,442
If we can't admit how we are feeling,

188
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,612
our dreams do it for us, right?

189
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,157
You're a novitiate?

190
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,241
Oh, yeah.

191
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,577
I just figured a little
exploration is healthy

192
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,953
before the big day.

193
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,665
I mean, I will be hiding this body

194
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,542
under a habit for the rest of my life.

195
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,378
So, why not let it breathe a little now?

196
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,467
Coffee?

197
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,557
So how does a girl from...

198
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,269
Uh, Pittsfield. Massachusetts.

199
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,898
So how does a girl from Pissfield

200
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,400
end up in Italy about to take the veil?

201
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,279
Well, Cardinal Lawrence was, um, a priest

202
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,697
at the orphanage that I grew up in.

203
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,783
And we got pretty close

204
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,368
because, uh,

205
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,703
well, I was somewhat of a problem child.

206
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,788
Wait.

207
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,872
Wait, wait, wait.

208
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,999
You were a problem child?

209
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,084
Like how?

210
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,712
I don't know. I guess, uh...

211
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,631
I mean, I used to get punished a lot.

212
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,636
And how did they punish you?

213
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,721
And where did you get these?

214
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,806
Hey.

215
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,350
And you are a nosy girl.
Do you know that?

216
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,688
Well, would they beat you?

217
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,482
Would they beat me?

218
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,735
No, not really.

219
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,449
I used to have
a pretty active imagination.

220
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,954
I'd get so convinced sometimes
that what I was seeing was real

221
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,498
that the sisters would need to, um...

222
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,917
subdue me.

223
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,048
But then Cardinal Lawrence
came to the orphanage,

224
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,718
and, uh, he was really great, you know.

225
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,887
He really helped me to see
that all that stuff was just in my head.

226
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,015
Things got a lot better for me after that.

227
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,437
For me,

228
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,897
it was a voice.

229
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,527
I was 16.

230
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,780
Just kicked out of the house.

231
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,576
It was so cold that night,
and I didn't know what to do.

232
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,082
And then...

233
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,044
this warm wind came...

234
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,506
out of nowhere.

235
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,472
And suddenly it was as if
His voice was all around me.

236
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,933
Inside me even.

237
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,228
So clearly.

238
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,482
And He told me it didn't matter

239
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,649
if I had no earthly home

240
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,110
because my true home was with Him.

241
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,114
And for the first time in my life,

242
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,868
I felt like I belonged on this Earth.

243
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,417
Yes,

244
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,754
but even with the most handsome
milkman in town,

245
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,048
we still had a whole group of us

246
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,716
who took the veil together.

247
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,220
Yes.
Now, instead, girls go off to college

248
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,139
and poor Luz is taking the veil alone.

249
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,517
- Hmm. And Margaret...
- Mm.

250
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,061
Margaret will be alone in the chapel, too.

251
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,397
Don't worry.
I'll warm it up for you.

252
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,236
Warm up? What is this "warm it up"?

253
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,613
As if Mr. Milkman didn't teach you.

254
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,826
I'm sorry!

255
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,661
It's true!

256
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,456
Practice it again.

257
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,668
Sono una farfalla.

258
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,713
E devo volare.

259
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,176
No, no, no. Shy American.

260
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,886
Say it with passione.

261
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,471
With passione?

262
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,765
Okay. All right.

263
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,559
Sono una...

264
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,602
- Farfalla.
- Farfalla.

265
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,229
E devo volare.

266
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,481
Good?

267
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,566
Good.

268
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,650
- Yeah・
- Yeah.

269
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,860
What does it mean?

270
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,404
"I am a teacher and I love to teach."

271
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,249
Silenzio.

272
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,751
Silenzio, ragazze.

273
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,799
Padre nostro, che sei neri ciell,

274
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,762
sia santificato il fuo nome,

275
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,766
venga il tuo regno,

276
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,770
sia fatta la tua volonia,

277
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,065
come in cielo cosi in terra.

278
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,859
Dacci oggi

279
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,737
il nostro pane quotidiano,

280
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,031
e rimetti...

281
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,478
No! No!

282
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,523
Margaret.

283
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,607
There you are.

284
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,609
I'm sorry I scared you. Come on.

285
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,654
I have something to show you for tonight.

286
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,115
You're gonna love it.

287
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,507
Ah-ha!

288
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,467
There she is.

289
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,387
Oh, my God, you look hot.

290
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,889
- I look naked.
- Yes.

291
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,434
What do you mean, naked?
You look gorgeous.

292
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,560
Come on.

293
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,020
Up with your foot.

294
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,106
The other one.

295
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,649
Mother Mary.

296
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,861
Don't be nervous.
Can you stand?

297
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,362
No.

298
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,697
Yes, you can.

299
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,532
Hmm? Whoop.

300
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,617
Perfect.

301
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,087
Luz?

302
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,756
Yeah?

303
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,092
I can't do this.

304
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,804
Tell me.

305
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,140
Have you ever been to a bar?

306
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,558
No.

307
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,310
- A disco?
- No.

308
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,644
Anything at all?

309
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,065
Because your whole life, you've wanted

310
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,150
to give yourself only to Him, right?

311
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,195
Look, I know.

312
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,156
I know it's scary coming out
from under the habit,

313
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,616
but look at you!

314
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,161
You're a very beautiful girl, Margaretta.

315
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,915
And you have to understand
that about yourself.

316
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,376
If only to know
what it means to give it up.

317
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,256
So, let yourself feel it. Okay?

318
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,258
Be brave.

319
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,628
So...

320
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,673
To the bravest girl I know.

321
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,757
Go.

322
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
Do you still feel your feet?

323
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,432
Oh, my.

324
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,685
Do you still feel your feet?

325
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,645
Yes.

326
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,896
Okay. Another, then.

327
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,523
Hello.

328
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,608
- Parlate italiano?
- What?

329
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,694
Parlate italiano?

330
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,487
Ah, no. Not when I'm drinking.

331
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,697
Too hard.

332
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,741
Inglese, per favore, no?

333
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,494
If you can.

334
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,872
I'm Alfonzo, and this is Paolo.

335
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,914
Hi.

336
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,501
Uh, we can buy you a drink if you want.

337
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,822
Excuse me.

338
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,907
Um...

339
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,241
Can I have a sip of that?

340
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,119
Ah, yeah, eat it.

341
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,625
- Eat it?
- Yes. Eat it.

342
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,671
I was watching this movie
with my mother yesterday.

343
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,881
- Yeah?
- And, um...

344
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,883
And was with Barbara Streisand,

345
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,052
and I just... I don't know.
I love her and...

346
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,720
- You do?
- I do.

347
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,305
- Barbra?
- I love Barbara.

348
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,890
- Yes, Barbara Streisand.
- Barbara?

349
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,016
Barbra, yeah.

350
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,645
I mean, it was the part with the "Hello,
gorgeous."

351
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,230
Hello, gorgeous.

352
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,314
Gorgeous.

353
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,649
Gorgeous.

354
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,402
Uh, what? Gorgeous.

355
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,029
- Gor... Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

356
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,032
You know, it's...
Sorry if I'm not a "professional..."

357
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,117
- It was good.
- Like Barbra.

358
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,621
But, um, what do you... what do you do?

359
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,707
Um...

360
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,213
Well, since you asked, um...

361
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,591
I am a butterfly...

362
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,970
And I must fly!

363
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,599
- Volare?
- Volare.

364
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,312
Okay.

365
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,817
A butterfly? Well then,
I must not keep you from flying!

366
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,070
- What?
- Dai... dai!

367
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,406
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

368
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,323
Come on.

369
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,447
Darkness all around me

370
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,617
This is the BBC World Service,

371
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,036
and it's the 3rd of June, 1971.

372
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,496
Riots have erupted in Rome,

373
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,206
with clashes between the far left

374
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,542
and far right groups escalating rapidly.

375
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,420
The unrest has caused
widespread damage to property

376
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,755
and has left several people injured.

377
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,549
Italian authorities are struggling

378
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,968
to contain the violence and restore order.

379
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,761
Public transportation, factories,

380
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,221
and schools are heavily affected...

381
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,389
Good morning.

382
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,807
Good morning.

383
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,934
Did you have fun last night?

384
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,144
Yeah.

385
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm guessing you've never
drunk like that before.

386
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,862
I didn't, like,

387
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,030
embarrass myself or anything last night,
did 1?

388
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,365
No. No.

389
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,783
Okay.

390
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,910
You were well-behaved.

391
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,289
Mostly.

392
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,752
Okay. I found you before
anything got out of control.

393
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,671
And for the record,
I was a very nice friend.

394
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,339
You came home with me.

395
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,009
Thanks.

396
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,512
But it wasn't easy
pulling you away from him.

397
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,019
What do you mean? I didn't...

398
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,902
Let's just say
you took my advice to heart.

399
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,030
You were a very brave girl, Margaretta.

400
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,077
But, hey, don't worry.

401
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,787
It's our little secret. Okay?

402
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,112
I am loved. I am accepted.

403
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,284
It is good to be a human being.

404
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,911
It is good to be alive.

405
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,194
Excuse me.

406
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,279
May I sit?

407
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,407
No, please, please stay.

408
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,450
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

409
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,202
My name is Father Brennan.

410
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,580
I apologize for startling you.
Please sit with me.

411
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,623
This will only take a few minutes.

412
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,792
Your name is Margaret Daino.

413
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,294
You work at the orphanage.

414
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,628
You're new there.

415
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,965
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

416
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,717
It's about the girl. Scianna.

417
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,552
Carlita?

418
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,053
You must be very careful, Margaret.

419
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,598
Bad things will start
to happen around her.

420
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,765
Evil things.

421
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,267
No, I have to go now.

422
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,811
No, no. Please, please.
Come see me tonight.

423
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,272
Saint Rita cloister, room 42.

424
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,356
I'll tell you everything.

425
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,950
Good morning, farfalla.

426
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,370
Good morning.

427
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,455
What's wrong?

428
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,042
Nothing.
Just a little tired, that's all.

429
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,798
Where's Carlita?

430
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,302
She's in the bad room.

431
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,638
The bad room?

432
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,641
Dirty.

433
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,101
Dirty.

434
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,686
Dirty.

435
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,980
Dirty.

436
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,190
Sister.

437
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,359
Sister, I need your help.

438
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,823
Carlita, she's locked in a room.

439
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,700
That's right.

440
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,787
She bit Sister Romano just this morning,

441
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,123
so she had to go to the bad room.

442
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,003
Sister, why is there a bad room?

443
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,469
Because some girls are bad.

444
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,742
This room is suffocating.

445
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,329
It's not meant to be pleasant.

446
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,958
The things we do aren't always pleasant,

447
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,293
but they are in the name of God.

448
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,757
Do you wanna talk about

449
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,175
why they put you in that room?

450
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,554
Sono cattiva.

451
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,889
I'm bad.

452
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,559
Oh. You're bad.

453
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,312
Well, guess who else was bad.

454
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,023
Who?

455
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,193
You?

456
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,072
Oh, yeah.

457
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,950
But you know what?

458
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,954
I realized that I'm not bad.

459
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,041
They just tell you that you are

460
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,878
because you're not doing
what they want you to do.

461
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,966
Back then, I used to think
that there was something

462
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,302
really, really wrong with me.

463
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,888
What did you do?

464
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,438
Well, I guess at first,
I tried to run away.

465
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,149
But, uh,

466
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,027
it didn't fix the feeling.

467
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,740
That's what I like about you, actually.

468
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,158
What?

469
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,788
What do you like about me?

470
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,709
I think that you feel
the same way that I felt.

471
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,922
But you're not scared, you don't run away.

472
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,423
You just...

473
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,968
You raise your little claws,
and you fight.

474
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,559
Carlita, go to your room, okay?

475
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,645
I'll be right there.

476
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,662
- Linfermiera, la ragga.
- Si, dottore.

477
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,539
Forcipe, per favore.

478
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,665
Forcipe.

479
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,012
Stia ferma.

480
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,353
No!

481
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,605
Stia buona!

482
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,833
Everything looks all right.

483
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,837
You did say you didn't
eat much in the morning.

484
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,632
May be low blood sugar.

485
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm so sorry.

486
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,302
Sorry? Margaret, what for?

487
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,846
You wouldn't be the first to faint

488
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,556
witnessing the birth of a child.

489
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,142
Frankly, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

490
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,187
The miracle of life
can be a messy business.

491
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,575
You guys mind if I join?

492
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,085
Carlita, did you do this drawing?

493
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,756
This part is mine.

494
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,842
It's a boy.

495
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:37,847
Uh, I don't think

496
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,557
that that's very appropriate, Sister.

497
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,254
You all right?

498
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,426
Yes?

499
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,646
Andiamo!

500
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,232
Um...

501
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,942
Here. Let's... Let's go for a walk.

502
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,907
- Join the group.
- Oh, not today, girls.

503
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,242
- Come on!
- Okay.

504
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,372
Venite, venite!

505
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,082
No, no, no, not me.

506
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,751
It's all right. It's okay.

507
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,003
You ready?

508
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,600
It's all for you.

509
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,773
Oh, no.

510
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,859
No, no, no, don't. Don't!

511
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,943
Don't!

512
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,982
Psst. Psst, psst.

513
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,030
Margaret. Come in.

514
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,431
Something happened, didn't it?

515
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,475
Yes. Um...

516
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,937
One of the sisters took her own life.

517
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,776
You mentioned the name "Scianna."

518
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,403
That's right.

519
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,329
I assume you know these people.

520
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,749
The priest is named Spiletto.

521
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,375
He's a radical.

522
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,210
Yes, I've seen him.

523
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,754
Turn it over.

524
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,469
The baby in this photo is Carlita?

525
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,220
I believe so.

526
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,847
And this is why she's in danger?

527
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,685
I know these sisters.

528
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,270
They're women of God.

529
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,813
They belong to the Church.

530
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,106
Listen to me, Margaret.

531
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,985
The truth is there are two Churches.

532
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,488
The one that follows
the teachings of Christ,

533
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,906
the one that you and I are part of.

534
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
And the other.

535
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,286
The Church that will turn a blind eye

536
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,205
to torture, to rape.

537
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,624
To commit murder in the name of God.

538
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,542
All in the name of supreme power.

539
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,837
What do you think that Church
is most frightened of?

540
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:04,507
The Devil?

541
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,884
Secularism.

542
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,763
We are living in unprecedented times.

543
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,849
Look at what's been occurring
in your very own generation.

544
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,228
A culture that is outspoken, rebelling.

545
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,604
Sometimes violently.

546
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,274
People are turning away
from the church in droves.

547
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,653
And, Margaret, you know as well as I do

548
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,905
that belief is power.

549
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,659
Now, how do you control people
who no longer believe

550
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,036
in your stories of fire and brimstone?

551
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,415
People who do not seem to fear?

552
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,252
You create something to fear.

553
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:46,340
This Church has maintained
power for generations.

554
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,092
Thousands of years.

555
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,469
And they will stop at nothing
to keep it that way.

556
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,930
So,

557
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,935
a small, but very powerful group

558
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,478
of priests and bishops,

559
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,605
even higher,

560
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,275
they decided

561
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,361
something drastic had to be done.

562
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,823
These priests...

563
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,159
believe they can birth the Antichrist

564
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,493
and then control him.

565
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,330
Allow him to bring his dark forces

566
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,124
to bear on the world just enough

567
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,042
to drive people back to the Church.

568
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,544
That's insane.

569
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,921
Yes. Don't you see?

570
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,382
If no one believes such a thing can exist,

571
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,010
who will stand in their way?

572
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,099
What does any of this
have to do with Carlita?

573
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,642
I was excommunicated.

574
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,562
My contacts within the Church
are very limited.

575
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,689
That photo is all I have to go on.

576
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,444
But I believe the baby girl in the picture

577
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,362
is to be the mother.

578
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,656
The mother of what?

579
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,664
Of the Antichrist?

580
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:01,749
Yes.

581
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,503
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

582
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,255
Look, if I am right,
Carlita would have been born

583
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,716
on the sixth day
of the sixth month at 6 a.m.

584
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,967
666.

585
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,135
It's the mark of the Devil

586
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,803
which she will have on her body.

587
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,223
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

588
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,891
They're keeping her files
at the orphanage.

589
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,975
Locked away.

590
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,645
I need you to get them to me.

591
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,439
I need to know how she was born.

592
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,983
What do you mean, how she was born?

593
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,610
Listen to me, Margaret.

594
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,028
There is a beast they're mating.

595
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,614
A jackal. That's the father.

596
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,241
- I have to go now.
- No, no, Margaret.

597
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,577
If Carlita is, in fact, the mother,

598
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,039
the evil inside her will do
whatever it takes to stop us.

599
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,416
We must destroy it at all costs.

600
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,293
- Do you understand?
- No.

601
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,712
Carlita is a little girl.

602
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,130
And she is not pregnant.

603
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,883
But we're not talking about a human child!

604
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,177
It's almost June 6th.

605
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,638
Look, we haven't a lot of time
and I need your help.

606
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,223
No, you need a doctor.

607
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,183
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

608
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,561
Will you let go of my arm?

609
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,675
Oh. Margaret.

610
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,635
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

611
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,346
Um, I need to talk to you about Carlita.

612
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,102
Do you know anything about her history,

613
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,022
or how she came to the orphanage?

614
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,942
Um, not off the top of my head. Why?

615
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,572
Do you know where I could find
that kind of information?

616
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:03,037
I'm afraid this is not really my area,
you know?

617
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,138
What?

618
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,266
Why do you keep staring at me?

619
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,811
I'm not.

620
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:18,987
Will you come with me?

621
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,949
Come on.

622
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,205
I need to talk to you about something.

623
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,582
But before I do, I...

624
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,585
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

625
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,505
Okay.

626
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,090
Um...

627
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,054
Has anyone ever done anything to you

628
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,850
that might have scared you

629
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,393
or upset you?

630
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,151
I don't know.

631
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,487
What don't you know?

632
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,909
Sometimes I get this...

633
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,662
bad feelings.

634
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,958
I see...

635
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,586
I see things.

636
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:21,467
And I can't tell if they're real or not.

637
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,928
Listen to me.

638
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,265
When I was younger,

639
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,893
I... I used to have these

640
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,937
horrible visions.

641
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,940
They were so terrible that 


642
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,360
convinced myself that they were real.

643
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,033
But I learned that those thoughts,

644
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,161
they were just lies.

645
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,498
Just tricks that my brain
was playing on me

646
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,750
because I was so unhappy.

647
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,044
This isn't a lie.

648
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,213
How can you know that for certain?

649
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,926
Carlita.

650
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,052
I'm sorry.

651
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,724
Carlita.

652
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,482
Carlita. I'm sorry.

653
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,089
There you are.

654
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,132
A riot's broken out.

655
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,592
We must go.

656
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,469
Deve andare adesso

657
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,931
Deve andare adesso

658
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,273
Listen.
It's all right, girls.

659
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,024
It's okay. Stay close to me, okay?

660
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,997
Stay close to me, okay?

661
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,589
Carlita!

662
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,346
Carlita!

663
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,956
Silenzio.

664
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,459
Silenzio.

665
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,798
Silenzio, ragazze.

666
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,219
Padre nostro, che ser nei ciell,

667
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:57,933
sia santificato il fuo nome,

668
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,185
venga il tuo regno...

669
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,478
Margaretta.

670
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,112
Sister Silva would like
to see you in her office.

671
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,996
Please take a seat.

672
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,129
Margaret...

673
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,342
Part of my job here is to look out

674
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,302
for the well-being of all those

675
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,179
who are under my care.

676
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,183
I'm sure this will come as no surprise,

677
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,311
but I've become concerned.

678
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,898
I'm fine.

679
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,447
Perhaps I should have put it this way.

680
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,241
We are concerned.

681
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,953
Myself and Cardinal Lawrence.

682
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,208
We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

683
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,669
And perhaps we postpone your vows.

684
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,337
What? No. Why?

685
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:13,550
We're also concerned about
your attachment to Carlita.

686
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,843
Carlita?

687
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,721
- But...
- Cardinal Lawrence told me

688
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,973
about your troubles growing up.

689
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,767
Your hallucinations.

690
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:27,230
Perhaps being around Carlita
is not what's right for you.

691
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:32,277
Carlita is disturbed.

692
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,197
And her illness must not infect us

693
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,115
as her caretakers.

694
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,243
And clearly, it has.

695
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,538
Wait.

696
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,585
I'm not ill.

697
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,380
I understand how hard you had to work

698
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,424
to get to where you are.

699
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,219
It would be a shame to give it all up now.

700
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,930
I am the only one who cares about her.

701
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,181
You don't let her play

702
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,307
- with the other girls.
- I've told you...

703
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,975
- You keep her in the bad room.
- We're only doing

704
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,143
what's right for her.

705
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,603
The girl is sick in the head.

706
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,523
Because of you!

707
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,741
If there was any doubt in our decision,

708
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,160
you've all but confirmed it.

709
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,787
You're clearly unwell.

710
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,666
And, Margaret,

711
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,669
you will keep your distance from Carlita.

712
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,964
Or there will be consequences.

713
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,854
Stop the car, Luca.

714
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,735
I can just walk home from here, okay?
You don't have to wait.

715
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,321
Paolo.

716
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,406
Paolo!

717
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,283
Paolo!

718
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:05,829
No, no, no.

719
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,497
Lasciami stare, ti pego, ti prego.

720
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,917
Paolo?

721
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,586
Just leave me alone, please.

722
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,795
Hey!

723
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,506
Sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know.

724
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,466
- Really, I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

725
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,302
Just stop following me!

726
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,517
Paolo, talk to me.

727
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,314
Just look for the mark.

728
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,132
Oh, okay.

729
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,636
All right. Oh, God. Okay.

730
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,679
All right. Um...

731
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,765
Hey, call an... call an ambulance.

732
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,475
Call an ambulance.

733
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,352
- Help me.
- I'm gonna help you.

734
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,771
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

735
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,939
I'm gonna help you.

736
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,982
- I can't move.
- I know.

737
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,276
- I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
- I know. Okay.

738
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,737
- I'm scared.
- Paolo,

739
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,072
you're gonna be fine, I promise.

740
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,156
I don't wanna die.

741
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,783
No, no, no.
You're not gonna die,

742
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,868
you're gonna be okay.

743
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,163
You ready?

744
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,844
Oh, no, no.

745
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,597
Oh, God.

746
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:49,849
Oh, God.

747
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,476
Oh, no, God.

748
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,450
Shh.

749
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:53,908
In nomine Patris, et Fill,
et Spiritus Sancti.

750
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,952
Amen.

751
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,952
Deus,

752
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,705
benedice hunc anulum.

753
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:45,418
Da ut soror quae induat altam fidem

754
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:50,298
in te habeat et remaneat
tibi fidelis in omni tempore.

755
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,426
Accipe hunc anulum,

756
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:57,055
nam aeterno Regi spondes.

757
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,933
Serva fidem cum sponso tuo

758
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:04,395
ut ad cenam nuptialem
aeternae gaudii venias.

759
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,272
Amen.

760
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,274
Amen.

761
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,648
Oh, god.

762
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,531
Come on.

763
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,450
Farfalla! Farfalla!

764
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:10,618
Oh, God.

765
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,251
Carlita.

766
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,169
Come with me, Carlita.

767
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,890
Okay, you go to the bed.

768
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:44,443
I am so sorry that I didn't believe you.

769
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,653
But I believe you now.

770
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,238
Okay?

771
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,281
I'm gonna keep you safe.

772
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,782
I'm gonna get you out of here.

773
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,367
Margaret.

774
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,577
Go, go, go. Over there.

775
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,586
- Margaret.
- You stay away.

776
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,170
I know what you're doing.

777
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,423
We don't want to hurt you.
Just put that down.

778
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,842
I know what you've done with the babies.

779
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,553
You stay away! No!

780
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,763
You stay away from me!

781
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,560
- Remain calm!
- No, no, no!

782
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,706
Please, please, I'm sorry.

783
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,750
No, no, no!

784
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,335
Not in there! Not in there!
Not in there!

785
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,421
No! No! No!

786
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,718
Let me out!

787
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,847
Please let me out!

788
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:55,932
Please!

789
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,748
Breathe. Breathe.

790
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,766
Crucifxus mortuu.

791
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,810
Sede da divinum.

792
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:23,978
Conviction:

793
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,313
I am wanted. I have a task in history.

794
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,484
I am accepted. It is good that I exist.

795
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,528
It is good to be a human being.

796
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,117
Let every human heart
experience your love.

797
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,545
It's not real.

798
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,007
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

799
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,175
What's not real?

800
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,384
Who said that?

801
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:49,373
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

802
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,639
No!

803
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:07,892
Margaret. We have to go.

804
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,727
We have to go. I found the files.

805
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,854
We have to go now. It's just me.

806
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,105
It's just me.

807
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:16,942
Get me out of here.

808
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,570
Yes. I know. I know.

809
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,952
All right, all right.

810
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,996
Father Gabriel. Margaret.

811
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:36,837
I don't understand.

812
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,591
How?

813
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,929
Oh, well done, Margaret. Well done.

814
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,514
Were you followed?

815
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:48,682
What? No.

816
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,017
I don't think so.

817
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,061
Luca, Margaret's driver, brought us.

818
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,272
We can trust him.
He's keeping watch outside.

819
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,149
You two know each other?

820
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,484
- Yes.
- No.

821
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,320
Uh, he tried approaching me.

822
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,821
I thought he was crazy.

823
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,950
It is crazy.

824
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,577
Carlita.

825
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,120
We have to go get her.

826
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:11,372
No, it's not safe.

827
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,623
Not safe?

828
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,291
She's the one who's not safe right now,
Gabriel.

829
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,709
Margaret, after what just happened,

830
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,128
they're not gonna let us
anywhere near that orphanage.

831
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,505
Especially Carlita.

832
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,757
He's right.
It's only a matter of time

833
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,759
before they realize we've got these.

834
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,136
And when they do, they will come for us.

835
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,304
We have to help her.

836
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,014
The only path forward

837
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,641
is to prove what they've done.

838
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,102
Otherwise,
no one will believe a word we say.

839
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,028
There's so many of them.

840
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,113
Yes.

841
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:45,906
Too many.

842
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,035
I had no idea they'd gone to such lengths.

843
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:57,960
I don't understand.

844
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,962
They need a male.

845
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,424
They've only birthed females.

846
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,010
They've all died except for Carlita.

847
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,929
After all these years, so many failures...

848
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,808
They believe the only way

849
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,477
is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

850
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,041
What is this?

851
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:39,126
I told you,
it's the photo from Carlita's birth.

852
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,210
No.

853
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:41,920
This.

854
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:48,927
It's the mark.

855
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,305
Carlita doesn't have the mark on her head.

856
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,059
Hers is here.

857
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,643
What are you talking about?

858
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:57,770
I've seen it.

859
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,399
You see? Carlita.

860
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:03,484
No mark.

861
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,362
The baby in this photo is not Carlita.

862
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:12,826
What does that mean?

863
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:15,913
Brennan?

864
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,498
I don't know.

865
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,211
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for,

866
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,379
then all we have to do

867
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,422
is find a baby with the mark on its scalp.

868
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,882
We must have missed something.

869
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,092
Right?

870
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,157
Where is it?

871
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,410
Why do they all look like this?

872
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,122
The father. He's not human.

873
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:33,824
It's her.

874
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,621
There was another survivor.

875
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,292
A sister?

876
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,586
Did you know about this?

877
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:46,837
No.

878
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,213
They must have kept it hidden away.

879
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:20,537
Look for the mark.

880
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,583
How did he know?

881
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:28,962
He knew where it was.

882
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,454
Margaret, Margaret. Hush.

883
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,748
Margaret. Margaret.

884
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,500
Margaret.

885
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,918
Just let me have a look.

886
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:56,837
Let me look.

887
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,241
Somebody say something.

888
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,786
How is that possible?

889
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:31,788
She's been a ward of the Church

890
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:32,831
her entire life.

891
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,125
They must have moved her around

892
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,168
to cover their tracks.

893
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,545
Carlita must be too young,

894
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,465
so they brought Margaret back
to Rome to...

895
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:42,549
To what?

896
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,428
To what?

897
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,352
I have to get out of here.

898
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:55,979
- You can't leave.
- Don't touch me.

899
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:57,063
- Margaret...
- Don't you touch me!

900
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:58,148
You can't just leave.

901
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,650
Touch me again, I'll fucking kill you!

902
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,830
I'm so sorry.

903
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,336
I'm so sorry this is happening to you,
my child.

904
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,631
But nothing will change
if you decide to leave.

905
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:26,760
It's June 6th.

906
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:27,928
Midnight.

907
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,513
They will be coming for you.

908
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,353
If this is true...

909
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,650
If I am pregnant...

910
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:45,987
then I need it out of me.

911
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,075
I need it out of me now.

912
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,669
Margaret,

913
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:02,629
you all right?

914
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,465
This doctor knows what he's doing?

915
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,301
He's experienced, yes.

916
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,206
Wait. Stop.
What are you doing?

917
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,207
Don't stop.

918
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,293
Make like you're heading for the main road

919
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,711
and then turn off before the arch.

920
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,308
Margaret.

921
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,231
What's happening to me?

922
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:48,498
Hello?

923
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:50,500
Hello?

924
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,170
Can anyone hear me?

925
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:55,630
Yes.

926
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:57,507
I can hear.

927
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:04,514
I can't tell if this is real or not.

928
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:08,935
This is very real, Margaret.

929
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:11,688
Can you untie me?

930
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:13,898
Soon.

931
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,402
Soon it will be all over, I promise.

932
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:22,824
No.

933
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:25,160
- No, no.
- Oh. Oh...

934
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:27,120
You don't have to be afraid.

935
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:30,999
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

936
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,129
I've watched over you

937
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,756
since you were a little girl.

938
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,761
The very first moment we met,

939
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,263
do you remember what I said to you?

940
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,016
That you, Margaret,

941
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:51,019
were the bravest girl I'd ever known.

942
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:55,607
Now you know how special you are to me.

943
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,691
To us.

944
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:03,698
The baby you're about to bear
will redeem the Church.

945
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:06,993
Will bring the people back to God.

946
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:10,538
All because of you.

947
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,582
Don't you understand, Margaret?

948
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:16,294
Your whole life, you've been searching,

949
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,379
waiting for His voice.

950
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,592
But the truth is...

951
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,264
He was always there with you.

952
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,729
He brought you here.

953
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,733
He chose you.

954
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,488
I... No.

955
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,923
There.

956
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,675
You're ready now.

957
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:07,262
Please know that I love you.

958
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,308
I'll be right here.

959
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,048
Stay down.

960
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:53,993
No, no.

961
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,287
No, no. Please.

962
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,343
Please, please, please.

963
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:11,636
No.

964
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,431
No, no, no.

965
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:17,350
No, please.

966
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:22,355
Please.

967
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:23,564
Please.

968
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:57,473
Help me, please.

969
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,768
Please help me. Please.

970
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,228
Please untie me.

971
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,523
Please untie me, I'm in pain.

972
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:11,404
I'm in pain. Please.

973
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,783
Help.

974
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,286
Help me, please.

975
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,288
Please help me.

976
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,540
Help me.

977
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:25,585
Help. I'm in pain.

978
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:29,398
What is it? A boy or girl?

979
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,535
There are two.

980
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:42,828
A girl...

981
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,209
And the other?

982
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,629
A boy!

983
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,717
We have him.

984
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:53,899
In nomine Patris, et Fill,
et Spiritus Sancti.

985
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:00,990
Help.

986
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:03,868
- Help. Help.
- Of course.

987
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,119
Of course, my dear.

988
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:06,954
- I'm in pain.
- Of course.

989
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,544
Can I hold him?

990
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,342
You're sure?

991
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:24,430
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.

992
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:27,725
Bring him here.

993
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:31,687
She's right.

994
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:37,151
It is important for a child
to bond with its mother.

995
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:45,993
We all need the comfort of our mothers

996
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:47,203
in the beginning.

997
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,121
Don't we?

998
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,337
You did so well, my child.

999
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:06,097
You are doing God's work.

1000
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,849
He would be so proud of you.

1001
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,227
Can't you hear Him telling you?

1002
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,479
Don't you hear His voice?

1003
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:19,652
No.

1004
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:25,116
No, I only hear my own.

1005
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,329
No!

1006
01:43:58,232 --> 01:43:59,358
Margaret.

1007
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,486
Stop this.

1008
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,365
Margaret,

1009
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:08,743
give me the baby.

1010
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:12,204
Just give me the baby.

1011
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,341
No!

1012
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,450
Burn everything.

1013
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,202
Leave them both to die.

1014
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:19,123
It's okay.

1015
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:11,652
The man you are looking for.

1016
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,779
The US Ambassador to Rome.

1017
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,490
He will be the new father.

1018
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:21,620
He and his wife will suffer a tragic loss,

1019
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:23,414
and be in need of a child.

1020
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:29,712
The boy will inherit their privilege

1021
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:30,879
and power.

1022
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:36,468
Soon, his darkness will spread

1023
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:41,056
and the world shall be saved.

1024
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:19,178
Baby, you're supposed to eat them.

1025
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,096
You're supposed to eat them like...

1026
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,181
Like that.

1027
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:26,935
What are you doing?

1028
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,105
Come here.

1029
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,278
No, no, no. Here.

1030
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:38,363
This.

1031
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:39,615
No, not this.

1032
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:40,949
You want one?

1033
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:43,410
You want it?

1034
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:46,371
Give it to Mama. Give it to Mama.

1035
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:47,414
Give it to Mama.

1036
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:11,021
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

1037
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,609
I tried just to leave you be.

1038
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:20,864
You need to go.

1039
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:24,076
Now.

1040
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,495
I came to warn you.

1041
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,289
They know you're alive.

1042
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,875
You weren't supposed to survive.

1043
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,043
None of you were.

1044
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,337
Especially the girl.

1045
01:50:38,006 --> 01:50:39,633
She'll be important, Margaret.

1046
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:44,012
I just want to be left alone.

1047
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:46,849
I know.

1048
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:50,978
But they will come for you.

1049
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,289
They've even given it a name.

1050
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:13,542
Your son.

1051
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:17,045
Damien.
