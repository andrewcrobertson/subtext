Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,157
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,690
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,431
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,972
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,974
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,476
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,740
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,145
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,274
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:41,308
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,286
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:45,084
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,351
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,790
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:48,860
After tonight.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,055
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

18
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,663
Can I get anyone more coffee?

19
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,994
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,526
You're welcome.

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,334
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:05,308
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,368
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

24

ain't supposed to stop you...

25

They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

27
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:15,077
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

29
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,521
He walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

30
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:20,113
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,658
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:23,160
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:24,661
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:26,357
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,865
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!

40
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,402
Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:41,412
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,812
The point of the story isn't the girl.
The point of the story is...

43
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,645
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:47,310
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,546
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:51,180
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,722
No more liquor stores?

48
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:55,385
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,927
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50

I don't want to kill anybody,
either.

put us in a situation...

You got the idea
taking their wallets.

99
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,234
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.

100

Thank you.

101
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,406

than we did from the register.

102

- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come into restaurants.

I've seen 'em do it, man.

171
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:32,981
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

172
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,684
Yuck.

173
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,095
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

174
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,196
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

175
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,204
That's counting our guy?

176
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,933
I'm not sure.

177
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:52,407
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

178
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,205
It's possible.

179
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,337
We should have fucking shotguns.

180
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,472
- What's her name?
- Mia.

181
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:01,517
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

182
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,782
I don't know.
However people meet people.

183
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,448
She used to be an actress.

184
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,924
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

185
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,860
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

186
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,385
Pilot? What's a pilot?

187
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,591
Well, you know the shows on TV?

188
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:17,099
I don't watch TV.

189
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,931
Yeah, but you are aware...

190
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,664
that there's an invention
called television...

191
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:22,934
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

192
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,065
Yeah.

193
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:27,042
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

194
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,544
That show's called a pilot.

195
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,910
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

196
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,448
and on the strength
of that one show...

197
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,279
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

198
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,945
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

199
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,648
Some don't, become nothing.

200
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,556
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

201
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:46,824
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

202
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,058
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

203
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,726
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

204
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,598
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

205
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,035
I mean, he got a weight problem.

206
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,537
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

207
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,665
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

208
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,937
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

209
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,443
Word around the campfire is...

210
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:03,742
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

211
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,303
[Elevator dings]

212
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,312
[Elevator motor engages]

213
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:13,981
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

214
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,390
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

215
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:18,053
Well, then, what, then?

216
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:19,959
Gave her a foot massage.

217
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:26,597
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,866
Then what did Marsellus do?

219
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:30,668
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

220
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:33,870
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

221
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,935
Nigger fell four stories.

222
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,879
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

223
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,143
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

224
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,447
Nigger fell through that.

225
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:45,511
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

226
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,513
That's a damn shame.

227
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,957
[Elevator dings]

228
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:55,898
But still, I have to say...

229
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,695
you play with matches,
you get burned.

230
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:58,894
What do you mean?

231
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:01,062
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

232
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,469
a foot massage.

233
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,132
You don't think he overreacted?

234
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,540
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

235
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:10,068
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

236
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:12,273
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

237
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,873
I give my mother a foot massage.

238
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,941
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

239
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,714
on Marsellus' new wife.

240
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:20,382
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

241
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,721
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

242
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,249
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

243
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:26,387
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

244
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,896
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

245
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,592
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

246
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,658
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

247
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:34,795
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

248
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:36,601
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

249
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,403
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

250
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:41,069
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

251
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,669
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

252
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:44,942
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

253
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,983
Have you ever given
a foot massage?

254
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,986
[Chuckles] Don't be telling me
about foot massages.

255
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm the foot fucking master.

256
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,555
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.

257
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:55,090
Got my technique down
and everything.

258
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,854
I don't be tickling or nothing.

259
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,361
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

260
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,722
Fuck you.

261
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,667
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

262
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:08,170
You know, I'm kind of tired.

263
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:09,671
I could use
a foot massage myself.

264
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,173
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

265
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,765
I'm getting
a little pissed here.

266
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,772
- This is the door.
- There it is.

267
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,482
What time you got?

268
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,917
7:22 in the a.m.

269
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,549
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

270
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,194
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

271
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,429
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

272
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,801
to throw Antwan
off a building...

273
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,305
into a glass
motherfucking house...

274
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,865
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

275
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,309
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass...

276
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:49,744
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

277
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,770
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

278
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,612
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

279
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,140
and I'm saying it does.

280
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:58,051
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

281
00:12:58,088 --> 00:12:59,749
and they all meant something.

282
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,780
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

283
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,656
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

284
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,253
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

285
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:09,197
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

286
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,995
Fucking Marsellus knew it...

287
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:14,128
and Antwan should've fucking
better known better.

288
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,933
I mean,
that's his fucking wife, man.

289
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,668
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

290
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,198
You know what I'm saying?

291
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,679
It's an interesting point.

292
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,840
Come on.
Let's get into character.

293
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,488
What's her name again?

294
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,320
- Mia.
- Mia.

295
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,588
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

296
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,322
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida...

297
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:42,991
and he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

298
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,195
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

299
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:50,263
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

300
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:53,002
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

301
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,169
It is not a date.

302
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:58,203
It's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife...

303
00:13:58,281 --> 00:13:59,805
to a movie or something.

304
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,874
It's just good company,
that's all.

305
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,418
[Jules sighs]

306
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:10,720
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

307
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,318
[Jules sighs]

308
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:22,761
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

309
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,296
Hey, keep chilling.

310
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,482
You know who we are?

311
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,143
We're associates
of your business partner...

312
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,915
Marsellus Wallace.

313
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:41,651
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

314
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,887
Let me take a wild guess here.

315
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:52,362
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

316
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:53,994
I thought so.

317
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,597
You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace...

318
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,834
don't you, Brett?

319
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,342
Yeah, I remember him.

320
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:01,775
Good.

321
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,609
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

322
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,081
Sorry about that.
What you having?

323
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,953
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

324
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,682
The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

325
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:15,850
What kind of hamburgers?

326
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:18,860
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

327
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,362
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

328
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,864
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

329
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,197
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

330
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:28,136
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

331
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:30,264
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

332
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,399
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

333
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,977
They're good.

334
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,878
You mind if I try one of yours?

335
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,415
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

336
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:52,996
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.

337
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:55,624
Vincent, you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger?

338
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,334
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

339

[Sniffs] Just over three years.

732

What was it?

738
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:38,321
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

739
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,225
called "Fox Force Five."

740
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:42,890
- What?
- "Fox Force Five."

a bunch of foxy chicks.

two, three, four, five of us.

There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,708
She was the leader.

The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

747

was a demolition expert.

748

00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,730
According to the show...

754
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:19,529
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

755
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,400
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

756

850
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:43,481
He fell out of a window.

851
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:46,982
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

852
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:49,690
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

853
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:53,132
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

854
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:55,158
and yet even another way
is to say...

855
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:58,331
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

856
00:44:58,373 --> 00:45:00,841
Is that a fact?

857
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,809
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

858
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:05,745
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

859
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,713
They.

860
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,512
They talk a lot, don't they?

861
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:11,643
[Chuckles]

862
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,449
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

863
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:16,457
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

864
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:19,324
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

865
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,521
Did it involve the "F" word?

866
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,029
No. No, no, no.

867
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:25,555
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

868
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:30,762
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

869
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,198
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

870
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:38,474
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

871
00:45:38,546 --> 00:45:41,242
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

872
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,614
[Chuckles] Well, I mean...

873
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,915
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

874
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:48,786
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

875
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:51,485
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

876
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:52,994
No, it seemed excessive...

877
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:55,895
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

878
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,398
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

879
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:02,665
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

880
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:04,501
A husband
almost killing another man...

881
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:06,905
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

882
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,806
But did it happen?

883
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:10,606
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

884
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:15,548
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

885
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,016
Really?

886
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:19,019
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

887
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:20,577
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

888
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,850
except Marsellus and Tony.

889
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,949
But when you little scamps
get together...

890
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,584
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

891
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:28,891
Ladies and gentlemen...

892
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,455
now the moment
you've all been waiting for...

893
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:36,596
the world-famous Jack Rabbit
Slim's Twist Contest.

894

[Applause, cheering]

895
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:43,268
This is where
one lucky couple...

896
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:47,475
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

897
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:51,484
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

898
00:46:51,552 --> 00:46:53,019
Right here!

899
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:55,420
I wanna dance.

900
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:57,083
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

901
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,059
No, no, no, no, no, no.

902
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:01,857
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

903
00:47:01,896 --> 00:47:04,626
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

904
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:07,327
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

905
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:10,269
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

906
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:11,771
All right. You asked for it.

907
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,363
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

908
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:15,774
[Applause, cheering]

909
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:22,315
Let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.

910
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,511
Young lady, what is your name?

912
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:29,580

914
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,923
All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:36,088

- WOMAN: Go for it!

916
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,722

an uncomfortable silence?
