1
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,792
LAWRENCE
You don't have to be afraid.

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,792
God has great plans for you.

3
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,334
This child is His way.

4
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,459
MARGARET
There's this girl...

5
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,334
...at the orphanage.

6
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,042
I think that she really needs
someone to look out for her.

7
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:39,250
SILVIA
Carlita...

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,250
...suffers from a touch of madness.

9
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,459
FATHER BRENNAN
You must be very careful, Margaret.

10
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,209
Bad things will start to happen

11
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:50,834
around her.

12
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,000
Evil things.

13
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,167
ANJELICA
It's all for you.

14
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:57,876
MARGARET
No, no, don't.

15
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,959
What does any of this have to do

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,584
with Carlita?

17
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,626
FATHER BRENNAN
This church has maintained power

18
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,000
for thousands of years.

19
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,876
They will stop at nothing

20
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:16,876
to keep it that way.

21
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,626
How do you control people

22
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,959
who no longer believe?

23
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,000
You create something to fear.

24
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,626
I believe the girl is to be the mother.

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,459
MARGARET
The mother of what?

26
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,751
FATHER BRENNAN
It's the mark of the Devil.

27
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:37,334
MARGARET
Hey!

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,125
It's not real. It's not real.

29
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,667
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

30
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,459
ANJELICA
What's not real?

31
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,167
MARGARET
Who said that?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,042
LAWRENCE
This... is very real.
