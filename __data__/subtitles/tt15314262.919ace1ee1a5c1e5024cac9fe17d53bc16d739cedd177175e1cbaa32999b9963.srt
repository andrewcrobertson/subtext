3
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,600
That's them in there, just like that?

4
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Just like that.

5
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I wouldn't go in there for a day or two.

6
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Heard the expression,
kick the hornet's nest?

7
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I'll stay right here, thank you.

8
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Those things scare me to death.

9
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yeah, they've been killing my honeybees.

10
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
A few days unchecked,
they'll wipe out out the whole colony.

11
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What are you gonna do with them?

12
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Well, that's between me and them,
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
That's okay.

14
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,400
I understand these things.

15
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I just wanted to
thank you

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,600
for putting up with me
and all of my bees.

17
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,600
This place was crabgrass and weeds,
and you brought it back to life.

18
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
You're a blessing .

19
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:06,600
No one's ever taken care of me before.

20
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll, uh...

21
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Mr. Clay?

22
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come back at
supper time, let me feed you.

23
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,799
- Boss?
- Got something, yeah?

24
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,198
I got one.

25
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I want it, I need it,
hey, clear my ear

26
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Get this fucking hippie shit down, please.

27
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
Hi, United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

28
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
How may I help you?

29
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
Boyd, uh... hello,

30
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,600
I just got a message saying that
there's a problem with my computer.

31
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Don't you worry,

32
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:47,600
The message you received is from our
United Data Group Antivirus Software.

33
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,580
It's part of the software package
that pre-installed in your computer.

34
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm sorry, I'm not a computer person.

35
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,300
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

36
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Our record shows that you actually
have an older version on your account,

37
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
so what I'm going to need you
to do is uninstall that

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,299
and install the latest version.

39
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,200
I have no idea how to do that,
my daughter set up everything for me.

40
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,300
I would recommend you take
your computer to an IT specialist.

41
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
However, keep in mind that
you will lose all your data,

42
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
since they'll have to
replace the hard drive.

43
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm pretty remote out here,
everything I have is on the computer.

44
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Okay, there is actually a software
package that you can download

45
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
that would allow me to reinstall,
remotely.

46
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Alright, tell me what to do.

47
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,259
Okay, can you type this,

48
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,500
friendlyfriend.net

49
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,800
Spelled just how it sounds.

50
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay.
I'm there.

51
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
And there should be a button
on your screen that says install.

52
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
- Can you click on that button?
- I clicked the button.

53
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,700
So you're about to see some windows
open and close on your desktop

54
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,500
as I reinstall the virus shield for you.

55
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,900
Okay. I hope you fucking
clowns are paying attention.

56
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You stick to the script.

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But not so much that you sound like

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
a goddamn robot.

59
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Alright?

60
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
She has got 10K checking.

61
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA, teacher's pension,

62
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
and holy fucking shit!

63
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Alright, she is a signatory
on a $2 million account.

64
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Some fucking charity.

65
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Alright kids, let the script mining begin.

66
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
My computer's going crazy.

67
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Totally normal.
Just do not touch

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
your keyboard.

69
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
<i><font color="#002aff">This subtitle provide [byME]</font></i>

70
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Because of this inconvenience,

71
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm gonna credit back
your subscription fees.

72
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,350
How about that?
I've gone ahead and deposited $500.

73
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,575
Into the account ending 020.

74
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, that's not my account.
That's an account that I manage.

75
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,525
Can you log into that account,

76
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,550
and verify the transfer,
please, Mrs. Parker.

77
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,588
Just hold on.

78
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:40,600
Yes, there's...

79
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
There's a transfer $50,000.

80
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Set the hook!
With sympathy.

81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Mrs. Parker, I-I made a terrible mistake.
I was supposed to credit you $500,

82
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
but I don't know, I got a stuck key here.
I'm gonna lose my job here.

83
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
I got kids.

84
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
I ain't got fucking kids.

85
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh, I don't want you to get in trouble,

86
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:10,100
but I could wire the amount back.

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
I will need a different
password.

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
One second.

89
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,600
This is the master password
for all of her accounts.

90
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,300
You know, I, um...
I think I should call the bank.

92
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,600
You know what? You're probably right,
but there goes my job.

93
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,000
And there goes all your data.

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,880
My kids' pictures are

95
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,800
on this computer.

96
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Okay.

97
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Boom... fucking yes!

98
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,500
That is what I am talking about!
Come on!

99
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,278
Let me fucking hear it,

100
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:11,600
I fucking love you! people!
I fucking love you!

101
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Hello? Hello,
are you still there?

102
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh!

103
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,500
<i>Fraud Detection.</i>

104
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
What did I do?

105
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Mrs. Parker?

106
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't move.

107
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Don't you fucking move.

108
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Drop the knife.

109
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Hands behind your back.

110
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Slowly, get on your knees
one knee at a time.

111
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Now, who the fuck are you?

112
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
And what are you doing
in my mother's house?

113
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Verona.

114
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm so sorry.

115
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
How do you know my...

116
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,575
Mom...

117
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.

118
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Clear him?

119
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Agent Parker, I know that's
your mother. I understand.

120
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,600
But there's a word where
she commits suicide.

121
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
Suicide?

122
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
You can't be serious.

123
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
That woman loved life,
more than anybody, I know.

124
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
But by all means,
let's just completely ignore

125
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
the big white dude in
her house with a knife.

126
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,000
- Get him up.
- Come on.

127
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,600
It's Clay, right?
Adam Clay?

128
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't have much to say.

129
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,100
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple questions.

130
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Like, What the fuck were you doing
in my mother's house?

131
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I was bringing her a jar of honey.

132
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
A jar of honey?

133
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,400
Who the fuck are you,
Winnie-the-Pooh?

134
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
I keep bees.

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
How do you know my mother?

136
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
I rent some space in the barn from her.

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I have a signed lease.

138
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

139
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
She didn't answer when I knocked.

140
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I noted her car in the driveway.

141
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I heard the smoke alarm
when I entered.

142
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You "noted"?

143
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
You got a law enforcement background?

144
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I told you, I'd take care of bees.

145
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,275
Oh, my God.

146
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,518
His hands test a negative
for gunshot residue,

147
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,200
but the prints on the gun
were your mother's.

148
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,376
It seems, sadly,
it was suicide.

149
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
Mr. Clay,

150
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I need to apologize for last night.

151
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I realize I may have been,
a little aggressive.

152
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
That's understandable.

153
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

154
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
No.

155
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
But I'll sit with you if you like.

156
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
No, thank you.

157
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I wanted to thank you
for taking care of my mom.

158
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

159
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Obviously I could have
done a better job.

160
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Being old can be a lonely thing.

161
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Turn a certain age,
you cease to exist.

162
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Cease to matter.

163
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

164
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
From the heart,
I guess you could say.

165
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

166
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I was born that.

167
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I hated that she was
out here alone.

168
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
She wouldn't leave.

169
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
There's too many memories.

170
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

171
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
You're just like my brother.

172
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

173
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,600
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

174
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,600
She loved him.

175
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
He'd mow the lawn and
you'd think he invented fire.

176
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
You know, while, I graduated
the FBI Academy and she said,

177
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
"Oh, that's nice."

178
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
She got scammed.

179
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Somebody emptied out all her accounts.

180
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Her savings, her retirement,

181
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
her every penny,
maxed out all her cards.

182
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
She was an educator,
director of a charity for kids.

183
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
They got two million
out of that account.

184
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You know who did it?

185
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

186
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
This crew's been operating for two years
and we don't even have names.

187
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
And even if we did, good luck building
an indictment that would stand up in court.

188
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Some defense attorney would just argue that
the elderly victim agreed

189
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

190
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Taking from an elderly person
is as bad as stealing from a child.
Maybe worse.

191
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
If it was.

192
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Someone hurts a child,

193
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Parents, people who
care, ready to step in.

194
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
When someone hurts an older person,

195
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Sometimes they are left
to face the hornets alone.

196
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

197
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
or no one cares.

198
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I care...

199
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And I'm stubborn.

200
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,800
And so help me God, I'm gonna get
these motherfuckers who did this.

201
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I need to take care of the hive.

202
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You've been up all night.

203
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Hive is more important.

204
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you doing?

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
I thought you retired.

206
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,300
I did.

207
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
I need a favor.

208
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
What kind of favor?

209
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
A name, an address.

210
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,500
Easy.

211
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,500
Not easy.

212
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

213
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,200
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

214
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,000
Shoot me the deets
and stand by.

215
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,005
Yeah.

216
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:55,905
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

217
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They're routing all over the world.

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But you found them?

219
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sure.
But who are these people?

220
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm gonna find out.

221
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

222
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,900
The hell you think you're going, pal?

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This United Data Group?

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't know nothing about that.

225
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is private property
and you're trespassing.

226
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm going inside.

227
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm gonna burn it down.

228
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

229
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,650
You're not going any-fucking-where

230
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

231
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you know what they do here?

232
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

233
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,996
One, two, three.

234
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,998
There, I did it for you.

235
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You aware this is a criminal outfit?

236
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Scamming the weakest in our society?

237
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Stealing everything they have?

238
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,901
Do you know that's who you work for?

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm looking for the call center?

240
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah, you're in the right place.

241
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,001
You just have to sign in here.

242
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Tell any other companies
in the building to evacuate now.

243
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,001
- There's gonna be a fire.
- Okay, thanks.

244
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,900
Hang up the phone.

245
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,000
Nah, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing here.

246
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
Hang up the phone.

247
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Uh, Ms. Perkins?

248
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
So sorry,
I'll have to...

249
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

250
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
I Need your attention please.

251
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Repeat after me.

252
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
I will never steal from the weak.

253
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
and the vulnerable again.

254
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,396
I sent you
a department download,

255
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,064
and we'll find out
what's going on...

256
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Repeat after me.

257
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I will never steal from the weak

258
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
and the vulnerable again.

259
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
I will never steal from the weak
and the vulnerable again.

260
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
To help you keep that promise,

261
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

262
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Might be a good time to go home.

263
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Hey!
Oh, my God!

264
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
It's gas!
You fucking psycho!

265
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's gas!

266
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's gas!

267
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's gas!

268
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's gas!

269
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

270
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What the fuck, bro?

271
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

272
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm the beekeeper.

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
To protect the hive.

274
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

275
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is a multi-million
dollar operation, asshole.

276
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, so you can't come up here

277
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
white-knighting shit.

278
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Will you stomp his ass out, please?

279
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,952
I got it.
I got it.

280
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:21,800
You fucking get him.
You fucking get him.

281
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

282
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Mister...?

283
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,700
- Uh, uh, G-Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

284
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I don't care if your friends here,
live or die.

285
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,000
The next call from your
little phishing scam.

286
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
To this call center
will make a spark

287
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
across these wires.

288
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here.

289
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I promise you...

290
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
anything alive in here won't be.

291
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,900
Uh guys, we might wanna dip out.

292
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Hey, what's going on?

293
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Uh, let me get

294
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
flat white, oat milk, of course,

295
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
and uh, extra shot of espresso.

296
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,400
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

297
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Good morning.
Did we get the

298
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
otoro and the onion in?

299
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

300
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Finally. Great.

301
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Arigato gozaimasu.

302
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
- Hey, um, Mikaela.
- Yes

303
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
It came back.
The whole thing?

304
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Yeah, and it's like,
I can barely fucking move.

305
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
It's all tweaked.

306
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
- Oh, those are nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

307
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Those are the new bowls?

308
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah.

309
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,600
That's perfect.

310
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Thank you.

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,100
What?
I'm in a meeting.

312
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
You said hit me on voice
if there's an emergency.

313
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

314
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,300
it seems we had

315
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
a disgruntled customer.

316
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

317
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Just get in touch
with the attorney

318
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
and start shoving back.

319
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal is...

320
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
gonna help much.

321
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

322
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
This dude just strolls in,

323
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
saying we're stealing from people,

324
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
and he just tears through

325
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
all my security guys, like fucking

326
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
tissue paper and um...

327
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
And what?

328
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
And he burns the place to the ground.

329
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah. The call center is gone.

330
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm standing here staring

331
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,600
at a $30 million building,

332
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
it's now like a giant fucking

333
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
ashtray.

334
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Four people didn't get out.

335
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,100
You're telling me that this asshole
burned the entire building down

336
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
and dropped four fucking bodies?

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Yeah, that's not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

338
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Who did this?
Give me a name right now!

339
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Sir, I don't have it.

340
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
All the cameras
and the, the drives

341
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
burned up in the fire.
He had a hat.

342
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,200
Oh, he had a hat.
Okay, I'm gonna hit you back, alright?

343
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

344
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Hey, I need to talk to you.

345
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
About what?

346
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
What, what, no, nothing.
I mean, if I had a friend

347
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
who, like, had a call center and someone

348
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
burned it down,
maybe killed some people

349
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
you could get him, right?

350
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Get him?

351
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, like, disappear the problem.
Come on.

352
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
That's way above my pay grade.

353
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You, you literally ran the CIA

354
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
and you're telling me
you can't just

355
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
find some guy in Massachusetts?
Listen, this sounds

356
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
like a job for the police.

357
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I just need a name.

358
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Well, you won't get it from me.

359
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
And you keep me
a million miles away

360
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
from your metaverse meth lab
or whatever it is.

361
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Yup.

362
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
So, check it out.
Daddy can't

363
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
hold your hand on this one.

364
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
This is clearly
some kind of crime with

365
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
passion, spur of the moment.

366
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Someone snapped, like,
whatever, but

367
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,945
what we're gonna do is
I'm going to send you some credentials,

368
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:41,600
You're gonna log into our cloud
and you're gonna look at

369
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
anyone connected to the last
few deals you closed, alright?

370
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Just, I don't know,
start there.

371
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

372
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Then what?

373
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,100
You get a wrecking crew together

374
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,755
and you "go Goodfellas" on him.
I mean, come on,

375
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,600
you're a connected guy, right?
Do you understand?

376
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,600
Yeah, No, I understand.

377
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I, uh, I'll get it done.

378
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
It's called the day off.

379
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,600
V, you good?

380
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

381
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,000
I mean, you did lose your mother

382
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
yesterday.

383
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Yeah.

384
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
- What do you want Wiley?
- Are you leaving? Please don't go.

385
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm going to yoga.

386
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Remember United Data Group?

387
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
Go on.

388
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Are you sober enough to drive?

389
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah.

390
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Give us a few seconds, thank you.

391
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Where's mine?

392
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
It's an old cup from my car
with instant gas station's hot water.

393
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Ew.

394
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
- You want a sip?
- No.

395
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
So the fire fried

396
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
all the CCTV footage,

397
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude,

398
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
in his 40's, manhandled security

399
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
and walked in with couple gas cans.

400
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,900
These clowns saw everything,
but no one's talking.

401
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,238
They're all frequent players
with perjury,

402
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,600
fraud, and cyber beefs.

403
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Fucking scumbags.

404
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
I want IDs on all of them.

405
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
You know, this is just the tip
of like, 20 spears, right?

406
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Can I just have this moment?

407
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Eloise Parker.

408
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah, I took her for over
2 millions yesterday.

409
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
She's, uh, she's black.

410
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Widow, just has a daughter in Boston.

411
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I don't think this is it,
but, you know...

412
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

413
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
That's him.

414
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
What the hell are those?

415
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,600
What?
Fucking beehives.

416
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Yeah, Dickhead was talking about them.

417
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
I guess he's, like, Bee lover.

418
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,800
You know what?

419
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
He breaks my shit.

420
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
You break his shit.

421
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Where you at, Bee Boy?

422
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
You fucking hiding, bitch?

423
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Well, come out and fucking face us!

424
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Bye, bitch, now!

425
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Let's go.

426
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
No.

427
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,075
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

428
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Can someone like,
fucking help me?

429
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:55,225
Fuck.

430
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,500
No! I'm okay.

431
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,205
W-we can talk about this,

432
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:05,576
L-Lets work this out.
me and you. We can fix...

433
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
No, no!

434
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Oh, no!
Oh, w-wait!

435
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
What the heck are you doing?

436
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Oh. Oh. Oh.

437
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,220
Oh, my God.

438
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,420
Oh.
Oh.

439
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,280
So help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

440
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,780
What's the nature of your business?

441
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,520
I don't know nothing
about no business.

442
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,680
So then why are people just wiring you

443
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,920
their entire life savings?

444
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,700
Must be your winning personality.

445
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,940
We've got some lawyers
and they want to talk to them.

446
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,660
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

447
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,620
Did you steal it out of a casket,
you dog fucker?

448
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,740
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,260
Verona, if you're done
shitting all over

450
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,780
this gentleman's civil rights,

451
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,380
can I speak to you for a moment?

452
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
That's a nice shirt.

453
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,180
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

454
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I'm an asshole.

455
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,380
Oh, so you like fires?

456
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,900
Yeah, today I do.

457
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

458
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,900
'Cause apparently, your mother's
house is on fire too,

459
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
and some other shit.

460
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,980
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

461
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, shit's on fire, let's go.

462
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,820
You good?

463
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
V, you okay?

464
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,860
Yeah.

465
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

466
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,420
Where's Maggie?

467
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,500
Hey, Maggie,

468
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,340
ID?

469
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,500
United Data Group.

470
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
Well, he's handsome.

471
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,580
Thank you.

472
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,340
Are you okay?

473
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,500
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good.
I'm good.

474
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,020
You think there's even
a remotest chance

475
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,740
that the dude who burned down
the United Data Group

476
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,020
is the same guy renting
this spot from your mother?

477
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,780
The beekeeper.

478
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,340
I lost my virginity in that barn.

479
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,020
Fucking shit.

480
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
The universe is gonna have to wait.

481
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
I gotta take this.

482
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,960
Yo. What's up, playa?

483
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,660
This is the part where you tell me
what a good job you did

484
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,460
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

485
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

486
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,060
You fucked this up, are you?

487
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Are you fucking crying right now?

488
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,260
I'm not crying.
I'm bleeding.

489
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

490
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,620
What do you mean bleeding?

491
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,940
My fingers.

492
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,820
On my right hand.

493
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,060
He cut them off.

494
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,620
Okay, fuck off.

495
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,300
Go.
Go.

496
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,820
He, who the fuck is he?

497
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,540
Tell me who he is right now.

498
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,580
I-I don't know.
A fucking beekeeper.

499
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,300
Makes honey,
and fucks with bee hives.

500
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,340
He fucks with beehives?

501
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,460
What's he saying about bees?

502
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
I don't know.

503
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,940
He said he was, like, protecting
the hive or something.

504
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,580
Oh, fuck, man!

505
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,820
What the fuck is this?

506
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,500
Guys.
No, no, no, no!

507
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
whoa, whoa, whoa...

508
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,860
What do you want from me?
You want crypto? NFTs?

509
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,460
I got fucking NFTs.

510
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,540
What are you fucking... What?

511
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,720
What?
No! Dude,

512
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,080
What the fuck is this, man?

513
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,700
Don't move.

514
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,900
I fucking can't move!

515
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,580
You're fucking crazy, man.

516
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
What the fuck, bro?

517
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:20,133
No! No! No!

518
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,158
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

519
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,040
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

520
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Fuck you.

521
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
That's who.

522
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,560
You burned my million-dollar
fucking call center.

523
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Now I'm gonna burn you down.

524
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
You haven't told me your name.

525
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I told you my name.

526
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
That's fuck you,
Mr. Fuck You,

527
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
and you better fucking remember it.

528
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Because you don't burn me down,
I burn you down.

529
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
You understand me?

530
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,860
You're fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

531
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
You sound young.

532
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
I bet you don't
have estate planning.

533
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,060
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

534
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm about to show you.

535
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,827
Breaking news in Springfield,

536
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:35,560
where three bodies
have been discovered

537
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
following an arson fire at a small farm.

538
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,940
There was an office building explosion.

539
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
And you say one guy did this?

540
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
Yup.

541
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,940
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot?

542
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Yup. And he said
he was gonna kill me.

543
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,941
And this is your data mining

544
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,140
consumer service business, right?

545
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,140
Yes, something like that.

546
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Pulling in 9 million a month,
one office, I've got like 20.

547
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,140
Yeah.

548
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,140
The only thing you know about him
is he says he's a beekeeper.

549
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Yeah, it's like his whole brand
or whatever.

550
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Jesus.

551
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,140
What?

552
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,628
For someone who has elevated

553
00:39:28,652 --> 00:39:32,140
fucking up into an art form.

554
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,140
This might well be your Mona Lisa.

555
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
How did I fuck up?

556
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,140
I don't know.
You've done something.

557
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,140
You've disturbed a beekeeper.

558
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,472
Oh. Oh, okay.

559
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:49,140
So fucking what?
What I care if the guy keeps bees?

560
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,140
If a beekeeper says you're gonna die,
you're gonna die.

561
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,140
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

562
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,028
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

563
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,740
What good are you?

564
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah.

565
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,060
I did 35 years of loyal government service,

566
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,060
culminating as director of the world's
premier intelligence agency.

567
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,540
I could have done anything.

568
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,560
But I chose this job as
a favor to your mother,

569
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,140
I keep Danforth Enterprises safe.

570
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

571
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
It's my fucking name too, alright?

572
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Oh, sit down.

573
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,140
I put up with you.
I put up with your tantrums.

574
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Kept you out of the tabloids.
Kept you out of jail.

575
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,840
The endless stream of sex workers.

576
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,840
You're a drowning man.
Do you know that?

577
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,040
Hmm, You're scared?

578
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,440
Dead right. I'm scared.

579
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Terrified.
So should you be.

580
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,540
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

581
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,440
He's probably the last pair of eyes
that you're gonna sneer at.

582
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,760
Okay, listen.

583
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,607
Remember our favorite burning building?
United Data Group.

584
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:24,598
The guys who work there are hackers,
con men, fraudsters, et cetera, et cetera.

585
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:26,560
Guy who ran it.
Garnet.

586
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,760
He's in the book.
He's a known mob associate.

587
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,297
He's missing, but I've got
PD chasing him down.

588
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,460
Okay, so I had some
analysts run some shit,

589
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,460
and I think I'm starting to get
the shape of the animal.

590
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Dude, I think United Data Group
is one of several call centers,

591
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,960
so there's gotta be like a central office
that's controlling all of them,

592
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,060
and that's what we've gotta find.

593
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Wiley, this could be like
a billion-dollar-a-year operation.

594
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Hello. Hey! Did you hear
a single word I just said?

595
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,140
Yeah.

596
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,140
And?

597
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,140
I'm just thinking you come in here
hungover on your day off,

598
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:05,140
and gain more yardage on this thing
than the whole squad has in two years.

599
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Yeah, well, they fucked with my family.

600
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
What'd you get on, Clay?

601
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Your beekeeper?

602
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Yeah.

603
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
He's a ghost.

604
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
What?

605
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Yeah, all I have is a birth certificate
and a social.

606
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,140
The guy's never even had a bank account,
credit card, flown on a plane.

607
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,760
I ran his prints to every database
I could think of.

608
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,060
No hits.

609
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,140
That's bullshit. This dude is
former military all day.

610
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,040
No hits, I'm telling you.

611
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,640
Either he's never been printed
or Adam Clay doesn't exist,

612
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,540
which is terrifying to me because
he's probably in a classified program.

613
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Special Agent Wiley.

614
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Okay. Let's go.

615
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
What?

616
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,740
They found the guy, Garnet.

617
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,440
- What?
- They found him. Let's go.

618
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
Oh, shit.

619
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Jessica.

620
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
I think you know why I'm calling.

621
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,840
You know I'd do anything for you.
Anything.

622
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,740
For you.

623
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Derek's scared shitless.
I've never seen him this scared.

624
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,140
Well, he's made his bed.

625
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,340
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

626
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,140
That's another million a year.

627
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.

628
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,140
Look, I don't need that.
I have enough.

629
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
So you got this?

630
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Yeah, you have my word.

631
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,540
Wallace, I still think of you.

632
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,340
Sometimes.

633
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
Sometimes.

634
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,040
Why are you calling me
on a "never-call-this-line" line?

635
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,260
This is priority one, Janet.

636
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,460
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

637
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,360
Look, I'm heading downtown to
a POTUS brief.

638
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,060
Just hear me out. Now, you know
who I work for, don't you?

639
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:11,084
Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.

640
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,235
Exactly.

641
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,140
Well, Director Harward.

642
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,540
My young friend seems to have caught
the unwanted attentions of...

643
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,140
I don't know how else
to say this, of a beekeeper.

644
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,140
Yeah.

645
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,940
A beekeeper, beekeeper?

646
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,940
As in.

647
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,140
Well, that's not good.

648
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
No, it's not.

649
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,140
What's the body count?

650
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Seven today.

651
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,140
You busy making funeral
arrangements?

652
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,140
I need help, Janet,
not jokes.

653
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,140
Is that Garnett?

654
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,140
He was strapped to an old pick up.

655
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,640
Check this out.

656
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,640
Does this mean you've taken pity
on the old man?

657
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,140
So your problem...

658
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,140
He's retired from the program.

659
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,440
No longer active.

660
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Well, that changes everything.

661
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,240
The current active beekeeper
is aware of the issue

662
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,140
and is going to be
taking things from here.

663
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,140
You can rest easy, old friend.

664
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,840
Oh, no, Janet, the current active
beekeeper is a fucking lunatic

665
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,140
who should have been removed
months ago.

666
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,140
God help us now.

667
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:39,164
Your services are required.

668
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,112
Forward it.

669
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,236
Eliminate Adam Clay.

670
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
what fun, hahaha.

671
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,640
Get out of here!

672
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,340
Shit!

673
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,716
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

674
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,740
You've been a busy bee.

675
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,640
You're supposed to be retired.

676
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm assuming you're my replacement.

677
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
Shit!

678
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Ah!

679
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,460
Fuck you!

680
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,860
Ah!

681
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
<i><font color="#002aff">This subtitle provide [by:ME]</font></i>

682
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
I need your keys.

683
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,140
There's an issue.

684
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,140
Problem has not been solved.

685
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,440
Well, that is a surprise.

686
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
The beekeepers have studied the situation

687
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,140
and have decided to remain neutral.

688
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,640
How can they do that?

689
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,740
He was their man, for fuck's sake!

690
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
I'm sorry, Wallace.

691
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,840
You're on your own.

692
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,540
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

693
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,340
I can handle this!

694
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,540
Thank you.

695
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,140
What you got for us, Detective?

696
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,940
That's a vehicle registered
to Anisette Landress.

697
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,540
The ATF are en route in bound
to take care of it.

698
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,740
We're way cooler than the ATF.

699
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,840
I'll show you why I called them.

700
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,748
That's a minigun.

701
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:14,674
They use those on military
vehicles.

702
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:16,760
Do you know that puppy
shoots 6,000 rounds a minute?

703
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,560
I know.

704
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
Do you know that's
100 rounds a second?

705
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Yep, I know.

706
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Did you know that you know a lot?

707
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,060
Yes, I do.

708
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,140
It's because I minored in math.
I'm a pretty smart guy actually.

709
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,540
Okay, then do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

710
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,640
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

711
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,640
Someone who doesn't exist in
any commercial or government database.

712
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,640
Someone who's a ghost,
like our good friend Adam Clay.

713
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
"Beekeeping for beekeepers."

714
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,672
Here's another reason that

715
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,940
Anisette Landress is like
our good friend Adam Clay.

716
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,140
Do you know what's that way?

717
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,940
Springfield.

718
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,540
Where the call center was torched.

719
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,440
And that way,
where Adam Clay's headed?

720
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,640
Boston.

721
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,140
Let's go.

722
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,540
How are you, my friend?

723
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:30,140
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

724
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,840
Come on, leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

725
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,840
Don't play with those things.
They go off.

726
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Sit down,
Make yourself comfortable.

727
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,940
When I was sworn in as director,

728
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,540
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

729
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,760
Well,

730
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,560
there are programs

731
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,560
even I wasn't privy to.

732
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Like the beekeepers.

733
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,140
The honeybee...

734
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,340
has always had a special
relationship with humanity.

735
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
A sacred relationship.

736
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,560
Why?

737
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:10,779
No bees, no agriculture,

738
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:13,360
no agriculture, no civilization.

739
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,360
Our nation

740
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,560
is not unlike a beehive

741
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,560
with its complex systems of

742
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,560
workers, caretakers,
even royalty.

743
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,560
If any of the

744
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
beehive's complex mechanisms

745
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,560
are compromised,

746
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,560
the hive collapses.

747
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,560
Someone a long time ago decided that

748
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,560
a mechanism was needed

749
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,560
to keep our nation safe.

750
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,560
A mechanism outside the chain of command.

751
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
Outside the system.

752
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,060
It's one mission

753
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,260
to keep the system safe.

754
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,160
Beekeepers,
are given all resources,

755
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,560
empowered to act

756
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,060
on their own judgment.

757
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:00,540
For decades they have quietly
worked to keep the hive safe.

758
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,140
That is, until now.

759
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,860
It appears that

760
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,560
a retired beekeeper

761
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
has gone off program and is acting

762
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,560
in what he mistakenly believes

763
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,560
is the hive's best interest.

764
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,210
Can't somebody just pick up the phone

765
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,060
and tell this yahoo to stand the fuck down?

766
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,640
That's the one thing beekeepers don't do.

767
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,140
Stand down.

768
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,640
Not unlike bees themselves.

769
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,040
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

770
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,640
So he's basically one of us.

771
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,460
No.

772
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,060
He's not like you.

773
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,060
You're Tier 1 operators.

774
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,140
Form a SEAL Team 6,
Delta group.

775
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
You are in other words,

776
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
pussies.

777
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
If you were in the same room,

778
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,560
he would kill you.

779
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,560
With enough of you, then maybe

780
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,560
you just might

781
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,560
in fact be able to kill him

782
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,560
before he accomplishes his goal.

783
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,560
What would that be?

784
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,560
To kill his way

785
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,560
to the top of the hive.

786
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,240
Mr. Pettis, you should get
your people moving.

787
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,140
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits. Did you know that?

788
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,630
I know, they pollinate
a bunch of shit

789
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:22,140
and we'd be fucked without them.

790
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,140
Listen.

791
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,550
Some bees are queen slayers,
which will rise up and kill their queen

792
00:54:26,774 --> 00:54:31,140
if she fails to produce
the right kind of male offspring.

793
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,140
Fascinating.

794
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,640
No.

795
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,040
Nope.

796
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,140
- No.
- It's your turn!

797
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,340
- No.
- You can't.

798
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,140
Special Agent Parker.

799
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,140
Yeah.

800
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:55,140
Okay.
Thank you.

801
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,740
What?

802
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,040
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

803
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,540
This is your fault.

804
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,140
This subtitle provide by[ME]

805
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,940
Here's another interesting factoid.

806
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,860
Thank fuck.

807
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,560
You know, I was getting sick

808
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
of enjoying my peaceful thoughts.

809
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Sir.

810
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,934
So this is Special Agent Parker,
Special Agent Wiley.

811
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,140
they'll be briefing you.

812
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,140
This is Deputy Director Prigg
and Amanda Munoz, Special Counsel.

813
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,140
Mr. Deputy Director.

814
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,479
My colleague and I believe,

815
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,452
that 3 major crime scenes in our area

816
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:03,178
are connected to a single subject,

817
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:04,360
Adam Clay.

818
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,548
He killed six people today
based on the extensive use

819
00:57:07,572 --> 00:57:10,560
of tradecraft and
the nature of his alias.

820
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,214
We believe that Mr. Clay
is connected to

821
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:14,460
a classified program named
Beekeeper,

822
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,112
A program that none of
our partner agencies

823
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:18,136
seem willing to acknowledge.

824
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,440
Let's stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

825
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,725
Yes, sir. In any event,
this individual is highly capable

826
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:27,140
and extremely motivated.

827
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,303
And we believe that
he's on his way to Boston,

828
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:30,440
if not already here.

829
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,540
And we believe that
this is his next target.

830
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,451
Nine Star United,

831
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:38,450
which appears to be the entity
operating the regional call centers

832
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:40,141
like the one that Mr. Clay burned down.

833
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,840
Why is Adam Clay on this rampage?

834
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,355
He's protecting the hive, sir.

835
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:50,440
It's what Beekeepers do.

836
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,315
I have enough to brief the director.

837
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,850
- What's your ask?
- My ask?

838
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:58,310
Well, a SWAT team for starters,

839
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,740
surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

840
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,340
That shouldn't be a problem.

841
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,040
Thank you.

842
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,160
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

843
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
Alright, everybody. Listen up.
It's roll call times.

844
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,296
I'm getting ready for
my dick to get hard

845
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,340
with some wonderful
beautiful numbers.

846
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Let's start with Phoenix.
Where are we at?

847
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,240
Phoenix is up 101K.

848
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,140
200K I'm gonna suck your dick.
I love you.

849
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,140
New Orleans, show me,
Tell me. Where we at?

850
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,640
It's down 92K, boss.

851
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,487
Down? You're a fucking loser.

852
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,140
You give me a fucking headache.
You give me fucking cancer.

853
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,940
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

854
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,140
New York City's up 64x K.

855
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,440
I love you, New York.

856
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,140
Gather round.
I want all weapons front on entry.

857
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,540
-Everybody give me an oos!
-Oos!

858
00:59:03,564 --> 00:59:04,664
Let's go!

859
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,940
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

860
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,140
The Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

861
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,340
State Department certified
to carry weapons in all 50 states.

862
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,240
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers to verify.

863
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,140
You're not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

864
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,040
Alright, boys. Let's go.

865
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,140
Set up a perimeter outside.

866
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,140
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

867
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,540
Money, money, money.
We fucking love it.

868
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

869
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,740
who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

870
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,140
We're the guys keeping you alive.
Shut it down now.

871
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,540
Everybody listen up.

872
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,140
Anyone who's not carrying a weapon,
Get the fuck out!

873
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,180
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

874
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:53,240
Listen to me, my friend.

875
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,140
This place prints money.
No one's shutting it down.

876
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,940
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired!

877
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,009
I'm sorry to break it to you,

878
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,640
but bin Laden's been dead
for a while.

879
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,640
So I'm going to say this one last time.

880
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,640
- Shut it down.
- The fuck I am.

881
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,340
- Call your fucking boss.
- You want me to call my boss?

882
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:16,240
I'll do that.

883
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,140
And you'll be so fucked.

884
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,740
it's gonna be beautiful.

885
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,240
Don't be shy.
Come on.

886
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,140
What about the parking garage.

887
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,140
Closed and locked.
Steel gate.

888
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,140
I want a body on comms,
watching it.

889
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,140
-Delivery dock?
-Same deal.

890
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,140
-Station an agent there too.
-Yes, sir.

891
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,140
Sure there's no back
entrances into this place?

892
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,640
Hey, there's no other entrances.

893
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,640
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

894
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Move along at minimum retreat
to a safe distance. Thank you.

895
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,840
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

896
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,612
The other option,
instead of going in,

897
01:00:47,636 --> 01:00:48,840
is to smoke them out.

898
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,140
Excuse me?

899
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:53,140
I figured I'd give
the firefighters a break.

900
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,840
I've put them through
enough already.

901
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,340
What'd you say your name was?

902
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,817
Currently I'd go by Adam Clay.

903
01:00:58,841 --> 01:00:59,940
Trust me.

904
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,940
If there was a back entrance,
I would've used it.

905
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:05,140
I don't wanna injure anyone
who's innocent or non-involved.

906
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,840
But it is what it is.

907
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,040
Somebody detain this guy!

908
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,140
Stop!

909
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
Ah!

910
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,540
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

911
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,560
Oh, wow. If it isn't the fucking
Golden Goose himself.

912
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,360
Sir, I got Captain Caveman here
telling me to send everyone off.

913
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,360
If we do that, we're walking
away from a lot of money.

914
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,460
Mm, put him on.

915
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,360
It's for you.

916
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,660
Why are you fucking with my business?

917
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,160
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me
to kick some fucking beekeeper ass.

918
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:12,860
Mr. Westwyld works for me,
which means that you work for me.

919
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:16,160
Now listen, that place is
the crown jewel of my kingdom.

920
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,460
I'm not going to let some crash test dummy
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

921
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,660
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

922
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,560
Didn't this character already burn
one of your centers to the ground?

923
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,960
Well, you know, they didn't
have you, and that's why.

924
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,160
So maybe you just do your fucking job
and don't tell me how to do mine, please.

925
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,360
- We got it?
- Copy that.

926
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,340
Fall out.

927
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,840
Set up a perimeter outside.

928
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Let's go.
Move.

929
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,140
Round applause.

930
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,140
Let's say goodbye to our good friends.

931
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,140
Bye bye, Admiral.

932
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,140
Go join fucking Space Force.

933
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,340
You're a beautiful...

934
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,540
Now get the fuck out!

935
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,940
Keep walking.

936
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,140
Bye bye, dickhead.

937
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:54,845
What a bunch of jackoffs.

938
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,140
Yeah.
We love you.

939
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,560
One-time amnesty.

940
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,760
Whoever doesn't want to die this evening,
can in an orderly fashion.

941
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,460
Leave now.

942
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,560
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It's not happening.

943
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,560
Anybody moves, you're fired.
No bonus...

944
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,060
- Come on, boys! Move, move!
-  no vesting, no 2 weeks.

945
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340
Nada.
Zero!

946
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,585
Are you fucking nuts?

947
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:25,701
Each one of these pricks.

948
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:27,940
it's worth 30 to 40
million a year in profit.

949
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,540
so no one is shooting no gun.

950
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,160
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

951
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,560
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

952
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,560
For either one of us
to close that distance,

953
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,060
Some of them will get hurt.

954
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
Let's start with this prick right here.

955
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,640
On me!

956
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,540
Take right!

957
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,140
Pettis, we got a man down.

958
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,140
Oh!

959
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,140
Fire... Fire.

960
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,140
Fire.

961
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,140
Fire... Fire.

962
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,140
Fire.

963
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,140
You know who you're working for?

964
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,140
None of my fucking business.

965
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,140
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

966
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,740
And you are our problem.

967
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:10,140
Goddamn right,
I'm a problem.

968
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,140
Fire.

969
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,140
Fire.

970
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,140
Fire.

971
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,140
Damn, what the hell happened?

972
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,640
- Any dead?
- Not dead, but we got our asses kicked.

973
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,420
Our guy?
What do we know?

974
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,640
He's in the building.
I'm waiting for more men to roll in.

975
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,140
I don't know what this guy is,
but nobody can do what he's done.

976
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,140
He's just a beekeeper.

977
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,240
Bad idea.

978
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,140
I'm not waiting.

979
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,140
- V, wait!
- Move!

980
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,140
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

981
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,740
Fuck.

982
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:25,920
We got him!

983
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,040
-You done?
-Reload.

984
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,840
Everybody out!

985
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
You're done.

986
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,240
We should take the stairs.

987
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,240
Smart.

988
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,140
Subject is in the hallway.

989
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,040
Command, report back.

990
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Anybody on comm?

991
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,560
Please, please don't kill me.

992
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,560
I'm just a middle manager.

993
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,560
I never hurt nobody.

994
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,048
I'd respect you more
if you look people

995
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:44,560
in their eyes when
you stole from them.

996
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,140
You're making a lot of money here.

997
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,140
Tell me where it's all going.

998
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,140
I don't know, man.

999
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,140
Ow!

1000
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,140
I know you're the middle man.

1001
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,140
Who's above you?

1002
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,140
No. They'll kill me.

1003
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,140
I'll torture you,
then kill you.

1004
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,140
Come on, guys, you got it.

1005
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,140
Wiley, get your ass up here.

1006
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,140
Yeah, well,
I'm not an Olympian.

1007
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,140
Make it stop.

1008
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,140
You can make it stop.

1009
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,140
You've stolen hundreds of millions

1010
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,140
from people who've done nothing

1011
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,140
but work hard all their lives.

1012
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,140
She was an educator, a mom.

1013
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,140
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1014
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,140
Yesterday she shot herself.

1015
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,140
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1016
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,140
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1017
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,140
Who?

1018
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,140
Where?

1019
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,140
Mr. Anzalone.

1020
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,140
Tell me who and where.

1021
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,140
I can't.

1022
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,140
Look, these people,
they're untouchable. I can't...

1023
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,140
No, please, please, stop.

1024
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,140
I will, I will.

1025
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,140
Let me show you.

1026
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,140
Let me show you.

1027
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:40,415
I told you they are untouchable.

1028
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,933
Nobody's untouchable.

1029
01:09:47,097 --> 01:09:49,240
Sometimes when the hive's
out of balance,

1030
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,490
you have to replace the queen.

1031
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,940
Clay!

1032
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,140
That man is directly responsible
for your mother's death.

1033
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
I believe you.

1034
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,140
But we have laws for these things.

1035
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,140
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1036
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,140
Then you have me.

1037
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,125
Arrest him!

1038
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:36,364
On your feet before
I blow your fucking head off!

1039
01:10:36,388 --> 01:10:37,588
I just been thrown through
a plate-glass window!

1040
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:40,412
Shut your fucking mouth!

1041
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,440
Whoa.
I've four kids.

1042
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,140
I know.

1043
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,240
Three boys and a girl.

1044
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,440
Wiley?

1045
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,140
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1046
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,740
- You okay?
- He went that way.

1047
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,840
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1048
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,140
Okay, well, I won't
tell her if you don't.

1049
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,840
Have you been hit?

1050
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,840
- No, I'm good, Mom.
- Yeah?

1051
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:22,015
Did you get him?

1052
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,140
Did you?

1053
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,140
No, he's tricky, almost though...

1054
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,140
You okay?

1055
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,240
I guess that's just evidence.

1056
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,240
Can I borrow your gun?

1057
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,140
Yeah, let's go.

1058
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,140
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
- Clear!

1059
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,840
I want interviews with all of them.

1060
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,140
We're gonna talk.

1061
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,140
Get him out of here.

1062
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
Wiley.

1063
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,140
Holy shit.

1064
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,360
Do you mind if I ask you
a really boring question?

1065
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,560
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1066
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,960
Mm, that's deep...

1067
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,140
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

1068
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Oh, God. Uh...

1069
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,640
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Come upstairs.

1070
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,140
You said these guys were
the fucking best.

1071
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
Why are they all dead?

1072
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,940
You kicked the beehive, and now
we have to reap the whirlwind.

1073
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,640
- Unless...
- Unless?

1074
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,040
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1075
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,540
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1076
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,590
I'm paying you
so much fucking money

1077
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,028
and your advice is to call my mother?

1078
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,083
He can't make his move on us,

1079
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:20,040
if we're in her proximity, can he?

1080
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,140
Her people.

1081
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,140
You're a fuck.

1082
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,312
- You're scared.
- I certainly am scared.

1083
01:13:31,336 --> 01:13:34,140
and you want to use my mother
as a human shield.

1084
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,140
Just call her.

1085
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,440
Just call her.
Come on.

1086
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,940
- It's not a game.
- Oh, it's all a game.

1087
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,140
Come on.

1088
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,940
Yes, Derek.
What do you want?

1089
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,140
Hey, Mom.

1090
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,140
No, nothing.

1091
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:49,140
I was, just you know,
thinking about you, I miss you.

1092
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,140
I was hoping to maybe
see you this weekend.

1093
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,140
I'm at the beach house.

1094
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,140
You're welcome to join
if you behave.

1095
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:55,140
I would love to.

1096
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,747
And hey, I'm actually was gonna,
you know,

1097
01:13:56,771 --> 01:13:57,940
get together some of
my tech homies and stuff,

1098
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,140
if that's, uh, if that's cool with you.

1099
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,040
Fine,
No drugs.

1100
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Give Kelly the details.

1101
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,240
Love you.
Have to go.

1102
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,840
Derek's joining me this weekend.

1103
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Help me keep him sober.

1104
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,240
Yes, ma'am.
I love babysitting.

1105
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,140
Madame President.

1106
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,140
Funmi Lawal.

1107
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,140
Hello.

1108
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,140
Good to meet you.

1109
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,140
Sola Oyemade

1110
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,140
Sola, thank you so much for coming.

1111
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,140
Susan Aneno.

1112
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,140
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1113
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,140
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1114
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,140
Oli, how good to meet you.

1115
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,140
Great to meet you, ma'am.

1116
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,640
You don't have to do this, you know.

1117
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,840
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1118
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,840
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1119
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,578
Wherever it's headed,

1120
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:51,771
I swore an oath.

1121
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:54,840
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1122
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,240
Even if he's right?

1123
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,040
Even if he's right.

1124
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,540
Apologies.

1125
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,140
Damn plane was delayed.

1126
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,140
What have you got?

1127
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,640
We think we have a sense of
Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1128
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,540
He seems to be following the money.

1129
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,340
What money is that?

1130
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,240
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1131
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,857
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1132
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:34,840
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1133
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,740
There's another company involved.

1134
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,177
Sir, a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1135
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,540
and to the Justice Department.

1136
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,398
In fact, we use this company's
software in this very office

1137
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,340
to identify... financial fraud.

1138
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,540
Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?

1139
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:03,640
Danforth Enterprises, with an annual
revenue of $10 billion,

1140
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:07,140
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1141
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,078
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1142
01:16:10,102 --> 01:16:12,840
as president of
the United States.

1143
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,140
She self-financed her campaign.

1144
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,140
Yeah, none of that money was clean.

1145
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,140
Who else knows this?

1146
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,640
- Us three.
- I have a really bad memory, sir.

1147
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,017
Let's, uh, keep the circle small

1148
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,740
until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.

1149
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,440
Not a word of this to anyone,
understood?

1150
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:32,740
Yes, sir.

1151
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,540
and Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count is steadily rising.

1152
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,840
In a beehive there is something
called a "queen slayer."

1153
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:42,887
It's a bee that will rise
up and kill the queen

1154
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:45,640
if she produces defective offspring.

1155
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,040
I thought we were sticking
to the known, knowns.

1156
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,072
Right, yes, not that
beekeepers exist,

1157
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:53,540
But Mr. Clay does keep honeybees.

1158
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,949
He admires their willingness

1159
01:16:55,973 --> 01:16:58,240
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1160
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,836
Our concern is that
Clay believes that

1161
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,540
Derek Danforth is the defective
offspring of a queen.

1162
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,406
Thereby, Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1163
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:14,140
and become a queen slayer.

1164
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:18,140
Adam Clay's next victim is
Derek Danforth's mother?

1165
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,540
President Danforth, sir.

1166
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,740
You have a blank check.

1167
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,440
Good luck.

1168
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,640
Thank you.

1169
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,940
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1170
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:44,840
This is a private event.

1171
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,840
I'm gonna need you to turn around,
go away.

1172
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,840
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1173
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,140
We're good.
We have invites right here.

1174
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,740
Alright, you'll need
to excuse my partner.

1175
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,740
He's recently concussed
and hasn't slept in two days.

1176
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,740
We're on the access list.

1177
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,140
We're good boss.

1178
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,540
Get the secret service
out of the house.

1179
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,540
I don't want them here.

1180
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,668
They're C-Team.
B-Team at best.

1181
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:33,440
Uh, mom's detail
is not gonna like that.

1182
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,440
Well, if mom's detail gets in
the way of what's coming for us,

1183
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,040
they're dead men.
And so are we.

1184
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,253
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1185
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:43,440
Yes, sir.

1186
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,740
He has a little talent, doesn't he?

1187
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,140
It's absolutely fucking terrifying.

1188
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,840
Good men, but clearly not good enough.

1189
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,640
-Hm.
-Fuck, bruh!

1190
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
How'd you piss this oak off, huh?

1191
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,108
I...

1192
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,240
-You're looking at me?
-Mm-hmm.

1193
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,540
How is any of this my fault?

1194
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,440
Wasn't your super secret CIA
data mining software supposed to,

1195
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,140
I don't know, maybe filter out

1196
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,340
un-fucking-stoppable killing machine?

1197
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,395
Don't you fuck with me, young man.

1198
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,540
Any other life you'd be in jail.

1199
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,140
Hey, this is a fucking beekeeper!

1200
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,439
Yeah, you know, I killed one once.

1201
01:19:22,463 --> 01:19:24,339
- Oh, you see?
- Yeah, only 'cause I was lucky.

1202
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,840
- And un-fucking-lucky.
- Oh, jeez.

1203
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,158
Yeah, don't piss your pants, Bru.

1204
01:19:33,182 --> 01:19:34,440
My team will be out shortly.

1205
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,140
If anyone can knock
this guy's dick in the dirt, it's them.

1206
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,440
Ain't that right,

1207
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,440
Money man?

1208
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,840
Yeah.

1209
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,140
I'm supposed to be at a kid's
birthday party with my wife.

1210
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,040
You are at a kid's birthday party.

1211
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,840
And I'm your work wife.

1212
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,840
Madam Presiden, you look spectacular.

1213
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,840
When the fuck are you going to tell me
what's going on, Wallace?

1214
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,040
Good. Go through.

1215
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,140
Tell that guy to hurry up.

1216
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,140
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1217
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,560
- We got this.
- Alright.

1218
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,160
I'm going to watch your back.

1219
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,140
Yeah.

1220
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,140
Let's go.

1221
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,140
Let's go, let's go.

1222
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,640
Come on. Move it up.

1223
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:29,140
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1224
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,640
Alright.

1225
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,140
Hold on.

1226
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,040
I'm in there now.

1227
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,140
Alright, you're good.

1228
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,340
Hey, when did you get in?

1229
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,640
What a surprise.

1230
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,678
You didn't hear the giant marine

1231
01:22:55,702 --> 01:22:57,640
helicopter land
on the front lawn.

1232
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,140
I guess not.

1233
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:03,140
Is this nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1234
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,128
I wouldn't unless you want to

1235
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:07,140
go talk with the machine elves.

1236
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,540
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1237
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:15,340
I mean, power, it just
looks so good on you.

1238
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,140
Doing below on your father's desk.

1239
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:22,140
God, how I wish
he was still alive,
so I can show him.

1240
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Stop picking your face.

1241
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,440
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1242
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,640
What have you done to the man?

1243
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,540
I wouldn't know, mother.

1244
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,940
Well, he's there to protect
you if you'll let him.

1245
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,540
You're a good-looking kid.

1246
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,640
You really are, you know that?

1247
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,540
What does that mean?

1248
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:53,140
It means that God doesn't
give with both hands.

1249
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,140
Okay, I love you too, Mom.

1250
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,140
Gotta go run the free world.

1251
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,940
Don't burn it down.

1252
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,140
Why are you up?

1253
01:25:07,494 --> 01:25:08,037
Fucking fantastic!

1254
01:25:15,688 --> 01:25:16,981
Wiley, look.

1255
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,140
Oh, shit.

1256
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,140
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1257
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,140
Look at her body language.

1258
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:26,140
Bad vibes.

1259
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,140
She got caught riding dirty.

1260
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,140
What have we done?

1261
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,140
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1262
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:34,140
It's gonna pop.

1263
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,140
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1264
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,140
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1265
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,140
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1266
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,760
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1267
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
Who's this?

1268
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,122
Jackson Prigg he's number two,
at The FBI.

1269
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,640
- Have a seat.
- I'm cool. I'll stand.

1270
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
What is this, like,
an ambush or something?

1271
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,132
This feels weird.
I don't like it.

1272
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,140
No, you'll sit.

1273
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,140
I'll sit.

1274
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,640
Kelly, would you give us a moment?

1275
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,040
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1276
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,040
I need you to step outside.

1277
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,740
The deputy director
has flagged his concerns

1278
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,340
about some uncomfortable
things happening

1279
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,340
inside the family company.

1280
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:25,740
Like what?

1281
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,640
Uncomfortable things about
the source of my campaign funds.

1282
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,040
Sounds serious.
What's up?

1283
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,040
Deputy director.

1284
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,140
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar with

1285
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,740
United Data Group?

1286
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,140
Yeah.

1287
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,140
Yeah.

1288
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,140
I invested in that.

1289
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,140
I invest everywhere.
I mean, it's everywhere.

1290
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,140
It's very diverse.

1291
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,140
How about a Nine-Star United?

1292
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,140
Yeah, that's more of like a consulting

1293
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,140
type of role.

1294
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,140
It's the blockchain issues
and you probably...

1295
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,140
I don't want to bore you
with all that.

1296
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,940
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1297
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,940
data mining software package

1298
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,940
developed by the intelligence community?

1299
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,640
He's here.

1300
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:32,840
All stations, target's in the building.
East Wing.

1301
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,640
East Wing, give me everything you got.

1302
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,540
He's in the house.

1303
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,440
Assault teams.

1304
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
Saddle up!

1305
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,140
Break, break. Package is in the house.

1306
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:48,140
Level three, side four.

1307
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,140
Blue over blue.
You see him.

1308
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,140
You fucking get him.

1309
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,140
Put your fucking hands up.

1310
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,740
Now turn, the fuck around.

1311
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,740
He's outside.

1312
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,240
Target's outside.

1313
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,440
Let's get this fucking guy.

1314
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,040
Easy. You see him?

1315
01:28:13,064 --> 01:28:13,916
Negative.

1316
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:16,140
Clay!

1317
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,140
That's right.

1318
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,540
That's right.

1319
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:21,740
Now, on your knees.

1320
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,140
On your knees.

1321
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,140
Place your fingers behind your head.

1322
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:30,140
Down.

1323
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,740
On your knees.

1324
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
Now. Do it. Now.

1325
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,540
Beekeeper, huh?

1326
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,640
God's right hand?

1327
01:28:43,664 --> 01:28:44,116
You are unchecked.

1328
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:44,848
You aren't shit.

1329
01:28:44,872 --> 01:28:45,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1330
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,240
Hey, take your step back.

1331
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,340
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1332
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,740
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1333
01:29:50,949 --> 01:29:52,076
Armed?

1334
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:54,540
As long as death motherfucker's breathing,

1335
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,140
- He's armed.
- You're not fucking executing him.

1336
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,740
Nice crowd
you're rolling with.

1337
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,440
Watch me.

1338
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,240
V, what the fuck is going on?

1339
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:13,040
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1340
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,440
Isn't that the bloody question?

1341
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,540
I think I'll take...

1342
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,840
to "bee."

1343
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,716
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1344
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,740
- Yeah
- Go!

1345
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,540
Get off me.
Huh?

1346
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,140
He's fucking mine!

1347
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,540
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1348
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,840
He's here.

1349
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Go! Go! All stations!

1350
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,140
I'll take it.

1351
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,640
Why are you waiting?

1352
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,740
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1353
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,140
Come on, come on.

1354
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,140
Hold your hands, guys.

1355
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,140
Come on.

1356
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,140
Hold it so hard.
Hang tight.

1357
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,140
On feet. On me.On me.On me.On me.On me.On me.On me.On me.

1358
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:30,551
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1359
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,640
You understand.

1360
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,840
You did this, right?
You broke the rules.

1361
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,240
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1362
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:40,840
I was just trying to get you
in the office, mom.

1363
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,740
How else do you think
you got elected?

1364
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,640
I was going to win with
or without your help.

1365
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,540
We were already rich.

1366
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,240
Your father built an empire.

1367
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,423
Yeah, and you were
going to fucking break it up

1368
01:30:50,448 --> 01:30:51,940
into pieces and sell it off.

1369
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,240
In the name of public service,
because I care,

1370
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,740
I want to leave a better world.

1371
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:56,840
Okay, right.

1372
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,840
Yeah, because you hate the fact that

1373
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,240
being the president is just
like an endless cocktail party.

1374
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,840
You realize that you were behind

1375
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,840
in 15 of 20 counties you needed to win.

1376
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,440
15 of 20 counties.

1377
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,115
I taught CIA software
to hunt... money

1378
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,640
and not terrorists.

1379
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,740
You didn't hear that.

1380
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,140
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1381
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,140
And you know that. Yeah, I know it.And you know that. Yeah, I know it.

1382
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,140
Everyone knows it.

1383
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,040
Now I know where the money came from.

1384
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,640
And all the people you hurt.

1385
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,140
Okay, whatever.
It's computer data, Mom.

1386
01:31:37,564 --> 01:31:39,415
Somebody in this family has to have
their fucking feet on the ground

1387
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,240
to actually get shit done.

1388
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,240
You understand that?

1389
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,840
Mom.

1390
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,240
The wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1391
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,540
What are you gonna do to fix this?

1392
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,140
Tell the truth.

1393
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,140
The fucking...

1394
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,440
What does that even mean?

1395
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,140
What does that even mean?
Tell the fucking truth?

1396
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,140
You have an entire building
full of PR people

1397
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,540
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1398
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
That guy who's coming to kill us,
that beekeeper,

1399
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,140
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1400
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,040
Then I'm telling the entire nation

1401
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,740
and if it costs me everything,

1402
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,740
well, so be it.

1403
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,640
you fucking git!

1404
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,140
You're just a man.

1405
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,140
I know.

1406
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,140
Thank you.

1407
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,940
Jesus. Looks like a tornado
came through here.

1408
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:35,640
What's your plan here, huh?

1409
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,016
You're going to tell this guy
the fucking truth and hope that

1410
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,116
he spares you
and kills me instead?

1411
01:35:38,617 --> 01:35:41,140
No, Derek, I'll tell him the truth
because it's the truth.

1412
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,940
It's gone far enough,
you proved your point.

1413
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,740
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1414
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:58,940
I'm retired.

1415
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,340
It's just personal.

1416
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,540
For the more reason to stop.

1417
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,940
Go back and live a quiet life.

1418
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,840
Making honey for your neighbors.

1419
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,840
That's all I wanted.

1420
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,140
My neighbor's dead.

1421
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,340
I know, I'm sorry.

1422
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,340
But do you live in the real world

1423
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,940
or just protect it?

1424
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,540
What does it matter to you

1425
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,540
how presidents come to be elected?

1426
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,240
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1427
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:31,740
What does matter to you?

1428
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,240
Right and wrong.

1429
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,140
It's not fashionable.

1430
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,540
I believe there's
good in the universe.

1431
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,140
Yeah, well, we agree.

1432
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,140
I mean, that's...

1433
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,140
that's my view.

1434
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,140
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1435
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,140
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1436
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,140
We wouldn't need beekeepers

1437
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,140
if it wasn't for men like you.

1438
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,140
Don't do that.

1439
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,140
- Sir, you might want to step back.
- No

1440
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,140
I don't want you to get hurt.

1441
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,140
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1442
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:02,140
Now have a seat.

1443
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,140
Nah, fuck the truth, man.

1444
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,140
The truth...

1445
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,140
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1446
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,140
Jesus!

1447
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:16,140
That's fucking real right there.

1448
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:18,140
Wait!

1449
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:20,140
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon.
Drop it! Drop it!

1450
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,140
You decide who you work for.

1451
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,140
For the law.

1452
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:54,140
Or for justice.

1453
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,140
Fuck this.

1454
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,140
Bye, Mom.

1455
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,140
Go! Go!

1456
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,140
I want my...

1457
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,140
Clay!

1458
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,140
No!

1459
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,140
No!

1460
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,140
No!

1461
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,140
No!

1462
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,140
No!

1463
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,140
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1464
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,140
Keep eyes on! Let's go!

1465
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,140
No!

1466
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,140
Thanks for watching!
