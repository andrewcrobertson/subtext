1
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,130
<i>Tonight is</i>
<i>the fucking night, okay?</i>

2
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,467
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

3
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,435
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

4
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,806
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

5
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,173
We're getting out there.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,809
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

7
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,579
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

8
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,113
Man, speak for yourself.

9
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,148
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

10
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,585
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

11
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,153
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,221
I think that it's time.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,623
Oh, really? It's time?

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,592
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

15
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,226
we've all been going
to school together?

16
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,628
I've been building tension.

17
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:01,963
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,096
Yeah, okay.

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,766
And just what would I say?

20
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,036
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,070
How's his penis?

22
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,707
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

23
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,474
They could have broken up,
you never know.

24
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,511
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

25
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,846
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

26
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,249
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

27
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,284
-Mmm.
-Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

28
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,486
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

29
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,657
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

30
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,425
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

31
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,293
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,662
It's probably white, okay?

33
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,065
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,132
What the fuck happened to her?

35
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,569
She's washed up.

36
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,538
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

37
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,641
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

38
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,310
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

39
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,046
Josie, tick-tock.

40
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,781
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

41
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,750
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

42
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,151
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

43
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,419
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

44
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,388
I might have a good shot
that way.

45
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,424
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

46
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,227
What the fuck are you wearing?

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,264
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

48
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,101
I think you wanna be here.

49
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,736
Who said that?

50
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,671
-Where'd you get that idea?
-I'm just feeling...

51
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,172
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

52
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,576
-No. No, no.
-Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,477
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

54
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,713
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,147
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

56
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,816
You have Munchausen's.

57
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,384
Look, just follow my lead.

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,853
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh.

59
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,521
Oh.
You know what?

60
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,155
- Just keep going.
- How was your summer?

61
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,524
-Good to see you.
-Okay, you know what?

62
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,126
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

63
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,560
This school has such
a gay problem.

64
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,030
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

65
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:45,900
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

66
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,835
Like, look at Matthieu.

67
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,469
Rock on, man. Killin' it.

68
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,706
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

69
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,741
Thanks, bitch.

70
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,711
-Fuck!
-Yeah.

71
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,311
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

72
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,280
-Every show.
-Yeah.

73
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,750
Ooh. Popcorn.

74
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:03,885
Don't mind if I do.

75
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,598
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Hazel.

76
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,867
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

77
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,036
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

78
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,739
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

79
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,108
yeah, it was good.

80
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,475
What are you guys doing here?

81
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,610
You guys never come
to the fair.

82
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,344
What happened to your arm?

83
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,246
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

84
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,682
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

85
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,751
-Mmm.
-Or did you get beat up again?

86
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,519
No, I just tripped
and I--

87
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,521
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

88
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,456
Did you go to juvie?

89
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,257
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

90
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,194
-Oh, my God, it was juvie?
-... <i>it's time to get ready,</i>

91
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,030
<i>get wild, and get horny</i>
<i>for our very own Vikings!</i>

92
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,099
Oh, my God, what did you do?

93
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,366
- <i>And the man</i>
<i>who will lead us to victory</i>

94
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,435
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

95
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,939
<i>shit-eating</i>
<i>Huntington Ferrets,</i>

96
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,273
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,809
Jeff! Have my babies!

98
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,578
Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

99
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,148
I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

100
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,416
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

101
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,018
What's the grossest animal?

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,855
Jeff,
come sign my tits!

103
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
Eat my pussy!

104
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,026
That's right.

105
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,997
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

106
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,365
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

107
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,768
- Take this.
- No.

108
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,368
Really quick.
This is the moment.

109
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,270
Stop yelling at me!

110
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,739
Could you give that back
really quickly?

111
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,674
-Hey, Brittany.
-PJ.

112
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,376
I am loving all the...

113
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,179
holes in your pants.

114
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,580
Thanks.

115
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,281
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

116
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,683
Thank you.

117
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,685
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

118
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,687
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

119
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,289
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- No, not that.

120
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,159
Brittany.

121
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,894
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,996
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

123
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,296
I need to pull trig.

124
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,497
-No, you don't.
-Yeah, I do.

125
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,666
I'm gonna say something crazy.

126
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,335
I think you could eat food,

127
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,006
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

128
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,373
Mmm, gross.

129
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,242
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

130
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,044
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

131
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,146
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

132
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,614
Oh, I don't know.

133
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,249
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

134
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,984
-No bun. No.
-You gotta get the bun.

135
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,653
-Yes, you could.
-No.

136
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,888
No bun. Okay.

137
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,924
Um, Isabel.

138
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,358
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

139
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,727
I don't think so.

140
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,229
I think so.
It was really good.

141
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,831
It was super funny.

142
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,437
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

143
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,608
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

144
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,409
Yeah, you're skinny--

145
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,978
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

146
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,913
You probably should eat.

147
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,115
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

148
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,952
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

149
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,522
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

150
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,890
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

151
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:00,460
Fuck! Fuck!

152
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,462
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

153
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,898
You know what? I'm good.

154
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,100
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

155
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,735
If it's not happening here,

156
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,071
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

157
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,439
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

158
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,508
-No.
-I'm packing up my vagina

159
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,177
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

160
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,545
That's the only hope for me.

161
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:18,980
-No.
-It's me and Matthieu, man.

162
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,815
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

163
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,350
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

164
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,751
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

165
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:24,986
We're going to have
to join a church.

166
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,087
He'll be the gay pastor.

167
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,555
My whole life's fucked!

168
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,357
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

169
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,958
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

170
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,493
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

171
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,063
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

172
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,165
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

173
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,134
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

174
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,636
And yeah, guess what?

175
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,338
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

176
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,641
He's fucking the evangelist!

177
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,577
I don't wanna
live like that.

178
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:52,445
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

179
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,150
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

180
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:59,120
- Isabel.
- Leave me alone!

181
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,588
-Stop following me.
-Wait, shut up.

182
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,023
-What?
-Look.

183
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,691
- Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

184
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,326
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

185
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,161
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

186
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,563
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

187
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,065
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

188
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,034
-Josie, offer her a ride.
-I don't think so.

189
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,101
Yes, come on.

190
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,836
...Irish Catholic.

191
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,672
And I'm regular Christian!

192
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,140
- Josie, ask her. Come on.
- PJ, stop.

193
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,008
You're hurting my head.

194
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,144
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

195
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,679
And it's giving me PTSD

196
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,780
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

197
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,015
-Just do it now.
-No.

198
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,216
-Just go fucking ask her.
-No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

199
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,185
Isabel.

200
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,988
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my God.

201
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,389
Isabel...

202
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,791
Get out of the car.

203
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,392
You can't tell me what to do.

204
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,961
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- Okay,

205
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,997
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

206
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,299
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

207
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,501
Move, you prick!

208
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,537
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

209
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,938
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

210
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,274
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

211
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,676
-Hey.
-Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

212
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,279
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

213
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,947
Get out! Come on.

214
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,382
-I feel like
we should just drive.
-Drive.

215
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,917
-Drive.
-Let's just go.

216
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,385
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

217
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,453
-He'll move.
-He's not moving.

218
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,821
He's gonna move.

219
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,656
- We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

220
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,257
- Drive. He'll move.
- Just drive. Josie, go.

221
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,326
-Three, two one...
-Pedal to the metal. Drive!

222
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,204
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

223
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,605
Jeff?

224
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,274
Jeff!

225
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,976
- Are you...
- Are you okay?

226
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,544
When people move cars,
don't people move?

227
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,846
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

228
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,814
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

229
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,483
- Back up! Back up!
- We didn't even do anything.

230
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,753
No, come here.

231
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,121
- Man down! Man down!
- You!

232
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,622
Oh, my God.

233
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,957
-I'm... I'm blacking out.
-No, stay with me.

234
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,392
We should go. Let's go.

235
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,760
-Let's go.
-Yeah. Okay.

236
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,428
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

237
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,829
- Fine.
- What did you do to him?

238
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,765
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

239
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,234
You fucking cowards!

240
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,602
You better fucking run!

241
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,470
I don't understand.

242
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,105
What the fuck?

243
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,475
They're not gonna
get away with this!

244
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,580
<i>Attention.</i>

245
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,182
<i>The library</i>
<i>is out of use again.</i>

246
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,284
<i>Huntington shot up</i>
<i>our remaining books,</i>

247
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,854
<i>so there will be no reading</i>
<i>again this year. Thank you.</i>

248
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,791
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

249
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,928
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

250
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,798
I know I won't even digest it.

251
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,132
I have to throw up."

252
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,967
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

253
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,270
She's like, "No, not, just...

254
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,938
Maybe, but not the bun."

255
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,941
Oh, it was just really sweet.

256
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:35,643
You had to be there.

257
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,944
I was there.

258
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,146
Are you serious?

259
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,681
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

260
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,416
You're the sidekick, not me.

261
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,452
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

262
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,654
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

263
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,356
Thanks.

264
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,560
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

265
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,294
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,696
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

267
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,232
Hi.

268
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,069
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

269
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,538
What? Yeah.

270
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,172
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- All right, kiddos.

271
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,941
Welcome back to class.

272
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,843
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

273
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,144
That belongs to the school.

274
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,179
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

275
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,681
Nice try, PJ,

276
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,316
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

277
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,485
All right, check it out.

278
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,019
-Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
-Josie, so, how'd you do it?

279
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,122
Do what?

280
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,793
Holy shit. Is he okay?

281
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,294
Hey, you good, man?

282
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,898
What the fuck?

283
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,800
- Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

284
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:33,968
Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

285
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,803
Okay, so, did he fight back?

286
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,404
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

287
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,973
-I hope you broke a bone.
-If you need a shoulder

288
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,041
or anything,
just let me know...

289
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,743
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

290
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,245
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

291
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,913
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

292
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,847
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

293
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:47,982
That's how, okay?

294
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,750
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

295
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,385
Overall bitch.

296
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,053
This is you.

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,222
God damn it, Jeff.

298
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,924
What the fuck?

299
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,193
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

300
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,897
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>this is Principal Meyers</i>

301
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,832
<i>with an important</i>
<i>Huntington update.</i>

302
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,433
<i>So, listen to this girl.</i>

303
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,403
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>outside the fair,</i>

304
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,372
<i>a Huntington player</i>
<i>followed me home,</i>

305
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,408
<i>pinned me against my car</i>
<i>and punched me in the face.</i>

306
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:17,612
<i>And now my face</i>

307
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,980
Fuck.

308
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,882
<i>We haven't faced the violence</i>
<i>of Huntington for 20 years.</i>

309
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,417
<i>They think they can get</i>
<i>in our heads</i>

310
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,252
<i>by picking on our weak</i>
<i>and defenseless.</i>

311
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,154
<i>Well, we can't let them</i>
<i>break our spirit, folks.</i>

312
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,923
<i>Keep your heads in the game.</i>

313
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,224
They're gonna pork us!

314
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,892
-We're fucked!
-I'm screwed.

315
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,360
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

316
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,728
Oh, great. More violence.

317
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,630
Just what this school needs.

318
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,432
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

319
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,434
- That's class?
- Latte.

320
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:41,503
Get my shit.

321
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,404
Solid class.

322
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,073
Hey.

323
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,843
Josie, right?

324
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,447
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

325
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,251
Um, weren't you there?

326
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,253
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

327
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,722
- and killed girls in juvie.
- Really?

328
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,091
Um, what did you think
about that?

329
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,726
<i>Excuse me.</i>

330
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,295
<i>Could the ugly,</i>
<i>untalented gays</i>

331
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,464
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office?</i>

332
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,433
Guess that's you guys.

333
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,969
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

334
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,003
Shut up.
You know why you're here.

335
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,672
I don't, actually...

336
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,240
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

337
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,610
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

338
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,679
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

339
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,746
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

340
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,716
-Shush.
-Okay.

341
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,620
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

342
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,120
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

343
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,955
-Yes.
-Yes. It's everywhere.

344
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,156
- Twenty years.
- Couldn't be clearer.

345
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,424
I think I can explain.

346
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,993
I can explain.

347
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,729
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

348
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,396
Ha! Sure.

349
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,699
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

350
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,966
Yeah, actually.

351
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,035
How come you can't buck up

352
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,605
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

353
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:53,941
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

354
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,745
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

355
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,546
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

356
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,515
-Can we just explain ourselves?
-Maybe I should buy a gun.

357
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:02,617
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

358
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,818
-Can we just
calm down, everybody.
-Zip it.

359
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,420
-You know what?
-What?

360
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,023
-I'm gonna expel you both.
-No!

361
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,791
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

362
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,094
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

363
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,498
-Really?
-We were just practicing...

364
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,801
for...

365
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,508
for our self-defense club.

366
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,444
Self-defense-- What is that?

367
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,013
- Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

368
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,049
-Well, here's the thing--
-Yes! Yes!

369
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,017
-Uh...
-Yes! Yes!

370
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,620
A fight club.

371
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,888
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

372
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:41,955
-No, we don't.
-Yes.

373
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,490
No, we don't. Shut up.

374
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,125
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

375
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,860
-I don't care.
-You're over it, okay.

376
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,362
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

377
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,565
while you perform
<i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

378
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,767
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

379
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,803
Yes, sir.

380
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,904
I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

381
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,206
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

382
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,809
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

383
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:01,975
We're doing it.

384
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,044
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

385
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,281
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

386
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,117
- Also, you heard
the announcements.

387
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,318
Girls are terrified.

388
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,053
It's perfect. They need this.

389
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,557
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

390
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,926
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

391
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,127
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

392
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,495
That's the point of feminism.

393
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,130
That's not the point
of feminism.

394
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,532
You also don't care
about feminism.

395
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,899
Your favorite show
is <i>Entourage.</i>

396
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,635
You're missing the point!

397
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,336
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

398
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,038
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

399
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,807
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

400
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,375
About juvie?

401
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,076
- Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

402
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,612
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

403
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,246
I just didn't correct you.

404
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,315
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

405
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,417
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

406
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,754
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

407
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,955
Look, this is how we do this.

408
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,490
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

409
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,058
Which I've got covered.

410
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,893
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

411
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,261
Hub-bub-bub-bub.

412
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,630
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

413
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,030
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

414
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,533
You know Stella-Rebecca?

415
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,502
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

416
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,169
-in Chicago on the weekends?
-Yeah, we're family friends.

417
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,506
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

418
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,174
-Josie.
-What?

419
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,777
-We're doing this.
-No.

420
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,344
Yeah. Listen to me.

421
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,146
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

422
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,149
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

423
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,885
They are grateful to us.

424
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,521
We build a community, we bond,

425
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,523
we share, we connect.

426
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,726
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

427
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,393
Next thing you know,

428
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,995
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

429
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,463
- Jeffrey!
- Josie...

430
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,366
Isabel knew your name.

431
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,636
- Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

432
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,805
-Mmm-hmm.
-Very big "if,"

433
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,439
we just run the risk
of becoming

434
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,441
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

435
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,544
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

436
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,012
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

437
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,749
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

438
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,183
We're the lowest of the low.

439
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,718
-Okay.
-We have nowhere to go but up.

440
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,420
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

441
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,156
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

442
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,325
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

443
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,728
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

444
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,665
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

445
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,569
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

446
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,572
What's your plan here?

447
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,206
I don't need a plan.

448
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,475
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

449
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,716
Okay.

450
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,116
What's up, lads?

451
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,385
What the fuck?

452
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,154
- These girls are ugly.
- Okay.

453
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,590
Where is Stella?

454
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,257
She was booked
for a car convention.

455
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,960
What? It's a Monday.

456
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,528
Um, maybe we should go

457
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:34,863
before someone cool shows up?

458
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,396
Before I die? Pick one.

459
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,999
Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

460
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,969
I love David Fincher.

461
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,403
- Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

462
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,406
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

463
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,075
and stopped huffing paint.

464
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,944
She'll never stop
huffing paint.

465
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,078
So, I thought
we'd start...

466
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,346
Um...

467
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,348
-Okay.
-Sorry.

468
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,684
All right.

469
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,554
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

470
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,321
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

471
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,190
Um, it's a self-defense club.

472
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,759
It's not really, "Fight."

473
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:08,128
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

474
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,898
and they're picking
on the weak

475
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:12,432
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

476
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,202
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

477
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,337
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

478
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,774
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

479
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,308
Then, punch-bucket,

480
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,310
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

481
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,279
and we punch you
until you bleed.

482
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:29,483
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

483
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,852
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

484
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,954
-Mmm. No. No.
-No.

485
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,822
Juvie was way crazier.

486
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,090
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

487
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,192
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

488
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,863
I get up. I'm blind.

489
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,599
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

490
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:46,500
Broke her fuckin' nose.

491
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,235
Josie?

492
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,604
Care to share?

493
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,307
Yeah, all right.

494
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,143
Juvie was insane.

495
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,013
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

496
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,382
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

497
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,687
So, you killed a girl?

498
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,387
Uh, no.

499
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,525
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

500
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,994
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

501
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:14,762
when she came back
to life, so...

502
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,832
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

503
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,867
She came back to life.

504
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,202
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

505
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,204
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

506
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,340
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

507
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,875
Josie, if you'll step forward.

508
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,444
No, I don't wanna do that.

509
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,145
-What's the problem?
-There's no problem. I just...

510
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,615
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

511
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,516
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

512
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,417
-They don't wanna see it.
-They wanna see. Look at them.

513
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,886
They wanna see the punch.

514
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,954
Who am I gonna punch?

515
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,254
Punch me. Just punch me.

516
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,991
-Punch you?
-Yeah, come on.

517
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,224
I can punch you.

518
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,492
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

519
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,995
Something people
would always say,

520
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,295
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

521
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,329
Come on up.

522
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,699
Oh!

523
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,500
Oh, fuck!

524
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,275
Will there an advisor
for this club?

525
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,811
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

526
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,713
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

527
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,148
where we punch each other
in the face?

528
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,919
The Holocaust. It happened.

529
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,822
Yes, it did.

530
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,357
But how? The seeds were sown
in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>

531
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,494
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

532
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,664
I mean, he's perfect.

533
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,699
No.

534
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,933
-What?
-No.

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,802
Please.

536
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,904
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

537
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,271
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

538
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,339
Fuck! When did you show up?

539
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,075
Hey, guys.

540
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,376
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

541
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,413
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

542
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,348
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

543
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,351
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

544
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,386
and, like, guns and stuff,

545
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,356
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

546
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,959
-That's so great, Sylvie.
-Okay.

547
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,493
But, unfortunately,

548
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,929
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

549
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,764
What? Why?

550
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,032
I don't know.

551
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,466
Why? It was just
so empowering.

552
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,002
What was empowering?

553
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,671
Oh, my God, hi. Um...

554
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,873
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

555
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,177
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

556
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,813
Isabel, let's go.

557
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,653
Hi, boo-boo.

558
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm so strong.

559
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:24,892
I mean...

560
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,299
Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.

561
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,901
Great class today.

562
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,903
Hey, uh, girl.

563
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,304
Thanks for coming in today.

564
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,540
We have to come in.
It's class.

565
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,743
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

566
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,179
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

567
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,647
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

568
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,448
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

569
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,852
Sure, he did.

570
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:55,189
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

571
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,558
- What kind of club is that?
- It's a women's club.

572
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,694
We talk about women's issues.

573
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,629
For example,

574
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:02,830
periods,

575
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,899
declining egg count,

576
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,033
skirts...

577
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,400
Skirts?

578
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,937
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

579
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:13,174
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

580
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,442
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

581
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,111
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

582
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,146
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

583
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,714
Listen. I'm kind of,

584
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,916
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

585
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,652
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

586
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,855
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

587
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,791
Back to the club,

588
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,358
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

589
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,960
Can I be honest?
You're a man

590
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,662
who's not coping
with what's going on.

591
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,396
-Yeah.
-You know what?

592
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,933
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

593
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
And here's one thing

594
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,769
- my mom's always said to me.
- Mmm.

595
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,471
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

596
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,040
-don't show up.
-Yeah.

597
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,242
It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

598
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,377
-but you don't even
come to the dang club.
-No.

599
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,479
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

600
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:53,881
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

601
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,817
You just say
you're doing something

602
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,985
and then you don't do
any of those things.

603
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,954
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

604
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,589
Don't come. Yeah.

605
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,526
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

606
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,327
-Amazing.
-What?

607
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,529
-Yeah.
-Really?

608
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,997
- Okay.
- So cool.

609
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,672
How many girls go
to this school, again?

610
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,474
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

611
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,910
Hey, guys.

612
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,514
Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

613
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:29,617
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

614
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,652
Hey, ladies.

615
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,955
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

616
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,123
All right. Um...

617
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:38,559
Hello, everybody.

618
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,393
Okay, excuse me.

619
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,963
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

620
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,197
Um...

621
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,569
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

622
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:59,080
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

623
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:03,251
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

624
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:08,022
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

625
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,925
First...

626
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,094
listen.

627
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,795
Second,

628
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,599
be on time.

629
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,902
Yeah.

630
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:22,904
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

631
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,806
What time is it?

632
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,642
- 3:30.
- 3:30!

633
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,578
Club starts at 3:15.

634
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,047
Not 3:16.

635
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:36,550
Not 3:17,

636
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:41,188
but the doors close at 3:15.

637
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,024
No exceptions.

638
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,927
I don't care if you're like...

639
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:48,428
- "Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

640
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:52,066
because I... I need
to get a full ride

641
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,801
because my mom
lives in a trailer

642
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,903
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

643
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,239
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

644
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,807
Shut up, okay?

645
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,644
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

646
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,386
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

647
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,955
Nice.

648
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,790
Uh, we're just getting
started here.

649
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,525
So, um...

650
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,095
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

651
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,697
We're gonna do wrestling.

652
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:24,932
I think I need a volunteer.

653
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,801
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

654
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,836
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

655
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:31,138
-That's not true. It's about...
-Oh, that's about next week.

656
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,606
-Yeah, next week.
-So, the rules for next week.

657
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,208
Don't be late.

658
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,776
- But this week is good...
- Yeah. No worries.

659
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,378
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

660
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:38,813
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

661
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,480
This is a self-defense
class, right?

662
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:41,782
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

663
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,651
against, like,
football players.

664
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,686
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

665
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,022
They're gonna pork us.

666
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,291
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

667
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,926
There's a cash prize, right?

668
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,594
I thought this was
to be part of, like,

669
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,097
a local underprivileged
female community.

670
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,767
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

671
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,470
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

672
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:03,604
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

673
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,339
So, uh, you know, like...

674
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:08,709
-Why are we nitpicking reasons?
-Yeah. How about this?

675
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,711
-Let's jump in. Right?
-Yeah. For sure.

676
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,246
- Love that.
- Yeah.

677
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:14,515
-I'll go.
-Great. Yeah.

678
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,955
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

679
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,523
I don't know about this shit.

680
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,725
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

681
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,794
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

682
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,229
- Look.
- We can take it slower.

683
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,697
- Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

684
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:31,565
Take that route.
Little slower.

685
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,801
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

686
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,202
Whatever you want, 'kay?

687
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,471
Oh, fuck.

688
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,939
Okay.

689
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,108
That's great.
I say that we go again.

690
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,843
- Oh!
- Ow, fuck! My back.

691
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,912
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

692
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,714
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

693
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,249
-Are you fine? Are you okay?
-Yeah, she's okay.

694
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:50,017
-She's totally fine.
-Shut this shit down.

695
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:52,019
- No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

696
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,587
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

697
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,489
I know that,

698
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,392
you know, this is
a little messy right now

699
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,428
but, like, the only way

700
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:03,964
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

701
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,034
Huntington is coming.

702
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,171
We need this.

703
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,575
I know that things
might seem scary,

704
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,944
but that's okay, because...

705
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,047
because...

706
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,850
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

707
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,585
-Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
-Yeah.

708
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:25,920
- Right?
- Yes.

709
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:28,122
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

710
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:31,092
You are never gonna
get assaulted
on your birthday again.

711
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:32,993
-Lucky number seven, okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

712
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,531
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

713
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,199
Yeah, absolutely.

714
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,568
And for me,

715
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,235
I'll be able
to kill my stepdad.

716
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:43,904
-Awesome.
-Okay.

717
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,673
And if you believe
in yourselves

718
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,074
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

719
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,343
I'm like,
"Let's fucking do this!"

720
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,711
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

721
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:53,013
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.

722
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,215
So good.

723
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,784
Yeah! Yes!

724
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,285
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

725
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:03,124
Yes! Yes, queen, slay!

726
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,226
Yes! Yes!

727
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:08,496
Slay! Yeah!

728
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:12,199
Cool.

729
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,202
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.

730
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,370
Yeah, for sure.

731
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,249
Oh!

732
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,690
-Whenever you want.
-I will.

733
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:42,830
Whoa!

734
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,401
-So, don't do that.
Don't do that.
-Don't do that, guys.

735
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,869
-That was not... Yeah.
-These things you don't do.

736
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,137
So, it's good to learn.

737
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,438
Yeah.

738
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,346
Yeah, no, we'll just do it.
 What you should do.

739
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,015
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

740
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,659
-Wanna go again?
-Yeah, why not?

741
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,159
Whoa.

742
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,161
Good job.

743
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,731
- Yeah!
- Damn.

744
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:39,253
Come on!

745
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,321
Yes!

746
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,468
Yeah, okay!

747
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,538
Nice. All right!

748
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:58,272
Oh, my God! Yes!

749
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,814
Keep it up, guys!

750
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:09,483
Shake it off. Shake it off.
Get back up.

751
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,396
- Good work, guys.
- Yeah!

752
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,198
Fight me off, PJ.

753
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,233
Stop smiling,
I'm kicking your ass.

754
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:32,840
Hazel!

755
00:29:58,132 --> 00:29:59,967
You little bitch,
it's actually working.

756
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,368
I told you.

757
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,170
I know. I feel like
if we keep it up,

758
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,938
we can actually take on
Huntington, you guys.

759
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,207
No, if we keep it up,
we can put our fingers

760
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:09,310
inside of each other. Grow up.

761
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,411
All right.

762
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,246
You know, PJ,

763
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:13,981
I feel like people
are actually liking
more than just

764
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,617
the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

765
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,918
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

766
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,088
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

767
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,823
it means a lot to people,

768
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,092
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

769
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,894
and actually get
to know these girls,

770
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,296
like, it would be
really important,

771
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,865
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

772
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:39,173
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

773
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,841
-Yeah.
-I love talking
about my trauma.

774
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:45,012
I literally jack off
after every single

775
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,581
-therapy session.
-What?

776
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,083
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

777
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,552
-Don't say "girls." It's you.
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

778
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:52,386
I just wanted to say

779
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,789
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

780
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,423
It seems so supportive
of women.

781
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,425
Especially the hot ones.

782
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,227
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

783
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:02,296
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

784
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:07,401
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

785
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,902
I'm just a bit concerned

786
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,572
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

787
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,275
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

788
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,379
Okay.

789
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:24,485
So, we know
that the club has been a place

790
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,521
where we can feel
empowered physically,

791
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:29,356
but we also thought
it could be

792
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,092
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

793
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,894
and talk about our feelings.

794
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,498
Okay, so who's been raped?

795
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,601
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

796
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,571
Gray area stuff counts too.

797
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,679
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

798
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,553
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

799
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,657
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

800
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,458
fuck, whatever.

801
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:05,993
You know?

802
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,228
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

803
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,397
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

804
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:12,867
And then the form
tells me to call,

805
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,904
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

806
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,471
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

807
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,339
but that doesn't count.

808
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,509
So, it's just, like, annoying.

809
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,043
Been there.

810
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,479
We've all been there.

811
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,015
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

812
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:30,050
but I'm more annoyed

813
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:34,522
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

814
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,559
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

815
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:41,729
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

816
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,699
See?

817
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:47,267
Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

818
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:50,237
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

819
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,973
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

820
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,709
It's been really, really dark.

821
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,077
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

822
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:01,114
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

823
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:04,117
-I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
-I can go next,

824
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,186
if that's okay.

825
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:11,759
I don't really like talking
about juvie

826
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:14,696
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

827
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:18,031
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

828
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,601
'cause people think
it's so badass.

829
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,070
But, really wasn't.

830
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:28,008
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

831
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,277
like, badass. I mean, um,

832
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,581
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

833
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,650
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

834
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,685
fight people basically
every single night.

835
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,855
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

836
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:44,626
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

837
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,694
and, um, pipes as well.

838
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:49,864
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

839
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,099
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

840
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:55,402
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

841
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,307
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

842
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,176
Like, I don't have
to just let things

843
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:06,648
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

844
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:09,851
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

845
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,520
for what the club
has become and...

846
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,254
Um...

847
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,758
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

848
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,093
Yeah, sorry.

849
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,328
I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

850
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,797
I've never really,

851
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:26,066
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

852
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,869
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

853
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,469
I'm going through a divorce.

854
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,373
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

855
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,976
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

856
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:37,277
men... men need therapy.

857
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,814
Yeah.

858
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,717
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

859
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:54,294
-Hey.
-Hey.

860
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:56,163
Um...

861
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,833
Thank you, um, for that.

862
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,336
Um...

863
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,674
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

864
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:11,178
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

865
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:13,681
if you wanna...

866
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:18,318
Yeah.

867
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,555
Yeah, okay, sure.

868
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,392
Mom?

869
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,534
Mom?

870
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:38,673
Oh, hi, honey.

871
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,608
What are you doing home
so early?

872
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,446
Uh...

873
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:48,415
Are you kidding me?

874
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,152
I had a long day.

875
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,188
Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

876
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,826
First club fundraiser.

877
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:01,763
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

878
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,098
Hello, ladies.

879
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:05,833
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

880
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,802
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

881
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,604
It's so weird.

882
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,973
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

883
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,407
Thanks, PJ.

884
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,942
Ah. We're havin' fun.

885
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,711
We're selling panties.

886
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,913
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

887
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,749
Very nice.

888
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,483
Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

889
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,786
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

890
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:28,823
Um, I can't. Uh...

891
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,392
Isabel and I have plans, so...

892
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:35,763
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

893
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,230
Yep.

894
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:39,167
Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

895
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:41,035
I have to keep up.

896
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,436
Hazel, what is wrong?

897
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,604
Are you constipated
or something?

898
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,405
I'm fucking tired.

899
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,340
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

900
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,309
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

901
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,845
-Thanks.
-You know, like, the guy.

902
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,479
He's like the crybaby.

903
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,850
With the balls?

904
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,285
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

905
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,889
He's like the main guy.

906
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,991
Jeff?

907
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,661
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

908
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,663
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

909
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,397
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

910
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,499
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

911
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,235
I'm good.

912
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,004
Looking good, Stella!

913
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,439
Are you gonna tell her?

914
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,645
Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

915
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,347
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

916
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,284
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

917
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:32,553
Hit me! Ow!

918
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,356
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

919
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,459
Got it. Thank you.

920
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,035
Jeff!

921
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:57,310
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

922
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,913
-Not good.
-That's not the best.

923
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,150
-No. No, not great.
-That's not a great thing.

924
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,456
I wanted to...

925
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:11,993
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

926
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,327
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

927
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:16,664
Me too.

928
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:20,802
I think it's really impressive

929
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,971
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

930
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:27,542
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

931
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,310
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

932
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,313
You're really, really brave.

933
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,849
No.

934
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,416
No. No, no.

935
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,654
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl.

936
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,655
You're...

937
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:42,790
Yeah, you're...

938
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,526
really, really brave.

939
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:49,831
What?

940
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,637
Actually, Isabel, uh...

941
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:59,406
-There's, um...
-Yeah?

942
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:02,043
There's something
you maybe should know.

943
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,476
Uh...

944
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:07,414
I mean it's pretty insane.

945
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,517
Okay.
What... what is it?

946
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:12,452
I just, I...

947
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:17,258
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

948
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,664
Wait...

949
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,069
Wait, what?

950
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,005
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

951
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:36,077
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

952
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:40,982
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

953
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:44,752
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

954
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,454
like, constantly.

955
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:51,759
I mean, just at it
with each other,
which is pretty fucked up.

956
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:54,829
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

957
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:57,031
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

958
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,733
Oh.

959
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:11,012
Thanks.

960
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,983
Jeff so hungy.
Hungy hungy, hungy.

961
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,484
Jeff so hungy.

962
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:18,853
Swoosh!

963
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:25,192
What the fuck is this?

964
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,193
Is there pineapple in this?

965
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,562
We talked about this, Janice.

966
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:29,997
Jeffrey's allergic
to pineapple.

967
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,434
Eat a bag of dicks.

968
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,842
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
but this is the last straw.

969
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,648
How was last night?

970
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:56,590
Uh, bad, probably,
I would say.

971
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:57,992
Wait, really?

972
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,932
She's walking really fast.

973
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,803
She usually walks
a lot slower.

974
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,441
Hi.

975
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,042
Are you having sex
with Mrs. Callahan?

976
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:20,014
Baby, you look so beautiful.

977
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,350
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

978
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,652
Bad. Are you having sex
with her?

979
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,587
I'm... I'm...

980
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:29,390
helping her with her taxes.

981
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:30,825
Aren't you
in eighth grade algebra?

982
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,760
I can't answer
that question

983
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,261
because I... I don't know
how to read.

984
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,495
She's asking you to your face!

985
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,931
Fuck, that usually works.

986
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:40,001
Are you cheating
on me again?

987
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,970
Baby, no! No!

988
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:44,705
No, why would...
why would I do--

989
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,174
That was one time
with your sister, just once,

990
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,743
two, four times.

991
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,145
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

992
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,415
I promise you
I am not sleeping with her.

993
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:55,816
I literally saw you yesterday.

994
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,518
Shut up, nerd!
I fucked your mom!

995
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,787
Mmm. Mmm.

996
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:01,922
Wait.

997
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,458
- Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

998
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,097
I'm getting revenge.

999
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,665
I'm gonna fuck up
some football players.
And I'm buyin' a gun.

1000
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,467
Hell yeah.
I'll get my stepdad's.

1001
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,102
What about, like, egging?

1002
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:16,737
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

1003
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,005
Ooh, we could cook 'em
and be like...

1004
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:19,373
-"You're cooked."
-Yes. Yeah.

1005
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,574
Or what about, like, a bomb?

1006
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,678
Like a...
like a super small bomb.

1007
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:26,113
I mean, they're super easy
to make,

1008
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,848
and I can just put it
under his car,

1009
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,216
and it can be a distraction.

1010
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:33,821
Yeah, Hazel,
let's do terrorism.

1011
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,244
Fuck you.

1012
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:33,347
Sylvie,
you can't just throw it.

1013
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,149
You have to fucking jump
with it.

1014
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,750
- I'm trying.
- Okay,
watch me. Just...

1015
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:45,826
Damn, we're, uh...
 We're really gonna scare them off.

1016
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,628
Nice! Nice!

1017
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,297
I think I'mma help Isabel
keep watch, so...

1018
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay, well,
don't get distracted,

1019
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,970
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

1020
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,941
Thought you might want
some company.

1021
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:04,812
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1022
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,350
It's nice everybody's here,
like...

1023
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:11,318
vandalizing...

1024
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:13,187
Jeff's house.

1025
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,358
It is nice.

1026
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:20,861
I, uh...

1027
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:23,330
Like, how are you doing?

1028
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:26,967
I mean,
I think it's for the best.

1029
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:31,272
But I did kind of miss
when he would touch my hair

1030
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,674
and go, like,

1031
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:38,746
"Shiny, shiny, shiny."
You know?

1032
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:42,416
I wanted to tell you
this before, but...

1033
00:44:43,652 --> 00:44:45,786
I really appreciated
you fighting

1034
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:48,822
and speaking loudly
at my boyfriend.

1035
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,125
I really value

1036
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,928
when people use violence
and raise their voices for me.

1037
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,965
It's actually one
of my love languages.

1038
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,367
-Is the other one gifts?
-The other one is gifts.

1039
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:03,771
Um, I know

1040
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,774
everything is, like,
really fucked up and...

1041
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:11,312
you still probably miss Jeff,
which I get,

1042
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,615
but I just think

1043
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:17,284
you deserve way better,
Isabel.

1044
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:22,256
'Kay, guys.

1045
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:23,857
Let's make sure we return
or donate these, okay?

1046
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,926
Does anybody know
where the fuck Hazel is?

1047
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,799
Like, 15 minutes?

1048
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,436
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

1049
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:37,371
Okay. Um...

1050
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:48,382
It's gonna blow!

1051
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,851
Oh, wow, yeah,
it's gonna blow, guys.

1052
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:54,822
Oh, my God.

1053
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,323
What the fuck?

1054
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:58,759
Holy shit.

1055
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,898
Oh, fuck, there's no door!

1056
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:14,208
- Annie, Annie, back up!
-  -I'm going, I'm going!

1057
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,677
Stop fucking yelling at me!

1058
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:16,645
- I'm going!
- Fuck.

1059
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,885
Oh, fuck!

1060
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:27,121
Can you listen to me for,
like, once...

1061
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,290
Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!

1062
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:31,792
- You're awesome!
- No, you're awesome.

1063
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,193
Great. What are we supposed
to do now?

1064
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,563
Relax. No one knows it's us.

1065
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,564
Hey, guys.

1066
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:38,966
Great show last night.

1067
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:41,402
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1068
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,404
Oh, you don't.
No, it's really all good.

1069
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:46,006
Jeffrey needed a new car,
anyway, so...

1070
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:48,309
don't worry about it.

1071
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,314
What's wrong, Josie?

1072
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:55,916
You seem a little off.

1073
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:05,893
Your club is over.

1074
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:07,595
You understand?

1075
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:11,899
Good.

1076
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,435
All right, well,
some of us clearly

1077
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,403
have a different definition
of egging,

1078
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,839
but if we keep
our mouths shut,
stay calm, we'll be fine.

1079
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:20,374
They're gonna shut us down,
aren't they?

1080
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,009
What?

1081
00:47:22,076 --> 00:47:23,877
No. We don't know that.

1082
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:25,479
- What-- Why--
- Principal Meyers
will believe

1083
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,081
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1084
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,049
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1085
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,251
Man...

1086
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,253
Fuck.

1087
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,855
You know,
it's been real, guys.

1088
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,924
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1089
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,093
with the goodbyes and...

1090
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,195
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

1091
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,599
And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1092
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,433
I mean, that was
fucking insane!

1093
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:49,403
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1094
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,205
Wait. Stop.

1095
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,440
We don't-- Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1096
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:57,512
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1097
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,280
All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1098
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:03,250
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1099
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:05,520
No matter what,

1100
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,288
this club has brought me
so much.

1101
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,390
I feel...

1102
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:14,529
so much more powerful
and, um...

1103
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:16,430
protected.

1104
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:18,800
Me too.

1105
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,234
- Great.
- Oh, my God, PJ.

1106
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,935
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1107
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,303
what you wanted
out of this group,

1108
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,972
but I think
the rest of us did.

1109
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,440
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1110
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:28,909
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1111
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,512
-Accomplished a lot.
-I actually did.

1112
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,781
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1113
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:34,716
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1114
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:36,818
You really think
that you're the reason
that we have this club?

1115
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:38,318
The reason? No.

1116
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:40,020
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1117
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,723
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1118
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,625
You're really ungrateful.

1119
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,426
You're so lucky
that we even let you
be a part of this.

1120
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,294
PJ, you're a liar.

1121
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:53,835
Yeah, well,
you have no friends,

1122
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:56,303
and a skank as a mom, so...

1123
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,952
Hazel.

1124
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:22,530
PJ...

1125
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,133
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1126
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,588
Hazel.

1127
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:51,425
Whoa.

1128
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,396
I love God.

1129
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,700
Yes, same.

1130
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:09,376
Yeah.

1131
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,646
Oh, my God,
I always wanted
one of these.

1132
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,084
But my mom says
they hide your figure
and make you look ugly.

1133
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,186
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1134
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,288
Like, as a joke or...

1135
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:23,423
whatever.

1136
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,559
Thanks.

1137
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:25,560
Yeah.

1138
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,134
Wow, you and PJ

1139
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:36,103
really have been
friends forever.

1140
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:39,139
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1141
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,610
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1142
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:45,713
PJ called her Gay Yoda,
but I think she's kind of
like a mentor.

1143
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:52,687
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1144
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:54,689
She's so, like...

1145
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,124
like...

1146
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,192
You know?

1147
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,460
- Yeah.
- And you're...

1148
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,429
You're so, like...

1149
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,371
-You know what I mean?
-No, yeah, I know.

1150
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,343
Josie...

1151
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,694
I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1152
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

1153
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,430
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1154
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,202
Wow.

1155
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:19,073
This is, um, a total shithole.

1156
00:52:24,846 --> 00:52:26,179
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1157
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:32,452
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1158
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,154
they give you a tax break.

1159
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,761
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1160
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:42,195
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1161
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:44,364
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1162
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,768
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1163
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:49,837
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1164
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:52,272
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1165
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,586
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1166
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:10,858
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1167
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:13,628
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1168
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,830
Watch out.

1169
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:27,307
What?

1170
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,377
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1171
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:34,214
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1172
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:39,120
Your wrists are so small,
and the pen is so heavy
that I'm like,

1173
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:41,455
-"Is she getting exhausted?"
-Mmm.

1174
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,423
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1175
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,726
with all the surface area

1176
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:45,993
that yours are taking up.

1177
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,361
Wow.

1178
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:49,429
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1179
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,132
Okay, does this hurt?

1180
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,900
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1181
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,635
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1182
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,504
-Can you feel that?
-Can't even feel that.

1183
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:58,305
-Can't feel anything.
-Just like muscles in there.

1184
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,015
Um...

1185
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,684
Uh...

1186
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,354
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1187
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,595
Oh.

1188
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,532
Um...

1189
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:29,737
Yeah. Um...

1190
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:32,840
-I'm... I'm sorry
if you misread anything.
-No, that's all...

1191
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:36,010
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1192
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,796
Um...

1193
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:57,464
I wanted to tell you something.

1194
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,834
What?

1195
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,804
Like, something that happened
last night.

1196
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:05,640
What happened?

1197
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:08,408
With Isabel.

1198
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:13,681
Wait.

1199
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:17,952
Wait, seriously?

1200
00:55:22,657 --> 00:55:24,592
That's... that's amazing.
That's...

1201
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,596
<i>Everybody,</i>

1202
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:31,098
<i>-even the fucking losers...</i>
-Even the fucking losers!

1203
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:33,968
<i>...make some noise!</i>

1204
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:40,708
I thought you were
super Christian.

1205
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:43,311
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1206
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:45,345
<i>All right, uh, so we're gonna</i>
<i>do the pep rally.</i>

1207
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,014
<i>First up, cheerleaders.</i>

1208
00:56:01,162 --> 00:56:02,663
Football!

1209
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:08,002
<i>Whoo! Yeah,</i>
<i>thank you, ladies. Ooh!</i>

1210
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,638
<i>Thank you all for joining us</i>
<i>here today, folks.</i>

1211
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:12,673
<i>There's been some</i>

1212
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,943
<i>exciting stuff happening</i>
<i>at Rockbridge Falls recently.</i>

1213
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,944
Oh.

1214
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:19,280
<i>How many of you</i>

1215
00:56:19,347 --> 00:56:23,416
<i>know about that little girl</i>
<i>fight club that could?</i>

1216
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:26,787
Ay, there go my girls.

1217
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:30,958
<i>Well, do we have</i>
<i>a surprise for you.</i>

1218
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:34,394
<i>We're gonna bring...</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

1219
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:36,831
<i>Hazel down.</i>

1220
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:40,034
<i>One of the founding members.</i>

1221
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:42,502
<i>To show us everything</i>
<i>the club's taught her</i>

1222
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,106
<i>in a fun little challenge.</i>

1223
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:49,377
- Let's go, Hazel!
- Go, Hazel!

1224
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,445
-What is this?
-I... I don't know.

1225
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:57,885
<i>Hazel will be</i>
<i>fighting Tucker,</i>

1226
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,688
<i> the school's number one boxer.</i>

1227
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,730
Wait, I thought I was gonna be
fighting PJ?

1228
00:57:09,797 --> 00:57:12,733
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>but don't be alarmed.</i>

1229
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,568
<i>Girls can do anything</i>
<i>guys can do, right?</i>

1230
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,070
Yeah, kick his ass!

1231
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:18,706
<i>Ready?</i>

1232
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,741
-Fuck.
<i>-Go.</i>

1233
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,058
Oh, my God.

1234
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:42,196
- You got this, Hazel.
- Come on, Hazel!

1235
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:43,164
You got it.

1236
00:57:58,612 --> 00:57:59,880
Shit.

1237
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:03,517
Whoo! Get him!

1238
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:18,332
- The fuck are you doing?
 -Is she, like,

1239
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:19,533
sort of winning or...

1240
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,638
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1241
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,541
Fuck.

1242
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:29,010
Oh. Oh, my God.

1243
00:58:29,076 --> 00:58:31,212
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

1244
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:35,549
<i>You may be wondering</i>
<i>how a girl</i>
<i>under the training of...</i>

1245
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,320
<i> of two juvie convicted killers</i>

1246
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:43,157
<i>can't even stand up</i>
<i>for herself</i>
<i>against a regular old guy.</i>

1247
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:47,595
<i>Well, truth is, they...</i>

1248
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,599
<i>they didn't go to juvie.</i>

1249
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:53,734
<i>No.</i>

1250
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,638
<i>There's no record</i>
<i>of them there.</i>

1251
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:00,408
<i>And according to Hazel...</i>

1252
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:04,311
<i>...they never fought</i>
<i>anyone at all.</i>

1253
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,113
<i>And you know what else?</i>

1254
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,017
<i>They didn't start the club</i>
<i>to empower women.</i>

1255
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:14,055
<i>They did it</i>
<i>to fuck cheerleaders.</i>

1256
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,093
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

1257
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,264
<i>It is such a shame.</i>

1258
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,635
<i>We were really rooting</i>
<i>for you girls.</i>

1259
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:31,272
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

1260
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:32,973
<i>Okay.</i>

1261
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,609
<i>- Thank you for attending...</i>
- Hazel!

1262
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:37,044
<i>- ...today's pep rally.</i>
<i>Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!</i>
- Is she okay?

1263
00:59:37,111 --> 00:59:38,679
- Hazel!
<i>- Whoo!</i>

1264
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:40,014
- Yes!
<i>- Yes!</i>

1265
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,690
Is that true?

1266
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:51,892
That's why you started this?

1267
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:54,628
No, no, no.

1268
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:56,397
Not... not entirely.

1269
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:57,965
Not entire-- Okay.

1270
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:00,968
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1271
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:03,871
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1272
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:06,073
The point of the club

1273
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,877
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1274
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:12,980
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1275
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,715
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1276
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:16,851
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1277
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,853
This is the second wave
all over again.

1278
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:25,960
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1279
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,530
PJ made me do this.
I didn't want to.

1280
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:29,897
I would never want to do this.

1281
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,035
You're pathetic, Josie.

1282
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:48,149
Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1283
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,551
All right, look.

1284
01:00:49,618 --> 01:00:51,652
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1285
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,053
I just look like this.

1286
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,322
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1287
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,225
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked
y'all group

1288
01:00:58,292 --> 01:00:59,727
and what y'all stood for.

1289
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:01,962
-Wait, we can explain.
-I trusted you two

1290
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:04,231
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1291
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:07,101
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1292
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:08,603
Is this about the time I said

1293
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,905
Amelia Earhart
was a fake hero?

1294
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,040
Because it's true.

1295
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:16,443
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1296
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:17,778
but you never hear about them.

1297
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:20,214
And then it's like,

1298
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:22,082
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

1299
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:23,817
"We, like, make less money."

1300
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,853
"We had to lose
our last names."

1301
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,522
"I love you."

1302
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:29,456
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1303
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:32,893
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1304
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,428
And all of a sudden,

1305
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:36,397
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1306
01:01:36,463 --> 01:01:39,133
and suddenly,
the fucking kitchen
is lime green.

1307
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,334
I think...

1308
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:42,703
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1309
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,306
Oh, you look confused,
like how I'm confused
right now,

1310
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,108
on how you created
a fucking fight club
to get some cooch.

1311
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:51,312
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1312
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,280
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1313
01:01:53,347 --> 01:01:54,982
you know what
I'm talking about?

1314
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:56,250
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1315
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,553
of that neck
and all type of--

1316
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,821
Sorry, I just don't know
if you're supposed
to be talking to us like that.

1317
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:02,489
Just, like, as a teacher...

1318
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:04,358
Man, I knew women were evil.

1319
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:07,294
Motherfuckers always
tellin' me like,
"No, that's not true."

1320
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:10,331
But time and time again...

1321
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,771
- Women ain't nothing
but the fuckin' devil.

1322
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,008
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1323
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:24,411
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1324
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:30,117
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1325
01:02:30,184 --> 01:02:33,387
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1326
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:35,624
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1327
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,292
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1328
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,027
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1329
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:41,996
and then he wouldn't be
so upset

1330
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:44,131
and then whatever the fuck
just happened
would not have happened.

1331
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:47,167
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1332
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,638
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1333
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:53,073
Well, I mean, yeah,
it was your idea
to start the whole club.

1334
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,645
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1335
01:02:56,711 --> 01:02:58,713
You know that.

1336
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:01,583
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1337
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,451
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1338
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,255
about girls betting on you
to fight other girls
with shivs.

1339
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:11,158
You're just mad
because I did this.

1340
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:14,428
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1341
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:16,096
Without you.

1342
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:17,599
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1343
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,099
ever.

1344
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:21,035
I'm the one who made it
happen for you.

1345
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:25,774
You know what's so funny
about this whole
fucking thing,

1346
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,041
all your little schemes,

1347
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:30,077
all your,
"Oh, we'll have our year

1348
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:33,314
and we'll fuck
so many girls,"
and whatever?

1349
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,686
Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1350
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:40,187
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1351
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:41,922
Yeah, no, shit,
she's straight.

1352
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,357
Does it even matter?

1353
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:46,528
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1354
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:49,096
Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

1355
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:50,665
Just find some other girl

1356
01:03:50,732 --> 01:03:53,067
to fucking jack off to
and do nothing about.

1357
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:00,274
Cool. Yeah, I will.

1358
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:05,547
PJ.

1359
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:49,289
-Ted?
-Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1360
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:51,392
Ted.

1361
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:53,961
Ted!

1362
01:04:56,096 --> 01:04:57,866
Ted!

1363
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,135
Josie, what the hell?

1364
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:47,509
Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1365
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,979
Hey, Rhodes.

1366
01:06:51,044 --> 01:06:52,580
Do you have a minute to talk?

1367
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:55,148
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1368
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:57,217
-then why are you here?
-Um...

1369
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,219
Like, for advice?

1370
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:01,154
I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

1371
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:02,557
You're too old for this shit.

1372
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:05,760
Girl, when I was
in high school,

1373
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:08,663
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1374
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,197
And back then it was worse

1375
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:12,600
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1376
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,903
Not for being
gay and untalented.

1377
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,604
Mmm.

1378
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:18,506
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1379
01:07:18,573 --> 01:07:20,775
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1380
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,110
And I used to say,

1381
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:24,646
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1382
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:25,914
Look, that's not the point.

1383
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:26,948
You want some advice?

1384
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,448
Invest in yourself,

1385
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,250
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1386
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:33,253
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1387
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,822
I just, um...

1388
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:36,991
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1389
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,425
So, like...

1390
01:07:38,492 --> 01:07:40,193
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1391
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,297
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1392
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,833
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1393
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,669
it's just gotten more sad.

1394
01:07:49,637 --> 01:07:51,338
Okay, um...

1395
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,240
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1396
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,242
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1397
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:56,578
I wouldn't do that.

1398
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:58,012
Why not?

1399
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,213
-It's with Huntington, right?
-Yeah.

1400
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,650
Well, I'm guessing
they've been fucking people up
for the past month, right?

1401
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:05,319
-Yeah.
-So, they're violent.

1402
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:06,888
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1403
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,856
I don't know. Football?

1404
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,926
Game? Tackle?

1405
01:08:11,993 --> 01:08:13,293
Oh, girl.

1406
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,564
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1407
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,833
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1408
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:21,603
How you don't know--

1409
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:24,404
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1410
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,542
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1411
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:30,845
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1412
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:32,145
It's called quartering.

1413
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:33,581
I know... I know
what it's called.

1414
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,683
So, tonight,
I'm stayin' inside

1415
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,317
and double boltin'
those doors.

1416
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:44,291
If you ever grab a--
Nah, I don't care.

1417
01:08:44,358 --> 01:08:47,327
I didn't understand a word
of that, I'm so sorry.

1418
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:16,524
Just go. Go, just, go.
I don't wanna go.

1419
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:19,661
Oh, my God.

1420
01:09:19,727 --> 01:09:21,963
-Hey.
-How did you find me?

1421
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,665
Why are you breathing
so heavy?

1422
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:26,333
Okay. I know we're not
in a great place right now--

1423
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,636
Yeah, because I'm pissed.
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1424
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,139
Okay, well, I just still think
we need to talk

1425
01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:32,874
about everything
that's, like, going on.

1426
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,242
Yeah, cool, well,
I don't wanna hear it, so...

1427
01:09:35,308 --> 01:09:37,310
Okay, maybe you
should reconsider

1428
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:39,781
because I saw Rhodes,
she says hi, by the way.

1429
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:42,083
She said
this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

1430
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,119
Apparently,
every time Huntington
plays Rockbridge,

1431
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:47,487
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

1432
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:48,823
The pets?

1433
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,725
It's bloodlust, man.
That's not the point.

1434
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,325
Sounds like I should get

1435
01:09:52,392 --> 01:09:53,393
-the fuck out
of here now. Okay?
-No.

1436
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,862
PJ, seriously, come on.

1437
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,463
We need to get
the club back together,

1438
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:58,666
so we can save them.

1439
01:09:58,733 --> 01:09:59,801
What?

1440
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,971
Sorry, you're saying
you want me and then you

1441
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:06,607
and then all of the girls
that fuckin' hate us

1442
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:09,977
to get together and save
some fucking football player,

1443
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:11,311
who we hate?

1444
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,246
Circle of bad vibes.

1445
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,782
Okay, well, obviously,
why would you
lay it out like that?

1446
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:16,216
Because it sounds insane.

1447
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:18,251
'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1448
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:20,988
Because we made
these girls trust us
and then we humiliated them.

1449
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:25,459
They deserve a shot
at showing everybody

1450
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,128
what they know,
what they learned,

1451
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:28,763
how fucking cool they are.

1452
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:31,632
Let's do this for the club.

1453
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:33,835
What do you say?

1454
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,871
Can we save the damn day?

1455
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:41,274
Wow.

1456
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:42,643
Pulling out the necklace

1457
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,645
-in the final fuckin' hour.
-Well...

1458
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:48,015
Yeah.

1459
01:10:50,051 --> 01:10:52,220
Mmm. Nice.

1460
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:55,556
<i>Rockbridge,</i>
<i>this is the most</i>
<i>important day of your life.</i>

1461
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:58,626
<i>Forget your wedding,</i>
<i>forget your funeral,</i>

1462
01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:00,427
<i>fuck your bar mitzvah.</i>

1463
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:02,362
<i>This is what matters.</i>

1464
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,133
<i>Gameday, let's do this!</i>

1465
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,803
<i>- Let's go, Vikings!</i>
- We're almost there.

1466
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:14,842
Okay, first off,
PJ has something
to say to Hazel, so...

1467
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:17,912
The apology. Do the apology.
Do the apology, instead.

1468
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:19,412
Okay.

1469
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:22,282
I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

1470
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:26,721
And I'm sorry

1471
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:30,625
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

1472
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:32,693
in front of all
of your friends.

1473
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,496
And I'm sorry
for being an asshole
a lot of the time.

1474
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:40,034
Most of the--
All of the time.

1475
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:43,638
And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

1476
01:11:43,704 --> 01:11:48,375
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1477
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:52,680
and I really appreciate it.

1478
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:57,051
Do you forgive me?

1479
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:01,155
Yes.

1480
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:02,690
I don't want
to interrupt this
gorgeous moment

1481
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:04,659
but we don't have time now

1482
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:07,228
because I got information from
a very confidential source

1483
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:08,763
that Huntington
is trying to kill

1484
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,397
someone on this team tonight.

1485
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:11,464
What are you even
talking about, Josie?

1486
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:13,067
Nobody's even over there.

1487
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:14,702
Oh, my God,
nobody is even over there.

1488
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:16,604
Well, that is obviously
a red flag.

1489
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,706
Are we not reading that
as a red flag? That's crazy.

1490
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:20,808
- What?
- Please, Annie.

1491
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,577
Even though
you're a Black Republican,

1492
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:24,712
you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

1493
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,714
I mean, obviously I know that.
You think I don't know that?

1494
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:28,716
Then help us
figure this out.

1495
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:31,451
We need to stop the game.
We need to save them.

1496
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:33,955
Wait, wait, hang on.
Hazel...

1497
01:12:35,256 --> 01:12:36,858
we need a distraction.

1498
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:40,995
Oh, now you want a bomb.

1499
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,331
Oh, fuck.

1500
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:44,464
So sorry. Okay. Fuck.

1501
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:53,774
Isabel.

1502
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:56,043
I know you really must
hate me right now,

1503
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,444
but the club needs you.

1504
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,880
To what? Have sex with them?

1505
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:01,082
Guys, we really,
really need you. We do.

1506
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:02,717
In your fucking dreams, PJ.

1507
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:04,719
Which you don't deserve
to have.

1508
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:07,321
When you sleep,

1509
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,522
- it should be, like...
-  -<i>Rockbridge,</i> <i>are you ready?</i>

1510
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:10,091
...total darkness.

1511
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:11,826
-Oh, fuck.
-Wow, okay.

1512
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:13,393
Okay, wait, seriously,

1513
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,762
maybe if you
just listened to us.

1514
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:16,764
-Just listen to us. Whoa!
-Brittany.

1515
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,498
<i>Here comes your team!</i>
- Isabel.

1516
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,801
I wouldn't be asking you
if this wasn't important!

1517
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:22,469
We don't have time
for this.

1518
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,205
- Josie, come on.
- Hazel!

1519
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:25,907
<i>- Okay, now that you're all...</i>
- Ugh. Uh...

1520
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,275
<i>...warmed up,</i>
<i>I want you guys...</i>

1521
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:28,408
Is it the red wire?

1522
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:30,511
Shit, or is it the yellow?

1523
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:32,213
<i>...Shawshank your way out.</i>

1524
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,948
<i>-Put your hands together...</i>
-You got this, Jeff.

1525
01:13:34,015 --> 01:13:35,216
<i>-...and shake your tanks.</i>
-You got it!

1526
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:37,852
Hazel! It's starting!

1527
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:40,588
<i>Jeff!</i>

1528
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:42,757
Jeff! Eat my pussy!

1529
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:44,125
Come on, come on!

1530
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,827
<i>Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!</i>

1531
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:49,230
-Hurry, Hazel!
-It's gonna blow.

1532
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:52,199
- Hazel, come on!
- Hazel!

1533
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:53,567
Hazel, come on!

1534
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:00,675
-Hazel, it's not working.
-Hazel, it's not going.

1535
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:02,310
- Oh, no.
- Fuck. Fucking...

1536
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:03,544
- Maybe turn it off...
- Maybe hit it?

1537
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:04,812
No. Give me space. Stop.

1538
01:14:04,879 --> 01:14:06,013
Turn it off
and then back on.

1539
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:07,515
Jeff!

1540
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:13,354
- <i>I want you to rub</i>
<i>Vicks VapoRub on your tanks</i>

1541
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:16,857
<i>and dance around</i>
<i>like the fruitbats</i>
<i>that you are!</i>

1542
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:19,994
Okay, plan B. We need to get
the cheerleaders to make out.

1543
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:21,829
Wait, okay, which cheerleaders
do you think?

1544
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:24,098
It's a distraction.
We need a distraction.

1545
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:32,540
-Guys.
-Hey, guys.

1546
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:33,975
Guys, kiss each other.

1547
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:35,576
Make out.
Make out with each other!

1548
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:36,777
We need
to delay the game.

1549
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:41,015
Guys! Make out
with each other!

1550
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:48,589
<i>Everyone,</i>
<i>get your guns out,</i>
<i>hide your children</i>

1551
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:51,625
<i> because here comes Huntington.</i>

1552
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:00,067
- Fuck you! Bitch!
- What the frick is up?

1553
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:02,169
-Yeah! Get back!
-Yeah! Wake up, pussy!

1554
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:03,671
Hold me back!

1555
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:05,773
You're so lucky!
You're so fucking lucky.

1556
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,376
Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!

1557
01:15:08,442 --> 01:15:09,710
What do we do?

1558
01:15:11,645 --> 01:15:13,481
Look, look, look.

1559
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:32,033
Oh, wait. I'm gay.

1560
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,037
Okay, yeah, I'm not.

1561
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:38,906
I just like gay porn.

1562
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:40,941
This is nothing
like porn at all.

1563
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,011
Wait.

1564
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:46,614
Is porn even real?

1565
01:15:58,527 --> 01:16:02,730
Can we cut the gay shit
and get this show on the road?

1566
01:16:02,797 --> 01:16:07,902
I came here for some good
man-on-man grappling
and slapping football!

1567
01:16:07,968 --> 01:16:10,671
<i>Can everybody</i>
<i>stop looking</i>
<i>at the dyke parade?</i>

1568
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:15,576
<i>Who do I have to blow</i>
<i>to get this game</i>
<i>started already?</i>

1569
01:16:15,643 --> 01:16:19,146
-Yes!
<i>-Now make 'em eat</i>
<i>a bag of urine cakes.</i>

1570
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:21,849
Look, I found empty
barrels of pineapple juice.

1571
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,951
There is pineapple here.

1572
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,020
So, they're gonna
poison Jeff then.

1573
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,122
Where the fuck is it?

1574
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:30,124
Fuck, I'm thinking
really quick.

1575
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:31,892
What if it's in their mouths
and they're swishing it around

1576
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,661
and then they're gonna
spit it out mid-game?

1577
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:35,362
- What?
- I hate to say it,

1578
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,331
but it might have something
to do with their semen.

1579
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:39,266
Obviously, it does not.
What is wrong with you?

1580
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,734
They kissed on the mouth.

1581
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:42,970
- With tongue.
- As a distraction,

1582
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:45,507
and we can do it again
if people are asking.

1583
01:16:45,574 --> 01:16:47,708
- Wait, when was this?
- The bomb didn't work,

1584
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,477
and there was no
other distractions!

1585
01:16:49,544 --> 01:16:51,412
- Yeah, there was...
- And because we were...

1586
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:53,347
- They're gonna spray the field.
- What?

1587
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:55,517
- Okay, we're gonna have to run.
-  -No!

1588
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:56,984
-We're gonna have to run.
We're gonna have to run.
-We can't run. No!

1589
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:58,085
No!

1590
01:16:58,152 --> 01:16:59,620
-Oh, my asthma.
-No, please!

1591
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:00,821
You don't have asthma.

1592
01:17:00,888 --> 01:17:02,623
I feel like I have asthma now!

1593
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:07,394
PJ!
Cover the sprinklers.

1594
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:08,696
I got it.

1595
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,361
Oh, fuck!

1596
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:20,367
Get back here,
you fuckin' weasel!

1597
01:18:51,498 --> 01:18:53,500
I'm sorry.

1598
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,111
You saved me.

1599
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:40,381
You're... you're welcome?

1600
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:43,917
Oh, no.

1601
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:46,554
-I... Would...
-Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh.

1602
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,857
Are you okay?

1603
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:51,492
Yeah.

1604
01:19:52,594 --> 01:19:53,961
- Whoa.
- Hazel!

1605
01:19:54,028 --> 01:19:55,462
- Hazel! Hazel! Look out!
- Hey.

1606
01:20:24,693 --> 01:20:25,794
It's pineapple juice!

1607
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:27,428
It's pineapple juice!

1608
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,063
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- 'Scuse me.

1609
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:31,865
Turn it off!
Please just turn it off!

1610
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,146
Yes.

1611
01:20:46,815 --> 01:20:48,583
Yes!

1612
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,951
Yes, this is the Viking way!

1613
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:53,153
Yes, thank you,
thank you.

1614
01:20:53,822 --> 01:20:55,089
You did it.

1615
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:57,525
You fucking saved me.

1616
01:20:57,592 --> 01:21:01,161
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1617
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:06,200
Thanks.

1618
01:21:15,844 --> 01:21:17,044
-What is...
-I mean...

1619
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:19,046
-Okay.
-I guess we did it.

1620
01:21:19,113 --> 01:21:20,715
We did that shit!

1621
01:21:20,782 --> 01:21:21,783
I mean...

1622
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,016
Really proud of you.

1623
01:21:24,084 --> 01:21:26,019
I'm proud of us.

1624
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:32,259
I do wanna say, um,

1625
01:21:33,293 --> 01:21:35,129
I feel like
you killed that guy.

1626
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:36,865
Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed--

1627
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,165
I think we killed...

1628
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:39,701
-You killed that guy...
-No.

1629
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:42,503
-Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.
-No. Oh, my God.

1630
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,438
Yeah, we killed a couple.
We killed...

1631
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:46,473
we killed a lot of guys.

1632
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:47,842
I-- Let's just--
We'll process it later.

1633
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:48,909
-Much later.
-Later.

1634
01:21:48,976 --> 01:21:50,578
-Yeah.
-Um...

1635
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:52,913
Do you wanna...

1636
01:21:53,882 --> 01:21:55,149
Yeah.

1637
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:03,457
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1638
01:22:03,525 --> 01:22:05,926
You don't have to forgive me
at all or anything.

1639
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:09,864
But I, like, really want
you to know
how sorry I am.

1640
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,033
I was kind of insane,

1641
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,538
and the sheer amount
of lies I told is...

1642
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,105
is shocking,

1643
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:19,973
and it doesn't excuse
what I did.

1644
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,644
But I really liked
getting to know you.

1645
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:27,749
And I still really like you.

1646
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:30,284
-I just...
-You know, you didn't have
to start, like, a whole

1647
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:33,020
fight club just to date me.

1648
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:38,492
You could have just,
like, talked to me.

1649
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,128
Oh. Okay, uh,
I don't really know

1650
01:22:41,195 --> 01:22:43,631
how true that is.
You know what I mean...

1651
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:58,345
Man, I knew women were good.

1652
01:22:58,412 --> 01:23:01,081
I been sayin' that shit
the whole time, man.

1653
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:13,360
Oh, so sorry.

1654
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:16,096
- Yeah!
- Oh.

1655
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,332
Yes, queen!

1656
01:23:18,398 --> 01:23:19,567
Yeah!

1657
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:21,301
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

1658
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:22,937
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>these Huntington players</i>

1659
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:24,104
<i>-are not only shitty...</i>
-Yes, queen!

1660
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:25,673
<i>...football players,</i>

1661
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,776
<i> but they're also dead cheating</i>
<i>bitch asses.</i>

1662
01:23:28,843 --> 01:23:32,647
<i> Meanin' the Vikings once again</i>
<i>win the game!</i>

1663
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:36,518
- Whoo!
<i>- Decompose, you fuckers!</i>

1664
01:23:58,573 --> 01:23:59,574
Damn it.

1665
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:01,643
That was my thing!

1666
01:24:26,266 --> 01:24:28,068
By the way, what the fuck
are you wearing?

1667
01:24:28,135 --> 01:24:30,738
You got suspenders
over your nipples
like a goddamn freak.

1668
01:24:38,312 --> 01:24:39,847
Not gonna come
to any meetings.

1669
01:24:39,914 --> 01:24:41,248
It's gonna be fine.

1670
01:24:41,315 --> 01:24:42,584
He's so preoccupied
with his divor...

1671
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,152
Yeah.

1672
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,921
I drank before I came
to class.

1673
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:48,590
-What?
-Sorry.

1674
01:24:54,494 --> 01:24:56,430
You got this, Jeff!
You got it!

1675
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:58,032
Oh, shit.

1676
01:24:58,098 --> 01:24:59,901
You scarin' the shit
out of me, boy.
You all right?

1677
01:24:59,968 --> 01:25:01,168
-Good shit.
-I got this.

1678
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:26,360
Y'all were two of my top
students, I think.

1679
01:25:26,426 --> 01:25:27,862
Oh, no, that was
two other students.

1680
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:29,597
But at the end of the day,
it don't matter.

1681
01:25:29,664 --> 01:25:32,700
This shit is, like, beyond me.

1682
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:36,470
Not Beyond Meat,
like the fake meat,

1683
01:25:36,537 --> 01:25:38,438
but beyond me, like...

1684
01:25:38,506 --> 01:25:42,242
Who does that?
Where do they do that at?

1685
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:46,313
Y'all out here forty-two
fakin' for the bacon.

1686
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,749
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

1687
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:54,589
- God, this is the most
depressing shit ever.

1688
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:56,658
Oh, wait, fuck me.

1689
01:25:57,925 --> 01:25:59,927
Idiot. Idiot!

1690
01:25:59,994 --> 01:26:02,630
- She's still laughing
because of the last laugh.

1691
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:04,799
No! Fuck!

1692
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:09,403
Cut, cut.

1693
01:26:12,507 --> 01:26:13,908
Hey, guys.

1694
01:26:13,975 --> 01:26:16,176
Hey, guys. Hi.

1695
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:19,580
Hey, guys. Sorry.

1696
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:39,167
You look like you yodel.

1697
01:26:39,232 --> 01:26:41,769
You look super religious.

1698
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:49,443
Get fucked, Janice.

1699
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,145
Get railed, Janice.

1700
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,580
Eat a dick, Janice.

1701
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:58,452
God, what is happening
to this country?

1702
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:00,320
- Why?
- Why?

1703
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:02,724
This is not the Viking way!

1704
01:27:05,593 --> 01:27:07,895
How old are you?
I put whiskey in that.

1705
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:21,475
Actually dealin'
with the "D" word.

1706
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:23,310
-Death.
-No.

1707
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:24,846
-Dinosaurs.
-No.

1708
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:26,246
- Depression?
- If you don't...

1709
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,248
Deez nuts!
