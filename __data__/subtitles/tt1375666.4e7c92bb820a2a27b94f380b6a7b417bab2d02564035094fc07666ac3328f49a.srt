00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:29,886
STUDY HIS MANNERISMS,

1340
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:31,681
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

1341
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:33,641
SO NOW IN THE FIRST LAYER

1342
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:33,641
OF THE DREAM,

1343
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:35,518
I CAN IMPERSONATE BROWNING

1344
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,271
AND SUGGEST CONCEPTS

1345
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,271
TO FISCHER'S CONSCIOUS MIND.

1346
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,106
THEN, WHEN WE TAKE HIM

1347
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,106
A LEVEL DEEPER,

1348
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,066
HIS OWN PROJECTION

1349
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,066
OF BROWNING SHOULD --

1350
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:44,859
SHOULD FEED THAT

1351
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:44,859
RIGHT BACK TO HIM.

1352
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:46,696
SO HE GIVES HIMSELF

1353
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:46,696
THE IDEA.

1354
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:48,447
PRECISELY.

1355
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:50,073
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

1356
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:50,073
IT WILL STICK.

1357
00:47:50,115 --> 00:47:51,241
IT HAS TO SEEM

1358
00:47:50,115 --> 00:47:51,241
SELF-GENERATED.

1359
00:47:51,283 --> 00:47:52,743
EAMES...

1360
00:47:52,785 --> 00:47:54,911
I AM IMPRESSED.

1361
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:57,164
YOUR CONDESCENSION, AS ALWAYS,

1362
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:57,164
IS MUCH APPRECIATED,

1363
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:58,290
ARTHUR, THANK YOU.

1364
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,962

[ RUSTLING ]

1366
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:21,772
WERE YOU GOING UNDER

1367
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:21,772
ON YOUR OWN?

1368
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:23,190
NO, NO, I WAS JUST --

1369
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:25,568
I WAS JUST RUNNING

1370
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:25,568
SOME EXPERIMENTS.

1371
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:27,778
I DIDN'T REALIZE

1372
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:27,778
ANYONE WAS HERE.

1373
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,573
YEAH, I WAS JUST -- I WAS

1374
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,573
WORKING ON MY TOTEM, ACTUALLY.

1375
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,741
HERE.

1376
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,741
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

1377
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:33,367
AH --

1378
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,578
SO YOU'RE LEARNING, HUH?

1379
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:38,789
AN ELEGANT SOLUTION

1380
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:38,789
FOR KEEPING TRACK OF REALITY.

1381
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,791
WAS IT YOUR IDEA?

1382
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,126
NO, IT WAS...

1383
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,126
IT WAS MAL'S, ACTUALLY.

1384
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:44,754
THIS....

1385
00:48:44,795 --> 00:48:46,171
THIS ONE WAS HERS.

1386
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:47,590
SHE'D SPIN IT

1387
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:47,590
IN THE DREAM,

1388
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:48,883
AND IT WOULD

1389
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:48,883
NEVER TOPPLE.

1390
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:50,175
JUST...

1391
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:52,052
SPIN AND SPIN.

1392
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,097
ARTHUR TOLD ME

1393
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,097
SHE PASSED AWAY.

1394
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,351
HOW ARE THE MAZES

1395
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,351
COMING ALONG?

1396
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:01,019
EACH LEVEL

1397
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:01,019
RELATES TO THE PART

1398
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,979
OF THE SUBJECT'S

1399
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,979
SUBCONSCIOUS

1400
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:04,607
THAT WE ARE TRYING

1401
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:04,607
TO ACCESS.

1402
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,776
SO, I'M MAKING THE BOTTOM

1403
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,776
LEVEL A HOSPITAL

1404
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:08,652
SO FISCHER

1405
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:08,652
WILL BRING HIS FATHER.

1406
00:49:08,694 --> 00:49:11,655
UM, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

1407
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:13,407
I HAVE A QUESTION

1408
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:13,407
ABOUT THIS LAYOUT.

1409
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,409
NO, NO, NO. DON'T --

1410
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,409
DON'T SHOW ME SPECIFICS.

1411
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,327
ONLY THE DREAMER

1412
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,327
SHOULD KNOW THE LAYOUT.

1413
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:19,872
WHY IS THAT

1414
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:19,872
SO IMPORTANT?

1415
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,749
IN CASE ONE OF US

1416
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,749
BRINGS IN OUR PROJECTIONS.

1417
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,793
WE DON'T WANT THEM KNOWING

1418
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,793
THE DETAILS OF THE MAZE.

1419
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:27,630
YOU MEAN

1420
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:27,630
IN CASE YOU BRING MAL IN.

1421
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:30,382
YOU CAN'T KEEP HER OUT,

1422
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:30,382
CAN YOU?

1423
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:31,801
RIGHT.

1424
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:33,594
YOU CAN'T BUILD BECAUSE,

1425
00:49:33,636 --> 00:49:36,221
IF YOU KNOW THE MAZE,

1426
00:49:33,636 --> 00:49:36,221
THEN SHE KNOWS IT.

1427
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:38,432
WELL, SHE'D SABOTAGE

1428
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:38,432
THE WHOLE OPERATION.

1429
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:39,974
COBB, DO THE OTHERS KNOW?

1430
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:41,602
NO. NO, THEY DON'T.

1431
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:43,978
YOU'VE GOTTA WARN THEM

1432
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:43,978
IF THIS IS GETTING WORSE.

1433
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,063
NO ONE SAID

1434
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,063
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

1435
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:47,775
I NEED TO GET HOME.

1436
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,402
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT

1437
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,402
RIGHT NOW.

1438
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:53,029
WHY CAN'T YOU GO HOME?

1439
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:59,662
BECAUSE THEY THINK

1440
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:59,662
I KILLED HER.

1441
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:03,039
THANK YOU.

1442
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:04,416
FOR WHAT?

1443
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,168
FOR NOT ASKING

1444
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,168
WHETHER I DID.

1445
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:09,212
"I WILL SPLIT UP

1446
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:09,212
MY FATHER'S EMPIRE."

1447
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:10,881
NOW, THIS IS

1448
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:10,881
OBVIOUSLY AN IDEA

1449
00:50:10,923 --> 00:50:13,300
THAT ROBERT HIMSELF

1450
00:50:10,923 --> 00:50:13,300
WOULD CHOOSE TO REJECT.

1451
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,303
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO PLANT IT

1452
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,303
DEEP IN HIS SUBCONSCIOUS.

1453
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:18,681
THE SUBCONSCIOUS IS MOTIVATED

1454
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:18,681
BY EMOTION, RIGHT?

1455
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:20,349
NOT REASON.

1456
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,100
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY

1457
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,100
TO TRANSLATE THIS

1458
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,853
INTO AN EMOTIONAL CONCEPT.

1459
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:26,647
HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE A BUSINESS

1460
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:26,647
STRATEGY INTO AN EMOTION?

1461
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,148
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE

1462
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,148
TO FIGURE OUT, RIGHT?

1463
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,651
NOW, ROBERT'S RELATIONSHIP

1464
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,651
WITH HIS FATHER

1465
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:31,944
IS STRESSED, TO SAY THE LEAST.

1466
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:33,111
WELL,

1467
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:33,111
CAN WE RUN WITH THAT?

1468
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:34,446
WE COULD SUGGEST TO HIM

1469
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:36,114
BREAKING UP

1470
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:36,114
HIS FATHER'S COMPANY

1471
00:50:36,156 --> 00:50:37,616
AS A "SCREW YOU"

1472
00:50:36,156 --> 00:50:37,616
TO THE OLD MAN.

1473
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:39,159
NO, BECAUSE I THINK

1474
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:39,159
POSITIVE EMOTION

1475
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,452
TRUMPS NEGATIVE EMOTION

1476
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,452
EVERY TIME.

1477
00:50:40,494 --> 00:50:42,830
WE ALL YEARN

1478
00:50:40,494 --> 00:50:42,830
FOR RECONCILIATION,

1479
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:44,498
FOR CATHARSIS.

1480
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,291
WE NEED ROBERT FISCHER

1481
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,502
TO HAVE A POSITIVE

1482
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,502
EMOTIONAL REACTION TO ALL THIS.

1483
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,379
ALL RIGHT,

1484
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,379
WELL, TRY THIS.

1485
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,423
UM, "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT

1486
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,423
I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF,

1487
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:55,425
NOT FOLLOW

1488
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:55,425
IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

1489
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:56,719
THAT MIGHT WORK.

1490
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,804
"MIGHT"?

1491
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:00,472
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO

1492
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:00,472
A LITTLE BETTER THAN "MIGHT."

1493
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:02,558
OH. THANK YOU FOR

1494
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:02,558
YOUR CONTRIBUTION, ARTHUR.

1495
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,727
FORGIVE ME FOR WANTING

1496
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,727
A LITTLE SPECIFICITY, EAMES.

1497
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:06,854
SPECIFICITY?

1498
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,105
INCEPTION'S

1499
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,105
NOT ABOUT BEING SPECIFIC.

1500
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:10,566
WHEN WE GET INSIDE HIS MIND,

1501
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:14,068
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK

1502
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:14,068
WITH WHAT WE FIND.

1503
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,571
Eames:

1504
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,571
ON THE TOP LEVEL,

1505
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:17,364
WE OPEN UP HIS RELATIONSHIP

1506
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:17,364
WITH HIS FATHER,

1507
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:20,242
AND SAY, "I WILL NOT FOLLOW

1508
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:20,242
IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS."

1509
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:21,785
THEN THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN,

1510
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:23,370
WE FEED HIM,

1511
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,372
"I WILL CREATE SOMETHING

1512
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,372
FOR MYSELF."

1513
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,081
THEN, BY THE TIME

1514
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,081
WE HIT THE BOTTOM LEVEL,

1515
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:28,876
WE BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS.

1516
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,545
"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME

1517
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,545
TO BE HIM."

1518
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,545
EXACTLY.

1519
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:35,173
Arthur: THREE LAYERS DOWN,

1520
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:35,173
THE DREAMS ARE GONNA COLLAPSE

1521
00:51:35,215 --> 00:51:36,759
WITH THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE.

1522
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,927
SEDATION.

1523
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:39,762
FOR SLEEP STABLE ENOUGH

1524
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:41,764
TO CREATE THREE LAYERS

1525
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:41,764
OF DREAMING,

1526
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:43,306
