1
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,679
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

2
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:16,749
<i>Beth.</i>

3
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,586
Keenish.

4
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,122
Herr... Konish?

5
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,158
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

6
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:28,026
<i>'Ö.' "Herr König."</i>

7
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,262
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

8
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:32,699
<i>Gretchen and the movers
are right behind us.</i>

9
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,436
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

10
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:42,074
No, she's Beth.

11
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:45,979
Ah, okay.

12
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,915
And what is going on
with your sister?

13
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,317
She deaf or something?

14
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,452
<i>No.</i>

15
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,156
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

16
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,510
You okay, honey?

17
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,481
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

18
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:24,484
Oh!

19
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,000
Ah, very good, Luis!

20
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,836
You've been practicing, huh?

21
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,038
How was your journey?

22
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,706
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

23
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:48,942
<i>We almost forgot
how beautiful it is here.</i>

24
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,578
<i>Ah, we almost forgot how
beautiful you are, Beth.</i>

25
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:52,979
<i>Oh, stop!</i>

26
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:54,681
Keep going!

27
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:57,550
Gretchen, come say hi.

28
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:01,821
Gretchen.

29
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,524
- What's up?
- Oh, Jesus.

30
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,793
<i>Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.</i>

31
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:07,893
Thank you.

32
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,161
No, thank you, Beth.

33
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:11,531
We are so glad to have you back.

34
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,167
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

35
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,436
I completely understand.

36
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:19,572
<i>We have something for you.</i>

37
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:22,107
It's...

38
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,978
The original sketch.

39
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,146
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

40
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,949
the land you acquired.

41
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,018
Beth, that is...

42
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:37,023
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

43
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:39,859
- Oh!
<i>- You know, you two lovebirds</i>

44
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,797
stumbled into my nest almost
eight years ago to the day.

45
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,599
<i>And I believe there were more</i>

46
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,369
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

47
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,604
<i>Hello, Alma.</i>

48
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,513
Your German is already
better than your father's, huh?

49
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:05,785
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

50
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,825
<i>Hey, Gretchen.
How are you holding up?</i>

51
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,129
<i>I wish we could have spent a little
more time together after the funeral,</i>

52
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:17,764
<i>but I get it.</i>

53
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:21,233
<i>You're all over Europe
with your dad's family, huh?</i>

54
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,404
<i>Don't forget you have a band
that needs your voice.</i>

55
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:26,406
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you
the new mix.</i>

56
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:28,541
<i>I knew your mom
would have loved it.</i>

57
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,955
Beth? It's occupied.

58
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,087
Gretchen, let's go!

59
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,356
<i>Herr König is taking us
to the new house.</i>

60
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,325
<i>Can you sit with Alma this time?</i>

61
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,624
Car? What?
Car what?

62
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:32,326
What?

63
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,835
<i>Hello there!</i>

64
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,381
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

65
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,917
I have my hands full.

66
00:09:58,084 --> 00:09:59,619
Oh, me too.

67
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,389
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

68
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,191
No, I'm a daughter.

69
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,826
Oh, really?

70
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,561
Haven't heard about you.

71
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,997
Are you from England as well?

72
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:12,298
No, I'm not.

73
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,567
Why would you have heard
about me?

74
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,202
I told...

75
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,570
Jesus.

76
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,138
Forgive me, my dear.

77
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,642
Didn't mean to startle you.

78
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,177
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

79
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,681
Dr. Bonomo is the medical
superintendent of the local hospital

80
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:32,585
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

81
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,820
which I am also funding.

82
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,690
<i>This is Gretchen.</i>

83
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,025
Gretchen.

84
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,361
Yeah.

85
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,897
Gretchen is from
the United States.

86
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:49,001
It has been decided that she
is moving in with her father.

87
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,206
What a pleasant surprise.

88
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,450
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

89
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,752
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

90
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,255
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

91
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,691
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

92
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,595
Hi, mom.

93
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,669
I know this is weird, um...

94
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,506
But it's good to hear
your voice.

95
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,647
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

96
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,218
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

97
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:52,466
<i>I know it's been tough.</i>

98
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:54,834
<i>But we are very happy
you're here.</i>

99
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:58,204
Excuse me.

100
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,140
Gretchen, my dear.

101
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,443
I, uh...

102
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:08,014
<i>I've been thinking,
for a young woman like you</i>

103
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:13,085
there's... not so many things to do
here during the summer, and so...

104
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,555
I have a little idea.

105
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,627
<i>A proposal. How would you like
to come work for me at the resort?</i>

106
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,330
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

107
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,897
<i>Well, it's an easy job,</i>

108
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:26,799
<i>and it will give you
something to do</i>

109
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,739
<i>while your parents build
the new resort for me.</i>

110
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:31,604
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

111
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:33,539
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

112
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,584
I would pay you an
appropriate salary, of course.

113
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:37,910
<i>- I don't...</i>
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

114
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,551
Oh.

115
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,152
Schön.

116
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:48,687
<i>Wonderful.</i>

117
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:51,657
<i>Come by the reception tomorrow.</i>

118
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,761
<i>Here's your ID badge, sir.</i>

119
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,631
<i>Would you like to pay
with cash or credit card?</i>

120
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,836
Cash, or credit?

121
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,839
Cash.

122
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:10,209
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

123
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:14,246
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

124
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,386
Oh, and this is Beatrice

125
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:21,787
and I am Gretchen.

126
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:34,100
<i>You have to be polite and
friendly, even if the guest is rude.</i>

127
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,103
<i>And remember to put up the sign
if you go to the bathroom.</i>

128
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,673
But if you have any real
trouble, just call the boss.

129
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:44,210
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

130
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,913
He lives in a vacation bungalow?

131
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:51,351
No, he has a villa way up there.

132
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:53,886
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

133
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:56,755
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

134
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:59,258
Weird, right?

135
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,460
Super.

136
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,906
This happens sometimes.

137
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:19,678
How's your first day, my dear?

138
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,750
Can't complain.

139
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,387
And how is your German
coming along?

140
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:30,122
Not good.

141
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,526
This is okay.

142
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,428
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

143
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,631
over the border, in Italy.

144
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:46,972
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

145
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,110
Oh, I have my bike.

146
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,211
Oh?

147
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:53,979
No.

148
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:55,748
No, no, no.

149
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,186
<i>No, it will be too dark
on the country roads by then.</i>

150
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,755
<i>This is why you
will not work late.</i>

151
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:06,192
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

152
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,726
What?

153
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,696
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

154
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:13,667
<i>You have a car.</i>

155
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:15,302
<i>I have a life, too.</i>

156
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,539
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

157
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,079
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

158
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,709
<i>No. Every time I raise
an issue with you,</i>

159
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,645
<i>there is something
you have to say about it.</i>

160
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,813
<i>- I do everything you ask!
- No.</i>

161
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,416
<i>What? I work every day
late shifts!</i>

162
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,294
<i>You're blasting your
Scheisse music on the car radio</i>

163
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,485
<i>on your way to work.</i>

164
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,521
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

165
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,088
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

166
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,557
<i>and you are disturbing
the wildlife</i>

167
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:39,291
<i>with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

168
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:11,524
They can dance on the carpet...

169
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,822
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

170
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,882
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

171
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:10,310
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

172
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:11,910
Alma?

173
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:15,582
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

174
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,723
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

175
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:28,495
My father's daughter
scratched me.

176
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:30,896
Your sister?

177
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:33,366
- She's not my sister.
<i>- Oh.</i>

178
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:34,701
Come on now.

179
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:38,003
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

180
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:46,111
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

181
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:53,218
<i>It's called vanishing twin
syndrome.</i>

182
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,956
It's when one fetus dies in the
early stages of the pregnancy

183
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,395
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

184
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,164
<i>I always thought
it was kind of badass.</i>

185
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,568
But yeah, she's a bitch.

186
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,104
Okay.

187
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,410
Another reason to not have kids.

188
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:20,145
<i>Thanks for finishing my shift.</i>

189
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:23,182
<i>Erik and I haven't been
on a date in ages.</i>

190
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,983
Here's my master key.

191
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,487
There's only one. Don't lose it.

192
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:31,691
And at 10 p.m. sharp you lock
everything up like I showed you.

193
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,026
And boss doesn't need to know.

194
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:35,662
It's fine.

195
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:36,762
Okay.

196
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,237
Uh-huh.

197
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,239
Can I get a room?

198
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:24,677
May I see your ID or passport?

199
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,446
You can't just ask for my name?

200
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,053
Uhm...

201
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,956
Is it just you...

202
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:40,192
or are you here with a partner?

203
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,228
We have special rates
and amenities

204
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,466
for couples and newlyweds.

205
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,504
For now, just me.

206
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:53,606
Okay.

207
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,412
I'm Ed.

208
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,716
<i>What's your name?</i>

209
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:06,653
I'm Gretchen.

210
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:11,491
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

211
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,462
I won't be here
for long anyways.

212
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:24,169
<i>You like music?</i>

213
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,309
Sure.

214
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:35,748
Then you should come to Paris.

215
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,255
Okay.

216
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,677
Hey!

217
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,416
Is this normal?

218
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,753
It's only my second day.

219
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,421
<i>Better go check on her.</i>

220
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:17,689
Uh-huh.

221
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,201
Resort Alpschatten...

222
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:34,641
<i>Gretchen?</i>

223
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,876
- Yes.
<i>- Where's Beatrix?</i>

224
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:40,145
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

225
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:42,882
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

226
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,282
<i>Gretchen.</i>

227
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,377
<i>I want you to lock the doors
and wait for me,</i>

228
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,488
<i>I will come pick you up
right now.</i>

229
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:49,588
Uh...

230
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:53,359
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

231
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,796
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

232
00:22:56,896 --> 00:23:00,099
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

233
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,478
<i>Gretchen, listen to me
carefully.</i>

234
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,168
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

235
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,303
<i>Fuck no.</i>

236
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:08,026
<i>Gretchen?</i>

237
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,575
Hello!

238
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,645
Please let me in!

239
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,516
Please let me in right now!
Please!

240
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:00,566
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

241
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,904
<i>The woman stood there
until the police arrived.</i>

242
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,341
I was chased.

243
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:09,041
Fuck!

244
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:14,280
It's really important that your
statement is as accurate as possible.

245
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:19,785
The receptionist, she stated that she
did not see any woman in the parking lot.

246
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,289
May I suggest...

247
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:26,926
we change the last part into...

248
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:32,565
"The woman stood there until
Mrs. So-and-so entered the room..."

249
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,267
"Then the police arrived."

250
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:40,740
That is so much better.

251
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:43,209
I think...

252
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:46,480
you are the victim of a prank.

253
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:50,516
<i>Everybody
is very nice here, honey.</i>

254
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:52,518
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

255
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,787
<i>but this is actually
very common.</i>

256
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:59,291
- Dad.
- Gretchen?

257
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:00,893
What happened?

258
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:01,993
Did you fall?

259
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:03,896
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

260
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:06,165
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

261
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:07,666
<i>We need to get her checked out.</i>

262
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,602
Dad, I was attacked.

263
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:13,373
- By who?
- I don't know, the cops think it was a prank...

264
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:15,308
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

265
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,810
- No, I fell, but...
<i>- Gretchen?</i>

266
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,850
She fell, it's okay.

267
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:29,588
<i>We are going to do an MRI...</i>

268
00:29:44,603 --> 00:29:47,273
It might be childhood epilepsy.

269
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,076
Epilepsy?

270
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:51,176
<i>It might be?</i>

271
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:52,446
It means it might be genetic

272
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:54,080
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

273
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,883
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

274
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,520
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

275
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:04,123
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

276
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:07,093
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

277
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:11,797
What's causing the seizures?

278
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:15,335
<i>There are many possible
triggers for a seizure in a child.</i>

279
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:17,069
<i>Fever. Certain lights.</i>

280
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,440
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

281
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:22,542
But Alma is too young for that.

282
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,743
<i>Has there been a stressful event</i>

283
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:27,146
<i>or disruption
in your family lately?</i>

284
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,926
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

285
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,295
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

286
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:45,865
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

287
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:48,634
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

288
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,338
<i>Mom, this place
is completely fucked.</i>

289
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:55,674
<i>Alma keeps freaking out, and they
say she has epilepsy or something.</i>

290
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:59,412
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

291
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,882
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

292
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,050
<i>I got the money.</i>

293
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,826
- <i>What happened to you?</i>
- Jesus.

294
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,831
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

295
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:28,874
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

296
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,778
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

297
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,948
incident last night.

298
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:46,158
Which one?

299
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:49,228
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

300
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:55,535
I don't wanna talk to you.

301
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:57,069
Excuse me?

302
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,838
Um... excuse me.

303
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,409
There's another guest waiting.

304
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:12,918
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

305
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:16,755
Could you come see me
when you're done?

306
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,291
Fine.

307
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:33,939
I'm checking out.

308
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:36,443
Oh.

309
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,510
Okay.

310
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,156
You didn't charge me.

311
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,792
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

312
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:56,962
Um...

313
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,765
No, you don't.

314
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:09,275
Do you smoke?

315
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,225
You coming?

316
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,963
Yeah, just give me a minute.

317
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:13,172
<i>I have a house
back in the States.</i>

318
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:15,207
<i>I just need to get
to an airport.</i>

319
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,043
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

320
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,515
<i>We have one of these in Paris.</i>

321
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,462
<i>And then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.</i>

322
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,063
I wasn't going in there.

323
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:44,069
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

324
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,350
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

325
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:00,420
<i>I wasn't going in there.</i>

326
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:05,525
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

327
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:19,271
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

328
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:22,409
I wasn't going in there.

329
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:30,983
Watch out!

330
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:23,396
<i>Do you smell this?</i>

331
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:27,467
Yes.

332
00:37:32,472 --> 00:37:39,177
Or are those molecules binding
to a receptor in your nasal cavity?

333
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:45,183
Got me.

334
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:00,667
And are you...

335
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:05,438
right now, in this moment...

336
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:13,680
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

337
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,287
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

338
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:23,456
Hm?

339
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:26,859
<i>If I were you...</i>

340
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:31,798
<i>I would stay home
until my body was done</i>

341
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,567
<i>growing back those cells.</i>

342
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:39,572
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

343
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:43,376
<i>As if I was stuck in a loop.</i>

344
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,112
<i>Can you... do this?</i>

345
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:53,151
Good.

346
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,527
Apology accepted.

347
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:05,665
Luis.

348
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:20,947
What are you doing?

349
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:22,615
I'm getting my stuff.

350
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,184
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

351
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:27,987
I mean, they said we can...

352
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:31,156
I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

353
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:35,395
<i>Beth has been watching Alma
while I've been here looking after you.</i>

354
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,930
I have to go home
and give her a break.

355
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,200
- Please don't leave.
- You'll be fine.

356
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:43,712
There are people here
all the time.

357
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,972
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

358
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:48,408
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

359
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:52,645
What if she comes back?

360
00:39:52,745 --> 00:39:54,113
Gretchen, stop it!

361
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:55,782
But why? I'm not making this up!

362
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,818
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

363
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:01,921
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

364
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:11,229
I wasn't high.

365
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,099
Oh, you were!

366
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:14,901
You were tested.

367
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,203
You stole money from Herr König

368
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:21,074
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

369
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,009
I can't force you
to do anything.

370
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:25,411
You are almost eighteen
years old.

371
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:27,413
But you don't have a job anymore

372
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,717
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

373
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:33,619
If you wanna run away,

374
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,689
then take your fucking bicycle.

375
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,503
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

376
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:52,905
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

377
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,441
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

378
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,344
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

379
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,415
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

380
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:04,951
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

381
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,688
<i>It's really bad.</i>

382
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,627
<i>I just wanna come home.</i>

383
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,833
Where's Gretchen?

384
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:22,935
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

385
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:24,537
Where's Gretchen?

386
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:27,473
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

387
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:43,723
<i>I told you to come see me.</i>

388
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:48,293
<i>I saved your life.</i>

389
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:51,864
I saw the woman.

390
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,336
You saw her?

391
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:01,774
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

392
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:05,044
I need you to help me
find that woman.

393
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,514
<i>She's wanted for murder.</i>

394
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:11,551
<i>And I expect her
to come for you again.</i>

395
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,755
I can protect you.

396
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,258
If we find her...

397
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:25,331
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

398
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:30,036
<i>Does Alma listen to music often?</i>

399
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:33,472
<i>She loves music, especially
since Gretchen moved in with us.</i>

400
00:42:33,573 --> 00:42:35,174
<i>Now...</i>

401
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:37,677
<i>And this is extremely important.</i>

402
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:41,714
<i>Nobody must know
about this investigation.</i>

403
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:44,517
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

404
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:46,686
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

405
00:42:46,786 --> 00:42:48,322
in people with Alma's condition.

406
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:52,525
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

407
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,862
It's just music.

408
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:57,630
<i>You going out?</i>

409
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:20,386
<i>A month ago,
a married couple on vacation</i>

410
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:22,488
had rented this cabin.

411
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:25,191
<i>A cabin not far from here.</i>

412
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:28,427
<i>The husband told the police
that in the evening</i>

413
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,596
<i>he'd lost consciousness.</i>

414
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,200
When he woke up...

415
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:39,438
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

416
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:44,911
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

417
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:50,082
<i>The blonde woman's voice
had a hypnotic effect on the man.</i>

418
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:54,321
<i>He chased the woman into
the woods, but she got away.</i>

419
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,523
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

420
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:02,161
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

421
00:44:06,198 --> 00:44:07,199
Jesus.

422
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:16,442
Dude...

423
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:21,381
The other night, a half-naked
woman came into the reception,

424
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,583
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

425
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:33,025
Where was she staying?

426
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:44,170
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

427
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:00,720
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

428
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:15,201
<i>I didn't know stakeouts
were gonna be so boring.</i>

429
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:19,705
When are we gonna see
some action?

430
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,674
<i>Almost 11.</i>

431
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:25,077
<i>Be on the lookout and listen
for anything strange.</i>

432
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:03,916
<i>She'll choke.</i>

433
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:09,021
<i>Last time I was too late.</i>

434
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:33,879
<i>Gretchen?</i>

435
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,883
Did we wake you?

436
00:51:45,057 --> 00:51:49,362
<i>All the owls
have individual calls</i>

437
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:53,132
<i>so that they can understand
each other over long distances.</i>

438
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,300
<i>And maybe we
can make a secret call</i>

439
00:51:55,402 --> 00:51:58,371
so that we
can understand each other.

440
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:01,474
Now, I brought you something.

441
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:03,643
I know that you will like this.

442
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:14,587
Gretchen, come sit with us.

443
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:15,822
Gretchen?

444
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:18,157
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

445
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:22,193
No.

446
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:25,130
Okay, good. Please join us.

447
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,200
I went out last night.

448
00:52:29,669 --> 00:52:31,404
Where did you go?

449
00:52:31,704 --> 00:52:33,306
<i>The resort.</i>

450
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,544
What were you doing there?

451
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:39,379
I was with Trixie.

452
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:41,246
<i>Hm.</i>

453
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:45,418
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

454
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:47,720
<i>She wasn't.</i>

455
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:50,790
She was really confused.

456
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,468
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

457
00:52:52,492 --> 00:52:54,761
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

458
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:57,797
Hm. I will look into this.

459
00:52:58,096 --> 00:53:01,133
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

460
00:53:01,634 --> 00:53:04,871
<i>Seems like a lot of people
need assistance after ten.</i>

461
00:53:05,137 --> 00:53:07,172
It doesn't make sense
economically.

462
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,809
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
<i>- Gretchen!</i>

463
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,119
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

464
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:12,745
It's not so interesting, but...

465
00:53:12,846 --> 00:53:14,414
Maybe another time.

466
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,083
It's quite the place
you got here.

467
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:19,719
Gretchen, what's the matter?

468
00:53:19,886 --> 00:53:21,454
Why did you bring us here?

469
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,897
Your parents are planning a...

470
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:32,465
A new resort, I know.

471
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:36,503
Why do we have to live here?

472
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:37,603
<i>Gretchen!</i>

473
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:39,247
Because it's pretty outside?

474
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:41,508
Calm down, right now.

475
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:02,795
You are here because your family
belongs here.

476
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,402
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

477
00:54:09,636 --> 00:54:12,472
- Gretchen, that's enough! What has gotten into you?
<i>- I don't know dad!</i>

478
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:15,140
I'm just reflecting on this very
fucking weird living situation

479
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,242
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

480
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,344
Out!

481
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:19,711
<i>Now!</i>

482
00:54:21,246 --> 00:54:23,316
- Great.
<i>- No, no, Luis.</i>

483
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,451
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

484
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:27,320
You need some family time,
I understand.

485
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,365
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

486
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:31,333
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

487
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:33,660
- and I wish you a good evening.
- I'm very sorry.

488
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,061
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

489
00:54:36,161 --> 00:54:38,565
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

490
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:42,969
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

491
00:54:43,068 --> 00:54:45,137
don't be afraid to...

492
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:47,473
talk to me.

493
00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:52,512
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

494
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:56,416
Oh... it was a surprise.

495
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:58,718
I was not supposed
to say anything.

496
00:54:58,818 --> 00:54:59,852
I am so sorry.

497
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:01,387
What package?

498
00:55:02,755 --> 00:55:05,758
- What package?
- It has your family name on it.

499
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:21,541
It was your mother's stuff.

500
00:55:23,076 --> 00:55:25,143
<i>The small stuff, at least.</i>

501
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:27,279
I received it this morning.

502
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,148
<i>I... your father should perhaps
change the address</i>

503
00:55:30,248 --> 00:55:31,618
<i>on the counter...</i>

504
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:33,720
What is it doing here, dad?

505
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:40,627
I sold the old house.

506
00:55:46,032 --> 00:55:49,102
It was... still my house.

507
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,604
<i>And I put the money
in an account for you.</i>

508
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:57,977
<i>I... I didn't want you
to get worked up again...</i>

509
00:56:07,152 --> 00:56:09,822
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

510
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:12,592
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

511
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:15,160
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

512
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,363
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

513
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:20,767
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

514
00:56:22,135 --> 00:56:24,070
<i>It's really bad.</i>

515
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,208
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

516
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:36,883
<i>What do you think?</i>

517
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:44,157
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

518
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,225
<i>What's your take on that, mom?</i>

519
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,779
<i>Next message.</i>

520
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:12,284
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,
my name is Alma.</i>

521
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:15,253
<i>I'm calling you
because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

522
00:57:15,688 --> 00:57:17,890
<i>Gretchen calls you
when she feels bad,</i>

523
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,792
<i>but you never answer.</i>

524
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:21,794
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

525
00:57:22,328 --> 00:57:23,763
<i>I'm worried.</i>

526
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,297
<i>If you get my message,</i>

527
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:27,900
<i>I want you to call Gretchen
back on the phone.</i>

528
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:30,703
<i>You can tell her
that you love her.</i>

529
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,705
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

530
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:35,108
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

531
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:38,177
<i>If you'd like to,
you can come visit us.</i>

532
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:40,646
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

533
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,702
Good, you're packed.

534
00:58:04,302 --> 00:58:06,305
Do you even know how to drive?

535
00:58:07,406 --> 00:58:09,274
Where is everybody?

536
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:14,447
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

537
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:17,717
Alma had a very strong seizure.

538
00:58:19,385 --> 00:58:21,854
<i>It's your fault, Gretchen.
You know that.</i>

539
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:23,823
<i>You terrified her.</i>

540
00:58:25,391 --> 00:58:29,996
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

541
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:33,232
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

542
00:58:33,332 --> 00:58:35,134
and I'll drive you
to the station.

543
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:37,302
The last train leaves
in one hour.

544
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:56,088
Bring your bike.

545
00:59:26,352 --> 00:59:27,553
You like it?

546
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:29,822
Sure.

547
00:59:30,122 --> 00:59:32,992
<i>You know it? A common cuckoo.</i>

548
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:35,995
<i>A magnificent creature.</i>

549
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,564
<i>Common.</i>

550
00:59:39,265 --> 00:59:44,036
Ah. But its behavior is not.

551
00:59:44,136 --> 00:59:47,173
Its nature is quite remarkable.

552
00:59:48,975 --> 00:59:52,445
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

553
00:59:52,778 --> 00:59:57,617
<i>Some species need our help
to survive and reproduce.</i>

554
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:02,154
I'm a preservationist, you know?

555
01:00:22,408 --> 01:00:23,943
<i>Oh, come along now.</i>

556
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:28,714
<i>I want you to understand
who you got involved with.</i>

557
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:33,219
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

558
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,454
<i>with an illegal firearm.</i>

559
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:37,324
What are you doing?

560
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:38,724
He's a cop.

561
01:00:40,293 --> 01:00:42,194
No, he's not.

562
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:44,364
Not anymore.

563
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,799
<i>You see, Erik here...</i>

564
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:48,968
is actually a policeman.

565
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:52,538
He has access to police files.

566
01:00:52,939 --> 01:00:56,442
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

567
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:59,779
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

568
01:00:59,912 --> 01:01:03,950
<i>one that he is personally
involved with.</i>

569
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:08,454
Okay, Erik. I think it is time to
take Herr Lando to the police station.

570
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:10,756
Gretchen, let's get your money.

571
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,996
<i>This way, please.</i>

572
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,598
Come along, now.

573
01:02:19,225 --> 01:02:23,129
<i>You are a liability, Gretchen.
I can't let you out.</i>

574
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,599
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

575
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,534
<i>Just pheromones.</i>

576
01:02:28,634 --> 01:02:31,237
<i>I am giving you the chance
to be of great use</i>

577
01:02:31,338 --> 01:02:33,539
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

578
01:02:34,006 --> 01:02:36,575
<i>The adolescent
needs to be trained.</i>

579
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:41,314
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

580
01:02:50,823 --> 01:02:53,159
It's a mild sedative.

581
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:54,560
What?

582
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:57,196
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

583
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:04,637
I'm staying here tonight.

584
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:11,577
<i>These creatures can't speak
like you or I.</i>

585
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:13,179
<i>But when trained,</i>

586
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:17,551
<i>their song can be dizzyingly
persuasive.</i>

587
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:47,198
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

588
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,172
Something is not right.

589
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:15,595
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

590
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:17,129
with those construction plans.

591
01:06:17,229 --> 01:06:19,999
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

592
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,537
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

593
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,307
<i>What happened
to Herr Lando's wife</i>

594
01:06:27,407 --> 01:06:29,476
<i>must not repeat itself.</i>

595
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:36,383
<i>I'm very sorry for what
happened to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

596
01:06:36,716 --> 01:06:42,988
But this one's mother
wandered off my area of authority.

597
01:06:43,088 --> 01:06:47,427
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

598
01:06:47,594 --> 01:06:49,828
<i>before we had another offspring</i>

599
01:06:49,928 --> 01:06:51,331
ready to replace her.

600
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:55,200
<i>There were family matters
prolonging my endeavor.</i>

601
01:07:00,272 --> 01:07:01,807
Actually...

602
01:07:02,174 --> 01:07:05,811
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

603
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:10,115
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

604
01:07:10,215 --> 01:07:11,215
Wow.

605
01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:15,322
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

606
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:18,491
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

607
01:07:18,857 --> 01:07:24,597
<i>A sacred process that keeps
an ancient creature alive and well.</i>

608
01:07:25,064 --> 01:07:28,067
<i>A magnificent creature
whose approach to family</i>

609
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:31,338
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

610
01:07:33,972 --> 01:07:35,941
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

611
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,911
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

612
01:07:39,412 --> 01:07:42,449
<i>Consider your mishap last night
a dry run.</i>

613
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:49,288
Erik?

614
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,405
Shh...

615
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:13,912
Oh.

616
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:17,717
No, no, no, no.

617
01:08:18,016 --> 01:08:19,686
<i>You should be on your side.</i>

618
01:08:19,786 --> 01:08:21,521
<i>You could choke, my dear.</i>

619
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:55,555
<i>Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?</i>

620
01:08:55,655 --> 01:08:57,490
I don't feel so good.

621
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,560
Take this.

622
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,956
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

623
01:09:59,985 --> 01:10:02,589
After my mom died,

624
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:05,492
I accidentally called
our house...

625
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:10,195
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

626
01:10:13,065 --> 01:10:15,368
It kind of helped,

627
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:18,571
so I kept calling.

628
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:23,676
Maybe you can do that too.

629
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:11,491
<i>Do you know what this bird
is famous for?</i>

630
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:20,033
This bird lays its eggs in
the nests of other bird species

631
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:25,070
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

632
01:11:27,941 --> 01:11:30,075
No! Not in here!

633
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,376
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

634
01:12:14,152 --> 01:12:16,856
How old is your sister?

635
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:23,830
Gretchen?

636
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,100
Yes, I am fine.

637
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,836
<i>We are in the treatment center
by the hospital.</i>

638
01:12:30,003 --> 01:12:31,283
If you come back in the morning,

639
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,606
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

640
01:12:33,773 --> 01:12:36,109
<i>Alma is going
to stay here for the evening.</i>

641
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,611
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor
her sleep.</i>

642
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:39,479
<i>Dad?</i>

643
01:12:39,579 --> 01:12:41,047
<i>Beth and I are coming home.</i>

644
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:43,281
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about...

645
01:12:45,283 --> 01:12:47,185
<i>What is it, Gretchen?</i>

646
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:50,356
We can't trust them.

647
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,792
<i>Gretchen, we can talk
when we're home.</i>

648
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:55,728
<i>I told you I will protect you.</i>

649
01:12:59,599 --> 01:13:00,900
<i>Get ready.</i>

650
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,902
What's wrong with Beth?

651
01:13:18,384 --> 01:13:21,754
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

652
01:13:23,456 --> 01:13:27,794
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

653
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:33,066
<i>Astonishing resemblance
to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

654
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:37,470
<i>The surrogate mother's distress
grows in close proximity</i>

655
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:39,505
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

656
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:43,843
<i>Thus both host parents have
been removed from the premises.</i>

657
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:49,649
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

658
01:13:49,749 --> 01:13:54,721
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

659
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:59,224
<i>Instead of leaving their
offspring in the care of a host,</i>

660
01:13:59,325 --> 01:14:03,563
<i>homo-cuculidae returns
to claim their young.</i>

661
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,865
Contact with the biological
mother

662
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:09,602
speeds up the process of the
offspring's physical development

663
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:13,306
<i>and its abilities significantly.</i>

664
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:22,048
We are about to initiate the
first close-distance encounter

665
01:14:22,348 --> 01:14:24,450
with the biological mother.

666
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:46,271
Brood parasites.

667
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,743
<i>They don't impregnate.</i>

668
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,479
They implant eggs.

669
01:14:55,715 --> 01:14:58,785
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

670
01:15:01,387 --> 01:15:04,924
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

671
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,362
Like your father...

672
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,098
<i>on his honeymoon.</i>

673
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:16,369
<i>And then what do they do?</i>

674
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,039
Release them into the wild.

675
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:24,811
When the mother shows up...

676
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:27,046
I end this experiment.

677
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:30,983
What about my sister?

678
01:15:33,586 --> 01:15:36,689
That is not your sister.

679
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:39,725
Two.

680
01:15:39,892 --> 01:15:42,028
<i>Yeah, the sister
of the young one</i>

681
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:44,363
and a rogue police detective.

682
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:48,868
<i>Yeah, I am afraid we must commence
definitive measures immediately.</i>

683
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:50,703
<i>She's dead.</i>

684
01:15:51,904 --> 01:15:53,940
The feather
I wrote my name with.

685
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,443
<i>The plumage of the apportioners.</i>

686
01:16:19,098 --> 01:16:20,099
Yeah.

687
01:16:47,493 --> 01:16:48,828
No! No!

688
01:16:57,803 --> 01:16:59,672
I'm not going to hurt you.

689
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:37,143
Alma. Alma?

690
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,445
Alma, we have to go.

691
01:17:39,612 --> 01:17:41,514
We have to go now.

692
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:10,509
Just stay right here.

693
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:04,630
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

694
01:19:50,242 --> 01:19:51,777
Alma?

695
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:42,682
She's dead!

696
01:27:43,483 --> 01:27:45,018
Mom is dead!

697
01:27:45,585 --> 01:27:50,055
<i>Where's your machine gun,
my dear?</i>

698
01:27:50,323 --> 01:27:52,492
Is it under your cast, huh?

699
01:27:55,628 --> 01:27:56,628
Why me?

700
01:27:56,696 --> 01:27:59,465
It's not about you,
you little brat.

701
01:28:00,265 --> 01:28:02,936
This is nature.

702
01:28:03,036 --> 01:28:05,405
<i>She is supposed
to be focusing...</i>

703
01:28:05,505 --> 01:28:09,107
<i>on reproduction and breeding.</i>

704
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:15,682
And you are competing for
resources with her offspring.

705
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:18,451
<i>Our process here ensures</i>

706
01:28:18,551 --> 01:28:21,387
<i>that each new generation
we breed</i>

707
01:28:21,487 --> 01:28:24,289
<i>is more powerful than the last.</i>

708
01:28:24,457 --> 01:28:27,827
<i>And my dear,
when I am done with you</i>

709
01:28:28,126 --> 01:28:30,797
<i>and reunite Alma with...</i>

710
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,797
Stay away from her, Alma.

711
01:31:09,222 --> 01:31:10,490
No.

712
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:15,027
S-She... can't.

713
01:31:17,163 --> 01:31:22,335
But she says thank you.

714
01:31:23,268 --> 01:31:25,438
Thank you, Alma.

715
01:31:56,435 --> 01:31:58,504
Thank you, Alma.

716
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:08,447
I really need your help.

717
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:22,995
<i>Henry!</i>

718
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,765
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

719
01:32:29,068 --> 01:32:30,670
I stand by it.

720
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:34,006
<i>Did you ever tell your wife
you'd protect her?</i>

721
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:39,846
What?

722
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:45,685
<i>Did you tell her
you'd protect her?</i>

723
01:32:50,823 --> 01:32:51,924
<i>Did you?</i>

724
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,598
Yes!

725
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:01,367
<i>Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

726
01:33:27,026 --> 01:33:28,494
Alma!

727
01:33:28,861 --> 01:33:31,797
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

728
01:33:33,699 --> 01:33:35,835
<i>What are you doing?</i>

729
01:33:35,935 --> 01:33:37,203
She's one of them!

730
01:33:37,436 --> 01:33:39,272
<i>Alma!</i>

731
01:33:39,373 --> 01:33:40,673
I don't think so.

732
01:33:40,873 --> 01:33:41,873
<i>Come to me.</i>

733
01:33:42,508 --> 01:33:44,610
She will be.

734
01:33:44,877 --> 01:33:46,913
She will become!

735
01:33:47,513 --> 01:33:50,049
- I don't think so.
<i>- Alma!</i>

736
01:33:50,216 --> 01:33:52,418
<i>We need to find out
how many there are.</i>

737
01:33:52,518 --> 01:33:55,855
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

738
01:33:56,555 --> 01:33:58,824
- Stop!
- Let her go.

739
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:02,362
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

740
01:34:02,461 --> 01:34:04,196
She is not your sister!

741
01:34:04,297 --> 01:34:05,577
They stopped reproducing before.

742
01:34:05,631 --> 01:34:07,900
They will go extinct
without preservation.

743
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:09,602
Oh, they will go extinct.

744
01:34:09,702 --> 01:34:11,671
<i>Hundreds of years of research.</i>

745
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,873
<i>This is the will
of the apportioners.</i>

746
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,541
<i>Let her go.</i>

747
01:34:16,075 --> 01:34:17,944
You don't know
what you're doing!
