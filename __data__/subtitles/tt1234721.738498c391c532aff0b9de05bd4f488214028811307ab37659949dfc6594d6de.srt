in four, three, two, one.

6
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:02,404
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

7
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:04,400
could be made completely safe,

8
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:07,404
and what if I told you
that this could be accomplished

9
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:12,082
without risking the life of one
single law enforcement officer?

10
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,413
How do I know this?

11
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:15,913
Because it's happening right now

12
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:20,880
in every country in the world
but this one.

13
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:25,137
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to "The Novak Element."

14
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:30,598
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

15
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:32,471
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe,

16
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,600
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

17
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,483
General Monroe,
welcome back.

18
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,320
- Good to see you, Pat.
- Uh, thank you

19
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:44,273
for this unprecedented
access to your operation.

20
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,118
Could you walk us through

21
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,946
what we're seeing here?

22
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,328
Well, this is a, uh,
a routine operation.

23
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,324
We found that
random patrols

24
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,121
helped the local population

25
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:56,121
to feel safer
and to trust us.

26
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,124
It's amazing.

27
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:58,797
And what are these colored dots

28
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:01,294
that we're seeing here,
General?

29
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,636
These are our assets
on the ground.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,637
Uh, in green,
we got the ED-2093.

31
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:09,684
They're the big boys,
they secure the perimeter.

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,520
Purple are the
smaller EM-2083.

33
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,136
They sweep and mop up.

34
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,189
And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.

35
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,026
(laughs)

36
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,988
It is great to see
American machines

37
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,657
helping to promote peace
and freedom abroad.

38
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,992
All right, you guys, this is
just standard op, all right?

39
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:27,365
There's no
opposition expected.

40
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,990
I'm gonna set your
markers to code red.

42
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:35,795
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

43
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,997
No red assets
have ever been lost.

44
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,126
- Okay.
- Okay?

45

46
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,463
-(woman chuckles)
- But, listen,

47
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:44,010
you keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.

48
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:45,378
- Okay.
- Okay?

49
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,970
Okay, enjoy the show.

scanning procedure.

54
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,623
No one will be harmed.

55
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,382
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,215

No one will be harmed.

58

As-salaam alaikum.

59
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:33,139
- May peace be upon you.
- Scott, get me a shot of this.

60
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,394
Your cooperation
is appreciated.

61
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,184
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

Incredible.

In... credible!

66
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:57,790
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,878
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

68
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,459
Uh, General, you care

69
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:04,926
to comment on this?

70
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,974
Well, Pat, we had
Vietnam, we had Iraq,

71
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,593
we had Afghanistan--

72
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,223
never again.

73
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,273
From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.

74
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,722
We can accomplish
our objectives

75
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,277
without any loss
to American lives,

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,273
and I think
the honest people over there

77
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,150
really appreciate it.

For the first time
in their lives,

80

their children grow up

81

00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:29,962
What lead?

182
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,090
Not in front of them.

183
00:09:32,224 --> 00:09:33,431
This is bullshit.

184
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:34,675
Yeah?

185
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,096
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

186
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:37,094
Vallon's our case.

187
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,311
Yeah, two years

188
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,056
without no arrest,
no nothing?

189
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,481
You've got to be
dumb or dirty.

190
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,934
You got something on us,
or is this personal?

191
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,939
No, it's nothing personal--

192
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:49,274
although I don't like you
as a person.

193
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:50,946
KAREN:
Okay, you two, out.

194
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:52,409
No problem.

195
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,784
Maybe if you hadn't gone
off the reservation,

196
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,458
your partner would
still be standing.

197
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,416
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

198
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,835
Okay, Alex.

199
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,468
Just you and me now.

200
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:11,306
So, me and Jack, we've been
doing some street buys.

201
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,140
We get a line on some guns.

202
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:16,513
(voice-over): We meet up with
this low-level G called Jerry

203
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:19,309
who ends up having a piece
he's not supposed to have.

204
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,311
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry?

205
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,355
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

206
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:25,147
Two crates?
No disrespect, J,

207
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:27,606
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

208
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,031
Yo, what's it matter
where it comes from?

209
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,320
Why it matters--
we don't want

210
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,783
no dirty guns, Jerry.

211
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,030
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

212
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,495
Yo, look, they're clean,
all right?

213
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,493
- You gonna buy this shit or not?
- Hey, hey,

214
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:37,618
why you acting so nervous, man?

215
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,247
You fishing on us, Jerry?

216
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,043
What'd you say?

217
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,163
- You think he fishing, D?
- I think he's fishing on us.

218
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,664
Yo, what the hell are
they talking about, man?

219
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,211
Hey, let me see your phone.

220
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,550
- Let me see your phone.
- I'm not showing you

221
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,295
-my phone, man!
- You recording this?

222
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,345
- What?
- I think you're a goddamn cop.

223
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,674
What the hell
are you talking about, man?!

224
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:55,725
- Don't even try that!
- Hey, put your gun down!

225
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:57,515
We're not cops, all right?

226
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:59,308
- We work for Antoine Vallon.
- Put your phones on the table!

227
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,059
What?
Hey, hey, hey, shut up, shut up.

228
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,057
What'd you say?

229
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,275
Ends up he works
for Vallon.

230
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,900
Before the meet we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

231
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,524
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

232
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:12,369
(voice-over):
Not out on the street.

233
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,570
Intake papers blank,
no signatures.

234
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:17,416
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

235
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,704
How do you think
that happened?

236
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

237
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,167
These guys'll shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

238
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,046
We need backup.

239
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,592
We call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station,

240
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,008
he's gonna disappear.

241
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,681
It's gonna be all right.

242
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,555
(voice-over): We told Vallon
we were gun buyers,

243
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:38,263
and he bought it.

244
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,230
What do you two need
with that much product?

245
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:41,726
You plotting a coup?

246
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,223
Man, don't trip.

247
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,443
We ain't gonna bust
a single shot in your town.

248
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,403
We got some problems back home
with Chicago PD.

249
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,022
(phone rings)

250
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,857
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

251
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:52,943
Hey, boss.

252
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,865
What do you got for me?

253
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:58,574
Really?

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,207
MURPHY (voice-over): We were
just about to close the deal,

255
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:01,284
but someone tipped him off.

256
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,754
Gentlemen,
I got to deal with this.

257
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,837
-(tires screech)
- Two minutes.

258
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,298
Make sure you kill 'em both!

259
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,437
I got two handguns,

260
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,360
one automatic.

261
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:32,234
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

262
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,495
We gotta get out of here.

263
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,788
I'm gonna take
the automatic.

264
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,120
You sure about this?

265
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,134
(gunfire continues)

266
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,975
You ready?

295
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,000
these machines are,
Mr. Sellars.

296
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,749
A machine does not know
what it feels like to be human.

297
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,630
It can't understand
the value of human life.

298
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:51,093
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

299
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:54,343
To, to, to legislate
over life and death,

300
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:58,516
we need people who understand
right from wrong.

301
00:14:58,643 --> 00:14:59,805
What do your machines feel?

302
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:02,647
Well, uh, they feel no anger.

303
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,474
They feel no prejudice.

304
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,275
They feel no fatigue,

305
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:09,317
which makes them ideal
for law enforcement.

306
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:13,357
Putting these machines
on the streets

307
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:16,534
will save
countless American lives.

- No, I'm not.

309
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,826
Yes, you're evading
the question.

310
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,956
I asked, what do
these machines feel?

311
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:26,377
If one of them...
killed a child,

312
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,876
what would it feel?

313
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,171
- Nothing.
- And that's the problem.

314
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:37,847
That's why 72% of Americans
will not stand

315
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,889
for a robot
pulling the trigger.

316
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,013
(applause)

317
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:49,022
MAN (voice-over): The world's
most valuable market,

318
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,988
and we can't touch it.

319
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,690
With a domestic expansion,

320
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:56,405
we'd clear $600 billion
per annum.

321
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:59,247
In other words, every second
that law is in existence,

322
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,364
we are hemorrhaging money.

323
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,242
What do you
want me to do?

324
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:04,415
We've thrown cash at senators

325
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:06,083
Nobody's budging.

326
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:08,047
They don't want to vote
against their constituents,

327
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:11,249
so, unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

328
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:14,882
Now, to that effect,
my team have come up

329
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,762

new campaign.

Wow factor
off the charts.

331
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,887
We need to give Americans
a product they can love,

332
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,518
a figure they can
rally behind.

333
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,891
Sir, I have dissected
this bill.

334
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,272
There are no loopholes.

335
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,520
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

336
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:31,945
Forget machines.

337
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,862
You saw the polls.

338
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,197
Americans don't want a machine.

339
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:42,366
They want a product
with a conscience.

340
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,628
They want something
that knows...

341
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:52,505
...what it feels like
to be human.

342
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,557
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

559

you're okay

00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:36,650
and your family's fine,
both your wife and your son.

566
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:37,643
Who the hell are you?

567
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:39,613
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.

568
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:42,024
I'm treating you.

569
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,151

572

- Visual input unstable.

573
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:55,336
I want you to relax, Alex.

Subject's dumping

575
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,374

- Not yet.

576
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:01,002
Unlock vertebrae.

577
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:05,507
(clicking, whirring, hissing)

578
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,513
Go ahead, Kim.

579
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,766
Unlock upper,
lower extremities.

580
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,365
What kind of suit is this?

581
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:30,700
It's not a suit,
Alex, it's...

582
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,792
it-it's you.

583
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:36,046
This was the only option.

584
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,247
We're here--

585
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:40,548
all of us-- to make
you whole again.

586
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:42,548
- Full body unlock.

587
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:44,380
I want you to walk now, Alex.

588
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:46,466
You can do that.

589
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:53,347
(footsteps thudding)

590
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:02,315
(whirring, thudding)

591
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:12,121
This seems so real.

592
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,291
Alex, it's, it's
very important

593
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:17,880
you understand
what is happening.

594
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:19,252
This is real.

595
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:20,878
It's not a dream,

596
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:22,631
it's not drugs or anesthetics.

597
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:25,757
I know I'm dreaming
because I can feel all of this.

598
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:28,923
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

599
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,926
It's called phantom
limb sensation.

600
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,645
What do you mean “amputees"?

601
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:33,935
- What the hell did you do to me?
- Alex, you need to relax.

602
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,557
Take this off me now.
I need to get out of this thing.

603
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,607
You need to relax.

604
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,101
Alex, Dr. Norton
saved your life.

605
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,773
What did you do to me?!
What have you done to me?!

606
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:40,774
Your body was beyond
biological repair!

607
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,982
KIM:
Alex... hey!

608
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,066
Shut him down.

609
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,447
NORTON:
Uh, no! Let him run!

610
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,865
Let him run!

611
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,338
(whirring, thudding)

612
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,007
(startled shouts, gasping)

613
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,376
(crew speaking Mandarin)

614
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,089
(man shouting in Mandarin)

615
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,722
Where am I?!

616
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,267
(man shouts in Mandarin)

617
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,609
(whirring, thudding)

618
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:23,940

619

(workers murmuring)

620
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:35,744
NORTON (over radio):
Alex, please.

621
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:39,206
Stop.

622
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,584
Alex, you have to stop.

623
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,845
Please.

624
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,683
Alex.

625
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,509
Please stop.

626
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:54,267
Stay where you are and,
and we'll come and pick you up.

627
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:04,149
(thudding)

628
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,080
(thud, whirring)

629
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,885
Okay, Kim.

630
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:33,017
Shut him down.

631
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,813
(power whirring down)

632
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,571
(workers murmuring,
birds chirping)

633
00:32:57,338 --> 00:33:01,837
Alex... you can't
run from this.

634
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:07,800
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.

635
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,095
Show me.

636
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:16,515
Kim.

637
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:19,935
(whirring)

638
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:28,110
(whirring and clanking)

639
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:34,200
No.

640
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:37,578
No.

641
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,922
Holy Christ.
Holy Christ.

642
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:49,307
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

643
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:52,351
(sobbing)

644
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:55,146
(heart beating quietly)

645
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,182
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

646
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,154
That's not even my brain.

647
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,159
We had to repair
the damaged areas,

648
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:11,955
but we didn't interfere
with your emotion

649
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,156
or your intellect.

650
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,161
Do you un-- you
understand me, Alex?

651
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:19,962
You're, you're
in control.

652
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,961
I'm in control?

653
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,043
Yes.

654
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,671
Okay.

655
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,721
If I'm in control...

656
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,846
then I want to die.

657
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:39,646
Just unplug whatever it is
keeping me alive

658
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:42,900
and end this nightmare.

659
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:45,023
Now, say I did that,
which, as a doctor,

660
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:49,409
would almost be impossible
for me, but, but say I did.

661
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:54,247
What, what, what do
I say to your wife?

662
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,911
What does she say to your son?

663
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:58,286
That it didn't work,
that you tried.

664
00:34:59,922 --> 00:35:01,584
Something went wrong.

665
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:07,513
You did everything
you could, but...

666
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,722
I died.

667
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,766
So, after all
they've been through,

668
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,100
all the pain,

669
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:15,437
all their hope restored,

670
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:19,059
we would just rip that away?

671
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,393
Your wife loves you, Alex.

672
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,520
She signed
the consent forms herself.

673
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:26,484
Otherwise, y-you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

674
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,251
She loves you,

675
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,503
and she gave you
a second chance.

676
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,754
I need you

677
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:47,219
to take it.

678
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:53,352
I don't want to see myself
like this again.

679
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:56,224
Ever.

680
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:58,306
And the same goes for my family.

681
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,274
Just put me back in.

682
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,858
(quiet whirr, click)

683
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,904
(phone ringing)

684
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:13,534
ROBOCOP:
Zoom in.

685
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,950
Stop.

686
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,127
(ringing continues)

687
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,247
Zoom in.

688
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:24,876
Stop.

689
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:29,592
(ringing continues)

690
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,139
Accept the connection.

691
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,467
(beeping)

692
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:36,472
(sighs)

693
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:38,978
It's so good to finally see you.

694
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,060
I was gonna say
the same thing.

695
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:44,984
I'm sorry.

696
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,611
I know how
I must look to you.

697
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,445
I think you look beautiful.

698
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:53,030
(Clara laughs gently)

699
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:55,624
Are they treating you okay,
baby?

700
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:58,327
So far. Dr. Norton,

701
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,540
he seems like a nice guy.

702
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:03,666
Does David know you're calling?

703
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,681
He misses you.

704
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:11,970
- I can go get him. I just...
- No.

705
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,974
I don't want him to
see me like this.

706
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:19,056
Not yet.

707
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,183
Sure.

708
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,028
(crying)

709
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,741
We're gonna get
through this, baby.

710
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,113
We're gonna make it like it was.

711
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:39,915
When are you coming home?

712
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:42,585
Well, they still
got some tests,

713
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:44,798
but they're saying it's
going really well.

714
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:48,886
The minute they let me.

715
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:53,260
I gotta go.

716
00:37:53,393 --> 00:37:55,180
I love you.

717
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,262
- End the connection.
-(beeping)

718
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,646
(whirring)

719
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:14,529
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

720
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:20,287
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

721
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:26,591

1081
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:11,518
KIM: Archive footage
uploading successfully.

1082
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:14,065
Your system draws connections
automatically.

1083
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,230
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes and give you

1084
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:20,027
their exact locations
whenever available.

1085
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:23,402
ROBOCOP: I got evidence
to make 138-- no, no-

1086
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:26,405
166 arrests.

1087
00:58:26,538 --> 00:58:29,704
KIM:
His emotions are stable.

1088
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:30,908
This is incredible.

1089
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:32,329
KELLY (voice-over):
You will notice

1090
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:34,879
his family is here
in the building as well.

1091
00:58:34,962 --> 00:58:36,420
The mayor is
standing on stage behind me.

1092
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:39,213
Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.

1093
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:40,713
They seem like great friends,

1094
00:58:40,802 --> 00:58:42,089
obviously echoing
the partnership

1095
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,838
that they've brought together.

1096
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,219
LIZ: How much longer
will this take?

1097
00:58:46,308 --> 00:58:48,392
KAREN: Well, the feed from
the database is almost done,

1098
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:51,061
so we're approaching
present day.

1099
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:54,723
634 pending arrests.

1100
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:57,694
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

1101
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:00,941
ROBOCOP:
He's on top of her.

1102
00:59:01,072 --> 00:59:02,907
KIM: Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

1103
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:04,404
- I got to do something...!
- Alex...

1104
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:07,072
Alex, ca-calm down.

1105
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:09,869
Take a breath; r-relax.

1106
00:59:09,957 --> 00:59:10,948
Kim, what are
the readings?

1107
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,746
I haven't seen him

1108
00:59:12,919 --> 00:59:14,957
-at levels like this.
- He's gonna shoot 'em. -Alex.

1109
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:18,379
Alex, Alex, r-relax.

1110
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:20,050
Relax.

1111
00:59:20,176 --> 00:59:21,588
Alex...

1112
00:59:21,677 --> 00:59:23,590
- What is this? -This just
a computer glitch?

1113
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,390
KAREN:
No, that's his own crime scene.

1114
00:59:26,474 --> 00:59:27,465
- Alex.
- KIM: He's spiking

1115
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,969
-all over the place.
- Alex!

1116
00:59:30,102 --> 00:59:31,265
- Alex!
- The system is crashing, Doctor.

1117
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:34,106
Alex, can you hear me?
Alex? Alex?

1118
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,272
KIM: I'm not sure
he can handle this.

1119
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:36,395
ROBOCOP:
I gotta do something.

1120
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:38,102
He's emotionally
overloaded.

1121
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:39,443
Unlock me!

1122
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,405
Alex, stop! Stop!

1123
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,152
He's having a seizure!

1124
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:45,241
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

1125
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:46,989
- Get me a live feed.
- I can't do it.

1126
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,202
- Dr. Norton's with the patient.
- Do it now!

1127
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:50,289
Jesus Christ!

1128
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:51,789
- Dr. Norton... Dr. Norton...
- What?!

1129
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,583
The press is waiting.
We have to get him

1130
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:55,957
-up there now.
- What do you want me to do?!

1131
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:58,799
I don't know-- fix him!
Do what you have to do.

1132
00:59:58,924 --> 01:00:02,500
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

1133
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:06,007
We're running
out of time.

1134
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:08,349
Okay.

1135
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,969
Everybody out.

1136
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:12,766
Out!

1137
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:15,224
Mayor Durant is about to take
to the stage and introduce

1138
01:00:15,315 --> 01:00:17,810
Detroit's newest weapon
in the war on crime.

1139
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:21,064
I'm, I'm actually getting word
that he's ready to go right now.

1140
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:23,985
(car alarm blaring)

1141
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:25,825
KIM:
Heart rate rising.

1142
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:27,444
He might start spiking, Doctor.

1143
01:00:27,538 --> 01:00:30,532
NORTON: Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

1144
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:31,997
But you'll be taking
away his emotions.

1145
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,662
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

1146
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,285
Doctor, you'll be taking away

1147
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:37,371
-his ability to feel anything.
- Now, please.

1148
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,840
Pull the footage.

1149
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:46,048
Put it on a loop.

1150
01:00:47,098 --> 01:00:49,216
Dopamine level's at 20%.

1151
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,811
More.

1152
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:54,227
KIM: Dopamine level's
at ten percent.

1153
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:55,974
NORTON:
More.

1154
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:57,189
KIM:
Dopamine level's

1155
01:00:57,275 --> 01:00:58,517
-at five percent.
- Lower...

1156
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,025
- You're flattening him out.
- Lower.

1157
01:01:01,113 --> 01:01:03,983
KIM:
Two percent.

1158
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:06,067
Hold it there.

1159
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:14,585
Alex...

1160
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:16,704
Alex, how do you feel?

1161
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:22,505
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

1162
01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:24,507
MAYOR (voice-over):
Well, today

1163
01:01:24,596 --> 01:01:29,265
I'm not here to talk
about crime prevention.

1164
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,893
I am here to give you the cure!

1165
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,061
That's right!

1166
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:42,737
Hi, Dad.

1167
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,948
(whirring,
footsteps thudding)

1168
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,988
Dad?

1169
01:01:51,957 --> 01:01:53,574
MAYOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

1170
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:56,044
the revolution begins right now

1171
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,750
with Detective Alex Murphy.

1172
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,253
(cheering, whistling, applause)

1173
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:14,390
♪♪

1174
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,140
SELLARS:
Detective.

1175
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,985
(whirring)

1176
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,910
POPE:
He looks like a zombie.

1177
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,416
I think he's accessing
criminal data.

1178
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,049
Thomas King,
you are under arrest.

1179
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,097
(crowd screaming)

1180
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,478
(whirring)

1181
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:07,360
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

1182
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,445
wanted for rape,
arson, and murder.

1183
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:15,708
This man has torn apart
American families.

1184
01:03:15,836 --> 01:03:20,380
On the loose for six years.

1185
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:25,426
And where was
this criminal mastermind hiding?

1186
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:33,306
Right in front
of the police headquarters.

1187
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:38,223
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

1188
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:42,231
These two officers
are completely unaware

1189
01:03:42,363 --> 01:03:46,360
of the monster in their midst.

1190
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:47,691
(crowd screaming)

1191
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:50,412
And then, in 60 seconds--

1192
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:54,535
I repeat, just 60 seconds--

1193
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:58,202
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

1194
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:00,205
ROBOCOP: If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1195
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:02,879
one will be provided for you.

1196
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,883
This, my friends, is the future

1197
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,589
of American justice.

1198
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:10,432
How many like Thomas King

1199
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:11,720
will pay for their crimes

1200
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:15,895
now that RoboCop is here?

1201
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:19,682
Yes, let's not shy away

1202
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,894
from what this means, people.

1203
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:26,064
Men weren't up to the task,

1204
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,866
but Alex Murphy--

1205
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:31,822
a robot cop-- was.

1206
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:33,241
We can't take him
off the street.

1207
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,539
This, this is
what I'm saying.

1208
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,119
He's a hit,
a big, fat, stinking hit.

1209
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,371
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

1210
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:41,045
Hey, we all knew
there would be issues.

1211
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,042
Uh, it's inevitable.

1212
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,419
Dennett, you're my guy.

1213
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,963
I just need you to
get a handle on this.

1214
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,585
I know, but I need more time.

1215
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:49,265
Scientifically,
w-w-we're in uncharted water.

1216
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,428
We need to take him back to
the lab and do more tests.

1217
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:53,135
I mean, it was
like something

1218
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:55,056
was interfering
with our system,

1219
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,731
something beyond
chemistry or physics.

1220
01:04:57,816 --> 01:04:59,774
Like what, his soul?

1221
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:02,273
Hey, look, this train
has already left the station.

1222
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:04,646
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

1223
01:05:04,781 --> 01:05:07,196
"Sorry, I released
a defective product,"

1224
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:08,445
so, no matter what we do,

1225
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:10,319
We just need to keep him
on the streets.

1226
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,618
Uh, what
about the interviews?

1227
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:12,953
Cancel 'em.

1228
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:16,658
Cancel all of 'em--
everything.

1229
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:20,165
In fact, Dennett, let's, uh,

1230
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:24,294
let's keep the wife
at a distance for now as well.

1231
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:26,297
CLARA (voice-over):
I'd like to see him.

1232
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:28,299
Can you arrange that?

1233
01:05:28,388 --> 01:05:30,301
Look, I won't lie to you.

1234
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,467
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

1235
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:36,770
I looked in his eyes
and I couldn't see my husband,

1236
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:39,145
and then he just shoots
a man in front of our son.

1237
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:42,149
That's not sedation.

1238
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:45,818
He's responding to drugs
differently now.

1239
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,986
We both knew, from day one...

1240
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,112
there would be complications.

1241
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,329
Just give me
a little more time.

1242
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,881
I promise...

1243
01:06:03,007 --> 01:06:05,000
you'll have your husband back.

1244
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,548
(elevator bell dings)

1245
01:06:07,678 --> 01:06:11,003
KAREN: This goes for every
squad in every department.

1246
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,134
Detective Murphy
will have full access

1247
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:14,810
to all investigations--

1248
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:17,686
robberies,
narcotics, homicides.

1249
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,857
If he requests
to take over a case,

1250
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:21,854
the case will be
handed to him.

1251
01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:23,852
No arguments, no complaints.

1252
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:25,187
MAN:
This is bullshit.

1253
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,023
I said no complaints,
and I mean it.

1254
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:28,193
Now...

1255
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:31,029
ROBOCOP:
Good morning, Chief Dean.

1256
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,032
Good morning, officers.

1257
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,909
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

1258
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,328
John Biggs is target number one.

1259
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:38,659
I'll be taking over this case.

1260
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:41,372
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

1261
01:06:41,463 --> 01:06:44,049
should be ready
to move in on my request.

1262
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,297
I wish you all a very good day.

1263
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:54,554
Murphy...

1264
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,728
you okay, man?

1265
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:00,518
I'm fine, Sergeant.

1266
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:02,521
Can't wait to get
back to work.

1267
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,398
Lake and Daniels are in there
shitting their pants.

1268
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,947
Excuse me, I have casework.

1269
01:07:12,412 --> 01:07:14,826

(engine roaring)

1274
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:47,781
Brother.

1275
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:49,232
So what's this do?

1276
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:58,288
(yelling)

1277
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:01,082
Don't shoot, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot!

1278
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,289
(tires screech)

1279
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,295
Walter Karrel, look at me.

1280
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:10,799
You have two options.

1281
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:11,971
Option one:

1282
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:14,892
I shoot you
with 50,000 volts,

1283
01:08:14,976 --> 01:08:18,302
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1284
01:08:18,438 --> 01:08:20,807
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control,

1285
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,812
and then I arrest you.

1286
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:24,359
Option two: you tell me

1287
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:26,821
where John Biggs' drug lab
is located,

1288
01:08:26,906 --> 01:08:29,491
and then I arrest you.

1289
01:08:29,574 --> 01:08:32,366
You have two seconds
to decide.

SELLARS: I agree,
that's why I called you here.

1307
01:10:14,266 --> 01:10:17,466
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1308
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:20,473
Okay, I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head...

1309
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:23,067
plus full surveillance
of the lab and...

1310
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,439
You're gonna have full access
to everything.

1311
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:29,480
If anything comes up,
I'm gonna be in Washington.

to this country's
most violent city.

1314
01:10:37,415 --> 01:10:38,578
He showed us all

1315
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,328
that Detroit and America

1316
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:41,575
can have a brighter future--

1317
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,503
a future of economic growth,

1318
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:44,791
freedom, and happiness.

1319
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,794
On tonight's show,

1320
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:49,958
a visionary and true patriot:

1321
01:10:50,053 --> 01:10:54,004
the CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1322
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,849
(applause)

1323
01:10:55,975 --> 01:10:56,842
- Hello, Pat.
- Raymond.

1324
01:10:56,977 --> 01:10:58,308
Thanks for having me.

1325
01:10:58,436 --> 01:11:01,022
You must be doing a
victory lap about now.

1326
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:03,140
- Well...
- Two weeks ago,

1327
01:11:03,232 --> 01:11:05,647
Omni's stock went
through the roof,

1328
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:08,149
and the Senate
has finally agreed

1329
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:10,481
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1330
01:11:10,615 --> 01:11:13,451
Well, look, I mean,
the tide is definitely turning.

1331
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,495
I, I just feel certain
that, soon,

1332
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,991
we'll be keeping
all Americans safe.

1333
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,163
I certainly
hope so,

1334
01:11:18,248 --> 01:11:20,333
but I think
our next guest will have

1335
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,453
a different point of view.

1336
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:22,660
SELLARS:
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:11:22,753 --> 01:11:24,336
Hubert Dreyfus.

1338
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,460
Senator, thank you
for joining us.

1339
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:27,881
Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.

1340
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:30,878
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1341
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:33,551
The American public is divided

1342
01:11:33,681 --> 01:11:35,172
on the Dreyfus Act.

1343
01:11:35,349 --> 01:11:40,178
Our polls at NovakEIement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1344
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:44,185
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,

1345
01:11:44,317 --> 01:11:47,813
but this bill is not
about Alex Murphy.

1346
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,694
It's about whether America
is willing to give robots

1347
01:11:50,781 --> 01:11:51,864
the authority
over human lives.

1348
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:54,486
No, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

1349
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:57,163
This, uh, sea change
we're witnessing--

1350
01:11:57,247 --> 01:12:00,117
and it is a sea change-- shows
that Americans don't really care

1351
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,919
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1352
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:04,912
What they care about
is efficiency

1353
01:12:05,046 --> 01:12:06,333
and they care about safety.

1354
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,880
You're clouding
the issue.

1355
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:10,719
This is clearly an attempt
to sway public opinion

1356
01:12:10,802 --> 01:12:13,341
-with a marketing stunt.
- No, what's clear is

1357
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,173
that with just one system
in place,

1358
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:16,723
We've cut crime by 80%.

1359
01:12:16,808 --> 01:12:19,347
Just imagine if we put,
I don't know,

1360
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,724
let's say
a hundred systems in place.

1361
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:23,728
And then I want you
to ask yourself,

1362
01:12:23,815 --> 01:12:25,354
why are you holding us back?

1363
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:26,558
- Is that your plan?
- Thank you, Senator.

1364
01:12:26,693 --> 01:12:28,561
- And thank you, Raymond.
- Thank you, Pat.

1365
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:31,945
Well, there you have it.

1366
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:33,942
Who could argue with that?

1367
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:36,695
Which begs the question:

1368
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:38,913
has the U.S. Senate

1369
01:12:38,998 --> 01:12:42,494
become pro-crime?

1370
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:47,414
(phone ringing)

1371
01:12:49,842 --> 01:12:50,753
(phone rings, then beeps on)

1372
01:12:50,885 --> 01:12:52,423
Yeah, hi.

1373
01:12:52,512 --> 01:12:54,255
No, no, $5,000.

1374
01:12:54,347 --> 01:12:55,931
Yeah, call me tomorrow.

1375
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:58,769
Hey, guys.

1376
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:01,605
Vallon's waiting
for you inside.

1377
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:03,267
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1378
01:13:03,398 --> 01:13:04,855
- I'm out here making money.
- Yeah, no, I know.

1379
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:06,098
VALLON:
Where are my trip wires?

1380
01:13:06,235 --> 01:13:07,772
I gotta do this myself?

1381
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,227
What took you so long?

1382
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:10,437
DANIELS: What the hell
is all this shit?

1383
01:13:10,572 --> 01:13:11,564
I can't move any product

1384
01:13:11,657 --> 01:13:14,402
with this thing on the streets.

1385
01:13:14,493 --> 01:13:15,825
What are you doing
to protect me?

1386
01:13:15,953 --> 01:13:17,992
Relax, the guy's
a walking zombie.

1387
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:19,454
Tell me your phones are off.

1388
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:20,448
He's not going after you.

1389
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,950
We covered our tracks.

1390
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:24,412
He can't manufacture evidence
out of thin air.

1391
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:26,462
If he does, I'm ready for him.

1392
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:28,958
(thudding, whirring)

1393
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:36,881
Well?

1394
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:41,260
I've been getting calls.

1395
01:13:41,354 --> 01:13:43,188
From whom?

1396
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:44,772
Well, Clara.

1397
01:13:44,858 --> 01:13:46,645
You need to let her
see her husband.

1398
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:48,978
She has rights.

1399
01:13:49,112 --> 01:13:50,320
That's not your decision.

1400
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:52,272
That's Legal's call.

1401
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:54,359
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1402
01:13:54,493 --> 01:13:56,862
before she turns up
on television.

1403
01:13:56,995 --> 01:13:58,989
Well, she can try.

1404
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:01,871
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1405
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:05,535
- I'd hop to it.
- CLARA (voice-over): Alex.

1406
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:08,382
Alex, Alex!

1407
01:14:09,508 --> 01:14:11,468
Alex.

1408
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,385
You need to come home.

1409
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:15,050
Clara, please stand aside.

1410
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,299
- You need to speak to your son.
- Right now,

1411
01:14:17,392 --> 01:14:18,679
I see three crimes in progress.

1412
01:14:18,809 --> 01:14:20,346
- My objective...
- Alex, listen to me.

1413
01:14:20,435 --> 01:14:22,850
I know you're in there.

1414
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,064
David won't show
his face at school.

1415
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:29,853
He's having nightmares.

1416
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:32,322
He's falling apart.

1417
01:14:32,407 --> 01:14:34,024
I'm falling apart.

1418
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:35,233
(gasping)

1419
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:38,204
Please.

1420
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:40,539
I can't do this on my own.

1421
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,827
He's been scared

1422
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,586
ever since that night.

1423
01:14:48,799 --> 01:14:50,542
-(clamoring)
- Come on, brother...!

1424
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,047
LIZ (voice-over): What do you
think she's gonna do?

1425
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:58,142
Hm. What's he gonna do?

1426
01:15:07,192 --> 01:15:09,607

01:26:55,838 --> 01:26:57,251
Even the police,

1605
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,957
the men and women

1606
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:01,967
who swore to keep us safe,

1607
01:27:02,095 --> 01:27:04,179
they can be bribed.

1608
01:27:04,264 --> 01:27:06,884
They... can be bought.

1609
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:10,808
Machines, however,

1610
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:13,307
are corruption-free.

1611
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:16,190
Americans could be living
in a country

1612
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,644
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1613
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:22,653
but incorruptible.

1614
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:24,700
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done,

1615
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:26,866
and for all that you are.

1616
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:30,321
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1617
01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:33,163
Our doctors are
working ceaselessly

1618
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:36,167
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1619
01:27:36,296 --> 01:27:37,881
(reporters clamoring)

1620
01:27:38,007 --> 01:27:39,875
KELLY: Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt

1621
01:27:40,009 --> 01:27:41,968
on Detective
Alex Murphy's life

1622
01:27:42,053 --> 01:27:44,343
will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?

1623
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,218
LIZ: At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern

1624
01:27:46,349 --> 01:27:48,810
is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.

1625
01:27:48,893 --> 01:27:51,182
NOVAK: How many times
does Detective Murphy

1626
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:54,190
have to give his life
for his country?

1627
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:57,858
I sincerely hope

1628
01:27:57,987 --> 01:27:59,854
the Senate makes
the right vote tomorrow,

1629
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,689
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices

1630
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:04,525
will not have been in vain.

1631
01:28:08,788 --> 01:28:10,998
OHIO SENATOR (voice-over):
Senator Dreyfus is my friend.

1632
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:14,204
He has been
my mentor and my strength

1633
01:28:14,294 --> 01:28:16,207
in times of difficulty
on this floor.

1634
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:19,712
But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio

1635
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:23,091
and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.

1636
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,213
So I vote yes.

1637
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:27,215
The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.

1638
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:30,018
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

1639
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:31,560
Yeah, I spoke to
the Senate liaison,

1640
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:33,396
and it looks like
it's in the bag.

1641
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:35,896
But we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1642
01:28:38,277 --> 01:28:40,271
We're here live
at DPD headquarters

1643
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:42,739
where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.

1644
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:44,236
POPE:
What the hell?

1645
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:47,195
Omnicorp has denied me
and my son

1646
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:48,905
access to Alex for weeks.

1647
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,205
I demand to know why.

1648
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:54,457
This treatment is inhuman,

1649
01:28:54,586 --> 01:28:57,581
and somebody needs
to be held accountable.

1650
01:28:59,216 --> 01:29:00,958
- CLARA: Thank you.
- Oh, we're fucked.

1651
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:02,589
No, we only need 12 votes.

1652
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:03,881
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1653
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:05,086
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1654
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:06,554
We... I mean,

1655
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,098
those two should not
be allowed contact.

1656
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:10,889
If-if she starts putting ideas
in his head...

1657
01:29:10,977 --> 01:29:12,139
Bring her in.

1658
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:13,262
I'll handle the explanation.

1659
01:29:13,397 --> 01:29:14,478
And what about Alex?

1660
01:29:14,606 --> 01:29:16,098
You know, unfortunately,

1661
01:29:16,192 --> 01:29:17,650
we can't just keep him on ice.

1662
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:19,397
LIZ: The shooting
at the station

1663
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:20,944
spooked some of the politicians.

1664
01:29:21,072 --> 01:29:23,441
They're our clients;
we have to take care of them.

1665
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:25,818
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1666
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:29,073
but when a man
is investigating city politics,

1667
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,621
they get nervous.

1668
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:32,786
All right, first off,
it's not a man, okay?

1669
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:34,493
It's property of Omnicorp.

1670
01:29:34,627 --> 01:29:37,291
And politics are the
least of your concern.

1671
01:29:37,379 --> 01:29:38,997
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1672
01:29:39,132 --> 01:29:40,294
How long till it realizes

1673
01:29:40,425 --> 01:29:41,632
you haven't been
on the level with it?

1674
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:43,427
POPE: If that happens,
every journalist

1675
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,095
in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1676
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,514
I mean, we-we created a hero.

1677
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:51,102
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1678
01:29:53,814 --> 01:29:56,308
What's bigger than a hero?

1679
01:30:06,744 --> 01:30:09,660
A dead hero.

1680
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:15,452
Get me Dr. Norton.

1681
01:30:24,427 --> 01:30:25,761
What is this, Raymond?

1682
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:28,090
You have Mattox spying on me

1683
01:30:28,182 --> 01:30:30,472
and now this bullshit
about a "critical condition"?

1684
01:30:30,602 --> 01:30:32,595
You know and I know

1685
01:30:32,687 --> 01:30:33,974
Alex is fine!

1686
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:35,313
Calm down.

1687
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,476
What... Dennett.

1688
01:30:36,608 --> 01:30:37,770
Your work is so good, I don't...

1689
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:39,146
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1690
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:40,318
You saw the woman on TV!

1691
01:30:40,445 --> 01:30:43,109
This has to stop!

1692
01:30:45,492 --> 01:30:47,404
You're right.

1693
01:30:47,535 --> 01:30:49,154
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1694
01:30:49,288 --> 01:30:52,123
What kind of life have we really
given Alex Murphy?

1695
01:30:52,206 --> 01:30:53,825
He's never gonna be
a normal man,

1696
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:55,705
a father, a husband.

1697
01:30:55,836 --> 01:30:57,999
By the time we put
the other units on the street,

1698
01:30:58,129 --> 01:31:00,464
he's just... Dennett...

1699
01:31:00,549 --> 01:31:01,837
(sighs)

1700
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:04,553
Let's face it.

1701
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:07,469
We failed him.

1702
01:31:07,556 --> 01:31:09,220
We failed Alex Murphy.

1703
01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:11,176
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1704
01:31:11,268 --> 01:31:13,011
because that's
what we're talking about.

1705
01:31:13,145 --> 01:31:15,639
The work you've done with him
is gonna be studied for decades.

1706
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:17,849
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1707
01:31:17,983 --> 01:31:21,024
No policeman
is ever going to die

1708
01:31:21,111 --> 01:31:22,353
in the line of duty again

1709
01:31:22,447 --> 01:31:24,781
because of you.

1710
01:31:26,283 --> 01:31:28,277
Think about that.

1711
01:31:35,836 --> 01:31:38,330
I want that family

1712
01:31:38,421 --> 01:31:41,337
taken care of
beyond their wildest dreams.

1713
01:31:41,424 --> 01:31:42,541
We owe them that.

1714
01:31:42,634 --> 01:31:44,091
I agree.

1715
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:46,429
I want full funding

1716
01:31:46,555 --> 01:31:48,046
for ten years.

1717
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:50,179
New staff, all my own people.

1718
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:52,054
Fantastic.

1719
01:31:52,185 --> 01:31:53,598
Deal.

1720
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:05,073
Hey, what's going on?

1721
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:06,235
Security's here.

1722
01:32:06,367 --> 01:32:07,574
They're clearing everyone out.

1723
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:09,239
They're not waking him up.

1724
01:32:09,328 --> 01:32:11,412
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1725
01:32:11,497 --> 01:32:13,081
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1726
01:32:13,165 --> 01:32:15,955
SENATE LEADER:
The voting period has ended.

1727
01:32:16,043 --> 01:32:18,127
The clerks have
tabulated the results.

1728
01:32:18,254 --> 01:32:21,090
The yeas are 63.

1729
01:32:21,216 --> 01:32:22,924
The nays are 22.

1730
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:25,795
A majority of senators
have voted in the affirmative.

1731
01:32:25,928 --> 01:32:28,548
The Dreyfus Act
has been repealed

1732
01:32:28,723 --> 01:32:29,930
by Congress.

1733
01:32:30,016 --> 01:32:31,976
(applause over TV)

1734
01:32:34,354 --> 01:32:35,937
(phone rings)

1735
01:32:36,022 --> 01:32:38,141
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1736
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:39,310
This is Mattox.

1737
01:32:39,442 --> 01:32:41,060
SELLARS:
Dennett's on board.

1738
01:32:41,153 --> 01:32:43,146
It's about time.

1739
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:49,568
Call it.

1740
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:51,119
Get it done.

1741
01:32:51,204 --> 01:32:53,197
My pleasure.

1742
01:32:55,626 --> 01:32:57,619
(doorbell rings)

1743
01:33:01,632 --> 01:33:02,873
Mrs. Murphy...

1744
01:33:02,966 --> 01:33:04,504
You can come here
as much as you want.

1745
01:33:04,635 --> 01:33:05,968
You can threaten me.

1746
01:33:06,095 --> 01:33:07,460
You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1747
01:33:07,554 --> 01:33:09,218
But I am not gonna stop
till I see my husband.

1748
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:10,636
Do you understand that?

1749
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:14,058
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1750
01:33:15,271 --> 01:33:16,808
Is Alex okay?

1751
01:33:16,897 --> 01:33:18,811
He has important information
to share with you.

1752
01:33:18,942 --> 01:33:21,356
Will you accompany me?

1753
01:33:22,528 --> 01:33:24,863
David.

1754
01:33:24,989 --> 01:33:25,980
We gotta go.

1755
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:27,197
Can you grab your coat?

1756
01:33:27,325 --> 01:33:28,361
(phone rings)

1757
01:33:28,492 --> 01:33:29,859
Hey.

1758
01:33:29,994 --> 01:33:31,361
NORTON: I'm in the elevator,
on my way down.

1759
01:33:31,496 --> 01:33:33,033
I need access to the lab.

1760
01:33:33,164 --> 01:33:34,247
That's insane;
they're still here.

1761
01:33:34,374 --> 01:33:35,786
NORTON:
Distract them.

1762
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,493
Okay.

1763
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,002
I cannot...!

1764
01:33:40,129 --> 01:33:42,169
There's a lady in here
going hysterical.

1765
01:33:42,299 --> 01:33:44,212
She will not let us in;
she's got the code for the door.

1766
01:33:44,343 --> 01:33:45,459
I repeat:
She will not let us in.

1767
01:33:45,552 --> 01:33:46,840
Lady, you need to let us
in there now.

1768
01:33:46,929 --> 01:33:48,341
We have to get in there.

1769
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,968
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1770
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,844
Do you want to be responsible
for the deaths

1771
01:33:51,934 --> 01:33:52,891
of everyone in this building?

1772
01:33:53,018 --> 01:33:54,008
Hey! Stop!

1773
01:33:54,143 --> 01:33:56,137
(panting)

1774
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,189
Don't shoot.

1775
01:33:59,274 --> 01:34:01,644
Step outside.

1776
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,488
Unlock the transmitter!

1777
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,786
KIM:
Transmitter unlocked.

1778
01:34:18,336 --> 01:34:20,706
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1779
01:34:20,839 --> 01:34:22,501
WOMAN (over intercom):
Right away, sir.

1780
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:26,168
NORTON (voice-over):
Wake him up!

1781
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:29,587
Alex! Alex!

1782
01:34:29,723 --> 01:34:30,714
Alex, it's Dr. Norton.

1783
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:32,846
You have to wake up!

1784
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:34,552
Alex, can you hear me?

1785
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,012
These men are here to kill us.

1786
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:38,563
They're here to kill us,

1787
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,436
for Christ sakes!

1788
01:34:44,988 --> 01:34:46,902
SELLARS (voice-over):
Mrs. Murphy, last night,

1789
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:48,778
Alex had a psychotic break.

1790
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:50,868
He killed an unarmed colleague

1791
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:53,196
and later suffered a seizure.

1792
01:34:53,289 --> 01:34:55,874
We did everything--

1793
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:57,746
everything-- we could,

1794
01:34:57,835 --> 01:34:59,121
but the doctors
couldn't save him.

1795
01:35:00,337 --> 01:35:01,922
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1796
01:35:02,049 --> 01:35:04,040
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1797
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:06,547
ROBOCOP (voice-over):
You shut me down.

1798
01:35:06,636 --> 01:35:08,253
I was about to get a confession.

1799
01:35:08,387 --> 01:35:11,759
Mattox shut you down.

1800
01:35:11,849 --> 01:35:13,056
I've removed your transmitter,

1801
01:35:13,142 --> 01:35:14,761
so he won't do it again.

1802
01:35:14,895 --> 01:35:17,935
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1803
01:35:18,022 --> 01:35:20,517
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1804
01:35:20,609 --> 01:35:22,567
He wants you dead, Alex.

1805
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:24,270
You understand?

1806
01:35:24,404 --> 01:35:25,817
SELLARS (voice-over):
Sorry. If there's anything

1807
01:35:25,948 --> 01:35:28,112
we can do for you and
David, we'll do it.

1808
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,820
I want nothing from you.

1809
01:35:30,953 --> 01:35:32,490
I understand.

1810
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:35,035
You stay out of our lives.

1811
01:35:36,249 --> 01:35:37,991
You and your company.

1812
01:35:38,127 --> 01:35:39,994
If that's what
you think is best.

1813
01:35:40,128 --> 01:35:41,837
There's one more thing.

1814
01:35:41,964 --> 01:35:44,174
I think it would be to
the benefit of everyone,

1815
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,540
especially David,

1816
01:35:45,633 --> 01:35:47,968
if we kept
this matter private.

1817
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:51,015
We don't want to damage
Alex's legacy.

1818
01:35:52,225 --> 01:35:53,968
NORTON (voice-over):
Alex.

1819
01:35:54,102 --> 01:35:55,183
Alex!

1820
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,518
I can fix this!

1821
01:35:56,645 --> 01:35:57,761
You lied to me.

1822
01:35:57,855 --> 01:35:59,643
You lied to my wife.

1823
01:35:59,732 --> 01:36:01,476
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1824
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,692
You want me to
trust you, Doctor?

1825
01:36:02,819 --> 01:36:04,937
Alex, I can go to the press!

1826
01:36:05,029 --> 01:36:08,320
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1827
01:36:08,407 --> 01:36:11,198
Alex!

1828
01:36:11,327 --> 01:36:14,288
Listen to me, please!

1829
01:36:14,373 --> 01:36:15,614
Alex!

1830
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:17,700
Alex...!

1831
01:36:26,468 --> 01:36:28,552
(engine roaring)

1832
01:36:28,678 --> 01:36:30,421
What the hell...?

1833
01:36:31,348 --> 01:36:32,886
(tires squealing)

1834
01:36:35,561 --> 01:36:36,801
(passing car honking horn)

1835
01:36:36,895 --> 01:36:38,353
(engine revving)

1836
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,687
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1837
01:36:39,815 --> 01:36:41,398
and for Christ sakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1838
01:36:41,525 --> 01:36:42,391
MAN:
Roger that.

1839
01:36:42,526 --> 01:36:45,397
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1840
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:47,863
Look at this city.

1841
01:36:50,242 --> 01:36:52,531
So beautiful.

1842
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:54,989
It's become so peaceful.

1843
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:00,577
I wish...

1844
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,045
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1845
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:04,588
I have very sad news.

1846
01:37:04,715 --> 01:37:05,831
Despite our best efforts

1847
01:37:05,925 --> 01:37:08,010
to save him,

1848
01:37:08,094 --> 01:37:10,554
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1849
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,888
Alex Murphy was...

1850
01:37:12,015 --> 01:37:13,552
SECURITY OFFICER:
Mr. Sellars.

1851
01:37:13,683 --> 01:37:15,551
- What is it?
- Mattox just called.

1852
01:37:15,685 --> 01:37:17,804
We need to you to come
with us now.

1853
01:37:19,856 --> 01:37:21,063
(elevator bell dings)

1854
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:25,728
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1855
01:37:25,862 --> 01:37:26,899
What are you talking about?

1856
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:28,275
We have
a security situation here.

1857
01:37:28,406 --> 01:37:29,819
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1858
01:37:29,908 --> 01:37:30,899
Sir, there's a car
outside that's...

1859
01:37:31,034 --> 01:37:32,197
That area is locked down.

1860
01:37:32,286 --> 01:37:33,401
- Now go.
- What's happening?

1861
01:37:33,495 --> 01:37:35,408
I said go!

1862
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:37,703
I want to talk to Mr. Sellars.

1863
01:37:40,086 --> 01:37:41,577
Mr. Sellars.

1864
01:37:41,712 --> 01:37:43,671
- How close is that helicopter?
- About ten minutes, sir.

1865
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:56,051
♪♪

1866
01:38:01,524 --> 01:38:02,936
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1867
01:38:03,067 --> 01:38:04,980
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1868
01:38:05,111 --> 01:38:06,103
- Yes.
- It's an emergency.

1869
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:07,229
SECURITY OFFICER:
Stand by.

1870
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:08,405
Mr. Sellars.

1871
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:09,981
Apparently there's
a Clara Murphy

1872
01:38:10,116 --> 01:38:11,324
in the lobby.

1873
01:38:11,451 --> 01:38:12,908
Uh, Raymond, if she sees him,

1874
01:38:12,994 --> 01:38:14,737
-we are dead in the water.
- What do you want to do?

1875
01:38:14,829 --> 01:38:16,492
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1876
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:17,786
Yes, sir.

1877
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:20,619
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

1878
01:38:20,752 --> 01:38:22,792
LEWIS (voice-over):
Norton said they may be

1879
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,292
using drones for protection.

1880
01:38:24,422 --> 01:38:26,757
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1881
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:28,584
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed.

1882
01:38:28,676 --> 01:38:30,716
- Clear?
- Clear. -Clear.

1883
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:41,140
(siren wailing)

1884
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,441
(engine decelerating)

1885
01:38:47,029 --> 01:38:48,487
OFFICER:
Hold it right there!

1886
01:38:48,572 --> 01:38:49,529
OFFICER 2 (over radio):
...coming your way.

1887
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:50,444
Don't move!

1888
01:38:52,786 --> 01:38:54,494
This is private property.

1889
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:57,582
You are not authorized
to be here!

1890
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,872
(electricity crackling,
officer groans)

1891
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:02,334
ROBOCOP:
I'd put those guns down now

1892
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:03,753
if I were you.

1893
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,167
OFFICER:
Stand down. Stand down.

1894
01:39:05,299 --> 01:39:07,291
OFFICER 2: All right, man,
we're good We're good!

1895
01:39:08,177 --> 01:39:08,962
Let's go! Back it up!

1896
01:39:23,067 --> 01:39:25,059
(whirring)

1897
01:39:35,913 --> 01:39:37,451
(thudding)

1898
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,670
(sirens wailing)

1899
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:53,466
Head to the lower level.

1900
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:56,808
- GUARD: Hold up! Hold up!
- Ram it!

1901
01:40:06,902 --> 01:40:08,896
(thudding)

1902
01:40:25,631 --> 01:40:28,548
(grunting, groaning)

1903
01:40:33,139 --> 01:40:35,177
(grunting with effort)

1904
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:49,941
(sirens wailing)

1905
01:40:50,072 --> 01:40:51,907
(tires squealing)

1906
01:40:56,246 --> 01:40:57,578
(grunting)

1907
01:40:57,664 --> 01:40:58,244
Gun it!

1908
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:02,038
Go, go, go, now!

1909
01:41:06,256 --> 01:41:07,747
(groaning)

1910
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,467
Alex, run!

1911
01:41:18,602 --> 01:41:21,392
Omnicorp Security!

1912
01:41:21,521 --> 01:41:22,979
- Drop your weapons!
- ED-209: Drop your weapon.

1913
01:41:23,066 --> 01:41:25,856
Keep your hands above your head,

1914
01:41:25,984 --> 01:41:27,475
and no one will be harmed.

1915
01:41:36,287 --> 01:41:39,123
(sirens wailing in distance)

1916
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,618
What's going on?

1917
01:41:43,712 --> 01:41:45,955
Mrs. Murphy, I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1918
01:41:46,047 --> 01:41:47,790
The organic part
of your husband Alex is dead.

1919
01:41:47,882 --> 01:41:50,876
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1920
01:41:51,011 --> 01:41:52,218
and he's shooting up
the building.

1921
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:53,837
So we've got to get you
and your son

1922
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:55,012
out of here right away.

1923
01:41:55,098 --> 01:41:57,889
I've got to take this call.

1924
01:41:58,017 --> 01:41:59,555
He just left the lobby,
and he's headed our way.

1925
01:41:59,686 --> 01:42:01,177
MATTOX:
Roger that, sir.

1926
01:42:01,312 --> 01:42:02,520
Don't shoot.

1927
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:03,854
My robot. You just flank.

1928
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,933
- Got it.
- Tin Man!

1929
01:42:08,653 --> 01:42:10,020
Tin Man?

1930
01:42:10,155 --> 01:42:12,865
Tin Man.

1931
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:14,190
Oh, there it is.

1932
01:42:14,327 --> 01:42:16,319
You look like crap.

1933
01:42:18,538 --> 01:42:20,030
What's the matter?

1934
01:42:20,124 --> 01:42:21,411
Can't shoot?

1935
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,749
Huh?

1936
01:42:22,877 --> 01:42:25,417
What were you thinking?

1937
01:42:25,546 --> 01:42:27,002
This isn't a drill.

1938
01:42:27,088 --> 01:42:28,080
You're a robot.

1939
01:42:28,215 --> 01:42:29,377
I'm a red asset.

1940
01:42:29,467 --> 01:42:30,549
Wrote that myself.

1941
01:42:30,676 --> 01:42:32,418
What do you think?

1942
01:42:32,553 --> 01:42:35,594
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1943
01:42:35,723 --> 01:42:37,717
Pull it.

1944
01:42:37,809 --> 01:42:39,016
You can run.

1945
01:42:39,102 --> 01:42:40,058
Go on.

1946
01:42:40,185 --> 01:42:41,677
Run.

1947
01:42:41,854 --> 01:42:43,062
Run!

1948
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:44,055
There you go.

1949
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:45,271
Run.

1950
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,143
Run. Run!

1951
01:42:48,112 --> 01:42:49,227
(yells)

1952
01:42:49,362 --> 01:42:51,401
(whoops)

1953
01:42:51,489 --> 01:42:53,233
- Stings like a bitch, don't it?
-(groaning)

1954
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:56,283
Aren't you lucky I didn't have
my gun set to "kill"?

1955
01:42:58,163 --> 01:43:00,247
Hey, listen...

1956
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:02,792
this isn't personal.

1957
01:43:02,918 --> 01:43:04,786
Well, maybe a little.

1958
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,370
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1959
01:43:08,464 --> 01:43:10,253
(gunshot)

1960
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:21,467
SECURITY OFFICER:
Helicopter's approaching.

1961
01:43:21,603 --> 01:43:22,810
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1962
01:43:22,938 --> 01:43:24,272
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy,

1963
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:26,016
you and your son
can get on first.

1964
01:43:27,944 --> 01:43:29,937
(groaning, gasping)

1965
01:43:30,072 --> 01:43:32,611
Officer down.

1966
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:33,781
Mechanical room.

1967
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:35,571
Omnicorp Building.

1968
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:37,778
OFFICER (over radio):
Roger that. EMS on the way.

1969
01:43:37,912 --> 01:43:39,952
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1970
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,078
Nonfatal.

1971
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:44,331
Go. Go.

1972
01:43:46,003 --> 01:43:48,088
PILOT: Omni-LZ Helo One
on approach to deck.

1973
01:43:48,173 --> 01:43:50,166
(whirring, footsteps thudding)

1974
01:43:53,929 --> 01:43:55,888
CO-PILOT:
What's that?

1975
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,928
- CO-PILOT: He's got a gun.
- PILOT: What?

1976
01:43:59,017 --> 01:44:00,007
CO-PILOT:
Pull up! Pull up!

1977
01:44:04,981 --> 01:44:05,973
What the hell's he doing?

1978
01:44:06,108 --> 01:44:07,315
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1979
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:13,902
Alex?

1980
01:44:13,991 --> 01:44:14,902
Dad?

1981
01:44:14,992 --> 01:44:16,736
(gasping)

1982
01:44:17,995 --> 01:44:20,581
Clara, David.

1983
01:44:20,664 --> 01:44:23,283
No, wait-wait-wait. Wait.

1984
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:24,742
Get out of the way.

1985
01:44:24,836 --> 01:44:26,749
- Alex, put down the gun.
- Clara,

1986
01:44:26,838 --> 01:44:28,249
take David
and get out of the way now!

1987
01:44:30,049 --> 01:44:31,461
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1988
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,338
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1989
01:44:36,765 --> 01:44:37,972
Are you here to cuff me?

1990
01:44:38,099 --> 01:44:39,637
All right.

1991
01:44:39,768 --> 01:44:41,932
Go ahead, cuff me.

1992
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,104
You can't.

1993
01:44:44,188 --> 01:44:45,521
You're not programmed that way.

1994
01:44:45,649 --> 01:44:46,935
If you go against the program,

1995
01:44:47,025 --> 01:44:48,859
the entire system
shuts down, so...

1996
01:44:48,985 --> 01:44:50,773
You don't even have a warrant.

1997
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:52,650
- We'll overlook this little...
- Get down on the ground and put

1998
01:44:52,781 --> 01:44:54,820
-your hands behind your back.
- I-I'm just from Marketing.

1999
01:44:54,909 --> 01:44:55,990
- Ok -Now!
- Okay, yep, yep, yep.

2000
01:44:56,075 --> 01:44:57,316
Yep.

2001
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:58,699
Alex, we need
to work together here.

2002
01:44:58,829 --> 01:45:00,821
Because I'm the only one

2003
01:45:00,914 --> 01:45:03,501
with the technology
to keep you alive.

2004
01:45:03,668 --> 01:45:05,661
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

2005
01:45:05,753 --> 01:45:07,665
(whirring)

2006
01:45:07,754 --> 01:45:10,466
-(clank)
-(groaning)

2007
01:45:11,717 --> 01:45:12,958
All right.

2008
01:45:13,053 --> 01:45:14,885
Weapon.

2009
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:16,633
Alex, honestly,

2010
01:45:16,722 --> 01:45:18,179
I mean you no harm.

2011
01:45:18,308 --> 01:45:19,469
If I wanted to,

2012
01:45:19,558 --> 01:45:21,143
I could have killed you
a long time ago.

2013
01:45:21,227 --> 01:45:22,684
I just aim this right
at your head and blow it off.

2014
01:45:22,812 --> 01:45:24,019
CLARA:
Sellars, please!

2015
01:45:24,146 --> 01:45:25,308
Don't!

2016
01:45:25,397 --> 01:45:26,686
I mean, if I wanted to,
I could just

2017
01:45:26,775 --> 01:45:29,018
aim this at your little family,

2018
01:45:29,152 --> 01:45:30,860
and I could just kill them too.

2019
01:45:30,945 --> 01:45:32,563
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it,

2020
01:45:32,697 --> 01:45:34,565
because, let's face it...

2021
01:45:34,699 --> 01:45:36,659
you're a robot.

2022
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:39,454
Do you understand that?

2023
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:43,993
Alex...

2024
01:45:47,295 --> 01:45:49,083
Dad!

2025
01:45:52,008 --> 01:45:53,374
CLARA (whispering):
Baby.

Hey... everything's

NOVAK:
There's still no word

2045
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:22,035
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

2046
01:48:22,122 --> 01:48:25,493
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

2047
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,169
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

2048
01:48:28,253 --> 01:48:31,419
But we have obtained
exclusive video

2049
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,039
taken by cell phone

2050
01:48:33,175 --> 01:48:35,418
that shows the people of Detroit

2051
01:48:35,552 --> 01:48:37,716
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

2052
01:48:37,847 --> 01:48:40,216
sooner than they think.

2053
01:48:40,349 --> 01:48:43,674
The real tragedy here is that

2054
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:48,098
our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

2055
01:48:48,232 --> 01:48:51,729
Now, I have no doubt
he was manipulated

2056
01:48:51,861 --> 01:48:53,899
by our biased media

2057
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:57,196
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

2058
01:48:57,283 --> 01:49:01,407
I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.

2059
01:49:01,538 --> 01:49:05,284
But I do believe
my research program is sound.

2060
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:08,167
What I did with it...

2061
01:49:09,379 --> 01:49:11,212
...was wrong.

2062
01:49:11,298 --> 01:49:13,131
The fact that
this mother (bleep)

2063
01:49:13,257 --> 01:49:17,084
is not serving time
in some Federal penitentiary

2064
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:21,171
is a huge, hot, heaping pile
of horse (bleep)!

2065
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,480
Now I know some of you may think

2066
01:49:28,606 --> 01:49:31,397
that this kind
of thinking is dangerous

2067
01:49:31,484 --> 01:49:33,648
and these machines violate

2068
01:49:33,779 --> 01:49:35,441
your civil liberties.

2069
01:49:35,572 --> 01:49:39,399
Some of you even believe that
the use of these drones overseas

2070
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:41,907
makes us the same kind

2071
01:49:41,995 --> 01:49:43,829
of bullying imperialists

2072
01:49:43,956 --> 01:49:47,281
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

2073
01:49:47,417 --> 01:49:50,254
To you, I say,

2074
01:49:50,421 --> 01:49:53,792
stop whining!

2075
01:49:53,924 --> 01:49:56,965
America is now,
