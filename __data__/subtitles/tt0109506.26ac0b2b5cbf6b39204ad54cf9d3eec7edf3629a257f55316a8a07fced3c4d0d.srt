1
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,345
<i>People once believed
that when someone dies,</i>

2
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.</i>

3
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,936
<i>But sometimes, something so bad happens</i>

4
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>that a terrible sadness
is carried with it,</i>

5
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,732
<i>and the soul can't rest.</i>

6
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>Then, sometimes, just sometimes,</i>

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,697
<i>the crow can bring that soul back</i>

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>to put the wrong things right.</i>

9
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,578
Over here.

10
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,460
Hey, Sarge!

11
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,003
Yeah?

12
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,757
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,759
Wedding was tomorrow night.

14
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,553
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

15
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,972
Nobody.

16
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,477
Sir, we got to move her.

17
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,811
Do it.

18
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,730
All right, guys, let's do it.

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,900
Devil's fucking night.
What's the count so far?

20
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,568
Hundred and forty-three fires.

21
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,487
They're slacking off from last year.

22
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,490
Three hours to go. Maybe they're
just slow starters.

23
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,991
Coming through!

24
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,790
You guys just can't come in here

25
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,999
and take her away like this.

26
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,709
There are procedures to stick by.

27
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,670
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,588
Is this the victim?

29
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,547
No, it's Amelia Earhart.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,633
We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.

31
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,884
I don't care what her name is.

32
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,011
I didn't the give the order to move her.

33
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,598
Jesus, Albrecht, I can see why they
took away your gold shield.

34
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,517
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on, let's go.

35
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,853
All right, clear out of here.

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,649
Shelly?
Stand back, kid.

37
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,820
Where's Eric?

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,655
Just don't worry about him.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,575
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,870
Look, I will. You just lie back.
Come on, come on.

41
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,132
Are you Sarah?

42
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,633
Yeah.

43
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,053
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

44
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,055
She's not my sister.

45
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,558
Shelly just takes care of me.

46
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,894
She's my friend.
Her and Eric.

47
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,733
You lied to her about Eric.

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,568
Look, I had to.

49
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,070
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

50
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,574
She's gonna die, isn't she?

51
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
Hey...

52
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,003
Now, come on.
Come on.

53
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,713
It's okay.

54
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,842
She's gonna be fine.

55
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,905
<i>A building gets torched.</i>

56
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,990
<i>All that is left is ashes.</i>

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,910
<i>I used to think that was true
about everything.</i>

58
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,705
<i>Families, friends, feelings.</i>

59
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,627
<i>But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real,</i>

60
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,879
<i>two people who are meant to be together,</i>

61
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,672
<i>nothing can keep them apart.</i>

62
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,743
Later.

63
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,171
What are you, like the night watchman?

64
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,904
You know, what this place needs

65
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,991
is a good natural catastrophe.

66
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,661
Earthquake, tornado, you know?

67
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,288
No, no, no.
Mickey, come on, man.

68
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,874
You got to put the mustard
underneath first.

69
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,084
Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

70
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,211
Hey, hey. Hey, come on.
Let me do it.

71
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,922
There we go.

72
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,091
All right.
How about some onions?

73
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,928
Come on, man. Don't cheap
out on me. Lots of onions.

74
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,138
All right, here you go.

75
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,056
Hey! All right.

76
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,225
Now we're talkin'.

77
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,229
Hey. It's the Sarah monster.

78
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,316
How do you steer that thing
on a wet street?

79
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,735
Pure talent. Hi.

80
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,154
See, now, Sarah, she's
a genuine hot dogger.

81
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,280
You hungry?

82
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,740
You buyin'?

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,908
I'm buyin'.

84
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,826
No onions, though, okay?

85
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,119
No onions?

86
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,996
They make you fart big time.

87
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,924
You know, Lake Erie actually
caught on fire once

88
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,009
from all the crap floating around in it.

89
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,012
I wish I could have seen that.

90
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
Fire it up! Yeah!

91
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,286
Fire it up!

92
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,121
We busted their machines!

93
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,398
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T-Bird, cop car, cop car.

94
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,991
Bad people out on the street tonight.

95
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,957
- Damn it!
- Oh, my God!

96
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,000
What was that?

97
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,293
You wait right here.
Be careful.

98
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,129
Mickey, call it in for me!

99
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,422
Gabriel.

100
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,392
Eric?

101
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,020
Department of housing!

102
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,148
Code violations?
Safety hazard?

103
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,442
Place looks fine to me.

104
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,527
Let's redecorate.

105
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,243
"Abashed, the Devil stood

106
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,038
"and felt how awful goodness is.

107
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,125
"Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."

108
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,376
It's pornography.

109
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,087
<i>Virtue?</i>

110
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,550
Shelly?

111
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
See ya!

112
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,141
No, no, no.
Me first.

113
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,150
Eric!

114
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,275
Hey, that's good.

115
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,199
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

116
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,119
Look at that.
Look at that.

117
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,289
Here's to Devil's Night.

118
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,582
My new favorite holiday.

119
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,506
You need to go over there
and talk to your pals.

120
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,633
You sick fuck!

121
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,637
You're out of your
motherfucking mind, man.

122
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,603
Man, look at that.

123
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,648
Pussies drink last, man.

124
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,526
Fuck you, Tin Tin.

125
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,653
Hey...

126
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,197
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

127
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,159
This one is.

128
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,332
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

129
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,461
Hey, fire it up!

130
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,172
Fire it up!
Fire it up!

131
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,383
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

132
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,177
Fire it up!

133
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,679
Here's your shooters.

134
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,598
Put your guns away, guys?

135
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,516
How you doing, Pussycat?

136
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,624
Boo.

137
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,219
I love you.

138
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,678
Say that again.

139
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,305
I love you.

140
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,724
Oh, boy.

141
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,602
Restaurant.

142
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>Wow, you look great.</i>

143
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,570
Ta-da!

144
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,409
Yeah!

145
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,621
Come here!
No, no, no!

146
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,639
Couple more rings.
That's 24k.

147
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,391
24k? It's 18k.

148
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,352
It's crap.
It's probably fake.

149
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,354
Leather purse.
Leather.

150
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,357
Geez.

151
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,361
Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?
A blood stain that's on here?

152
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,449
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

153
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,868
Now, you take it or leave it.

154
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,539
Right there for ya.

155
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,750
Decisions, decisions.

156
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,673
You cheap-ass, chrome-dome,

157
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,759
child-molestin' saprophyte, motherfucker.

158
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
Close the gate when you go out!

159
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,889
Oh, I'll close this up for
you real good, massa.

160
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,558
Fuck you.

161
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,812
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

162
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,860
Lucky I didn't stab your fat ass.

163
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,095
What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead?

164
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,727
Halloween ain't till manana.

165
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,691
Come on.

166
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,884
I'll cut you!

167
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,856
Fuck, you murderer!

168
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,108
I ain't murdered nobody, man!

169
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,526
I don't even fucking know you, man!

170
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,902
What the fuck do you want, man?

171
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,946
I want you to tell me a story.

172
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,741
A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.

173
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,993
You're out of your motherfucking mind.

174
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,954
Listen! I'm sure you'll remember.

175
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,624
You killed them.
On Halloween.

176
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,752
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Halloween, yeah.

177
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,962
Some dude, some bitch.
Whatever, man.

178
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,964
Her name was Shelly.

179
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,718
You cut her.
You raped her.

180
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,678
Shelly. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,890
I shanked her pink ass and she loved it!

182
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,110
Murder, man? Murder?

183
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,863
Let me tell you about murder. It's fun.

184
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,782
It's easy.

185
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,743
You gonna learn all about it.

186
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,125
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

187
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,170
We never miss.

188
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,890
Try harder.
Try again!

189
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,983
Victims.
Aren't we all?

190
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,178
Look at this mess!
What's the world coming to?

191
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,857
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

192
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,072
Get out of my way, you worms!

193
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,826
Give me some of that, over there!

194
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,873
Why don't you ladies come
by later, check me out?

195
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,292
Hey, guess what.

196
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,795
Arcade games fell down, went boom.

197
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,921
Boom.

198
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,215
Can you imagine that?
It's tragic.

199
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,759
Gather your soldiers.

200
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,095
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

201
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,680
Is the man in?

202
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,973
He's taking a meeting.

203
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,339
You're thinking about the past.

204
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,012
Dad gave me this.

205
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,806
Fifth birthday.

206
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,060
He said,

207
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,854
"Childhood's over the moment
you know you're gonna die."

208
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,286
Is she asleep?

209
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,796
I think we broke her.

210
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,137
I love her eyes.
Pretty.

211
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,032
Hey, kid, get the hell out of the road!

212
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,057
I told you to stay out of here.

213
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,059
So, I guess you're not gonna be home

214
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,061
till a lot later, Darla?

215
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,354
She's busy.

216
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,065
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

217
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,358
I don't have any dolls.

218
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,030
Get some food?

219
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,074
Somebody already bought
me dinner. The police.

220
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,082
"Somebody already bought
me dinner. The police."

221
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:59,265
$20, $40, $60, $80.

222
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,893
Who the fuck is this now?

223
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,980
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!

224
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,190
<i>Cerrado!</i>

225
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,194
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead!

226
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,904
Unless you want to get mutilated.

227
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,456
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

228
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,960
Hey! Hey!

229
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,635
"Suddenly, I heard a tapping,

230
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,054
"as if someone gently rapping,

231
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,056
"rapping at my chamber door."

232
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,935
What are you talking about?

233
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,938
You heard me rapping, right?

234
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,273
You're trespassing.

235
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,943
And you owe me a fucking new door!

236
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,115
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

237
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,366
Gold.

238
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,119
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

239
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,252
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!

240
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,131
Shit on me.
Shit on me!

241
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,473
Mr. Gideon.
You're not paying attention.

242
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,105
No! My hand!

243
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,024
I repeat,

244
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,986
a gold engagement ring, yes?

245
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,446
It was pawned here a year ago

246
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,490
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

247
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,496
He confided in me before
he ran out of breath.

248
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,461
Who's this sack of shit?

249
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,299
That's Tin Tin, one of T-Bird's
little helpers.

250
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,509
I think you can rule out accidental death.

251
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,263
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

252
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,182
This could be a turf hit,

253
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,434
but it doesn't look like
your usual gang crap.

254
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,227
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.

255
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,189
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

256
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,274
I'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

257
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,735
Word to the wise...

258
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,236
Watch your fucking mouth.

259
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,323
What the hell do you call that?

260
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,327
I call it blood, Detective.

261
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,330
I suppose you'll
write it up as "graffiti."

262
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,042
You can leave my crime scene now, okay?

263
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,593
Warmer?
What are you doing?

264
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,053
Don't you know this game?

265
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,471
What game are you talking about?

266
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,349
Okay, the rings! I'll tell
you about the rings!

267
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,393
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

268
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,357
Take it!
Take your fucking rings!

269
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,359
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!

270
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,447
Look, it goes up to the attic.

271
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,157
Okay.

272
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,459
No, no.

273
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,587
No, no, no.

274
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,427
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.

275
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,350
Shelly.

276
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,443
I love you.

277
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,328
You have one chance to live.

278
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,205
Take anything you want.
Thank you.

279
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,415
Take anything!

280
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,544
Now you're gonna tell me where to find

281
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,671
the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.

282
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,589
The Pit. They all hang out at The Pit.

283
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,301
All of T-Birds' little potato-heads
hang out there.

284
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,220
Funboy. He lives there
upstairs, all right?

285
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,680
Funboy.

286
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,724
Oh, baby, oh!

287
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,269
A whole jolly club...

288
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,312
Stop! Stop! Please!

289
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,730
...With jolly pirate nicknames!

290
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,274
Stop! Please!
Jesus Christ...

291
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,442
Hold still!

292
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,197
Each one of these is a life,

293
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,657
a life you helped destroy.

294
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,493
I'm begging you, all right?
Don't kill me.

295
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,164
I'm not gonna kill you.

296
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,708
Your job will be to tell the rest of them

297
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,169
that death is coming for them...

298
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,378
Tonight.

299
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,679
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

300
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,684
You walk out of here,

301
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,686
they're gonna erase your sorry ass!

302
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,481
You're nothing but
street grease, you hear?

303
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,483
Street grease, you motherfucker!

304
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,485
Is that gasoline I smell?

305
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,196
No, man, no! No!

306
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,530
No!

307
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,699
No!

308
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,218
It's on the house, kiddo, you know that.

309
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,512
One root beer.

310
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,600
I can't do anything.

311
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:39,730
Your mom, technically,
she's off right now.

312
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,649
Yeah, way off.

313
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,572
Police! Don't move!

314
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,616
I said, "Don't move!"

315
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,662
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze."

316
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,415
Well, I am the police,
and I say don't move, Snow White.

317
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,582
You move, you're dead.

318
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,546
And I say I'm dead.
And I move.

319
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,299
Not one more step.
I'm serious.

320
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,762
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.

321
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,598
What, are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

322
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,767
You high?

323
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,352
You don't remember me?

324
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,728
What are you talking about?

325
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,774
How about Shelly? Do you
remember Shelly Webster?

326
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,777
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

327
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,696
I want you to move over to the curb there.

328
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,449
Go on, real nice and easy.
Come on, move it!

329
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,661
Okay, we're gonna wait here for backup.

330
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,372
It's getting too freaking weird for me.

331
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,666
Oh, it gets better.

332
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,877
Do you know someone named T-Bird?

333
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,297
He had a friend who shouldn't
have played with knives.

334
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,840
Like the coat?

335
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,675
You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.

336
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,802
Hey, check it out.

337
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,804
He was already dead.

338
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,309
He died a year ago,
the moment he touched her.

339
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,481
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

340
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,858
Get away from there!

341
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,486
Cops! Come on!
Get out of here!

342
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,406
Leave it!
Leave it! Run!

343
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,538
Oh, great.

344
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,415
Great.

345
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,418
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell,

346
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,504
and you lose him right out in the open.

347
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,342
Well, at least he didn't do that

348
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,427
walking against the wind shit I hate that.

349
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,638
Little early for Devil's Night.

350
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,352
You are very restless.

351
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,396
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

352
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,649
Be careful of what you ask for.

353
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,567
Yeah, I may get it.
I know.

354
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,791
There are energies aligning against you.

355
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,751
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

356
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,390
Yummy.

357
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,899
Gideon's pawnshop just burned
down to the foundation.

358
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,902
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

359
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,946
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

360
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,490
I'm sure you must be awful disappointed.

361
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,661
I got trouble. One of my crew
got himself perished.

362
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,870
Yeah, and who might that be?

363
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,330
Tin Tin.

364
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:47,710
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.

365
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,920
Well, gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have

366
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,424
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.

367
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,804
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

368
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,599
Whatever you say, I can do.

369
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,684
Good.
That's very reassuring.

370
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,521
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

371
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,943
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

372
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,446
Call it my need to know.

373
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,731
Hey! Let go, you creep!

374
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,861
Nah.

375
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,781
You didn't even slow down, you dickhead!

376
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,744
He couldn't have stopped.

377
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,996
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.

378
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,834
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

379
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,878
Sometimes.

380
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,007
It's more like surfing than skating.

381
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,802
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

382
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,680
It can't rain all the time.

383
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,640
Eric?

384
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,242
Don't thank me.

385
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,537
Are we fighting the good fight?

386
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,915
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

387
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,585
Annie, look at that.

388
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,091
"We, the undersigned tenants of 1929
Caulderon Court Apartments."

389
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,718
What is this, a petition?

390
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,929
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice
girl who found herself a cause,

391
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,139
and the cause got her killed.

392
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,808
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

393
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,601
Shelly Webster

394
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,646
and her nice rock-'n'- roll
boyfriend, Eric Draven.

395
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,649
You know, the last time you went
snooping around on a case

396
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,568
is when you got put back on the beat.

397
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,945
Yeah, I know.
Torres keeps reminding me.

398
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,864
Oh, I bet he does.

399
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,957
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

400
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,501
I'm cool.

401
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,878
You didn't get that file from me, okay?

402
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,130
And don't tell me you owe me one.

403
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,800
I owe you one!

404
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,093
Yeah, right.

405
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,763
Damn.

406
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,125
Tomorrow night we can get high,

407
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,004
and watch this whole fucking
city burn from that window.

408
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,782
There's a big, fucking bird over there.

409
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:51,995
It's a squab.

410
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,666
Come here, bird.

411
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,793
Hey, bird.
Hey, bird.

412
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,962
Bird. B-b-birdie.

413
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,756
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.

414
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,676
Come here, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.

415
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,848
Birdie?
Hey, birdie?

416
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,851
Here, Funboy.

417
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,105
What the fuck!

418
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,780
No, man!
Don't do that!

419
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,949
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

420
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,036
Don't sweat it.

421
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,750
It's time for you to take your
bird and leave, freako.

422
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,889
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead-bang.

423
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,685
You are seriously fucked up.

424
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,021
Did you look in the mirror?

425
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,065
I mean, you need professional help.

426
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,778
Bingo!

427
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,907
He shoots, he scores!

428
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,210
Jesus Christ!

429
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,838
Jesus Christ?

430
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,715
Stop me if you heard this one.

431
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,800
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

432
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,267
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

433
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,146
Don't you ever fucking die?

434
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,148
"Can you put me up for the night?"

435
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,197
Does that hurt?

436
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,908
Fuck.
Does it fucking hurt?

437
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,786
Oh, God.

438
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,831
Look what you've done to my sheets.

439
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,983
I've got a gun in my pocket.

440
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,029
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

441
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,926
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

442
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,936
Look.

443
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,149
"Mother" is the name for God

444
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,860
on the lips and hearts of all children.

445
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,236
Do you understand?

446
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,865
Morphine is bad for you.

447
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,880
Your daughter is out there on
the streets waiting for you.

448
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,081
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

449
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,332
Now fill it up!

450
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,920
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

451
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,338
I really need this.

452
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:20,680
All right.

453
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,185
You burn yourself playing with matches?

454
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,269
Fuck off.

455
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,479
You have an appointment.

456
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,106
Well, shit on me.

457
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,273
Drink up.

458
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,944
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

459
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,279
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

460
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,990
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!

461
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,368
Hey, good night, Darla.

462
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,165
You stay put.

463
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,500
Right there.

464
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,095
Get away, steamhead.

465
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,129
<i>As you can see, I'm here,</i>

466
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,048
<i>on the corner of 27th street
in Washington Place.</i>

467
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,177
<i>The site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.</i>

468
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,511
<i>It was exactly one year ago</i>

469
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,555
<i>that the building you see
across the street from me</i>

470
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,099
<i>was totally demolished by fire.</i>

471
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,727
<i>The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...</i>

472
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,104
<i>But lost the lives of two fire fighters.</i>

473
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,107
<i>In fact, if it weren't for
the constant surveillance</i>

474
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,400
<i>by the local police...</i>

475
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,152
Freeze!

476
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,530
Jesus! Don't ever do that, man.

477
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,159
Fuck.

478
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,455
Good likeness.

479
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,415
I saw your body, man.

480
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,292
You died.
You got buried.

481
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,544
You still have your hat on.

482
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,507
I got to sit down.

483
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,554
Shit. Holy shit.

484
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,059
Say...

485
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,437
Are you some kind of...

486
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,065
Ghost?

487
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,233
Boo!

488
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,326
I don't know what I am.

489
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,578
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

490
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,167
You took a six-storey
swan dive out of a window.

491
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,171
She, was beaten and raped,

492
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,547
died at the hospital.

493
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,509
Hey, you asked, man.

494
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,469
I mean, come on, read the file.

495
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,432
Shelly Webster held on for
30 hours in intensive care.

496
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,352
Her body finally just gave it up.

497
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,438
I saw it, man. I couldn't do jack for her.

498
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,119
Hey.
Don't touch me!

499
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,290
Hey.

500
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,460
You okay?

501
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,129
I saw her.

502
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,300
I saw her through your eyes.

503
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,553
You stayed with her the whole time.

504
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,305
Yeah, well...

505
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,225
You got to understand
something, all right?

506
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,436
I was...

507
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,188
I was hoping she'd
come out of it, you know?

508
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,274
Give me something
I could work with.

509
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,235
Yeah.

510
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,572
Look, I...

511
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,657
Why didn't you do something about it?

512
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,701
You think any of those people
in that building,

513
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,328
even the ones who signed the petition,

514
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,163
would talk after what happened to you?

515
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,208
I kept asking questions, and...

516
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,628
Finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

517
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,343
This your wife?

518
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,635
Yeah, we...

519
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,264
Well, not anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

520
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,434
It's funny.

521
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,356
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

522
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,400
I used to think they were kind of trivial.

523
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,362
Believe me, nothing is trivial.

524
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,333
You shouldn't smoke these.

525
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,793
They'll kill you.

526
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,593
You gonna vanish into thin air again?

527
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,599
I thought I'd use your front door.

528
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,729
Look, man.

529
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,526
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

530
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,611
Yeah.

531
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,828
Yeah.

532
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,372
I got stabbed!

533
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,207
I shot the son of a bitch!

534
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,459
I watched the bullet hole close by itself.

535
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,254
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

536
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,631
Other than that, my day sucked.

537
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,802
Yeah. I saw him, too.
He had a guitar.

538
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,554
He winked at me

539
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,473
before he jumped out a fourth-floor
window like he had wings.

540
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,724
He winked at you?

541
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,436
Musicians.

542
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,980
What else did you see?

543
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,523
So far, I haven't heard shit about

544
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,275
what you're going to do
about all this crap!

545
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,401
I mean, what do I get?

546
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,696
My livelihood got flushed
away and went swirling.

547
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,242
You ain't lost everything.

548
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,287
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot, either!

549
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,788
Jesus!

550
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,499
Fair enough.

551
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,418
Catch.

552
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,795
Jesus!

553
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,840
Say hello to the last fellow who
wouldn't cooperate with me.

554
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,842
What, you telling me...
You tellin' me this thing is real?

555
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,304
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

556
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,557
Sometimes, more useful than
the people who bear them.

557
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,311
You're directly out of your fucking mind!

558
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,645
You know that!

559
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,732
Yeah.

560
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,484
Eyes see.

561
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,904
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.

562
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,822
She's supposed to be your sister?

563
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,701
My father's daughter.
That's right.

564
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,455
What's the matter, you don't
see the resemblance?

565
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,500
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.

566
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,503
With a lot of detail.
What do you say?

567
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,423
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

568
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,052
He told me to tell T-Bird
that death was on its way,

569
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,929
whatever the fuck that means.

570
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,849
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

571
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,727
Want to relax that thing now?

572
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,648
And this bird man, he just happened
to let you live?

573
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,776
You sure you ain't making all of this up

574
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,945
just to save your own ass?

575
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,489
I ain't making all this up.

576
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,451
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

577
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,414
All right.

578
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,380
A boy and his bird.

579
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,882
Awful touching.

580
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,760
Yeah.

581
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,687
Oh, for fuck's sake die, will you?

582
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,355
Give me that thing.

583
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,821
Thanks.

584
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,782
Funboy said he saw a black bird, too.

585
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,951
A big one.

586
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,580
Then he choked to death on his own blood.

587
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,500
I'll have the janitor come on up.

588
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,608
You again?

589
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,943
Are you lost or hungry?

590
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,654
Hi.

591
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,633
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you.

592
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,926
We're in this together!

593
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,637
One part falls, it all falls!

594
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,264
You know how long it took
us to put this together?

595
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:09,018
That piece of rat shit made Tin
Tin into a Fucking voodoo doll.

596
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,562
Tin Tin was a dick.

597
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,648
Tin Tin.

598
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,736
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

599
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,029
Fire it up!

600
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,868
No Funboy?

601
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,080
Probably still banging away on Darla.

602
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,963
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.

603
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,049
I'm on it.

604
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,958
What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?

605
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,087
I'm your passenger.

606
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,096
Drive.

607
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,771
What's all this happy horseshit?

608
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,857
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!

609
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,030
Oh, shit!

610
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,782
What the fuck's the matter with you?

611
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,868
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!

612
00:54:56,794 --> 00:55:00,963
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

613
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,134
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.

614
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,969
This is business, right?

615
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:08,805
Faster.

616
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,018
You got that cream stuff?

617
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,731
I hate this. They can't even
call it cream legally.

618
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:20,983
What in the crap!

619
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,116
Oh, look.
Making us popular.

620
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,828
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

621
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,837
This is Vehicle 48. We got
us a big, old, red hot rod.

622
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,924
Turn.

623
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:49,178
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

624
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,764
Right?

625
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:57,854
Damn! Dead end!

626
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,777
Look out!

627
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,950
Oh, my God!
Get outta the way!

628
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,215
Holy shit!
Goddamn foreign cars!

629
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,930
Shit! Shit!

630
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,733
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.

631
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,194
T-Bird!
I got you, man!

632
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,822
Shit!

633
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,840
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything,
but I don't know what...

634
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,134
What? What?

635
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,054
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.

636
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,182
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

637
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,768
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

638
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,812
She wasn't going along with our
tenant relocation program.

639
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,189
And her idiot boyfriend shows up

640
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,191
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear

641
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,903
into a total cluster fuck!
Who gives a shit?

642
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,114
It's ancient history!
Why? What do you want?

643
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,826
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!

644
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,289
Did you send us these complaints?

645
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,753
Come here!
"Abashed the Devil stood."

646
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,338
Does it get you sweaty?

647
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:53,135
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

648
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,889
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

649
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,892
You can't be you. We put
you through the window.

650
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,894
There ain't no coming back.

651
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,939
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

652
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,274
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

653
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,821
T-Bird.

654
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,949
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

655
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,286
T-Bird.

656
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,001
"Abashed, the Devil stood

657
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,004
"and felt how awful goodness is.

658
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,340
"And felt how awful goodness is."

659
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
T-Bird. T-Bird.

01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,943
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

672
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,153
Wait, you loved eggs.

673
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,948
Yeah, when I was five.

674
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,284
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

675
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,247
So what did you take to become
mother of the year?

676
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,460
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

677
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,087
Who?

678
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,465
Oh, it was nuts.

679
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,927
You're acting weird.

680
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,346
Did you win the lottery
or something, Darla?

681
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,478
Oh, forget it. I never was too
good at this mommy shit.

682
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,106
Over easy.

683
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,987
I like 'em over easy, Mom.

684
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,167
Hey, Albrecht.

685
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,423
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

686
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,550
We just fished this out of the river.

687
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,595
He's fused to his own car.
We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.

688
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,430
His name is T-Bird.

689
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,806
Arson was his specialty.

690
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:29,018
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

691
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,394
Case closed.

692
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,396
Bull-fucking shit.

693
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,024
Come here.

694
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,197
You're holding out on me.

695
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,324
I got a goddamn vigilante killer

696
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,242
knocking off scumbags left and right,

697
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,286
and you're covering up for somebody.

698
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,539
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

699
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,625
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me.

700
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,751
Okay.

701
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,211
Gideon's blows all to hell and
you're having a chit chat

702
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:59,465
with some weirdo who winds up in T-Bird's
car when it zigs instead of zags.

703
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,218
Then you steal one of my
case files from homicide,

704
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,303
and you're saying this is just
a fucking automobile accident?

705
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,096
Come on!
Yeah.

706
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,223
Good speech though.

707
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,641
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

708
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,476
You gotta write that shit down.

709
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,436
All right, smart-ass.

710
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,065
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

711
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,068
Welcome to the first day of
the rest of your suspension.

712
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,361
Suspension?

713
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,029
For what?

714
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,197
Misconduct.

715
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,118
Yeah, give me the lab.

716
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,422
<i>One for sorrow, two for joy...</i>

717
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,548
<i>Come here.</i>

718
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,717
<i>...Three for a girl, and four for a boy.</i>

719
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,472
<i>Dancing.</i>

720
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,674
Eric?

721
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,472
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

722
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,725
Gabriel.

723
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,395
I thought you were dead.

724
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,273
You're not dead, are you?

725
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,426
I knew it was you.

726
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,390
Even with the makeup.

727
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,231
I remembered your song.

728
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,359
You said, "Can't rain all the time."

729
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,237
That is from your song, right?

730
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,750
Come on, Eric.
I know you're here.

731
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,631
I miss you and Shelly.

732
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,721
Get so lonely all by myself.

733
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,478
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

734
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,815
Sarah, I do care.

735
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,579
That's him.
That's him!

736
01:05:58,746 --> 01:05:59,913
But he looked different.

737
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,374
He was all painted up white like
some kind of dead whore.

738
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:05,544
I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me
in for some road beers, right?

739
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,796
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

740
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,258
And he flash fried T-Bird
to his fucking car!

741
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,802
T-Bird!
Here's to you, buddy.

742
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,474
Maybe we ought to just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.

743
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,353
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up!

744
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,563
You see the grave?

745
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,565
Empty.
Fire it...

746
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,901
Grave?
What grave?

747
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,487
What about my fucking grave?

748
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,614
Three out of four.

749
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:36,325
He's working his way back to
this speed freak right here.

750
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,743
It's not fair.

751
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,412
It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control.

752
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,415
T-bird, he came in, he says,
"Waste them both."

753
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,542
And now this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

754
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,466
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

755
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,511
This.
Hey.

756
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,639
It ain't no ghost.

757
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,434
They have all arrived.

758
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,727
Watch him.

759
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,562
We might need him.

760
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,690
Ghost gonna kill my...

761
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,873
He like his plain or with onions?

762
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,627
Fine.
Don't talk to me.

763
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,923
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

764
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,677
That's what I thought.

765
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,513
Are you referring to anyone in particular?

766
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,390
You'll just think I'm nuts.

767
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,768
Yeah, well, then maybe they'll
have to lock us both up.

768
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,396
You see him, too?

769
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,566
I saw somebody.

770
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,694
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

771
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,489
Eric didn't come back for me.

772
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,451
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

773
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,455
You want a friend to walk you home?

774
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,046
<i>Being crucified.</i>

775
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:40,884
Boys.

776
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,473
It seems our friend T-Bird won't
be joining us this evening

777
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,058
on account of a slight case of death.

778
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,560
You wanna sit down?

779
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,941
Well, well, well.

780
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,901
Devil's Night is upon us again.

781
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,862
I thought we'd throw a little party,

782
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,907
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

783
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,118
I like the pretty lights.

784
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,958
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

785
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,043
That's no reason to quit.

786
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,714
Wrong.
Best reason to quit.

787
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,049
Only reason to quit.

788
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,928
A man has an idea.

789
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,558
The idea attracts others

790
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,059
like-minded.

791
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,645
The idea expands.

792
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,815
The idea becomes an institution.

793
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,985
What was the idea?

794
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,822
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

795
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,658
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself

796
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,827
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

797
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,831
You see, gentlemen,

798
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,751
greed is for amateurs.

799
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,757
Disorder, chaos, anarchy.

800
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,551
Now, that's fun!

801
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:05,886
What about Devil's Night?

802
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,095
What about it?

803
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,766
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

804
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:14,102
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit heel was imitating me.

805
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,855
Do you know what they got now?

806
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,609
Devil's Night greeting cards.

807
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,070
Isn't that precious?

808
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,615
Yeah.

809
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,994
The idea has become the institution, boys.

810
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,914
Time to move along.

811
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,750
You don't want us to do "Light My
Fire" time for the whole city?

812
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,001
No.

813
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,880
No, I want you to set
a fire so goddamn big

814
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,716
the gods will notice us again.
That's what I'm saying.

815
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,844
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye

816
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:52,015
one more time and say,
"Are we having fun or what?"

817
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,142
Hey, you! What's your name?

818
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,061
Skank!
You don't feel that?

819
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,188
I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook.

820
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:02,108
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook."

821
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:05,821
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you!

822
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,910
How the hell did that thing get in here?

823
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,246
Gentlemen.

824
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:20,669
Let me go! Let me go!
I gotta go!

825
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,134
You're him?
The avenger.

826
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,054
The killer of killers.

827
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,139
Nice outfit.

828
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,101
I'm not sure about the face though.

829
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,228
I just want him.

830
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,147
Well, you can't have him.

831
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,817
Well,

832
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,072
I see you have made your decision.

833
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,742
Now let's see you enforce it.

834
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,704
This is already boring the
shit out of me. Kill him!

835
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,963
Ooh! That had to hurt.

836
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,259
Well, that's that.

837
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,887
That guy was crazy.

838
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,812
He's gone.

839
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,238
Get him!

840
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,842
Right here! Here, help me!
He's gonna kill me!

841
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,932
Jesus Christ!

842
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,783
Hey!

843
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,943
You're all going to die.

844
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,374
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, Skank?

845
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,919
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there.

846
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,047
Skank's dead.

847
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,049
That's right.

848
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,133
No!

849
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,392
What the crap!

850
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,145
Don't move!
Hold it!

851
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,398
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

852
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:24,204
<i>You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.</i>

853
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,333
<i>Stop running immediately.</i>

854
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,918
Holy shit!

855
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:42,305
<i>Stop immediately, lie down,
spread your arms and legs.</i>

856
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,059
Come on! Move it!

857
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,483
My advice.
Next time duck.

858
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,155
So many cops, you'd think they
were giving away doughnuts.

859
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,285
Shit!

860
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,582
Oh.

861
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,417
I knew you were gonna do that.

862
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,253
Look at that out there.

863
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,006
The whole city ought
to be in flames by now.

864
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,092
Sky ought to be red.

865
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,346
So that, I take it, is the late,
great Eric Draven.

866
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:10,602
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

867
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:13,188
I like him already.

868
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:19,277
The crow is his link between
the land of the living

869
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,362
and the realm of the dead.

870
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:26,034
So, kill the crow and destroy the man.

871
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,395
I'm coming home, Shelly.

872
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,488
You're gonna say I shouldn't
be in the cemetery

873
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:46,698
in the middle of the night, right?

874
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,574
Safest place in the world to be.

875
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,161
It's 'cause everybody's dead.

876
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:53,496
I knew you'd come here.

877
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,458
It's really late, Sarah.

878
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,627
You didn't say good-bye.

879
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,132
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

880
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,718
And you're never coming back.

881
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,729
I gave this to Shelly once.

882
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,153
I think she'd like you to have it.

883
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,659
This way you'll always remember her.

884
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,162
I'll never take it off.

885
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,391
I better go sneak back in the house.

886
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,567
Bye.

887
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,344
Take it easy, sweetheart.

888
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:58,371
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

889
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,334
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

890
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,260
Her eyes are so innocent.

891
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:25,648
Eric!

892
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,859
Eric, help! Eric!

893
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,570
Quick impression for ya.

894
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,656
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

895
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,785
Give me the girl and I'll
let you walk out of here.

896
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:23,664
Well, well.

897
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,501
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that?

898
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,678
Nah. Fuck it.

899
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:47,855
Fuck.

900
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,365
Well, well, well.

901
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,742
It does seem to me that our
little life has undergone

902
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,911
a rather significant change
in the past few minutes now.

903
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,829
Wouldn't you agree?

904
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,878
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

905
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,759
It's still alive.
Well, then kill it!

906
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,555
Bye-bye, birdie.

907
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,810
Shit.

908
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,521
Well, just came by to pay my respects

909
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,440
and here you are
getting all shot up again.

910
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:13,691
They've taken Sarah.

911
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:14,859
How many?

912
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,652
Two more.

913
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:18,946
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

914
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,741
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

915
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:22,992
You stay in front,

916
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,744
and when they run out of ammo,
I'll arrest 'em.

917
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,955
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

918
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,586
Oh, shit. You're bleeding
all over the place.

919
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,589
I thought, you know, you were invincible.

920
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:39,634
I was.
I'm not anymore.

921
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,555
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

922
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,806
Come on.

923
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,480
You take that.

924
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,928
You were supposed to stay behind me.

925
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,638
I think I messed up.

926
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,581
This is all the power you ever had.

927
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,917
Now it is mine.

928
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,629
Pity there's not more time

929
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,632
for us.

930
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,570
Help, Eric!
I'm scared!

931
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,782
Let me go!

932
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,794
Let her go!

933
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,592
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

934
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:47,636
All right.

935
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:48,763
No!

936
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,018
Eric!

937
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,039
Sarah?

938
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,166
Look out!

939
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,048
Eric!

940
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,016
You know, my daddy used to say

941
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,185
"Every man's got a devil

942
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,813
"and you can't rest till you find him."

943
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:23,691
What happened back there with
you and your girlfriend...

944
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:26,235
I cleared that building.

945
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,697
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.

946
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,908
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

947
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,870
But if it's any consolation to you,

948
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,998
you have put a smile on my face.

949
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,001
You got a lot of spirit, son.

950
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,211
I am going to miss you.

951
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,047
I have something to give you.

952
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,884
I don't want it anymore.

953
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:55,723
Thirty hours of pain!

954
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,228
All at once!

955
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,900
All for you.

956
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:32,259
Yeah.

957
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,853
Go help him.

958
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,276
Are you alive?

959
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,282
God, I need a cigarette.

960
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:03,082
Everybody else dead?

961
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,875
You helped me.

962
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,170
What you kept in here saved me.

963
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,881
Thanks.
Don't mention it.

964
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,342
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

965
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,058
Oh, yuck.

966
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:26,814
I'm quitting as of now, if I live.

967
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,034
Stay with him until help comes.

968
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,996
He'll be okay, right?

969
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:44,999
Eric?

970
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:50,129
He does that a lot.

971
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,022
Shelly.

972
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,126
At least it stopped raining?

973
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,294
It can't rain all the time.

974
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,920
No, I don't believe it.

975
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:34,131
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

976
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,883
Look, you go on home.

977
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,259
I'm okay.
Okay.

978
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:38,927
Want to tell me what's going on?

979
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:40,929
Your vigilante's up on the roof.

980
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,892
You missed it.

981
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:46,477
Get him outta here!

982
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,127
Thanks.

983
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:02,261
<i>If the people we love are stolen from us,</i>

984
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:06,306
<i>the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.</i>

985
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:10,060
<i>Buildings burn, people die,</i>

986
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:12,062
<i>but real love is forever.</i>
