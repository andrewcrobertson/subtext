1
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,044
Do you think we're close?

2
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,255
They're almost
impossible to find.

3
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,050
No one's ever
captured one alive.

4
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,971
I agreed
to provide security for you...

5
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:58,682
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

6
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,310
Well, it's worth the wait.

7
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,937
Dead specimens show that

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,189
the peptides
in the spider's venom, they...

9
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,277
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

10
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,615
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

11
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,992
like <i>Las Arañas.</i>

12
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:18,619
<i>Las Arañas?</i>

13
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:22,623
The mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

14
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:23,832
and punish evil men

15
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,001
with their black,
poisoned touch?

16
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,254
I like to base my research
in science,

17
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,005
not legends, Mr Sims.

18
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,799
Those powers are wasted here.

19
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,301
These little spiders

20
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,595
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

21
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,680
It could...

22
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,016
- Are you okay?
- No.

23
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,811
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

24
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,022
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

25
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,316
Not when I'm this close.

26
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,612
Perhaps you should rest.

27
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,740
I don't have time.

28
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,035
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,121
For the umbrella.

30
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,249
I found it.

31
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,876
I found the spider.

32
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,007
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

33
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,800
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

34
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:59,094
Something so small
yet have so much power.

35
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:01,055
Okay.

36
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:02,765
Okay.

37
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:05,809
What are you doing?

38
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,020
I don't...

39
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:09,188
I don't understand.

40
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,607
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

41
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,026
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

42
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:15,528
I'm not interested
in helping people.

43
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,656
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

44
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,533
My road was
not as clear as yours.

45
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,117
We didn't have the same choices.

46
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,494
You're making
the wrong decision.

47
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,578
- Give me the spider!
- No.

48
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:25,829
You're making
the wrong decision.

49
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,414
- Give it to me.
- No.

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,625
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

51
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,960
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

52
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:42,137
No.

53
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,592
Her journey will not be easy...

54
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,219
but she is strong.

55
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,512
She will come back
when she needs answers.

56
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,139
And when she does...

57
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,309
I will be here for her.

58
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,328
Come on!

59
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:37,753
Move!

60
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,046
All right! All right!

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,093
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

62
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:45,553
Code three.

63
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,846
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

64
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,266
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

65
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,142
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

66
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,936
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

67
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,573
Come on.

68
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,460
How you doing back there?

69
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,504
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

70
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:21,630
I was being shot at.

71
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,924
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

72
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:26,218
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

73
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:27,887
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

74
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:40,941
Shouldn't you be in school?

75
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,904
Who flips off an ambulance?

76
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:46,238
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

77
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:47,740
Jesus.

78
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,367
Kids.

79
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,709
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

80
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,629
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

81
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,839
I know how
these things work, Ben.

82
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,257
Oh, do you? How do you know?

83
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,550
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

84
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,845
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

85
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:11,847
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

86
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,432
She's gonna be okay.

87
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,644
Who?

88
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,604
Your patient.

89
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,148
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

90
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:25,569
You know what,

91
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:27,196
Mr Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

92
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,365
Just take it.

93
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:30,991
Take it.

94
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,368
Just take it.

95
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,371
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

96
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:36,830
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:39,792
I'll take you in to see her.

98
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,502
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

99
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:42,878
I'm her stepdaughter.

100
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,547
I think she might prefer...

101
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,174
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

102
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:49,677
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

103
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,595
Okay.

104
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,680
Come on, buddy.

105
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,557
Let's go see Mommy.

106
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,434
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

107
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,270
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

108
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,607
What am I supposed
to do with this?

109
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,401
Just put it in your pocket

110
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,611
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

111
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,615
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

112
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,619
Come on.

113
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,914
We both hate family stuff.

114
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,126
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

115
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,711
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

116
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,629
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

117
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,548
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

118
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,799
You know, I might sleep in.

119
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,135
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

120
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:32,261
You don't have a dog.

121
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:33,846
I might adopt one.

122
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,014
Return the favour.

123
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:37,975
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

124
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,643
I don't know
what you're talking about.

125
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,021
I was a model foster kid.

126
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,647
I peed outside and everything.

127
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:46,817
So...

128
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,488
I kinda met someone.

129
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,240
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:54,658
What's this one's name?

131
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,167
Serious.

132
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,467
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

133
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,053
Thank you.

134
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,807
"You have
a winning personality."

135
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,100
I guess I got yours by mistake.

136
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:22,311
You're an asshole.

137
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:23,395
Here.

138
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,774
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

139
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,486
What if I don't wanna know?

140
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:31,779
Well, it's just a cookie.

141
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,077
"You will."

142
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,120
You will what?

143
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,832
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

144
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,418
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

145
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,297
It means that
their printer is broken.

146
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,590
We can't eat here any more.

147
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,809
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

148
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,147
You think
I can manage both of these?

149
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,232
I think so, yeah.

150
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,567
<i>We'll have it for you tomorrow.</i>

151
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,443
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheque.

152
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,279
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

153
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:14,363
I haven't seen him in a while.

154
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:15,614
Maybe we can work something out.

155
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,950
He's not
home right now, actually.

156
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,451
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.

157
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,245
But no more excuses.

158
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:22,746
I swear. We'll have it.

159
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,707
All right.

160
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,080
Us strays
need to stick together.

161
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:07,750
{\an8}Somebody's hungry.

162
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,126
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

163
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:39,049
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

164
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,471
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

165
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,224
MVA, three vehicles.

166
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:49,977
<i>One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.</i>

167
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,770
<i>Copy that. Sending backup
to your location.</i>

168
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:52,938
It won't open.

169
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:56,233
All right, sir. We're gonna
get you out of there, okay?

170
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,068
Just don't move.

171
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:59,153
Hi, sir.

172
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,280
Can you tell me your name?

173
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,740
Robert.

174
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,909
Robert, I'm Cassie.

175
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,952
I'm gonna help you out
today, okay?

176
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,287
You're gonna be all right.

177
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,455
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seat belt.

178
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,623
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

179
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,249
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

180
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,417
on that side, okay?

181
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,836
Three, two, one.

182
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,048
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

183
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,132
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

184
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:21,634
One, two, three.

185
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,054
Okay. You're gonna be okay, sir.

186
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:26,722
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

187
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:29,350
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

188
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,268
- Cassie!
- Ben!

189
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,170
<i>79 over 55.</i>

190
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,672
<i>Dial it back, I'm fine.</i>

191
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:01,590
<i>You need a real workup
at a real hospital.</i>

192
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,592
<i>No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.</i>

193
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,135
<i>Games!</i>

194
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,804
<i>You guys are ice-cold.</i>

195
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,557
<i>Cassie!</i>

196
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,268
<i>This place has always
been a death trap.</i>

197
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,775
<i>You can't save all three!</i>

198
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,860
<i>...you can use the web</i>

199
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,821
<i>to be in more than one place
at the same time.</i>

200
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:26,740
<i>You are the only one
who can change the future.</i>

201
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,992
<i>No!</i>

202
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,076
<i>Cassie!</i>

203
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,536
<i>That's it, Cassie, breathe!</i>

204
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,745
Come on!

205
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:35,833
You're okay. You're okay.

206
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,044
Did I die?

207
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,170
Yeah.

208
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,673
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

209
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,592
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:48,095
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

211
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,607
You're not goin' anywhere.

212
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,192
79 over 55.

213
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:04,403
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

214
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,113
with a real doctor.

215
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,281
I don't need a doctor.

216
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,325
I trust you.

217
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,494
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

218
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:14,622
Slightly above that
of a dead fish.

219
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,794
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

220
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:24,006
Jump back in the water anytime.

221
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:31,347
You're not goin' anywhere.

222
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,057
79 over 55.

223
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,101
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

224
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:38,020
with a real doctor.

225
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:40,773
Seriously, Ben, dial it back.

226
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:41,941
I'm fine.

227
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:45,861
Wait, wait, wait. I need
to get your oxygen levels.

228
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,071
Again?

229
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:48,656
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,157
My O2 is 89.

231
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,285
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

232
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,664
Oh, you're right.

233
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,585
Are you okay?

234
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:02,962
What the hell
happened down there?

235
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:04,045
I'm fine.

236
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,675
I just wanna go home
and watch <i>Idol.</i>

237
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,510
Please stay where you are.

238
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:35,638
Wow.

239
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:38,515
Great apartment.

240
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,878
<i>Where's my spider?
They took my spider.</i>

241
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,889
<i>Who are you?</i>

242
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,213
No!

243
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:04,435
Bad dream?

244
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,644
It's not a dream.

245
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:08,647
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

246
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,817
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

247
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,364
The same three faces.

248
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,327
Every night, the same vision.

249
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:23,954
It's a curse.

250
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:25,998
But we all die someday.

251
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,167
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

252
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,544
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

253
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,547
you'd try to stop them.

254
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,258
Okay...

255
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:40,596
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

256
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,474
of dying over and over again.

257
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:44,892
And I can't escape it.

258
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,978
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

259
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,401
I will find them
and kill them first.

260
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:57,613
So you know who did it...

261
00:20:57,696 --> 00:21:01,075
I mean, will do it?

262
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:05,287
It's always those three faces.

263
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,583
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

264
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:14,088
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

265
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,509
But as the years pass...

266
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,512
there have been
technological advances.

267
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,599
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

268
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,812
The kind of technology
I've heard...

269
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:32,731
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

270
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:50,332
What are you doing?

271
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:53,961
How are you poisoning me?

272
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,462
What's your password?

273
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,257
I can't tell you. Oh, please!

274
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,468
Is "please" your password?

275
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:05,890
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

276
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,349
and I'll stop the poison.

277
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:21,447
Q-9-2-0...

278
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:25,284
B-3-7-5.

279
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:31,582
Oh, God.

280
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:39,006
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

281
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,383
today was the day
you were going to die.

282
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:56,232
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

283
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:58,108
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

284
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,193
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

285
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:00,277
You know what you're doing.

286
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:01,820
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

287
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:02,905
Cassie!

288
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,032
- Hey!
- Hi.

289
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,909
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

290
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,702
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

291
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:11,497
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

292
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:14,041
Are you pressing the burgers?

293
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,417
I'm releasin' the fat.

294
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:16,752
That's called flavour, man.

295
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,420
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

296
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:19,797
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

297
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,633
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

298
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:23,759
I could use a beer?

299
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,762
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

300
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:30,182
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

301
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,434
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

302
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:33,561
That's boring.

303
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,396
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

304
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,480
No, there's...

305
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,357
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

306
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,441
It was cardiac arrest.

307
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:42,152
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

308
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,071
Really?

309
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,073
Dead, huh?

310
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,742
Did you see a white light or...

311
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:53,747
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

312
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:56,041
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

313
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,126
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:58,794
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

315
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:00,129
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

316
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,463
Yeah, they're ruined now.

317
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:02,882
Take that. For you, sir.

318
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,676
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

319
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,678
- We're ready to start.
- What?

320
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:09,013
What?

321
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:11,223
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

322
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,309
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

323
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:15,060
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

324
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,145
Have fun.

325
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,900
- ...for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

326
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,110
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

327
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:24,528
Okay. This is crazy.

328
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:25,821
Well, I couldn't decide,
so I got two.

329
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:27,072
Yeah, that's like...

330
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,283
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,118
Cassie Webb.

332
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:32,828
Thanks for having me.

333
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:36,123
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

334
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,750
Nice to meet you.

335
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,419
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

336
00:24:40,502 --> 00:24:42,046
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

337
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:44,131
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

338
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,133
Where is it this time?

339
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:47,718
He's in Mumbai...

340
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,929
Shanghai... I can't keep track.

341
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,559
Never stops
leaping around in there.

342
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:56,644
And always hungry.

343
00:24:57,853 --> 00:24:59,897
Does it have a name? The...

344
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,817
We're saving that
for one of the games.

345
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,737
- Games?
- Games!

346
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:11,659
Games!

347
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,828
Okay.

348
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:19,458
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

349
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:22,670
Chloe, is that you?

350
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:23,754
Yes.

351
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,592
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

352
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:30,386
It was years
before I figured that one out.

353
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,391
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

354
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,893
Whose is this?

355
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:41,564
Oh, it's mine.

356
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:44,650
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

357
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:48,612
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

358
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,783
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

359
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,619
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

360
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:56,871
She died.

361
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:01,792
But, I grew up totally healthy.

362
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,712
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

363
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:09,300
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

364
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:11,427
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

365
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,430
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

366
00:26:14,513 --> 00:26:16,432
Okay, so let's...

367
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:17,683
let's move on to the next game.

368
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,937
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

369
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,439
Oh, yes!

370
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:25,316
Okay, I'll kick things off.

371
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:28,611
- Sam.
- Nope.

372
00:26:28,694 --> 00:26:29,904
Steven.

373
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,906
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

374
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:33,616
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

375
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:39,079
Baby sausage?

376
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,081
Richard Junior?

377
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,458
Richard wishes.

378
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,252
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

379
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,254
Cassie... what's your guess?

380
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:54,845
Do that thing
where you throw it up

381
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:55,930
and catch it on the...

382
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:58,557
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

383
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,892
- Look at that.
- The name is...

384
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:07,358
Baby sausage?

385
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,986
Richard Junior?

386
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,279
Richard wishes.

387
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:15,658
Come on, get your hamburger.
Get your...

388
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,284
Cassie... what's your guess?

389
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:18,619
Put five dollars down, let's go.

390
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,371
Wait. We just did this.

391
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,081
Do that thing
where you throw it up

392
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,165
and catch it on the...

393
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:27,962
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

394
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,966
Sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

395
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,551
Fire down at the docks.

396
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:34,635
So...

397
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,514
You okay?

398
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

399
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,687
I got you, man.

400
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:46,522
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

401
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,232
The ones who got out, come on.
This way.

402
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:49,358
Get her out. Come on.

403
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,860
Grabbin' a woman on A-side here.

404
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:53,654
Go. Go. Go.

405
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:54,947
We need more pressure
in the line.

406
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,448
Keep pressure on the leg
here, okay?

407
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,660
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

408
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,744
Otherwise stable.

409
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:04,874
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

410
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:10,546
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

411
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:11,755
Let's go. Come on.

412
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:18,762
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

413
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,347
No, it's not safe.
The structure's unstable.

414
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:21,557
Hey, the people are trapped.

415
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,475
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

416
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,811
The place is
packed with explosives.

417
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:27,646
Industrial grade fireworks.

418
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,565
It could blow up any minute.

419
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:34,695
It could blow up any minute.

420
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,488
<i>- Cassie!</i>
- It could blow up any minute.

421
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:39,241
<i>Cassie!</i>

422
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,790
This place has
always been a death trap.

423
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,626
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

424
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:49,710
Otherwise stable.

425
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,879
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.</i>

426
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:55,674
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

427
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:56,759
Let's go. Come on.

428
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,182
I gotta get my guys in there.

429
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:04,350
The structure's unstable.

430
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,559
Hey, the people are trapped.

431
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,770
The place is
packed with explosives.

432
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,188
Industrial grade fireworks.

433
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:10,606
This place has
always been a death trap.

434
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:11,690
Cassie!

435
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:12,983
Cassie! Cassie.

436
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,735
I need you at the triage.

437
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,362
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

438
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:18,280
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

439
00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:20,199
He's stable. Ready to transport.

440
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:21,992
Yeah, copy that. We need
every able body down here.

441
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,077
You're gonna be okay.

442
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,787
Stabilise the head while
I get the longboard set up.

443
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,872
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

444
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:28,123
Copy that.

445
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:29,375
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

446
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,001
Will you let me drive?

447
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,169
What are you talking about?

448
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:35,130
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

449
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:36,465
Cassie, I need you over here.

450
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,093
Will you just let me drive?

451
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:41,262
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

452
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:43,973
I don't think
that's what's happening.

453
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:47,810
Don't let it
mess with your head.

454
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,937
Cassie, come on!

455
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:01,115
<i>This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.</i>

456
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,199
<i>Headed back...</i>

457
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,350
O'Neil, come on.

458
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:33,939
Come on. O'Neil.

459
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,441
Come on!

460
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:38,527
Let's get it! Come on, let's go!

461
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:40,779
Wake up!

462
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,157
O'Neil, come on.

463
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,950
<i>Did you see a white light or...</i>

464
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,327
<i>O'Neil, come on.</i>

465
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:48,954
<i>Cassie! Cassie!</i>

466
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,167
Come on. Come back.

467
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:55,961
Come on, come on.

468
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,672
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

469
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,799
It's all right. It's okay.

470
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,677
It's okay. Okay?

471
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,096
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

472
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:45,719
So, was it worth the trouble?

473
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,263
The scale
of the NSA surveillance

474
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,722
is unprecedented.

475
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,516
They can access everything.

476
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,310
There's nowhere to hide.

477
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:54,645
That's the idea.

478
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:56,897
The potential is infinite.

479
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,108
It's intoxicating.

480
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:02,528
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

481
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:05,155
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

482
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,949
It's gonna change everything.

483
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,078
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

484
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,163
before they get their powers.

485
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:15,040
This is what
they look like in your visions

486
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:16,458
as well as you can recollect.

487
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:19,962
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

488
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:22,256
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

489
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:25,634
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

490
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,637
Here's what
they should look like now.

491
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:35,144
They're younger than I thought.

492
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,689
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

493
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:41,525
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

494
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,278
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

495
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,697
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

496
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,366
I will not give up
everything I've built...

497
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,076
and have my life cut short.

498
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:55,915
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

499
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,374
go to a museum...

500
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,001
get money from an ATM...

501
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,086
wherever they are
in the world...

502
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:03,380
Find them.

503
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:05,591
I pay you a fortune.

504
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,301
Yeah, I'll find them.

505
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,139
Still no blurriness.

506
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,807
No double vision.

507
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,017
No discolouration at all.

508
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,312
Your eyesight is good,

509
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:20,147
and all your other vitals
check out.

510
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,817
But what about the visions?

511
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:26,820
How am I seeing that stuff?

512
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,490
Sometimes when
we experience trauma,

513
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:31,033
it can have a lasting effect.

514
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:32,952
This isn't trauma.

515
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:34,745
I knew he was gonna die.

516
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,206
I saw it.

517
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:38,999
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

518
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,543
from your other consultations.

519
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,421
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

520
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,965
The scan showed
no abnormalities.

521
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,800
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

522
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:49,760
but I don't understand
what's happening.

523
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,012
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

524
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,472
Get some rest.

525
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,640
Watch old movies.

526
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:56,350
If you still have concerns,

527
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,561
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

528
00:33:58,936 --> 00:33:59,937
But I'm sure

529
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,814
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

530
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,111
<i>I am in the presence</i>

531
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:08,863
<i>of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.</i>

532
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,575
<i>And you're going to show me
shadows of things</i>

533
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:14,869
<i>that have not yet happened
but will happen.</i>

534
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:17,788
<i>Spirit of the Future,</i>

535
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:20,082
<i>I fear you more than
any other spectre I've seen.</i>

536
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:24,044
<i>But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.</i>

537
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,504
<i>I cannot change.</i>

538
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,297
<i>Whose funeral
were they talking about?</i>

539
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,388
<i>Hey, Cass, it's me again. Ben.</i>

540
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,765
<i>I know you're there.
Just pick up.</i>

541
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,517
<i>I ought to be there
this time of day.</i>

542
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:43,105
<i>Okay, well, O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.</i>

543
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,398
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

544
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,610
<i>I know it's the last place
you wanna be...</i>

545
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:50,738
<i>but it would help Susan
if you came.</i>

546
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,698
<i>It might help you too.</i>

547
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:54,700
<i>Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

548
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,911
<i>Cassie?</i>

549
00:34:58,204 --> 00:34:59,205
<i>Cass?</i>

550
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:07,796
<i>Before I draw
nearer to that stone,</i>

551
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,131
<i>answer me one question.</i>

552
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:12,009
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be...</i>

553
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:15,638
<i>or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

554
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,431
Hate to break it to you,
Scrooge...

555
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,018
but you can't change anything.

556
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,890
<i>Are these the shadows of things
that must be?</i>

557
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,185
<i>Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

558
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,903
This isn't gonna
change anything.

559
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,511
Guess you didn't die after all.

560
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,750
<i>Please keep all
personal belongings with you</i>

561
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:08,876

Come on, guys. This way.

563
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,008
Come on. Let's go down the ramp.

564
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:17,176
Yeah, awesome.

565
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:35,402
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

566
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,073
<i>...New Haven now ready.

Anya Corazón is now moving
onto the platform.

570

She's on her own.

571
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,961
Julia Cornwall is
on the concourse, also alone.

<i>...find a member
of the MTA staff.</i>

573
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:57,383
And Martha Franklin.

574
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,803
Shit.

575
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:01,887
What are the odds of them

576
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:03,514
all being in the same place
at the same time?

577
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:04,974
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

578
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:07,768
<i>There must be something
that connects them.</i>

579
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:08,978
Or...

580
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,647
something that will.

581
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,608
<i>Please keep all belongings

583
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,408

- Oh, sorry.

589
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,583

Oh, my God.

I hope not.

Get off the train.
Come on.

00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:45,528
My mom told me
never to talk to strangers.

- Hey, give me that back!

Hey, give me that back!

- Well...

628

This woman's
trying to abduct us!

629
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:31,282
What?
No, that's not... That's...

Shh. That's...

That's your emergency. That.

632
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:46,881
Is anybody else seeing this?

- That man is trying to kill you.
- And how do you...

634
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:49,884
- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

635
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,263
We don't have
tickets for this train.

636
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:55,681
That's your biggest concern?

637
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,183
<i>Please stand clear

<i>No! Help!</i>

00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,886
Holy shit.

Run!

There's an emergency exit
to the street that way.

653
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:00,663
Go.

654
00:44:00,746 --> 00:44:02,164
Hey, help. Over here.

655
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:03,457
I've never been so happy
to see cops.

656
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,667
You guys
need to call for backup.

657
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,752
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

658
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:07,836
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

659
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,921
No. You don't understand.

660
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:10,589
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

661
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:11,840
You're safe.

662
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,343
Run! Go!

663
00:44:14,843 --> 00:44:15,844
Run!

664
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:22,351
Run! Run!

665
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:23,769
Go! Go! Go!

666
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,461
Come on.

667
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,592
- Get in.
- What?

668
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:55,676
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

669
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:56,760
Thank you so much.
This is for you.

670
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:57,970
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move. Slide over.

671
00:44:58,053 --> 00:44:59,680
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

672
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,516
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

673
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,810
That guy was nuts. Do you guys
think he killed those cops?

674
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:06,604
He could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

675
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,439
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

676
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:09,773
There's not enough
frictional force

677
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:11,275
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

678
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,359
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

679
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,403
- What the hell is going on?
- ...much less the ceiling.

680
00:45:14,486 --> 00:45:15,863
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

681
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:16,947
so what good is it?

682
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:19,116
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

683
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,743
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

684
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:22,745
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

685
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:23,871
Your voices are, like,

686
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,581
drilling in the centre
of my skull...

687
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:26,665
and I need to think.

688
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:35,216
I'm Cassie. Okay?

689
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,342
What are your names?

690
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,260
What are your names?

691
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:39,386
I'm Julia Cornwall.

692
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:41,889
My dad lives here in New York,

693
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,224
and my mom lives
back in LA, but...

694
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,850
We don't need
your whole life story.

695
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:48,938
I'm Anya Corazón.

696
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:50,606
Mattie Franklin.

697
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,942
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

698
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:54,026
I'm not... That's not...

699
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,569
That's not
what's happening here.

700
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:58,364
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

701
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,407
Your parents can handle this.

702
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,159
My parents
are on a business trip.

703
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:03,953
Yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

704
00:46:04,036 --> 00:46:06,288
- My dad is busy working, so...
- Oh, my God.

705
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:07,540
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

706
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:08,999
Well, where do
your friends live?

707
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,084
- I'll drop you off first.
<i>- ...are asking</i>

708
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,253
<i>for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest</i>

709
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,381
<i>seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...</i>

710
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:16,966
<i>at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.</i>

711
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:18,968
That's great. Good.

712
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:22,680
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

713
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:24,807
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

714
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,183
<i>She is also the same person</i>

715
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:27,309
<i>police are
seeking to question...</i>

716
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:28,394
<i>in the possible abduction...</i>

717
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,479
- She?
<i>- ...of the three teenage girls.</i>

718
00:46:30,563 --> 00:46:33,315
<i>Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.</i>

719
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:34,775
<i>The public has been asked
for any information...</i>

720
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:35,860
What?

721
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,069
<i>...and to keep an eye out
for these girls.</i>

722
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:39,989
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

723
00:46:40,072 --> 00:46:41,115
And he was
crawling on the ceiling.

724
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,199
What about that guy?

725
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:43,784
I mean, you saw. I...

726
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:44,994
No one saw ceiling guy.

727
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:46,537
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

728
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,038
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

729
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:49,582
I didn't know
what was happening.

730
00:46:49,665 --> 00:46:50,791
Okay, guys.

731
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,210
My uncle, Jonah, can totally
help us. I'm gonna call him.

732
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:54,712
You have a phone?

733
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:56,505
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

734
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:58,048
No, you can't...

735
00:46:58,132 --> 00:47:00,509
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

736
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:01,802
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

737
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,053
What is your problem?

738
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:04,138
- What do you mean?
- Please.

739
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,723
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay.

740
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:08,309
Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

741
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,810
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

742
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,312
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

743
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,148
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

744
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,192
because you guys
are the only ones

745
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:17,735
that know
what actually happened.

746
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:23,657
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

747
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:26,118
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

748
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:28,329
And...

749
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,748
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

750
00:47:34,543 --> 00:47:35,544
You know...

751
00:47:38,047 --> 00:47:39,298
This is still not a kidnapping.

752
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:40,841
Okay?

753
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,510
Feels like a kidnapping.

754
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,681
How did they get away?

755
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,892
It's like
they knew I was coming.

756
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:52,478
<i>No hits at the train station,
bus depot,</i>

757
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:53,687
<i>or any of the bridges.</i>

758
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:56,148
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

759
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:58,400
<i>The police don't have
this technology.</i>

760
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:01,612
<i>You have access
to every camera in the city.</i>

761
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:02,696
<i>We should be ahead of them.</i>

762
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,325
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

763
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:08,285
Use them better.

764
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,788
I've always
wanted to be a Girl Scout.

765
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,872
Of course you did.

766
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,708
Anybody else starving?

767
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,293
All I have is gum.

768
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:20,506
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

769
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,883
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

770
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,134
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

771
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:27,096
Okay, I hope you're
good at catching squirrels.

772
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,599
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

773
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:32,685
I told you, I don't know.

774
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:34,061
I've never seen him before.

775
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,145
Then how did you know
he was coming?

776
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:36,230
Oh, my God.

777
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,024
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

778
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:41,318
I don't know.

779
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:43,946
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

780
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:45,990
Stop asking me. Okay?

781
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,075
Wait. You're the paramedic.

782
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:50,870
You saved my stepmother,

783
00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:52,872
then you were
super awkward about it.

784
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:57,543
That does sound like me.

785
00:48:57,626 --> 00:48:59,753
Wait. I recognise you too.

786
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,046
What?

787
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,215
Yeah. You live in my building.

788
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,968
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

789
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:08,012
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

790
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,639
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

791
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:12,433
You don't think this is weird?

792
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:14,685
That we both know you?

793
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:15,769
It's honestly, like,

794
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,980
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

795
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:22,610
What?

796
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:26,113
Total stranger.

797
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,741
No.

798
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:30,993
You flipped me off.

799
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,162
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

800
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:34,955
You guys, this is so freaky.

801
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:37,208
Who are you? What is going on?

802
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:41,670
I can see the future.

803
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,131
Kind of.

804
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:51,138
I mean...

805
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:53,807
What the hell?

806
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:55,893
See? She didn't see that coming.

807
00:49:56,685 --> 00:49:57,978
It doesn't work like that.

808
00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:00,231
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

809
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,399
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

810
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:04,401
did you see us...

811
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:06,946
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

812
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:10,115
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

813
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:12,701
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

814
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,954
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

815
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,499
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

816
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:21,252
So, you're welcome.

817
00:50:23,504 --> 00:50:24,630
How does it work?

818
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:28,551
It just happens.

819
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:30,511
Can you do it now?

820
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:33,222
I can't control it.

821
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:36,267
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

822
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,810
No, he can't.

823
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,729
He was using his hands.

824
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,648
Why are you like this?

825
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:45,067
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

826
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,027
It was like a spider...

827
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:49,655
person.

828
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,458
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

829
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:04,753
Where are you going?

830
00:51:04,837 --> 00:51:07,756
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

831
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,551
You can't just leave us here.

832
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,803
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

833
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:14,763
Yeah, sure. Just three teenagers
alone in the woods.

834
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:16,932
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

835
00:51:17,016 --> 00:51:19,143
You are way safer out here.

836
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:23,856
Just, you know,
be like a Girl Scout girl.

837
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:25,900
Be that. Just be that.

838
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:28,068
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

839
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:29,153
Cassie.

840
00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:33,240
Can we trust you?

841
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,619
Three hours. Okay?

842
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:39,872
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

843
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:47,504
Seriously. Don't do dumb things.

844
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:52,134
She was talking to you.

845
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:54,303
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

846
00:52:01,602 --> 00:52:02,728
I know tae kwon do.

847
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:04,396
You?

848
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:07,566
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

849
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,943
when my parents were divorcing.

850
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:12,321
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

851
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,953
That's what I thought.

852
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:33,777
One second, cat.

853
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:38,282
Come on.

854
00:53:42,328 --> 00:53:44,788
Research on Amazonian spiders...

855
00:53:45,998 --> 00:53:48,751
peptides, more peptides.

856
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,211
Come on. Where is it?

857
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,006
Spider people.

858
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:56,217
<i>Las Arañas.</i>

859
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:59,595
Have you ever heard
of <i>Las Arañas?</i>

860
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:02,306
Me neither.

861
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,186
"According to local folklore...

862
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,024
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

863
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:16,946
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

864
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:20,241
"and they can
climb like spiders."

865
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:23,911
Just like ceiling guy.

866
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:31,877
How would you know...

867
00:54:31,961 --> 00:54:35,839
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

868
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:55,192
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

869
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:07,329
<i>"Las Arañas</i> are said to possess
a sixth sense...

870
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,541
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

871
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,723
Oh, my God.

872
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:45,868
Hey, who's got the jerky?

873
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:46,952
You ate it all.

874
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,288
I had, like, three pieces.

875
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,498
- Out of five.
- You counted?

876
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,542
You also ate all mine.

877
00:55:55,044 --> 00:55:57,588
- What's this?
- Stop.

878
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:58,839
Stop. Just...

879
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:00,966
Jeez.

880
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:04,637
Okay, forget jerky.

881
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,015
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

882
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,475
Let's just go there
and get real food.

883
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,977
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

884
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:13,187
She bailed on us.

885
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,397
We don't have any money, genius.

886
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:17,233
Well, I have money, so...

887
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:19,568
You have money
so we should do what you want?

888
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,278
You got something to say?

889
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:24,782
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

890
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:26,450
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

891
00:56:26,534 --> 00:56:28,744
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

892
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:30,746
So sad about Martha Stewart.

893
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,543
My parents are in Beijing...

894
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,877
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

895
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,879
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

896
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,090
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

897
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:42,550
So...

898
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:43,926
I talk to them on Mondays.

899
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,135
So who do you live with?

900
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,221
The housekeeper.

901
00:56:49,056 --> 00:56:51,058
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

902
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,644
I bet you have
your own room at least.

903
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:57,439
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

904
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:59,775
- What about your mom?
- She's...

905
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,528
not really around.

906
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:03,904
She bailed on you?

907
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:07,074
Right. So, diner?

908
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,202
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

909
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:11,287
Yay.

910
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,455
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

911
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:17,459
Julia, you in?

912
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:20,421
Hey.

913
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:22,089
We have
to take care of ourselves.

914
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:30,598
Yeah.

915
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:33,934
You're right.

916
00:57:35,644 --> 00:57:36,770
Let's go do this.

917
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:40,441
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

918
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:41,692
I heard that.

919
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:45,821
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

920
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:47,615
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

921
00:57:48,324 --> 00:57:50,034
Who says we like you now?

922
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:52,953
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

923
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,709
Shit.

924
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,127
Do you think there's ticks?

925
00:58:02,004 --> 00:58:03,005
Can we walk

926
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,715
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

927
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:06,634
You said this was a shortcut.

928
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,844
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

929
00:58:08,928 --> 00:58:11,222
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah. Actually, I do.

930
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:15,309
Ow! Shit!

931
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:21,565
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

932
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:23,150
We're in the middle of nowhere.

933
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:24,568
No one's gonna
track us down here.

934
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:26,362
Just don't make eye contact.

935
00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:28,614
I hope they have cherry pie.

936
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,876
Let's sit at the bar.

937
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:48,968
There you go.

938
00:58:50,469 --> 00:58:51,470
Here.

939
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:54,139
Should we make a game plan?

940
00:58:54,223 --> 00:58:56,350
Eat first, strategise later.

941
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:01,146
Okay. Here you go.

942
00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:05,067
Keep it coming.

943
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:08,904
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

944
00:59:08,988 --> 00:59:10,447
Absolutely, great idea.

945
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:11,532
Right after cherry pie.

946
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:15,119
No. No cherry pie.

947
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,790
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

948
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,544
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

949
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:26,338
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

950
00:59:26,422 --> 00:59:28,215
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

951
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:29,633
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

952
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,391
We should go over there
and talk to them.

953
00:59:38,058 --> 00:59:39,059
Really?

954
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:41,937
No. We...

955
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:43,522
Should we? We can't.

956
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:45,399
Come on. You know you want to.

957
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,483
No.

958
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,153
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

959
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:50,446
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

960
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:51,822
Just hold on a second.

961
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:52,948
What is this?

962
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:54,033
Do you want the Reuben?

963
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,494
{\an8}It's just
a little confidence boost.

964
00:59:57,578 --> 00:59:59,205
This isn't really my style.

965
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,458
So what? You look cute. Come on.

966
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:04,960
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

967
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:06,670
Okay.

968
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:08,172
Hi. Hey, guys.

969
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:09,965
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

970
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:11,342
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

971
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:12,843
We've been
saving these seats for you.

972
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,053
Awesome.

973
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:16,430
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

974
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:17,514
Nice to meet you too.

975
01:00:17,598 --> 01:00:18,599
<i>...for your information.</i>

976
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,392
<i>Can you just
confirm your location?</i>

977
01:00:20,476 --> 01:00:22,853
<i>4 Star Diner.
Daves Road, Route 206.</i>

978
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:23,979
- Hey.
<i>- Church Hill, New Jersey.</i>

979
01:00:24,063 --> 01:00:26,190
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

980
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,275
<i>Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.</i>

981
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:30,194
Yeah. Patching you in now.

982
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:42,873
2-2-3 dispatch.
On scene at 4 Star Diner.

983
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:44,500
Route 206 at Daves Road.

984
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,876
<i>Go ahead, 2-2-3.</i>

985
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,378
No need to send backup.

986
01:00:49,797 --> 01:00:51,507
These aren't
our missing persons.

987
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,802
Code four. Repeat.

988
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:57,263
These are not
our missing persons.

989
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:08,816
Girls!

990
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,410
Girls!

991
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:25,291
Oh, God damn it.

992
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,310
Girls!

993
01:01:53,068 --> 01:01:54,653
Let's go. Let's go!

994
01:01:55,154 --> 01:01:56,864
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

995
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:57,948
I know you know the words.

996
01:01:58,032 --> 01:01:59,950
- Come on, get up here.
- You should get up there.

997
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:01,869
So much
for not attracting attention.

998
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:13,672
No. Please. Please, stop.

999
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:15,257
Don't touch me, okay?

1000
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:16,592
Can you...

1001
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:18,761
What are you doing?

1002
01:02:18,844 --> 01:02:19,970
- What are you...
- What is that?

1003
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:21,388
We have to go.

1004
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,185
I'm so sorry.

1005
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:30,022
Get down!

1006
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:32,983
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

1007
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:34,109
You left us.

1008
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:36,779
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:40,783
Julia!

1010
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:41,867
Julia!

1011
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:43,994
Julia, get back!

1012
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:56,257
Come on!

1013
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,466
No! Mattie!

1014
01:02:58,592 --> 01:02:59,593
No.

1015
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:48,475
<i>This track is going to be huge.</i>

1016
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,769
<i>Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.</i>

1017
01:03:53,981 --> 01:03:55,649
Let's try that again.

1018
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:08,871
I love this song.

1019
01:04:12,374 --> 01:04:13,375
Guys.

1020
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:16,170
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

1021
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,676
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

1022
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:25,179
Right. Okay.

1023
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:35,272
Oh, my God. Come on.

1024
01:04:39,193 --> 01:04:40,611
Seriously, dude.

1025
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:52,915
Come on. Let's go.

1026
01:04:52,998 --> 01:04:54,833
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1027
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:55,960
I know you know the words.

1028
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,836
Come on, get up here.

1029
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,214
Hey!

1030
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:01,549
You should totally
get up there, dog.

1031
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,342
Come on.

1032
01:05:12,768 --> 01:05:14,436
Hey!

1033
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:20,484
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

1034
01:05:29,243 --> 01:05:30,911
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

1035
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,454
Leave everything. Run!

1036
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:34,957
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

1037
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,667
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

1038
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:56,395
God!

1039
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,983
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

1040
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:03,319
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

1041
01:06:03,402 --> 01:06:05,446
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

1042
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:06,530
and you don't listen!

1043
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:07,907
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

1044
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,074
Don't even say anything!

1045
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:10,910
God!

1046
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:13,204
Your futures were almost...

1047
01:06:13,996 --> 01:06:15,122
so different.

1048
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:18,709
You're lucky I saw them.

1049
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:19,919
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:06:20,002 --> 01:06:21,003
Yes.

1051
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:25,090
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

1052
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:28,427
God!

1053
01:06:51,867 --> 01:06:53,869
Amaria, where did they go?

1054
01:06:53,953 --> 01:06:55,746
<i>I'm running checks now.</i>

1055
01:06:56,956 --> 01:06:58,749
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

1056
01:06:58,832 --> 01:07:00,543
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

1057
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:02,336
I'm not interested in her.

1058
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:04,672
Focus on finding those girls.

1059
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:06,006
Cassandra Webb.

1060
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:08,926
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

1061
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:10,678
Did you say, "Webb"?

1062
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:13,472
Yeah. Do you know her?

1063
01:07:13,556 --> 01:07:14,974
That's not possible.

1064
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,561
Come on.

1065
01:07:22,857 --> 01:07:25,317
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

1066
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:29,280
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

1067
01:07:31,156 --> 01:07:33,075
But you can see the future.

1068
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:36,495
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

1069
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,414
I don't know
how to control them.

1070
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,499
It's useless.

1071
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,376
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

1072
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:43,836
Is your hand okay?

1073
01:07:45,588 --> 01:07:46,589
It's fine.

1074
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,721
First thing in the morning,
I'm taking you all home.

1075
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:55,514
Your parents can deal with this.

1076
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,017
No, they can't.

1077
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:03,314
My mom's in a psych ward.

1078
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:07,443
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

1079
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:10,237
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

1080
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:12,031
and I don't think
that they want me there.

1081
01:08:15,534 --> 01:08:17,243
I wondered if they missed me...

1082
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:20,164
if I ran away.

1083
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:22,917
So you did.

1084
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:24,960
My parents aren't around either.

1085
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:28,255
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

1086
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:29,840
I don't think they're gonna

1087
01:08:29,924 --> 01:08:31,258
fly back from China
to deal with this.

1088
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,344
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

1089
01:08:34,053 --> 01:08:35,054
I'm on my own.

1090
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:39,934
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

1091
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:42,937
- go to the police.
- No.

1092
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:49,151
My dad got deported
six months ago.

1093
01:08:50,277 --> 01:08:52,446
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

1094
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,988
What about your mom?

1095
01:08:54,073 --> 01:08:55,866
My mom died when I was five.

1096
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:57,535
It's just me and my dad.

1097
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:00,412
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

1098
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:02,414
So, I've just been
living by myself

1099
01:09:02,497 --> 01:09:03,666
at our apartment since then.

1100
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:04,750
You're on your own?

1101
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:08,461
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

1102
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:11,881
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

1103
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:17,220
So, I can't go to the police.

1104
01:09:17,304 --> 01:09:18,305
Okay?

1105
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:21,183
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

1106
01:09:22,684 --> 01:09:24,812
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

1107
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,231
Or going into the foster system.

1108
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:31,109
Well...

1109
01:09:32,403 --> 01:09:34,988
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

1110
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:40,493
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

1111
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:42,037
Right.

1112
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,834
Cassie, please help us.

1113
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,604
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

1114
01:12:11,687 --> 01:12:13,564
You won't be so lucky next time.

1115
01:12:14,273 --> 01:12:15,900
Why are you doing this?

1116
01:12:16,775 --> 01:12:18,694
I need to stop them
from killing me.

1117
01:12:19,737 --> 01:12:22,323
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

1118
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,575
In the future,
they become much more.

1119
01:12:24,658 --> 01:12:28,871
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

1120
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:32,082
Those girls cannot exist.

1121
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,585
How come you get to decide?

1122
01:12:35,169 --> 01:12:37,046
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

1123
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:44,470
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

1124
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:47,514
Would I?

1125
01:12:47,598 --> 01:12:50,809
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

1126
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:52,561
The only thing I know is that,

1127
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:54,855
in the future,
they also have powers.

1128
01:12:56,899 --> 01:13:00,236
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

1129
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:02,571
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

1130
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:05,491
Your mother underestimated me.

1131
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:08,702
The power of the spider.

1132
01:13:09,662 --> 01:13:11,580
Don't make the same mistake.

1133
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:13,165
Tell me where they are!

1134
01:13:13,874 --> 01:13:15,084
They don't mean anything to you.

1135
01:13:16,752 --> 01:13:18,170
You could just walk away.

1136
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:15,644
What is this?

1137
01:14:20,024 --> 01:14:21,233
Rise and shine.

1138
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:24,278
Okay, so this guy's hands

1139
01:14:24,361 --> 01:14:26,947
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

1140
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:29,575
and it is painful. I was lucky.

1141
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:31,202
The longer he holds on to you,

1142
01:14:31,285 --> 01:14:33,370
the more poison
gets into your system.

1143
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:34,455
Then what happens?

1144
01:14:35,873 --> 01:14:37,208
Then your heart stops.

1145
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:41,837
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

1146
01:14:42,463 --> 01:14:45,549
So you interlock your hands
like this.

1147
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,593
You lock your elbows...

1148
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,262
and then you place
the heel of your hand

1149
01:14:50,346 --> 01:14:52,598
right on the sternum. Okay?

1150
01:14:52,681 --> 01:14:53,682
And then you pump.

1151
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:56,018
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

1152
01:14:56,393 --> 01:14:59,230
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

1153
01:14:59,855 --> 01:15:00,940
You ready?

1154
01:15:01,023 --> 01:15:03,150
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

1155
01:15:05,194 --> 01:15:06,529
Okay. And when do I stop?

1156
01:15:06,612 --> 01:15:08,364
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

1157
01:15:09,657 --> 01:15:10,658
And if you get tired,

1158
01:15:10,741 --> 01:15:12,368
then you need
somebody to take over.

1159
01:15:13,202 --> 01:15:14,453
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

1160
01:15:14,537 --> 01:15:16,622
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mmm-hmm.

1161
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:19,583
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1162
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:20,668
- Yeah.
- Ready?

1163
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:22,002
- Yep.
- And go.

1164
01:15:25,339 --> 01:15:27,424
Great. Nice, Mattie.

1165
01:15:27,508 --> 01:15:28,509
Not cool.

1166
01:15:31,262 --> 01:15:33,097
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

1167
01:15:34,306 --> 01:15:35,307
Get ready.

1168
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:40,563
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

1169
01:15:40,646 --> 01:15:41,939
Nice job, Anya.

1170
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:46,652
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

1171
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:48,737
but you're a good teacher.

1172
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:54,869
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

1173
01:15:57,079 --> 01:15:58,372
About my mom.

1174
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,463
Wait, so you do know this guy.

1175
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:08,674
My mom did. I think.

1176
01:16:08,757 --> 01:16:10,009
That's her.

1177
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:11,385
She's really pretty.

1178
01:16:15,681 --> 01:16:17,516
So this is because of you?

1179
01:16:19,894 --> 01:16:22,813
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

1180
01:16:23,772 --> 01:16:25,649
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

1181
01:16:25,733 --> 01:16:30,487
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

1182
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:32,281
What kind of crazy stuff?

1183
01:16:33,782 --> 01:16:35,659
Climb like spiders.

1184
01:16:37,286 --> 01:16:39,997
So is he one of them?

1185
01:16:40,789 --> 01:16:42,416
I need more information.

1186
01:16:46,212 --> 01:16:47,213
You're leaving.

1187
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:53,427
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

1188
01:16:53,928 --> 01:16:54,929
How?

1189
01:16:57,932 --> 01:16:59,308
You have to go to Peru.

1190
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,771
I'll be gone a week.

1191
01:17:03,854 --> 01:17:04,855
I don't wanna leave them,

1192
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:06,273
but he's out there
looking for them...

1193
01:17:06,357 --> 01:17:07,358
and they're relying on me,

1194
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:08,734
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

1195
01:17:08,817 --> 01:17:11,111
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

1196
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:12,321
while Richard's out of town.

1197
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:14,532
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

1198
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:18,452
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

1199
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:20,913
Just be careful, okay?

1200
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:22,248
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1201
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:24,333
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

1202
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:26,252
Okay, well, neither did you.

1203
01:19:53,065 --> 01:19:55,860
You have come back
looking for answers.

1204
01:19:59,905 --> 01:20:00,906
Back?

1205
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:03,075
I promised your mother
I would be here.

1206
01:20:06,537 --> 01:20:09,039
My mom thought
<i>Las Arañas</i> were a myth.

1207
01:20:09,123 --> 01:20:10,332
What do you think?

1208
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,043
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

1209
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:14,545
She came here

1210
01:20:14,628 --> 01:20:17,423
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

1211
01:20:17,506 --> 01:20:19,550
She thought
she was being protected.

1212
01:20:19,633 --> 01:20:20,843
By Ezekiel Sims?

1213
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:22,845
His motives were selfish.

1214
01:20:22,928 --> 01:20:24,722
He used your mom to find us.

1215
01:20:24,805 --> 01:20:26,432
But, because
he stole the spider...

1216
01:20:26,515 --> 01:20:27,641
he was cursed.

1217
01:20:28,434 --> 01:20:31,353
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1218
01:20:38,235 --> 01:20:39,862
This is where my mom died?

1219
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:42,364
And where you were born.

1220
01:20:47,828 --> 01:20:51,123
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

1221
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,251
To see the future clearly...

1222
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:56,545
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

1223
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:57,671
That sounds like literally

1224
01:20:57,755 --> 01:21:00,090
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

1225
01:21:00,174 --> 01:21:02,635
You have to go
back to your beginning

1226
01:21:02,718 --> 01:21:04,011
and keep going past that.

1227
01:21:04,094 --> 01:21:05,137
There are powers

1228
01:21:05,221 --> 01:21:07,389
you don't even know
you're capable of.

1229
01:21:08,557 --> 01:21:11,685
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1230
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:16,565
Do you trust me?

1231
01:21:18,984 --> 01:21:20,945
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

1232
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:30,829
<i>You could just walk away.</i>

1233
01:21:30,913 --> 01:21:33,415
<i>Your thread did not start
when you were born.</i>

1234
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:36,585
<i>They're almost
impossible to find.</i>

1235
01:21:37,419 --> 01:21:39,922
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1236
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:41,215
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

1237
01:21:41,298 --> 01:21:42,716
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

1238
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,885
Why did you hate me so much?

1239
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:45,970
Thank you.

1240
01:21:46,053 --> 01:21:47,304
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1241
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,723
<i>- Give it to me.
- No.</i>

1242
01:21:50,307 --> 01:21:51,475
I found it.

1243
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:52,560
I found the spider.

1244
01:21:53,435 --> 01:21:54,853
Incredible, isn't it?

1245
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:58,858
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

1246
01:21:58,941 --> 01:21:59,942
Give it to me.

1247
01:22:00,025 --> 01:22:01,026
<i>You're making
the wrong decision.</i>

1248
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:02,778
- You could just walk away.
<i>- No, you're making the wrong...</i>

1249
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:18,043
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

1250
01:22:18,836 --> 01:22:21,505
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1251
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:25,467
Las Arañas <i>could not stand by.</i>

1252
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,178
<i>We tried to save you both.</i>

1253
01:22:46,071 --> 01:22:48,032
Her journey will not be easy...

1254
01:22:48,866 --> 01:22:50,576
but she is strong.

1255
01:22:59,585 --> 01:23:01,795
Your test results came back.

1256
01:23:01,879 --> 01:23:02,963
I'm sorry to tell you

1257
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:05,633
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

1258
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:08,719
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

1259
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:10,512
<i>But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.</i>

1260
01:23:10,596 --> 01:23:13,307
Life expectancy varies.

1261
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:15,142
Do you need a tissue?

1262
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:16,936
No. No. I need a cure.

1263
01:23:17,019 --> 01:23:19,521
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1264
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:22,191
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

1265
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:24,109
<i>It's experimental...</i>

1266
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,612
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

1267
01:23:26,695 --> 01:23:28,322
That's why you went there?

1268
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:29,823
For me?

1269
01:23:29,907 --> 01:23:32,326
I have to advise you against
travelling in your condition.

1270
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:35,412
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

1271
01:23:35,496 --> 01:23:37,331
I know this is hard to accept.

1272
01:23:37,414 --> 01:23:38,916
No, no, I am...

1273
01:23:38,999 --> 01:23:43,003
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

1274
01:23:44,129 --> 01:23:46,340
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

1275
01:23:55,975 --> 01:23:56,976
You did it.

1276
01:23:58,852 --> 01:23:59,937
You did it.

1277
01:24:01,438 --> 01:24:03,315
I never knew I was sick.

1278
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:06,527
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

1279
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:11,949
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1280
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:58,871
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

1281
01:24:59,622 --> 01:25:03,209
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1282
01:25:07,213 --> 01:25:09,506
I was there.
I was in the room...

1283
01:25:10,216 --> 01:25:12,551
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

1284
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,011
<i>You</i> did that.

1285
01:25:14,094 --> 01:25:17,056
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

1286
01:25:17,139 --> 01:25:20,142
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

1287
01:25:20,935 --> 01:25:23,270
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

1288
01:25:25,022 --> 01:25:27,858
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1289
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:30,945
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1290
01:25:31,028 --> 01:25:32,655
But I can't do what he can do.

1291
01:25:32,738 --> 01:25:37,201
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

1292
01:25:37,284 --> 01:25:40,246
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

1293
01:25:40,329 --> 01:25:42,665
or the ability
to release poison...

1294
01:25:42,748 --> 01:25:47,461
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

1295
01:25:47,545 --> 01:25:50,256
Your mind
has infinite potential.

1296
01:25:50,339 --> 01:25:53,676
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

1297
01:25:53,759 --> 01:25:56,845
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

1298
01:25:57,471 --> 01:26:00,641
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1299
01:26:01,892 --> 01:26:04,311
And when you take on
the responsibility...

1300
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:07,690
great power will come.

1301
01:26:24,957 --> 01:26:26,208
Every day that goes by,

1302
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:28,627
my appointment with death
gets closer.

1303
01:26:29,962 --> 01:26:31,672
And you still
have found nothing?

1304
01:26:32,256 --> 01:26:33,257
How can she have kept

1305
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,467
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1306
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:37,386
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

1307
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:39,263
scanning CCTV camera.

1308
01:26:39,346 --> 01:26:40,347
I have hacked

1309
01:26:40,431 --> 01:26:42,182
police and emergency services
frequencies.

1310
01:26:42,266 --> 01:26:44,184
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

1311
01:26:44,268 --> 01:26:46,145
including friends and family.

1312
01:26:48,063 --> 01:26:49,106
Still nothing.

1313
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:51,192
Do you understand?

1314
01:26:52,484 --> 01:26:53,569
Huh?

1315
01:26:53,652 --> 01:26:55,779
Those girls cannot exist.

1316
01:26:55,863 --> 01:26:57,573
They will try to destroy me,

1317
01:26:57,656 --> 01:27:00,367
as I will you
if you don't find them.

1318
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:03,579
She can't hide them forever.

1319
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,211
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there.

1320
01:27:11,086 --> 01:27:12,796
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

1321
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,632
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

1322
01:27:14,715 --> 01:27:15,716
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

1323
01:27:15,799 --> 01:27:16,926
- after ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

1324
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:18,093
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

1325
01:27:18,177 --> 01:27:19,220
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

1326
01:27:19,303 --> 01:27:20,596
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

1327
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:22,223
- is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

1328
01:27:22,306 --> 01:27:24,099
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

1329
01:27:24,183 --> 01:27:26,060
or my water broke.

1330
01:27:28,437 --> 01:27:29,521
Ew!

1331
01:27:29,605 --> 01:27:31,148
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

1332
01:27:31,232 --> 01:27:32,983
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

1333
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:34,068
Richard's not here,

1334
01:27:34,151 --> 01:27:36,862
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

1335
01:27:36,946 --> 01:27:39,323
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

1336
01:27:39,406 --> 01:27:40,616
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1337
01:27:41,033 --> 01:27:43,953
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for...

1338
01:27:45,162 --> 01:27:46,163
the ambulance.

1339
01:27:46,247 --> 01:27:48,249
The baby is not waiting.

1340
01:27:48,332 --> 01:27:50,543
He's coming now.

1341
01:27:50,626 --> 01:27:51,627
Now.

1342
01:27:52,461 --> 01:27:54,463
Like, here? In the dining room?

1343
01:27:54,547 --> 01:27:57,258
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1344
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:58,342
Okay.

1345
01:28:00,678 --> 01:28:01,679
Get in the car.

1346
01:28:05,349 --> 01:28:06,350
Keep your head down.

1347
01:28:10,771 --> 01:28:11,772
It's gonna be okay.

1348
01:28:13,065 --> 01:28:14,066
Okay. Come on.

1349
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:15,150
Okay, okay.

1350
01:28:18,112 --> 01:28:19,113
Everyone okay?

1351
01:28:19,572 --> 01:28:21,073
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

1352
01:28:21,657 --> 01:28:22,658
Seriously?

1353
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:24,493
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1354
01:28:24,577 --> 01:28:25,703
Never mind.

1355
01:28:29,665 --> 01:28:31,584
All right, let's step on it.

1356
01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:51,353
<i>10-58 in progress. 30-relo-5.</i>

1357
01:28:51,437 --> 01:28:52,438
I might have something.

1358
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:53,689
<i>Woman in labour.</i>

1359
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:56,442
<i>20-Edward copy. En route.</i>

1360
01:28:56,525 --> 01:28:57,693
<i>- 13-Edward, go ahead.
- 10-4.</i>

1361
01:28:57,776 --> 01:28:58,819
<i>Possible D&D in progress.</i>

1362
01:29:00,529 --> 01:29:02,364
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

1363
01:29:02,448 --> 01:29:03,449
St Timothy's.

1364
01:29:03,532 --> 01:29:04,700
Track the route.

1365
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:05,784
Tracking.

1366
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:44,823
<i>The baby is not waiting.</i>

1367
01:29:44,907 --> 01:29:46,492
<i>...doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...</i>

1368
01:29:46,575 --> 01:29:47,576
<i>Get out, get out, get out!</i>

1369
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:48,953
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!</i>

1370
01:29:49,328 --> 01:29:50,329
<i>What? What?</i>

1371
01:29:50,955 --> 01:29:52,122
<i>Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!</i>

1372
01:29:52,206 --> 01:29:53,207
Shit!

1373
01:30:05,177 --> 01:30:06,387
Sorry, guys.

1374
01:30:09,598 --> 01:30:10,599
Hey!

1375
01:30:14,895 --> 01:30:16,230
Thank you.

1376
01:30:21,986 --> 01:30:23,195
So the last one was

1377
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:25,906
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

1378
01:30:26,866 --> 01:30:27,867
So that means

1379
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,870
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

1380
01:30:31,996 --> 01:30:33,581
21.6 seconds.

1381
01:30:35,082 --> 01:30:36,625
That's pretty fast.

1382
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:39,003
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

1383
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:40,087
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

1384
01:30:40,796 --> 01:30:42,631
<i>He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.</i>

1385
01:30:42,715 --> 01:30:45,217
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

1386
01:30:45,926 --> 01:30:46,927
Drive faster.

1387
01:30:47,011 --> 01:30:49,388
Let's go. Let's go, please.

1388
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,523
Hack into traffic control.

1389
01:31:00,524 --> 01:31:01,734
<i>Turn the lights green.</i>

1390
01:31:03,611 --> 01:31:04,945
<i>Amaria, now.</i>

1391
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:06,739
Turning all traffic lights
to green.

1392
01:31:10,117 --> 01:31:11,535
Why is no one stopping? Hey!

1393
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:12,870
Ben, watch out!

1394
01:31:14,455 --> 01:31:15,748
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

1395
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,166
Whoa, whoa.

1396
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:18,959
Ben!

1397
01:31:21,837 --> 01:31:22,838
Everyone okay?

1398
01:31:22,922 --> 01:31:23,923
Yeah.

1399
01:31:24,006 --> 01:31:25,299
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1400
01:31:25,382 --> 01:31:26,383
I'm fine.

1401
01:31:31,722 --> 01:31:32,806
What is that?

1402
01:31:36,852 --> 01:31:38,437
Oh, my God, it's him.

1403
01:31:39,188 --> 01:31:40,189
Guys.

1404
01:31:52,868 --> 01:31:54,161
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

1405
01:31:54,245 --> 01:31:55,371
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

1406
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:27,820
Cassie!

1407
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,905
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

1408
01:32:29,989 --> 01:32:31,448
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

1409
01:32:31,532 --> 01:32:34,743
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

1410
01:32:34,827 --> 01:32:37,121
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

1411
01:32:37,204 --> 01:32:38,497
Well, what about you?

1412
01:32:39,123 --> 01:32:41,250
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

1413
01:33:04,398 --> 01:33:05,524
You're showing off.

1414
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,651
Not yet.

1415
01:33:08,569 --> 01:33:09,945
I think we lost him.

1416
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:17,244
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

1417
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,038
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

1418
01:33:21,582 --> 01:33:23,167
Okay, press "charge."

1419
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,877
Am I having a heart attack?

1420
01:33:25,878 --> 01:33:26,962
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

1421
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:28,505
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

1422
01:33:28,589 --> 01:33:29,757
Hey, man!

1423
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,467
Okay, get ready.

1424
01:33:33,219 --> 01:33:34,762
Get it close to the ceiling.

1425
01:33:34,845 --> 01:33:36,764
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

1426
01:33:38,224 --> 01:33:39,558
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

1427
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:44,271
Wait. Wait.

1428
01:33:45,022 --> 01:33:46,398
Now.

1429
01:33:53,822 --> 01:33:54,990
Sorry.

1430
01:33:55,074 --> 01:33:56,200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1431
01:33:56,283 --> 01:33:57,576
- You okay?
- You okay?

1432
01:34:00,204 --> 01:34:01,205
Okay.

1433
01:34:02,331 --> 01:34:03,541
Now you're showing off.

1434
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:05,417
Maybe a little.

1435
01:34:35,322 --> 01:34:36,323
Now what?

1436
01:34:37,157 --> 01:34:38,659
<i>Those girls cannot exist.</i>

1437
01:34:38,742 --> 01:34:40,244
<i>- ...doesn't look safe.
- It's a death trap.</i>

1438
01:34:40,327 --> 01:34:41,537
<i>...infinite potential.</i>

1439
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:43,956
<i>This place has
always been a death trap.</i>

1440
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:45,332
<i>...packed with explosives.</i>

1441
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:46,625
<i>Get down!</i>

1442
01:34:48,752 --> 01:34:49,753
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1443
01:34:51,505 --> 01:34:52,756
<i>Jump! Come on!</i>

1444
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,966
<i>Get in the helicopter.</i>

1445
01:35:01,348 --> 01:35:04,685
I have a code 30. PD-36-307.

1446
01:35:04,768 --> 01:35:07,688
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

1447
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:09,690
<i>Copy that.</i>

1448
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:11,150
Okay.

1449
01:35:15,404 --> 01:35:16,739
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1450
01:35:16,822 --> 01:35:18,240
It's already crazy.

1451
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:19,909
You didn't bail on us.

1452
01:35:20,743 --> 01:35:21,785
Whatever happens,

1453
01:35:21,869 --> 01:35:23,454
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1454
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:25,539
We'll protect each other.

1455
01:35:25,623 --> 01:35:26,665
Yeah, we're in this together.

1456
01:35:27,374 --> 01:35:28,375
Right?

1457
01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:29,835
Yeah.

1458
01:35:30,961 --> 01:35:32,588
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

1459
01:35:33,714 --> 01:35:35,633
I know. It's not cool.

1460
01:35:35,716 --> 01:35:37,092
Let's go. Out the back.

1461
01:35:37,176 --> 01:35:38,302
- What?
- Go, go, go.

1462
01:35:49,188 --> 01:35:50,814
This doesn't look safe.

1463
01:35:50,898 --> 01:35:53,817
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1464
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:55,736
That doesn't <i>sound</i> safe.

1465
01:35:55,819 --> 01:35:57,363
It's a death trap.

1466
01:35:58,197 --> 01:35:59,740
And that's a good thing?

1467
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:01,659
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

1468
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:04,620
No matter what happens...

1469
01:36:04,703 --> 01:36:07,122
we need to work together, okay?

1470
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,751
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

1471
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:12,628
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1472
01:36:13,462 --> 01:36:14,463
Are we ready?

1473
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:22,763
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

1474
01:36:22,846 --> 01:36:25,099
Here. Take these.

1475
01:36:25,182 --> 01:36:27,434
Put them in
as many crates as you can.

1476
01:36:32,439 --> 01:36:33,440
Okay?

1477
01:36:34,441 --> 01:36:35,818
You two, go that way.

1478
01:36:35,901 --> 01:36:37,611
We need to slow him down.

1479
01:36:37,695 --> 01:36:39,947
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

1480
01:36:45,578 --> 01:36:46,745
I got this one.

1481
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:48,664
Come on, Julia. Let's go.

1482
01:37:01,385 --> 01:37:02,469
Anya, go.

1483
01:37:06,181 --> 01:37:07,224
Go.

1484
01:37:18,652 --> 01:37:21,197
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

1485
01:37:26,076 --> 01:37:28,078
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

1486
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:31,749
Now!

1487
01:37:35,502 --> 01:37:36,629
Whoa!

1488
01:37:36,712 --> 01:37:37,713
Go! Run!

1489
01:37:39,006 --> 01:37:40,424
Now you're really showing off.

1490
01:37:40,925 --> 01:37:42,134
Come on, upstairs.

1491
01:37:53,812 --> 01:37:55,064
I knew. I knew she had a plan.

1492
01:37:55,147 --> 01:37:56,148
- Hey!
- Hey!

1493
01:37:56,649 --> 01:37:57,650
- Hey!
- We're here!

1494
01:37:58,108 --> 01:37:59,485
Down here!

1495
01:38:01,153 --> 01:38:03,447
<i>Make your way to the south side.</i>

1496
01:38:05,908 --> 01:38:06,951
Come on.

1497
01:38:09,912 --> 01:38:11,080
Wait. Get down!

1498
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:16,210
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

1499
01:38:17,169 --> 01:38:18,420
Anya, stop!

1500
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,765
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

1501
01:38:37,481 --> 01:38:39,275
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

1502
01:38:39,358 --> 01:38:40,776
Get down!

1503
01:38:42,528 --> 01:38:44,363
Go to the ladder. Go!

1504
01:38:46,407 --> 01:38:47,408
Come on, come on!

1505
01:38:52,037 --> 01:38:53,372
<i>Use the web.</i>

1506
01:39:06,969 --> 01:39:08,012
Get to the helicopter.

1507
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:10,764
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

1508
01:39:13,017 --> 01:39:16,103
<i>It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.</i>

1509
01:39:16,186 --> 01:39:17,479
Guys, this way.

1510
01:39:17,563 --> 01:39:19,565
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

1511
01:39:24,278 --> 01:39:25,446
Anya, jump.

1512
01:39:26,947 --> 01:39:28,741
Jump now! Julia, get back!

1513
01:39:36,123 --> 01:39:37,124
Julia, get down!

1514
01:39:50,054 --> 01:39:51,055
Oh, God!

1515
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:53,641
You should have walked away.

1516
01:39:55,893 --> 01:39:57,019
You can't protect them.

1517
01:39:57,102 --> 01:39:58,103
Cassie!

1518
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,777
Over here, asshole.

1519
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:08,822
Mattie!

1520
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:20,918
Don't hurt her!

1521
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:29,510
Anya!

1522
01:40:32,346 --> 01:40:33,681
Cassie!

1523
01:40:51,282 --> 01:40:52,741
You can't save all three.

1524
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:57,872
<i>And when you take on
the responsibility...</i>

1525
01:40:58,497 --> 01:41:00,291
<i>great power will come.</i>

1526
01:41:06,755 --> 01:41:09,133
Julia, I got you.

1527
01:41:09,216 --> 01:41:10,217
Come on.

1528
01:41:11,635 --> 01:41:13,846
Mattie. You're gonna be okay.

1529
01:41:13,929 --> 01:41:15,848
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

1530
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:49,548
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

1531
01:41:53,135 --> 01:41:54,637
What makes you so sure?

1532
01:42:01,977 --> 01:42:03,979
Come on. Come on, come on.

1533
01:42:04,063 --> 01:42:05,439
You're just like your mother.

1534
01:42:05,523 --> 01:42:07,274
Yes, I am.

1535
01:42:30,047 --> 01:42:32,007
You've been trying
to change your future.

1536
01:42:33,759 --> 01:42:36,011
But the girls
were never your future.

1537
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,722
I was.

1538
01:42:52,778 --> 01:42:54,655
No!

1539
01:43:17,595 --> 01:43:19,555
No. Cassie!

1540
01:44:13,317 --> 01:44:14,610
She's not breathing.

1541
01:44:14,693 --> 01:44:16,278
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

1542
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:18,072
Beginning compressions.

1543
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:21,617
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

1544
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:22,993
Come on, guys. Come on!

1545
01:44:24,578 --> 01:44:26,121
Keep going. We don't stop.

1546
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:28,040
Come on, Cassie.

1547
01:44:29,124 --> 01:44:30,334
I'm getting a little tired.

1548
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:31,752
Okay. I'm right here.

1549
01:44:32,836 --> 01:44:34,255
Cassie, wake up! Please.

1550
01:44:34,338 --> 01:44:36,006
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

1551
01:44:37,841 --> 01:44:39,635
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

1552
01:44:40,344 --> 01:44:42,263
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

1553
01:44:44,598 --> 01:44:45,808
Oh, my God!

1554
01:44:46,517 --> 01:44:47,518
Cassie.

1555
01:44:48,852 --> 01:44:50,437
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1556
01:44:50,521 --> 01:44:51,522
Oh, my God. We did it.

1557
01:44:56,527 --> 01:44:57,778
We did it.

1558
01:45:18,883 --> 01:45:19,884
Hi.

1559
01:45:22,344 --> 01:45:23,596
Hello.

1560
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:24,680
Hi.

1561
01:45:26,974 --> 01:45:28,684
Oh, he's perfect.

1562
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,561
He is.

1563
01:45:31,061 --> 01:45:32,688
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

1564
01:45:40,404 --> 01:45:41,697
We're still here, Cassie.

1565
01:45:42,489 --> 01:45:43,991
Yeah. We're not leaving you.

1566
01:45:44,992 --> 01:45:45,993
I wouldn't be here

1567
01:45:46,076 --> 01:45:47,494
if it weren't
for the three of you.

1568
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,496
Right back at ya.

1569
01:45:49,997 --> 01:45:50,998
Ben said to tell you

1570
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:52,499
that the baby
is doing really well.

1571
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,877
And he's loving being an uncle.

1572
01:45:56,003 --> 01:45:59,006
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1573
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:01,592
That's what he thinks.

1574
01:46:04,803 --> 01:46:07,139
Are you all immediate family?

1575
01:46:07,598 --> 01:46:08,807
Yes.

1576
01:46:10,017 --> 01:46:11,435
They're all mine.

1577
01:46:18,526 --> 01:46:20,027
Can we get you anything?

1578
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:21,111
No.

1579
01:46:22,029 --> 01:46:24,114
I have everything I need
right here.

1580
01:46:53,769 --> 01:46:54,770
No.

1581
01:46:58,357 --> 01:47:01,569
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

1582
01:47:01,652 --> 01:47:04,822
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

1583
01:47:04,905 --> 01:47:06,532
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

01:47:06,615 --> 01:47:07,908
How'd you know?

1585
01:47:08,659 --> 01:47:09,743
Bless you, Anya.

1586
01:47:09,827 --> 01:47:10,828
What?

1587
01:47:13,372 --> 01:47:14,373
Thank you.

1588
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:19,211
Mattie!

1589
01:47:19,295 --> 01:47:21,714
What? I told you I'm starving.

1590
01:47:21,797 --> 01:47:23,465
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

1591
01:47:23,549 --> 01:47:25,301
...wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

1592
01:47:25,384 --> 01:47:27,177
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1593
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:29,471
How's your eyesight?

1594
01:47:30,014 --> 01:47:31,682
I can see better
than I ever have.

1595
01:47:31,765 --> 01:47:32,766
Oh, yeah?

1596
01:47:33,392 --> 01:47:35,686
Can you see us in the future?

1597
01:47:36,604 --> 01:47:37,730
Yes.

1598
01:47:38,981 --> 01:47:40,191
I can see you.

1599
01:47:42,109 --> 01:47:44,069
<i>Standing up
for what you believe.</i>

1600
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:50,910
<i>Never giving up.</i>

1601
01:47:56,457 --> 01:47:59,376
<i>Discovering you were always
more powerful than you thought.</i>

1602
01:48:01,128 --> 01:48:02,922
Nothing I didn't already know.

1603
01:48:05,633 --> 01:48:07,051
I don't know about you two...

1604
01:48:07,635 --> 01:48:09,845
but that totally
makes sense to me.

1605
01:48:10,429 --> 01:48:12,348
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

1606
01:48:14,934 --> 01:48:16,435
What? I'm being serious.

1607
01:48:20,356 --> 01:48:22,691
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

1608
01:48:31,992 --> 01:48:33,536
<i>Whatever the future holds...</i>

1609
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:40,793
<i>we'll be ready.</i>

1610
01:48:43,087 --> 01:48:44,964
<i>And you know the best thing
about the future?</i>

1611
01:48:47,091 --> 01:48:49,009
<i>It hasn't happened yet.</i>
