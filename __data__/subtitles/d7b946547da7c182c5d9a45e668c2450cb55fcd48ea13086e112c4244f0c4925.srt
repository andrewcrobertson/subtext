there is something

called a "queen slayer."

1446
01:16:44,175 --> 01:16:48,142
It’s a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

for the greater good.

1453

believes that Derek Danforth

is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1455
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:16,175
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1456
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:19,241
and become a queen slayer.
