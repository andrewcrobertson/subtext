00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,303
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

184
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,005
I have my own problems.

185
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,874
What problems?

186
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,275
Internal.

187
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,077
-Internal?
-Yes.

188
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,712
I don't know how else to put it.

189
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,914
Problems with what I feel
internally.

190
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,816
How can you have
internal problems?

191
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,851
You got your ass all bricked up.

192
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,954
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

193
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:17,992
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

194
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,828
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

195
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,998
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

196
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,801
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

197
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,070
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

198
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,671
Please don't eat those peas.

199
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,207
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,876
-and then we two...
-I can't. I'm leaving town.

201
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,611
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

202
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,679
Where are you going?

203
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,347
Tallahassee, Florida.

204
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,383
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

205
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,151
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

206
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,020
Can't she move?

207
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,888
Tallahassee is very nice.

208
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,890
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

209
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,692
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

210
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,728
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

211
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,931
There's good birding.

212
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,632
Birding?

213
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,234
How have I missed out on this?

214
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,969
It's very pleasant.

215
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,738
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

216
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,874
I've been unhappy,

217
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,076
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

218
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,744
and it's not fair to them.

219
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,380
I'm only impatient with myself.

220
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,116
Well, we can fix that.

221
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,017
We'll have you running right
in no time.

222
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,220
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

223
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,889
We get our shit together,
together.

224
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,724
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

225
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,160
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

226
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,428
Now you can come with me,

227
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,430
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

228
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,165
What's a drive-away?

229
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,733
Free one-way rental.

230
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,268
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

231
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,903
of the drive-away company
wants it,

232
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,005
if they got one going
near your destination.

233
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,741
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

234
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,043
Are you kidding? A birder?

235
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:46,046
I'll wear my great big old
straw hat,

236
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,016
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

237
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,885
You know how
parents and such love me.

238
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,720
They think I got charisma.

239
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,055
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

240
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,690
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

241
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,758
Isn't she something?"

242
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,293
I'm not sure.

243
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,728
Don't go finding a problem here.

244
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,363
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

245
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,965
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

246
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,034
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

247
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,769
SUKIE:
<i>Oh, God!</i>

248
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,771
-(sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!
-(power drill whirring)

249
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,940
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

250
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,442
-I don't want it anymore.
-(dog barking)

251
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,444
(hushed):
You said she wouldn't be here.

252
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,981
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

253
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,216
That was a gift.

254
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,884
I wanted you to have it.

255
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:28,322
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

256
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,025
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

257
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,293
No, no, no, no.

258
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,094
And take Alice, too.

259
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,829
I never liked her.

260
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,798
And she won't stop barking!

261
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,934
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

262
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,335
Remember, you kicked me out?

263
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,469
(continues sobbing)

264
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:45,406
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

265
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,509
It's your dildo, Susanne.

266
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,344
(Alice barks, growls)

267
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,012
Curlie's Drive-Away,

268
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,480
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

269
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,015
Curlie speaking.

270
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,750
MAN (on phone):
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

271
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,786
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

272
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,354
Yeah, you have something
to write this down?

273
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,957
-Yes, I'm writing it down.
-To 14 Tinywick Road.

274
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,325
-Right.
-Tallahassee.

275
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,793
-Sure.
-You got it?

276
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,194
-Right. Got it.
-Can you help us?

277
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,830
And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.

278
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,498
-By tomorrow.
-No later.

279
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,234
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

280
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,169
-Okay.
-Over and out.

281
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,240
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

282
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:22,109
$250 deposit and a reference.

283
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,444
A reference?

284
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,513
Somebody local
I can break his balls

285
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,481
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

286
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,250
His balls.

287
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,985
Can the reference be a woman?

288
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,120
We don't know a lot of men.

289
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,421
No kidding.

290
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,057
-Where do you want to go?
-Tallahassee.

291
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,960
Tallahassee?

292
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,396
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

293
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,998
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

294
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,266
I think Curlie here...

295
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,900
Don't call me Curlie.

296
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,837
Isn't your name Curlie?

297
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,938
My name is Curlie.

298
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,574
We just met. It's too familiar.

299
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,842
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

300
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,076
No, I got good sense.

301
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,912
-Your car is a Dodge Aries.
-Oh.

302
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,348
Okay. Is that a good car?

303
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,050
Not really.

304
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,887
You sell those shirts?

305
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,556
JAMIE: There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

306
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,891
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

307
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,860
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

308
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,061
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

309
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,496
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

310
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,964
-but it's just...
-Jamie.

311
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,299
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

312
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,833
Down and across.

313
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,302
Right here's
the world's largest Dixie cup

314
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,570
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

315
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,338
MARIAN:
Direct route, down and across.

316
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,074
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

317
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,910
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

318
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,212
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

319
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,616
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

320
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,150
The interstate is not life.

321
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,585
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

322
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,186
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.

323
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,054
That's nature.

324
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,922
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

325
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,390
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

326
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,925
He said it was a rush job.

327
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,226
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

328
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,328
Tomorrow can wait a day.

329
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,929
We could even go to Miami.

330
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,331
Bikinis and high heels.

331
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,232
(engine revs, tires squeal)

332
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,134
A medical doctor?

333
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,302
Or a reverend?

334
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:59,607
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

335
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,909
No, not for medical doctors,
either.

336
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,611
Make up your mind--
which are you?

337
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:06,313
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

338
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,883
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

339
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,186
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

340
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,889
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

341
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,326
Well, we're here.

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,995
Okay. Who are you?

343
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,499
-The car.
-The car?

344
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,267
The Dodge Aries.

345
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,403
The Dodge Aries?

346
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,672
What are you, a mynah bird?

347
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,005
I'm Curlie.

348
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,907
I understand that.

349
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,476
You're not the Dodge.

350
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,514
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

351
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,949
♪ ♪

352
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,953
(doors open and close)

353
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,389
(engine starts, tires squeal)

354
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,023
What's the big deal?

355
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,693
The car isn't ours.

356
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,461
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

357
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:56,029
And once we get to Tallahassee,

358
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,532
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

359
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,500
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

360
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,201
-soap and water.
-It won't.

361
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,237
-Won't what?
-Come off with soap and water.

362
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,573
-Well, how do you know?
-I tried.

363
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,642
Marian, it's art.

364
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,076
Stop saying it's art.

365
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,645
That doesn't end all discussion.

366
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,146
We're gonna be driving through

367
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,014
some conservative towns--
the South.

368
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,683
-The Bible Belt.
-Mm, don't I know it.

369
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,685
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

370
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,453
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

371
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,689
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

372
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,224
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

373
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,728
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

374
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,095
My project.

375
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,130
What's your project?

376
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,934
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

377
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,236
How long's it been?

378
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,073
Weeks?

379
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,678
Months?

380
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,446
Oh, my God, Marian.

381
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,715
Don't tell me it's been years.

382
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,050
H-How many years? Who was it?

383
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,152
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

384
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:53,621
Donna.

385
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,255
Yeah, Donna.

386
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,394
Oh, my God.

387
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,963
Oh, my God. Donna?

388
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,499
(sighs)
She work for Al Gore now?

389
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,000
Nader.

390
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,504
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

391
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,073
CURLIE:
Wait a minute.

392
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,477
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

393
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,747
Yes, I did.

394
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,183
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

395
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,752
and then these broads come in

396
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,154
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

397
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,223
You gave them the car.

398
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,024
You don't know who they were?

399
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,627
CURLIE:
I told you their names.

400
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,127
Their names, yes, but...

401
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,797
This place is a dump.

402
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,265
They drive the car
instead of you.

403
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,233
Is that bad?

404
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,668
Bad if they find the goods.

405
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,237
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

406
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,739
CURLIE:
I like clutter.

407
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,240
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

408
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,374
Sterile doesn't work for me.

409
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,142
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

410
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,612
-Dick-yank?
-CHIEF: Flint.

411
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:51,779
I'm a dick-yank?

412
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,280
Don't antagonize.

413
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,682
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

414
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,751
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

415
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,418
And you would?

416
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,722
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

417
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,422
(footsteps approaching)

418
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,591
Not per se.

419
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,192
"Per se"?!

420
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,695
They left a local number.

421
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,665
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

422
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,466
Someone whose balls I can break.

423
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,067
(grunts)

424
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,671
(groaning)

425
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,039
Now you've gone and done it.

426
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,810
(grunting)

427
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:26,781
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

428
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:29,617
-(thumping)
-(grunting and groaning)

429
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,452
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

430
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,188
Tomorrow.

431
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,457
(grunting and groaning continue)

432
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,127
(sighs) This is great.

433
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,429
This is so slutty. I love this.

434
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,165
-Hope they have postcards.
-Uh, Jamie?

435
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,100
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

436
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,268
The Butter Churn awaits.

437
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,571
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

438
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,573
No. No, don't even.

439
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,807
You come with me.

440
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,609
I'll show you how this is done.

441
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,714
(chatter in foreign language,
audience laughter over TV)

442
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:02,482
(door opens, closes)

443
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,587
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

444
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,220
It's a dyke bar.

445
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,424
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

446
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,360
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

447
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,395
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

448
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,498
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

449
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,536
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

450
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,240
Hello?

451
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,477
(engine idling)

452
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,647
-(engine shuts off)
-(muffled music playing inside)

453
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,381
JAMIE:
Confidence.

454
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,217
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

455
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,353
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

456
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,321
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

457
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,924
Jamie, I have done this before.

458
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,626
It's just like this.

459
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,193
One message.

460
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,696
You dig the female body.

461
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,897
Your body.

462
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,165
You're like this.

463
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:55,770
Not like this.

464
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,572
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

465
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:58,906
I have done this before.

466
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,407
I am not a schoolmarm.

467
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,909
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

468
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,845
-Not only.
-Only in the last four years.

469
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,613
Three years.

470
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,482
(hushed):
And four months and 14 days.

I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

487
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,548
I said they all looked fine.

Yeah, but not in the sense
of "super fine."

"throw up against the wall

496
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,000
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

497
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,601
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

498
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:03,236
I'm just trying
to get you laid, sugar sweet.

499
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,272
They sense it,
whether you want to fuck them

500
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,841
or you think they're just fine.

501
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,375
I have to be me.

502
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,410
It has to be done
with authenticity.

503
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,446
-You mean with authority.
-I mean with authenticity.

504
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,982
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

505
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,751
You don't know
what our life was like.

506
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,019
You know nothing
about its worth.

507
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,654
Then why didn't
the two of you move

508
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,723
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

509
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:22,990

the people in the movie,

895
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:26,887
and they opened the box,

896
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:30,758
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

wanted or something?

Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

922
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,702

00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:43,424
(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

1066
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:46,293
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

1067
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:48,429
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

1068
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,963
I guarantee you someone's there.

1069
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:52,433
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

1070
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,968
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

1071
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:56,671
I'll take Alice.

1072
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,338
Really? Swear?

1073
00:48:58,372 --> 00:49:00,708
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

1074
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:03,343
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

1075
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:06,413
CHIEF (over phone):
A juke joint where?

1076
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,449
Wetumpka, Alabama.

1077
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:10,184
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

1078
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:11,351
They hadn't been there,

1079
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:14,722
but a very personable
music lover

1080
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,591
told us of another juke joint

1081
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,392
-fairly close by called...
-You see?

1082
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:19,527
Stop!

1083
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:21,395
Called Ike's.

1084
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,398
Maybe he said "Mike's."

1085
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,033
Maybe he said "Mike."

1086
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,168
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

1087
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,070
I think the soccer team
was just confused

1088
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,072
about which joint
these girls were going to,

1089
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:33,541
so we're gonna drive...

1090
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,276
Stop saying words.

1091
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,012
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

1092
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,481
They arrived in Tallahassee

1093
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:44,151
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

1094
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:46,186
Tallahassee.

1095
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,755
I want you to get
your asses over there

1096
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:50,090
and take care of it right away.

1097
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:51,626
Not a juke joint.

1098
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,160
You should arrive
by early morning.

1099
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,261
I'll meet you there.

1100
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:56,497
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

1101
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:58,465
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

1102
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,568
We have not slept
since the night before last,

1103
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:02,504
-and we...
-(click, dial tone)

1104
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:04,204
Hello?

1105
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,542
-Chief?
-Who's in Tallahassee?

1106
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,110
DESK CLERK:
Certainly.

1107
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,045
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

1108
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,380
or right here at the hotel,

1109
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:16,049
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

1110
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,519
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

1111
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:20,588
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

1112
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,123
Maybe we should stay here.

1113
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:24,592
Replenish the ice.

1114
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,162
(piano playing
"Fly Me to the Moon")

1115
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:31,231
This is great, but how...

1116
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,601
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

1117
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:37,304
(softly):
Rainbow.

1118
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:38,205
Yes.

1119
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,775
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

1120
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,544
Like, a really, really good one?

1121
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:43,645
WAITER:
Of course.

1122
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:47,682
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

1123
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,349
Theoretically.

1124
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,287
(Jamie sighs)

1125
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:59,126
So...

1126
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:04,331
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1127
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,169
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1128
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:12,574
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1129
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:15,475
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1130
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,478
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1131
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,615
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1132
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:23,518
but I usually have stuff to do.

1133
00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:26,153
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1134
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:28,690
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1135
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:33,193
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1136
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,228
-(cork pops)
-Something I decided

1137
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,598
last night
while I was lying in bed

1138
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:39,601
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1139
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:43,838
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1140
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,405
Especially since, with you,

1141
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,474
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1142
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,643
Am I right?

1143
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,145
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1144
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:55,415
-Thank you.
-WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

1145
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,618
Yes, please.

1146
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,753
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1147
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:00,420
I mean, we're good friends,

1148
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,422
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1149
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,891
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1150
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:07,461
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1151
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:10,430
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1152
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,634
-You never have sex.
-Exactly.

1153
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:14,569
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1154
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:17,270
She was always saying
that this or that

1155
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,940
-would be inappropriate.
-Uh-huh.

1156
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,610
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1157
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:24,311
the sex was great.

1158
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,279
Ladies, have we decided?

1159
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,585
Don't rush us, buddy.

1160
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:34,555
First, we'll dance.

1161
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:38,291
("You Belong to Me"
by Diana Krall playing)

1162
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,570
Maybe I do overthink things.

1163
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:52,406
Yeah.

1164
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:56,443

I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1167
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,485
Ah, you know Debbie.

1168
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,555
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1169

on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1170
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,492

1240
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:39,073
CHAUFFEUR:
Sir?

1241
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,774
-Sir.
-Hmm?

1242
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,777
Tallahassee, sir.

1243
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:46,380
-Where to, exactly?
-(sighs)

1244
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:48,782
Yes, um...

1245
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,684
The track.

1246
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:52,753
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1247
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,388
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1248
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:55,956
JAMIE:
Oh, come on now.

1249
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,826
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1250
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,761
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1251
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:03,063
No. I like this one.

1252
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,433
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1253
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:07,902
Last night was beautiful,

1254
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,870
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1255
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:11,772
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1256
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,440
-Okay! -All right!
-(Jamie and Marian screaming)

1257
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,143
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1258
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,912
We're here for two things.

1259
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,180
-(screaming continues)
-(grunts)

1260
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,714
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1261
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:21,982
Screw you!

1262
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,451
-(screaming)
-We're here for two items.

1263
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:25,953
Whoa. She's naked.

1264
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:28,189
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1265
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,823
We're here for two items.

1266
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:31,892
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1267
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,994
-And the head box.
-Head box!

1268
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:35,996
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1269
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,898
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1270
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:39,900
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1271
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:42,436
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1272
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,805
Let's get this show on the road.

1273
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,373
(screaming continues)

1274
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,742
Yeah, baby.

1275
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:53,280
You're such a big, bouncy,

1276
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,984
beautiful baby.

1277
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,087
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1278
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,190
Whoa.

1279
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,793
This is so groovy.

1280
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:08,495
Now I can love you forever.

1281
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,231
Whoa.

1282
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:12,433
And ever

1283
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:16,237
and ever and ever

1284
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:21,308
-and ever and ever.
-And ever and ever.

1285
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:25,879
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1286
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:29,984
BOTH: Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1287
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:34,522
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1288
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:38,926
(echoing): Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1289
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,530
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1290
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:46,267
Never to wilt...

1291
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,535
(bell rings)

1292
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:50,271
(snarling)

1293
01:02:50,304 --> 01:02:51,506
Took 'em straight here.

1294
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:52,973
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1295
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:55,075
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1296
01:02:58,546 --> 01:03:00,281
This is all they had?

1297
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:02,082
What's all they had?

1298
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:07,589
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1299
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,857
GOON:
What are you talking about?

1300
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,026
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1301
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,428
-Not in the...
-Well, that just figures.

1302
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,330
Come on, girls.

1303
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:17,965
Where's the last phallus?

1304
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:21,101
(muffled chattering)

1305
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,337
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1306
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,039
I-I...

1307
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,007
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1308
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,909
What have you done, jerk-off?

1309
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:30,844
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1310
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,179
They gave you the combination,

1311
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,181
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1312
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,949
-FLINT: I never slip up.
-GOON: Right, left,

1313
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,851
-past the first number.
-(yells)

1314
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,888
(snarling)

1315
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:54,134
The senator is a good man.

1316
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:57,938
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1317
01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,239
Many of us did.

1318
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:01,609
-It was a different time.
-(muffled muttering)

1319
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:04,912
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1320
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:07,381
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1321
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:14,656
Housekeeping.

1322
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,624
(snarling)

1323
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:21,128
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1324
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,164
...thing.

1325
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:29,370
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1326
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,238
(beeping)

1327
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:34,509
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1328
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:37,911
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1329
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:40,414
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1330
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,618
He was just a kid.

1331
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:47,054
(humming an upbeat tune)

1332
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:51,091
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1333
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,160
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1334
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:56,096
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1335
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,466
(hushed):
You saw him, sort of.

1336
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,039
(continues humming)

1337
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:09,443
(stops humming)

1338
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,348
<i>(housekeeper screaming)</i>

1339
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:17,585
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1340
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:20,320
Think of it: eBay,

1341
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:24,559
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1342
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:27,127
Comments, reviews.

1343
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,597
Think of what
it would do to him.

1344
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:34,001
His children, his family,
his career.

1345
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:36,571
(gasps)

1346
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:39,707
-(goons yelling in distance)
-We're not unreasonable.

1347
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,443
We'll gladly pay for it.

1348
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:43,711
We just...

1349
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:45,680
Will you please shut up!

1350
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:47,014
That wasn't my idea!

1351
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,550
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1352
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,617
I was experimenting.

1353
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:51,051
But you liked it.

1354
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,352
-FLINT: No, I didn't!
-I could tell.

1355
01:05:52,386 --> 01:05:54,054
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1356
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,355
Drunk on cock.

1357
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:57,024
-FLINT: No! I didn't.
-It's not my thing.

1358
01:05:57,057 --> 01:05:58,760
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1359
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,695
-To understand life.
-No!

1360
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,363
-The stuff of life!
-No, no, no!

1361
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:04,599
(groaning)

1362
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:06,066
(screaming)

1363
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:09,002
CHIEF:
God, man, what are you doing?!

1364
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:11,171
-(both screaming)
-(Flint yelling)

1365
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,142
(Marian and Jamie whimpering)

1366
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:28,288
(Marian and Jamie
whimpering loudly)

1367
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:34,094
(gun clicks)

1368
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:38,432
(clicking)

1369
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,437
Mommy.

1370
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:47,609
(crying)

1371
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:56,718
(door opens, closes)

1372
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,419
(dogs barking, yelping
in distance)

1373
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,525
(dogs barking in distance)

1374
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,127
MARIAN: All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1375
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,530
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1376
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:10,130
Then we switch hotels.

1377
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:11,833
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1378
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,367
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1379
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,670
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1380
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,138
-Where are you going?
-Art store.

1381
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,212
(barking)

1382
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:27,347
WOMAN:
Next customer, please.

1383
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:30,384
SUKIE: Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1384
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,786
Don't ask me why.

1385
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,822
(line ringing)

1386
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,423
MAN (over phone):
Committee to Reelect.

1387
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:38,325
JAMIE:
I need to speak to the senator.

1388
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:41,763
MAN: Well, who should I say
is calling?

1389
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:44,298
Someone who has his...

...personal effects.

1392
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:21,401

-GARY (over phone): Who is this?

1393
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,670
Senator?

1394
01:08:22,704 --> 01:08:25,205
Yes. Who is this?

1395
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,275
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1396
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:31,613
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1397
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:33,313
Everybody's things.

1398
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,917
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1399
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,151
If you're not alone,

1400
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:40,187
believe me, I'll know it.

(Alice barking)

1402
01:08:49,597 --> 01:08:50,932
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1403
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:52,867
made a phone call
from here last night.

1404
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,301
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1405
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:57,639
Well, this is for her.

1406
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:58,773
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1407
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,374
You've missed them.

1408
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:03,276
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1409
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:19,661

1410

With what?

1412
