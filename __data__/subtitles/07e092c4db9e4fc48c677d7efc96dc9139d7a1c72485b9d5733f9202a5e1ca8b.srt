1
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,239
Another glass of...

2
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,509
...rosé?

3
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,413
No. The hour is long past.

4
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,682
Check.

5
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,854
Check!

6
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,650
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,818
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,285
Do not advance!

9
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,788
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,957
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,392
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,562
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,641
Oh, God.

14
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,968
Go.

15
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,795
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,731
Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

17
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:50,998
Leave a message.

18
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,299
Hey, Jamie.

19
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,301
Are you there?

20
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,803
Just wondering,
are you and Sukie

21
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,872
-going to shot night tonight?
-Oh, my God!

22
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,041
I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.

23
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,374
Maybe Carla's going.

24
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,744
Do you know if Carla's going?

25
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:03,845
Are you going?

26
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,948
Anyway, call me if you would.

27
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,448
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,817
Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.

29
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,686
Miss you, friend. It's Marian.

30
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,824
Hey. Marian.

31
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,559
Hi, Bart.

32
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,028
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,897
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,565
What?

35
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,333
Phish concert.

36
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,636
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,038
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,039
P-H.

39
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,341
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,977
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,780
-Y-You know, I just meant...
-Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,982
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,984
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,384
That's fine.

45
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,353
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,355
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,323
-What expression?
-"Anyhoo."

48
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,593
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,394
What is it?

50
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,898
A word.

51
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,866
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,502
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:02,970
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,539
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,406
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,842
It's very good.

57
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,944
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,312
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:15,348
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,787
People don't usually call them
"engagements."

61
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,455
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,759
Yes.

63
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,694
The fact remains.

64
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,829
The engagement.

65
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,564
That's right.

66
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,054
Oh, my.

67
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,889
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,091
My God!

69
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,398
Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

70
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,835
Leave a message.

71
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,004
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,772
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,107
During sex?

74
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,977
-Hi, Sukie.
-Wow.

75
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,781
-Who? Here?
-Yes, there.

76
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,450
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,153
-I was just masturbating.
-Uh-huh.

78
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,521
Me... me time.

79
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,592
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,804
No.

81
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,472
-What?
-No.

82
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,508
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,010
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,146
-I just came from work.
-I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,446
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,716
-Is Jamie here?
-Okay, look.

87
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,919
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,654
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,488
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,890
Why else would you be here?

91
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,525
To socialize.

92
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,027
Hello, girls.

93
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,165
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,134
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,202
Why not 2K?

96
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,206
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:25,146
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,714
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,050
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,686
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,056
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,725
So, first lick...

103
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,162
Here.

104
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:44,765
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,700
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,234
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,103
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,540
-And then second lick...
-Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,608
Ooh! Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,244
Here.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,082
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,851
-And then third lick...
-Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,619
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,121
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,023
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,257
Here.

117
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,627
She's a free spirit.

118
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,129
I admire her.

119
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,731
Free. Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,266
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,668
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:25,773
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,243
Pull that out!

124
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,645
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,948
-Somebody's gonna get hit.
-Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,286
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,822
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,758
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,093
20th-- soon-to-be 21st--
century lesbian.

130
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,029
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,698
-This right here is
what it gets you. -Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,566
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,868
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,302
move my shit out of Sukie's
tomorrow...

135
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,303
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,005
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,874
What problems?

138
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,275
Internal.

139
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,077
-Internal?
-Yes.

140
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,712
I don't know how else to put it.

141
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,914
Problems with what I feel
internally.

142
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,816
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,851
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,954
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:17,992
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,828
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,998
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,801
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,070
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,671
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,207
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,876
-and then we two...
-I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,611
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,679
Where are you going?

155
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,347
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,383
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,151
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,020
Can't she move?

159
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,888
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,890
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,692
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,728
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,931
There's good birding.

164
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,632
Birding?

165
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,234
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,969
It's very pleasant.

167
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,738
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,874
I've been unhappy,

169
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,076
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,744
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,380
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,116
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,017
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,220
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,889
We get our shit together,
together.

176
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,724
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,160
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,428
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,430
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,165
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,733
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,268
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,903
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,005
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,741
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,043
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:46,046
I'll wear my great big old
straw hat,

188
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,016
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,885
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,720
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,055
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,690
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,758
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,293
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,728
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,363
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,965
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,034
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,769
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,771
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,940
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,442
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,444
You said she wouldn't be here.

204
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,981
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,216
That was a gift.

206
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,884
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:28,322
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,025
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,293
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,094
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,829
I never liked her.

212
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,798
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,934
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,335
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:45,406
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,509
It's your dildo, Susanne.

217
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,012
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,480
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,015
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,750
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

221
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,786
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,354
Yeah, you have something
to write this down?

223
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,957
-Yes, I'm writing it down.
-To 14 Tinywick Road.

224
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,325
-Right.
-Tallahassee.

225
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,793
-Sure.
-You got it?

226
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,194
-Right. Got it.
-Can you help us?

227
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,830
And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.

228
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,498
-By tomorrow.
-No later.

229
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,234
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

230
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,169
-Okay.
-Over and out.

231
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,240
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:22,109
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,444
A reference?

234
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,513
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,481
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,250
His balls.

237
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,985
Can the reference be a woman?

238
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,120
We don't know a lot of men.

239
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,421
No kidding.

240
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,057
-Where do you want to go?
-Tallahassee.

241
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,960
Tallahassee?

242
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,396
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

243
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,998
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

244
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,266
I think Curlie here...

245
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,900
Don't call me Curlie.

246
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,837
Isn't your name Curlie?

247
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,938
My name is Curlie.

248
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,574
We just met. It's too familiar.

249
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,842
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

250
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,076
No, I got good sense.

251
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,912
-Your car is a Dodge Aries.
-Oh.

252
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,348
Okay. Is that a good car?

253
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,050
Not really.

254
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,887
You sell those shirts?

255
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,556
There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

256
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,891
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

257
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,860
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

258
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,061
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

259
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,496
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

260
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,964
-but it's just...
-Jamie.

261
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,299
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

262
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,833
Down and across.

263
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,302
Right here's
the world's largest Dixie cup

264
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,570
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

265
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,338
Direct route, down and across.

266
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,074
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

267
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,910
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

268
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,212
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

269
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,616
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

270
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,150
The interstate is not life.

271
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,585
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

272
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,186
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.

273
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,054
That's nature.

274
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,922
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

275
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,390
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

276
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,925
He said it was a rush job.

277
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,226
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

278
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,328
Tomorrow can wait a day.

279
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,929
We could even go to Miami.

280
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,331
Bikinis and high heels.

281
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,134
A medical doctor?

282
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,302
Or a reverend?

283
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:59,607
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

284
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,909
No, not for medical doctors,
either.

285
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,611
Make up your mind--
which are you?

286
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:06,313
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

287
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,883
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

288
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,186
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

289
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,889
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

290
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,326
Well, we're here.

291
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,995
Okay. Who are you?

292
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,499
-The car.
-The car?

293
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,267
The Dodge Aries.

294
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,403
The Dodge Aries?

295
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,672
What are you, a mynah bird?

296
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,005
I'm Curlie.

297
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,907
I understand that.

298
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,476
You're not the Dodge.

299
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,514
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

300
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,023
What's the big deal?

301
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,693
The car isn't ours.

302
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,461
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

303
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:56,029
And once we get to Tallahassee,

304
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,532
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

305
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,500
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

306
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,201
-soap and water.
-It won't.

307
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,237
-Won't what?
-Come off with soap and water.

308
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,573
-Well, how do you know?
-I tried.

309
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,642
Marian, it's art.

310
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,076
Stop saying it's art.

311
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,645
That doesn't end all discussion.

312
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,146
We're gonna be driving through

313
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,014
some conservative towns--
the South.

314
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,683
-The Bible Belt.
-Mm, don't I know it.

315
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,685
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

316
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,453
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

317
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,689
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

318
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,224
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

319
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,728
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

320
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,095
My project.

321
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,130
What's your project?

322
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,934
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

323
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,236
How long's it been?

324
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,073
Weeks?

325
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,678
Months?

326
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,446
Oh, my God, Marian.

327
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,715
Don't tell me it's been years.

328
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,050
H-How many years? Who was it?

329
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,152
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

330
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:53,621
Donna.

331
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,255
Yeah, Donna.

332
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,394
Oh, my God.

333
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,963
Oh, my God. Donna?

334
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,499
She work for Al Gore now?

335
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,000
Nader.

336
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,504
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

337
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,073
Wait a minute.

338
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,477
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

339
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,747
Yes, I did.

340
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,183
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

341
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,752
and then these broads come in

342
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,154
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

343
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,223
You gave them the car.

344
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,024
You don't know who they were?

345
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,627
I told you their names.

346
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,127
Their names, yes, but...

347
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,797
This place is a dump.

348
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,265
They drive the car
instead of you.

349
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,233
Is that bad?

350
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,668
Bad if they find the goods.

351
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,237
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

352
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,739
I like clutter.

353
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,240
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

354
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,374
Sterile doesn't work for me.

355
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,142
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

356
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,612
-Dick-yank?
-Flint.

357
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:51,779
I'm a dick-yank?

358
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,280
Don't antagonize.

359
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,682
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

360
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,751
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

361
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,418
And you would?

362
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,722
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

363
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,591
Not per se.

364
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,192
"Per se"?!

365
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,695
They left a local number.

366
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,665
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

367
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,466
Someone whose balls I can break.

368
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,039
Now you've gone and done it.

369
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:26,781
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

370
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:32,452
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

371
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,188
Tomorrow.

372
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,127
This is great.

373
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,429
This is so slutty. I love this.

374
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,165
-Hope they have postcards.
-Uh, Jamie?

375
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,100
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

376
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,268
The Butter Churn awaits.

377
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,571
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

378
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,573
No. No, don't even.

379
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,807
You come with me.

380
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,609
I'll show you how this is done.

381
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,587
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

382
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,220
It's a dyke bar.

383
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,424
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

384
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,360
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

385
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,395
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

386
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,498
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

387
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,536
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

388
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,240
Hello?

389
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,381
Confidence.

390
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,217
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

391
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,353
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

392
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,321
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

393
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,924
Jamie, I have done this before.

394
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,626
It's just like this.

395
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,193
One message.

396
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,696
You dig the female body.

397
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,897
Your body.

398
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,165
You're like this.

399
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:55,770
Not like this.

400
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,572
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

401
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:58,906
I have done this before.

402
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,407
I am not a schoolmarm.

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,909
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

404
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,845
-Not only.
-Only in the last four years.

405
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,613
Three years.

406
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,482
And four months and 14 days.

407
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,488
Okay.

408
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,825
You feeling your body?

409
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,694
Very much so.

410
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,428
Okay.

411
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,364
Who looks good to you?

412
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,871
They all look fine.

413
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:31,271
Fine?

414
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,540
Like, "You'll do"?

415
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,875
"Please, please come home
with me, baby.

416
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,543
"You seem totally okay.

417
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,444
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

418
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,279
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

419
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,548
I said they all looked fine.

420
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,383
Yeah, but not in the sense
of "super fine."

421
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:46,253
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

422
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,221
Why are you jousting with me?

423
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,490
I'm not jousting.

424
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:51,826
I'm asking which of these women

425
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,460
you want to throw up
against the wall

426
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,295
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

427
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,297
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

428
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,000
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

429
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,601
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

430
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:03,236
I'm just trying
to get you laid, sugar sweet.

431
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,272
They sense it,
whether you want to fuck them

432
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,841
or you think they're just fine.

433
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,375
I have to be me.

434
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,410
It has to be done
with authenticity.

435
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,446
-You mean with authority.
-I mean with authenticity.

436
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,982
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

437
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,751
You don't know
what our life was like.

438
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,019
You know nothing
about its worth.

439
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,654
Then why didn't
the two of you move

440
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,723
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

441
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:22,990
That didn't happen.

442
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,959
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

443
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,594
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

444
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:27,729
No, I'm not.

445
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,262
This is not me.

446
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,798
You're right. I can't do this.

447
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,700
No, Marian.

448
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:36,604
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

449
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,305
You can do this.

450
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,774
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

451
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,008
Your best self.

452
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,643
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

453
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,444
but this really isn't
right for me.

454
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:47,380
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

455
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:51,919
"On the town"?

456
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,598
Here we go.

457
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:04,999
Right here. Look.

458
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,466
Hold it. Better.

459
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,636
Great. Turn.

460
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,806
Oh.

461
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,675
Hello.

462
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,277
Good evening.

463
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,615
I'm Amber.

464
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,517
Marian.

465
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,521
What you reading?

466
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,991
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

467
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,727
Wow. Thick one.

468
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,697
Hello, Marian.

469
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,399
Hello.

470
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:43,671
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

471
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,739
No.

472
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:46,674
No, no.

473
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:48,910
-No.
-Oh. Okay.

474
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,444
Rats.

475
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,616
Well...

476
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,519
I'll just...

477
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,507
How was it?

478
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,010
Bouncy.

479
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,682
How's your book?

480
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:36,918
Good.

481
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,886
It's about two free spirits

482
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,855
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

483
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:44,692
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

484
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:47,161
That is why we are going
the other way.

485
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,663
Although there was
this one chick

486
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,197
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

487
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,933
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

488
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,068
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

489
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,736
No, I'm not kidding.

490
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,672
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

491
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,240
in India supposedly
who can do that.

492
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,242
Black belts in cunnilingus.

493
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,811
They can even
cunniling themselves.

494
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:06,080
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

495
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,480
You got to ask the librarian.

496
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,216
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

497
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,985
Who wrote your book?

498
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,020
Henry James.

499
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,555
Henry James...

500
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,724
American writer.

501
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,893
Famous family. His brother, too.

502
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:19,994
Rick?

503
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,530
No, I'm kidding.

504
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,198
I know who Henry James is.

505
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,766
White and uptight.

506
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:30,071
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

507
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:31,973
Boy, that was a great read.

508
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:35,109
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

509
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,812
That's a very apt simile.

510
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:40,581
-His prose is labyrinthine.
-Yeah.

511
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,616
Put me off the whole book thing.

512
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,586
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

513
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,887
-Uh-huh.
-Except road signs.

514
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,222
Uh-huh, yeah.
I don't think you should've

515
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,557
brought someone
back to the room.

516
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,259
Okay.

517
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:53,728
I knew this was coming.

518
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,262
How do you think I felt?

519
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,998
You told me to have
a night on the town.

520
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:59,300
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

521
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,235
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

522
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,870
We operate on a handshake basis.

523
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:04,772
-What does that mean?
-"Hiya. How you doing?

524
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,273
"How much for that Cadillac car?

525
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:08,142
How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

526
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,777
-Okay.
-Where you from, girl?

527
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,145
-Not Texas.
-I know that.

528
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,214
-Well, then why'd you ask?
-I...

529
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,019
I don't know. I'm...

530
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,091
Sorry.

531
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,200
No. I'm sorry.

532
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:34,769
Why are you sorry?

533
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:37,271
You're good. I'm a little...

534
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,773
No, I'm a big baby sometimes.

535
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:41,776
Uncle Gino's!

536
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,546
You are not going
to believe this.

537
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,115
See over there?

538
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:49,617
UNG soccer team.

539
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,918
Uh-huh.

540
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,953
I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

541
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,188
Uh-huh.

542
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,689
They're very committed lesbians,

543
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:57,124
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

544
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:58,826
which is practically on our way.

545
00:25:58,859 --> 00:25:59,794
Not exactly.

546
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,662
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

547
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:02,963
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

548
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:04,999
Forget the map.
After today's game,

549
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,201
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

550
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,702
And guess who's invited.

551
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:10,037
I'm sure you are.

552
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,206
Nuh-uh.

553
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,941
Us.

554
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:14,842
You see?

555
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,678
Shit happens when you eat
at Uncle Gino's.

556
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,082
Goal! Goal!

557
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,725
Hello?

558
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:07,027
Well,
here I am, my thumb up my ass.

559
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:09,396
-They didn't.
-No.

560
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,665
That's all right.
We've got a plan B.

561
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:12,867
Another way to get them back?

562
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,902
Yes, sir.

563
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,239
-I'm not gonna wait forever.
-Yes, sir.

564
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,406
I understand that, sir.

565
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,875
You do understand?

566
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,943
-You got my word on it.
-Your word.

567
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,846
Let me just...

568
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,016
No-show.

569
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,736
Rotate right.

570
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,354
Um...

571
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,755
Ca-Can we, um...

572
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,357
See, actually,
we're just friends.

573
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,506
Come on, Marian.

574
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,110
It's no big deal.

575
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,479
-Susanne Shinkleman?
-Susanne Shinkleman.

576
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,180
Who the fuck are you?

577
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,349
Since when do women
curse like that?

578
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:45,886
You know Jamie Dobbs?

579
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,556
-Do you know Jamie Dobbs?
-You guttersnipe.

580
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,191
Should've known
it was about that cunt!

581
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,927
And Marian Pallavi?

582
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:57,031
You-you shouldn't do that.

583
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,199
He can't fight back.
He can't hit a girl.

584
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,568
He's old-school.

585
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,170
We just want to locate
your friends.

586
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,439
They inadvertently took
something that belongs to us.

587
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,542
-We don't want to hurt them.
-They're not my friends.

588
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,143
Hurt 'em as much as you want.

589
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:10,878
Okay.

590
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,247
It would be helpful
if you had a picture.

591
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,151
Picture? Yeah.

592
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:24,825
Got a picture of one of 'em.

593
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:35,369
If you find 'em, give it to her.

594
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:37,037
Okay.

595
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:39,273
Will do.

596
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,487
If you bring someone back,
just...

597
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,122
I'll take my book to the office.

598
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,260
I still have
a couple of chapters left.

599
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:03,964
Marian.

600
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,368
We don't yet know exactly
where they are,

601
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,136
but we do know who they are.

602
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,971
We've got a picture of one of
the girls. We're all set to...

603
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:12,574
Oh,
who gives a shit who they are?

604
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:13,941
I want the package.

605
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,242
We will find and deliver
the package.

606
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,244
-Under control.
-I am unhappy.

607
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:19,346
I understand that
you are unhappy, sir.

608
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,648
Damn right I am.

609
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,584
I've got my two best men
on the...

610
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,258
All right.

611
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,160
Get some coffee.

612
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,996
You two are gonna be
driving all night.

613
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,182
Where you headed, miss?

614
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,983
Home.

615
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,386
And where's that?

616
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,288
Some motel. I don't know.

617
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:36,056
You don't know?

618
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,025
I can't remember the name.

619
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,060
A motel on the highway.

620
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,495
And where you coming from?

621
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,697
A house.

622
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,364
Whose house?

623
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,567
I don't know.

624
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,334
It was a slumber party.

625
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:51,271
Little old for slumber parties,
aren't you, miss?

626
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,008
Look, mister...

627
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:16,263
You know what?

628
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:19,601
I'm gonna drop you off at home.

629
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,736
Aw.

630
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:56,524
Hey, handsome.

631
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,823
Hey, handsome.

632
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,792
Want to get plastered?

633
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,430
I'll drive when it's my turn.

634
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:38,432
At the end of three hours.

635
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,535
I have no sympathy for you,
my friend.

636
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:42,637
You could've just asked her,
and you'd be fine right now.

637
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,839
I just asked. She answered.

638
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,641
But you cannot relate
to the public,

639
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,976
which, in a service profession,
is a big fucking handicap.

640
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,477
And that sound

641
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,979
is beginning to get irritating.

642
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,581
Well, your lectures
are getting irritating.

643
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,817
I don't lecture, my friend.
That's my point.

644
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,318
I take people in. I react.

645
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,454
I read people
to get what I want.

646
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,489
You, though,
you think life is this

647
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:04,692
orderly series of people
to beat the shit out of.

648
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,861
Well, real life
is not like that.

649
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,329
You only see it that way
because you're not nourished

650
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:12,466
by human contact, the human
give-and-take, so forth.

651
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,468
Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

652
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:15,870
That's what you're
comfortable with.

653
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,437
-Yeah, yeah.
-Caveman shit.

654
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,740
You don't engage
the whole person.

655
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,875
Well, you did a great job
helping me engage

656
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:24,011
that very agile harpy.

657
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,613
Didn't have to.

658
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,715
No need whatsoever
for the physical approach,

659
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,951
which you couldn't see
because you don't savor

660
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,552
the stuff of life.

661
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm not a sissy boy,
if that's what you mean.

662
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,523
Kiss my ass. I...

663
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,326
-Hello?
-Okay, we're on track.

664
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,328
Marian Pallavi was picked up
for vagrancy

665
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,631
last night in Marietta, Georgia.

666
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,767
-Just north of Atlanta.
-On it.

667
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,503
Georgia.

668
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,618
Thank you.

669
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:05,385
For what?

670
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,522
Just picking me up.

671
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,557
Am I not gonna pick you up?

672
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,525
Hard not to.

673
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:12,093
"Ma'am, your friend here
is in the hoosegow.

674
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,493
Care to come get her?"

675
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,328
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

676
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,064
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

677
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,399
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

678
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,570
And so I say thank you.

679
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:30,545
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

680
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:33,047
and I've been careful
not to ask,

681
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,583
but damn, Marian,

682
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:39,053
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

683
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,055
I think it was jail, not prison.

684
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,657
Oh. I'm sorry.

685
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,959
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

686
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,828
It wasn't hell-raising.

687
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,830
Sorry to disappoint.

688
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:51,566
A policeman didn't like my tone.

689
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,800
Oh.

690
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,368
You copped some attitude.

691
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:57,772
I don't have attitude.

692
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:01,408
Marian, if I may,

693
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,611
there are certain things in life

694
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:06,479
which you got to sense
and understand

695
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,583
in order to live life,

696
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:11,619
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

697
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:13,855
well, all these
funny little creatures

698
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,456
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

699
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,726
we call 'em human beings.

700
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,895
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

701
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,697
And your whole social situation,

702
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,765
you got to understand
what that is.

703
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:25,867
Uh-huh.

704
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,001
You know what that means?

705
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,468
"Social situation"?

706
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,403
I know what
"social situation" means.

707
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,639
Okay, good.

708
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,574
So, the whole thing
with a cop is--

709
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,743
and you should remember this
for future reference--

710
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:39,146
when you're in
a social situation with a cop,

711
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,414
there ain't no social situation.

712
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,684
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

713
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:46,419
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

714
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,155
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

715
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,724
for two years now, and...

716
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:51,491
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

717
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:53,961
Thank you. I understand.

718
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:56,097
But if authority
is being abused,

719
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,767
-there's an obligation to...
-Holy shit.

720
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,669
Florida.

721
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:07,642
Lesbian...

722
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:12,513
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

723
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,936
You okay?

724
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,904
Spare tire.

725
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:52,920
What?

726
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,725
Something burning?

727
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,743
Jamie, it's cold.

728
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:19,613
Don't touch it.

729
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,817
I saw this movie once where

730
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,519
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

731
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:26,887
and they opened the box,

732
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:30,758
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

733
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:47,875
Head!

734
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,153
No, I'm kidding.

735
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:01,889
It was a minor traffic accident.

736
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,290
Fast stop.

737
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,694
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

738
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:08,829
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

739
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,767
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

740
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,836
That's right.

741
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,739
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

742
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,042
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

743
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:23,277
Just drove off
with something we need.

744
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,945
Didn't even know they had it.

745
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,882
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

746
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,152
Just making out.

747
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,054
Oh, yeah?

748
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,789
With who?

749
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,926
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

750
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:44,065
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

751
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:45,833
sample case back.

752
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,702
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

753
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,337
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

754
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,907
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

755
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,176
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

756
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:01,315
No, no.

757
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:02,950
We should just call the cops.

758
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,218
We will, Jamie.

759
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:07,054
First, we should see
what's in here.

760
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,889
Why? I don't want to look.

761
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:10,925
-Why do I have to look?
-Jamie, listen.

762
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,327
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

763
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,929
This might tell us who they are,

764
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:16,897
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

765
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:19,200
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

766
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:20,968
Protect us?

767
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:23,304
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

768
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:25,606
What do we lose by looking?

769
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,808
Look.

770
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,945
I just want to know
what's going on.

771
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,948
This might tell us.

772
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,684
I bet it's locked.

773
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,977
-We got to call the cops.
-Why?

774
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,078
That was awful.

775
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:06,046
You just said
not to call the cops.

776
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,748
In ignorance.

777
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,049
No, what you said was true.

778
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,885
The cops could think
you're involved.

779
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,353
You just spent
the night in jail.

780
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,854
For vagrancy.

781
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:16,190
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

782
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:17,458
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

783
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:18,859
Here's what we do.

784
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:20,895
First, we get to Tallahassee.

785
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:22,263
Bye!

786
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:26,800
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

787
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,235
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

788
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,237
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

789
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:31,972
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

790
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,340
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

791
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:34,808
the address
where they're headed?

792
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,977
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

793
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:38,913
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

794
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,948
Bye!

795
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,787
Welcome to El Conquistador.

796
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,223
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

797
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,792
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

798
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:54,261
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

799
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:55,796
You take the Rainbow Card?

800
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,231
Uh, I'm sure we do.

801
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,266
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

802
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,168
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

803
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:02,803
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

804
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:04,238
You do that, right?

805
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:06,073
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

806
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,509
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

807
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:09,210
for sensitive materials?

808
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:10,512
We do have in-room safes

809
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:12,012
for any valuables
that you may have.

810
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,348
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

811
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,217
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

812
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,118
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

813
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:19,353
Do you have ice?

814
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:30,164
This is it?

815
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:34,101
They said Farm Road 80.

816
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,537
What's the matter?

817
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,838
Afraid of the stuff of life?

818
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:03,130
Is this, um... Slappy's?

819
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:04,932
That's right.

820
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:11,506
Have you seen two, um,
nonlocal women come in here?

821
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,107
That's one of them.

822
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:16,010
I was sittin' here listening

823
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:17,411
to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

824
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:21,215
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

825
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:24,318
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

826
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:29,423
Now, that's true.

827
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,358
Love will bite your ass.

828
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,304
Oh, I can send Sukie.

829
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,939
But why would these people
just be waiting there

830
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:47,408
in the drive-away office?

831
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:48,610
Well, clearly, this was not

832
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:50,344
your garden-variety
decapitation.

833
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,945
This was some kind of a...

834
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,881
Well, I don't know what it was,

835
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:56,450
but they know
we have their stuff.

836
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:57,885
Yeah?

837
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:00,354
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

838
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:03,090
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

839
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:05,059
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

840
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:08,028
But why would we get
in touch with them?

841
00:47:08,062 --> 00:47:10,064
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

842
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:12,600
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

843
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,068
Jamie.

844
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,637
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

845
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,871
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

846
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,173
She hates you.

847
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:22,209
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

848
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:24,378
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

849
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:27,881
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

850
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:30,217
Attorney? Are you a college boy?

851
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,487
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

852
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:35,623
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

853
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:37,358
I'm running booking, jackass.

854
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,493
-He said...
-You want me to walk over there

855
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,161
and kick your number-running ass

856
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,364
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

857
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:46,233
Who's running booking?

858
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,669
-You are.
-Who is?

859
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,970
-You are.
-No fucking shit!

860
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:51,506
-Shink!
-Yeah.

861
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,273
Telephone.

862
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:55,610
Sergeant Shinkleman.

863
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:57,579
Hey. It's me.

864
00:47:57,612 --> 00:47:59,313
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

865
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,583
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

866
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:04,184
-Did the two creeps find you?
-What?

867
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,687
The two weirdos looking for you.

868
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,388
I tried to be helpful.

869
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,424
-Uh, but who were they?
-How should I know?

870
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:12,192
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

871
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:14,094
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

872
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:16,997
-George and Lennie.
-George and Lennie?

873
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:20,668
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

874
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:22,403
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

875
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:24,271
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

876
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:26,674
"Break a big murder case"?

877
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,544
Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.

878
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,378
-Curlie's Drive-Away?
-Yeah.

879
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:34,181
And you ask Curlie about...

880
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

881
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:39,554
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

882
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:42,089
You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.

883
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:43,424
Jamie, that is about

884
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:46,293
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

885
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:48,429
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

886
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,963
I guarantee you someone's there.

887
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:52,433
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

888
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,968
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

889
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:56,671
I'll take Alice.

890
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,338
Really? Swear?

891
00:48:58,372 --> 00:49:00,708
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

892
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:03,343
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

893
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:06,413
A juke joint where?

894
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,449
Wetumpka, Alabama.

895
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:10,184
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

896
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:11,351
They hadn't been there,

897
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:14,722
but a very personable
music lover

898
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,591
told us of another juke joint

899
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,392
-fairly close by called...
-You see?

900
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:19,527
Stop!

901
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:21,395
Called Ike's.

902
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,398
Maybe he said "Mike's."

903
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,033
Maybe he said "Mike."

904
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,168
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

905
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,070
I think the soccer team
was just confused

906
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,072
about which joint
these girls were going to,

907
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:33,541
so we're gonna drive...

908
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,276
Stop saying words.

909
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,012
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

910
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,481
They arrived in Tallahassee

911
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:44,151
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

912
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:46,186
Tallahassee.

913
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,755
I want you to get
your asses over there

914
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:50,090
and take care of it right away.

915
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:51,626
Not a juke joint.

916
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,160
You should arrive
by early morning.

917
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,261
I'll meet you there.

918
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:56,497
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

919
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:58,465
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

920
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,568
We have not slept
since the night before last,

921
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:02,504
and we...

922
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:04,204
Hello?

923
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,542
-Chief?
-Who's in Tallahassee?

924
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,110
Certainly.

925
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,045
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

926
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,380
or right here at the hotel,

927
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:16,049
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

928
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,519
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

929
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:20,588
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

930
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,123
Maybe we should stay here.

931
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:24,592
Replenish the ice.

932
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:31,231
This is great, but how...

933
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,601
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

934
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:37,304
Rainbow.

935
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:38,205
Yes.

936
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,775
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

937
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,544
Like, a really, really good one?

938
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:43,645
Of course.

939
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:47,682
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

940
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,349
Theoretically.

941
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:59,126
So...

942
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:04,331
I've been thinking
about it, and...

943
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,169
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

944
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:12,574
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

945
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:15,475
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

946
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,478
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

947
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,615
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

948
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:23,518
but I usually have stuff to do.

949
00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:26,153
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

950
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:28,690
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

951
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:33,193
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

952
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,228
Something I decided

953
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,598
last night
while I was lying in bed

954
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:39,601
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

955
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:43,838
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

956
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,405
Especially since, with you,

957
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,474
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

958
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,643
Am I right?

959
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,145
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

960
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:55,415
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Madame?

961
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,618
Yes, please.

962
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,753
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

963
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:00,420
I mean, we're good friends,

964
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,422
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

965
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,891
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

966
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:07,461
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

967
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:10,430
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

968
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,634
-You never have sex.
-Exactly.

969
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:14,569
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

970
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:17,270
She was always saying
that this or that

971
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,940
-would be inappropriate.
-Uh-huh.

972
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,610
But when I finally
got her to relax,

973
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:24,311
the sex was great.

974
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,279
Ladies, have we decided?

975
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,585
Don't rush us, buddy.

976
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:34,555
First, we'll dance.

977
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,570
Maybe I do overthink things.

978
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:52,406
Yeah.

979
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:56,443
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

980
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:03,584
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

981
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,485
Ah, you know Debbie.

982
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,555
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

983
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,557
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

984
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,492
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

985
00:53:12,527 --> 00:53:14,529
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

986
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:17,230
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

987
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,738
One accomplishment.

988
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:13,473
Huh? Name me one.

989
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:16,010
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

990
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,879
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

991
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:21,816
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

992
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,483
on a creaky porch swing

993
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,186
on a warm summer evening--
crickets, so forth?

994
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:28,488
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

995
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:30,157
trousers around your ankles,

996
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,693
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

997
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:35,495
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

998
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,497
Yes, people might stroll by

999
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:38,966
and see you looking foolish
up there

1000
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,500
slapping ham on the veranda,

1001
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:43,504
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1002
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:46,107
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1003
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,643
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1004
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:51,679
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1005
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:53,180
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1006
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:55,482
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1007
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:57,184
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1008
00:56:57,218 --> 00:56:58,953
that I've been carrying
on my back

1009
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:01,421
all the way from Philadelphia!

1010
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:21,042
Help.

1011
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:31,619
"Big case."

1012
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,955
That woman.

1013
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,194
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1014
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,984
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1015
00:58:03,017 --> 00:58:04,752
Yes, sir.

1016
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:28,669
Honey, we eating soon?

1017
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:30,604
Okay.

1018
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:34,775
Oh. All right.

1019
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:08,375
Jamie?

1020
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:13,614
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1021
01:00:15,382 --> 01:00:17,618
Jamie, no!

1022
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,161
Jamie, why?

1023
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,869
Oh, my God.

1024
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,203
Marian.

1025
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:39,073
Sir?

1026
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,774
-Sir.
-Hmm?

1027
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,777
Tallahassee, sir.

1028
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:46,380
Where to, exactly?

1029
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:48,782
Yes, um...

1030
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,684
The track.

1031
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:52,753
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1032
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,388
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1033
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:55,956
Oh, come on now.

1034
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,826
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1035
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,761
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1036
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:03,063
No. I like this one.

1037
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,433
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1038
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:07,902
Last night was beautiful,

1039
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,870
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1040
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:11,772
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1041
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,440
-Okay!
-All right!

1042
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,143
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1043
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,912
We're here for two things.

1044
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,714
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1045
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:21,982
Screw you!

1046
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,451
We're here for two items.

1047
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:25,953
Whoa. She's naked.

1048
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:28,189
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1049
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,823
We're here for two items.

1050
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:31,892
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1051
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,994
-And the head box.
-Head box!

1052
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:35,996
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1053
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,898
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1054
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:39,900
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1055
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:42,436
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1056
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,805
Let's get this show on the road.

1057
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,742
Yeah, baby.

1058
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:53,280
You're such a big, bouncy,

1059
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,984
beautiful baby.

1060
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,087
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1061
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,190
Whoa.

1062
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,793
This is so groovy.

1063
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:08,495
Now I can love you forever.

1064
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,231
Whoa.

1065
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:12,433
And ever

1066
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:16,237
and ever and ever

1067
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:21,308
-and ever and ever.
-And ever and ever.

1068
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:25,879
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1069
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:29,984
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1070
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:34,522
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1071
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:38,926
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1072
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,530
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1073
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:46,267
Never to wilt...

1074
01:02:50,304 --> 01:02:51,506
Took 'em straight here.

1075
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:52,973
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1076
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:55,075
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1077
01:02:58,546 --> 01:03:00,281
This is all they had?

1078
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:02,082
What's all they had?

1079
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:07,589
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1080
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,857
What are you talking about?

1081
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,026
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1082
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,428
-Not in the...
-Well, that just figures.

1083
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,330
Come on, girls.

1084
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:17,965
Where's the last phallus?

1085
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,337
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1086
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,039
I-I...

1087
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,007
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1088
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,909
What have you done, jerk-off?

1089
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:30,844
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1090
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,179
They gave you the combination,

1091
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,181
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1092
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,949
-I never slip up.
-Right, left,

1093
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,851
past the first number.

1094
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:54,134
The senator is a good man.

1095
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:57,938
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1096
01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,239
Many of us did.

1097
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:01,609
It was a different time.

1098
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:04,912
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1099
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:07,381
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1100
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:14,656
Housekeeping.

1101
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:21,128
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1102
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,164
...thing.

1103
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:29,370
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1104
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:34,509
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1105
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:37,911
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1106
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:40,414
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1107
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,618
He was just a kid.

1108
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:51,091
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1109
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,160
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1110
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:56,096
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1111
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,466
You saw him, sort of.

1112
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:17,585
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1113
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:20,320
Think of it: eBay,

1114
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:24,559
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1115
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:27,127
Comments, reviews.

1116
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,597
Think of what
it would do to him.

1117
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:34,001
His children, his family,
his career.

1118
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:39,707
We're not unreasonable.

1119
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,443
We'll gladly pay for it.

1120
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:43,711
We just...

1121
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:45,680
Will you please shut up!

1122
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:47,014
That wasn't my idea!

1123
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,550
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1124
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,617
I was experimenting.

1125
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:51,051
But you liked it.

1126
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,352
-No, I didn't!
-I could tell.

1127
01:05:52,386 --> 01:05:54,054
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1128
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,355
Drunk on cock.

1129
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:57,024
-No! I didn't.
-It's not my thing.

1130
01:05:57,057 --> 01:05:58,760
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1131
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,695
-To understand life.
-No!

1132
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,363
-The stuff of life!
-No, no, no!

1133
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:09,002
God, man, what are you doing?!

1134
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,437
Mommy.

1135
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,127
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1136
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,530
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1137
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:10,130
Then we switch hotels.

1138
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:11,833
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1139
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,367
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1140
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,670
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1141
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,138
-Where are you going?
-Art store.

1142
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:27,347
Next customer, please.

1143
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:30,384
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1144
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,786
Don't ask me why.

1145
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,423
Committee to Reelect.

1146
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:38,325
I need to speak to the senator.

1147
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:41,763
Well, who should I say
is calling?

1148
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:44,298
Someone who has his...

1149
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,068
...personal effects.

1150
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:21,401
Who is this?

1151
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,670
Senator?

1152
01:08:22,704 --> 01:08:25,205
Yes. Who is this?

1153
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,275
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1154
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:31,613
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1155
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:33,313
Everybody's things.

1156
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,917
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1157
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,151
If you're not alone,

1158
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:40,187
believe me, I'll know it.

1159
01:08:49,597 --> 01:08:50,932
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1160
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:52,867
made a phone call
from here last night.

1161
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,301
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1162
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:57,639
Well, this is for her.

1163
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:58,773
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1164
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,374
You've missed them.

1165
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:03,276
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1166
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,699
Done.

1167
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,802
With what?

1168
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,203
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1169
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:32,674
Want to join me?

1170
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,538
Jamie.

1171
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:07,441
I want...

1172
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:08,776
Uh-huh?

1173
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,846
I... I-I want...

1174
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:14,481
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1175
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,886
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

1176
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:41,702
Who are you?

1177
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:44,705
Democrats.

1178
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,373
Mind if we sit down?

1179
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:56,083
Are they all there?

1180
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:01,622
Count 'em.

1181
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:20,875
We didn't deserve this...

1182
01:12:20,908 --> 01:12:22,944
this commodification.

1183
01:12:24,846 --> 01:12:26,581
These are all good people.

1184
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:29,617
Important people, too,
some of them.

1185
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:34,555
There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.

1186
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:38,593
The owner of
a large-market football team.

1187
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:42,362
A Supreme Court justice.

1188
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:49,170
You little people
titillate yourselves

1189
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,806
with something
that was never meant for you,

1190
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:56,010
trafficking in
other people's attainments.

1191
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:57,678
Senator, save the sanctimony.

1192
01:12:57,712 --> 01:13:00,748
And hand over
the million smackers.

1193
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,820
I used to believe in
the unfettered free market.

1194
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:13,594
I don't know.

1195
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:19,567
Whose head, Senator?

1196
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,838
Don't get lofty with me, women.

1197
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,442
Did we do the wrong thing?

1198
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,013
What if he's the next president?

1199
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,782
You girls are cute.

1200
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:37,952
My friends and me are having
a little basement party later.

1201
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:39,553
You want to join?

1202
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:49,964
Not tonight.

1203
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:54,802
Sukie?

1204
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:58,005
There you are. So what was that
crackhead phone call about?

1205
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:00,007
Wha-What do you mean?
How'd you know I'd be here?

1206
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,510
How many dyke bars are there
in Tallahassee?

1207
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:04,712
What, are you an executive now?

1208
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:06,247
Did they, uh, make you
the president

1209
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,049
of Little Miss Liar Pants, Inc.?

1210
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:11,052
Oh, this? No, I just, uh...

1211
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:24,765
'Cause we thought
they didn't know where we were,

1212
01:14:24,799 --> 01:14:26,534
but somehow they did,
and this morning,

1213
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:28,202
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1214
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:29,870
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1215
01:14:29,904 --> 01:14:31,772
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1216
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:33,607
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1217
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:36,877
Well, you've had a full day.

1218
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:42,016
She's yours now.

1219
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,020
Hang on. This doesn't look good.

1220
01:15:03,104 --> 01:15:04,872
Motherfucker.

1221
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:15,750
What's she chasing?

1222
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,651
Yeah.

1223
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:18,953
We forgot to tell you about

1224
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:21,155
the suave guy's head
in the hatbox.

1225
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:31,599
Boy, I think
I could win against him.

1226
01:15:31,632 --> 01:15:33,601
And now we get to just
keep on going.

1227
01:15:33,634 --> 01:15:35,936
Who's gonna complain
if we keep the car?

1228
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,205
Things could not have
worked out better.

1229
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,175
Well, I guess.

1230
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:42,910
What's wrong?

1231
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:46,947
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1232
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:49,283
but I have to admit,

1233
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:51,185
I'll miss his...

1234
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:53,020
No worries, girl.

1235
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,089
I made a cast.

1236
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,824
And two copies.

1237
01:15:58,392 --> 01:15:59,960
Great.

1238
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,662
But why two?

1239
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:03,097
For each other.

1240
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,266
Ladies, your visitor is here.

1241
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:07,301
Can we get our car?

1242
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:10,871
You know, hers and hers.

1243
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:15,910
Aunt Ellis.

1244
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:18,679
Oh, hello, darling.

1245
01:16:18,712 --> 01:16:20,214
-She's your aunt?
-Uh-huh.

1246
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:21,682
Uncle John met her in church.

1247
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:23,350
Watch what you say.
She's very religious.

1248
01:16:23,384 --> 01:16:25,753
So good to see you.

1249
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,089
This is my friend Jamie.

1250
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:29,356
Oh, how are you, young lady?

1251
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,958
This your first time
in Tallahassee?

1252
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:33,794
Yes, ma'am,
and what a beautiful city.

1253
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:36,664
-Not like Miami.
-Oh, no, no.

1254
01:16:36,697 --> 01:16:38,833
Not like Miami.

1255
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:40,401
You able to stay with us long?

1256
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:42,002
No, unfortunately...

1257
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:43,938
Right after birding,
we're off to Massachusetts.

1258
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:46,006
-We just decided last night.
-Jamie.

1259
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,842
Well, what do they have
in Massachusetts

1260
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:50,311
that we don't have right here
in North Florida?

1261
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:52,547
Women can get married there.

1262
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,619
To each other?

1263
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:01,922
Hmm.

1264
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,860
Well, that's an innovation.

1265
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:22,176
Ladies!
