00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,911
I can't...
Yeah, they're not coming.

349
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,479
(groans)

350
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,748
It's over.

351
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,415
(tune ends)

352
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,951
- VOICE: (in distance) Psst.

353
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,853
(choral music playing)

354
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:53,954
GARFIELD: Huh?

355
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,688
- (harmonica squeals)
- Am I dead?

356
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,726
Are you an angel?

357
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,296
(panting)

358
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,168
Please, take me.

359
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,604
I am ready to go
to that... (sobbing)

360
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,573
to that all-you-can-eat buffet
in the sky.

361
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,879
VOICE: What? Listen,
I'm going to swing you out,

362
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,049
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

363
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,084
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

364
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,284
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

365
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,887
cutting a rope
over a 40-foot drop?

366
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,187
- (Nolan giggling)
- VOICE: No time.

367
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,924
We got to get out of here
before they come back.

368
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,960
(barking)

369
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,594
(whoops)

370
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,868
- (groaning)
- (birds tweeting)

371
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,837
VOICE: We need to go.
Come on, Junior.

372
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,005
(gasping)

373
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,372
- CAT: Wait here, Junior.
- (sirens wailing)

374
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,076
- CAT: I'll be right back.
- (thunder crashing)

375
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,644
VOICE: (echoing)
I'll be right back.

376
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,150
(gasps) You.

377
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,986
(stammers) Hey, Junior.

378
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,621
- Huh?
- "Who is he?"

379
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,324
This is Vic. My "father."

380
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,761
Look, Junior, I know
how you might be upset.

381
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,428
Upset? Why would I be upset?

382
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,231
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

383
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,266
I'm probably just overreacting.

384
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,602
- (metallic screeching)
- (screaming)

385
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,638
(screeching continues)

386
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,948
Oh, no, not her.

387
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,381
Okay, follow me, Junior.

388
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,184
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

389
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,053
You lost the privilege
of telling me what to do

390
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,320
a long time ago.

391
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,622
- Hello, Vic.
- (Garfield gasping, screaming)

392
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,058
Oh, dang it.

393
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,692
Scare cam.

394
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,228
(laughing)

395
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,996
Oh, you should've
seen your faces.

396
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,164
(gasps) Ooh.

397
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,866
(laughing)

398
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,735
Okay, boys, show me.

399
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,402
Hello, Vic.

400
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,905
- (gasping, screaming)
- Oh, dang...

401
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,340
(laughing)

402
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,077
Post that ASAP.

403
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,411
(laughing)

404
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,915
(stammering)

405
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,283
What? Uh, hey, Jinx.

406
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,620
I haven't seen you since... Oh.

407
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,390
W-Well, no hard feelings,
though, right?

408
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,761
Oh, I don't think so.

409
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,697
I'm a hugger. Oh!

410
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,867
Part of me wants to be mad
at her for kidnapping us,

411
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,235
but you got to love her energy.

412
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,436
(gasps) Where are my manners?

413
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,807
Chop-chop, gentlemen.
Look alive.

414
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,541
- (barks)
- (growls)

415
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,944

417
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,519
(gargling)

418
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,089
Ah. Perfection.

419
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,158
You know, I was so delighted

420
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,161
that you accepted
my invitation here tonight.

421
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,131
Well, throwing us in a burlap
sack wasn't exactly an Evite.

422
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,099
Vic, you're so quiet.

423
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,902
Are you feline sad?
Cat got your tongue?

424
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,171
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

425
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,207
Excuse me, uh, how do you two
know each other?

426
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,440
Let me handle this, Junior.

427
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,243
Oh, don't "Junior" me.

428
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,179
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

429
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,747
- (scoffs)
- Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

430
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,851
Anyway, can somebody please
tell me what is going on?

431
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,219
Well, we really don't
need to get into...

432
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,287
(shushes) I'll take this one.

433
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,922
(clears throat, breathes deeply)

434
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,091
(solemn tune playing)

435
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,261
What?

436
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,662
I'm from a small town
outside London

437
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,532
that you've probably
never heard of.

438
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,402
Oh, I scratched and clawed
my way through hard times

439
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,306
to come here with one dream.

440
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,440

Jinx, I tried
to come back for you.

466
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,249
You have to know that.

467
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,384
Oh, yes,
you get an "A" for effort.

468
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,819
So, what happened next?

<i>So very stinky.
I can't overstate that enough.</i>

475
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,866
<i>But it gave me purpose.</i>

476
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,069
<i>I needed to get out.</i>

477
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,870

(laughing)

480
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,552
So, your purpose was
to escape jail

481
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,554
and get involved with charities?

482
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,291
No. My purpose was... (purrs)

483
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,826
revenge.

484
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,027
(gulps)

485
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,762
Oh, I see.
I went the other way with it.

486
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,529
I'm kidding.

487
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,565
Another cat would be
bent on revenge,

488
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,201
but I'm, uh...
Ooh, how would you put it?

489
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:46,039
Evolved, compassionate and
incredibly self-actualized.

490
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,539
Bingo. (laughs)

491
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,608
I had such trouble finding him,

492
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,677
and when I discovered
you were his son,

493
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,714
I had no choice but
to kidnap you to lure him here.

494
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,916
No, listen, I totally get it.
It's-it's all...

495
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,919
It's all part of being
associated with Vic.

496
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,655
So, what do you need from him
to make this right?

497
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,191
I simply want him to pay back

498
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,592
the quart of milk
I lost that night,

499
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,927
and we'll call it even.

500
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,029
I can do that.

501
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,230
What he can't do
is raise a child.

502
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,798
- Just one quart.
- Just one quart.

503
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:12,899
- Done.
- Done.

504
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,334
For every day
I was in the pound.

505
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,436
- What, now?
- Nice twist. Well played.

506
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,971
Uh, how long were you
in the pound again?

507
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:19,472
Four years, seven months
and two days.

508
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,807
Oh! That long?

509
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,443
All right, I'm gonna do
the math here in my brain.

510
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,311
Uh, the way you do that is...

511
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,047
- Odie?
- (barking)

512
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,050
1,675 quarts of milk.
Exactly right, Odie.

513
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,318
We both came up with it
at the exact same time.

514
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,954
Where am I gonna find
that much milk?

515
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,923
Well, I suggest you go back
to the place

516
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,557
you double-crossed me.

517
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,527
Lactose Farms.

518
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,729
Wow. Well, good luck, Vic.

519
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,799
(chuckles) I'll leave you two
to work out the fine print.

520
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:48,268
We'll just see ourselves out.
Odie?

521
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,005
Ah, no.
You're all going to do this.

522
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,306
What? Wait, why me?

523
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,974
He's the one who abandoned you.

524
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,544
Yes, but this is
more than a one-cat job.

525
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,812
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

526
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,980
of low-life cat burglars
he could ask.

527
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,783
Oh, I'm sure he does, but if
I'm being completely honest,

528
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,852
seeing how miserable
you make one another

529
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,054
brings me endless satisfaction.

530
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,190
Oh, well, thank you
for your honesty.

531
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,624
And if I don't go?

532
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,829
You can stay and have a
playdate with Roland and Nolan.

533
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,932
Okay, boys... (gasps) go play.

534
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,166
(growling)

535
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,342
Ma'am, I think
this is an opportunity

536
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,111
to take a deep, cleansing breath

537
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,781
and repeat
your anger management mantra.

538
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,051
(coughs)

539
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,588
(clears throat) Anyone else
have any objections?

540
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,490
(gulps) Nope, I'm good.

541
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,858
Thanks for the opportunity.

542
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,793
- Excellent.
- (growling)

543
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,329
Now, you boys have 72 hours.

544
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,764
(glugging)

545
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,766
- (exhales sharply)
- (glass shatters)

546
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,135
Or else.

547
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,004
I-I can't believe
this is happening.

548
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,839
I don't see you for years,
and when I do,

549
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,274
you pull me
into a life of crime.

550
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,576
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head, too.

551
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,777
Well, that's the difference
between us,

552
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,946
because I never wanted
to see you again.

553
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,581
Now, I-I totally understand
your anger.

554
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,216
But if you give me
a chance to explain,

555
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,952
you'll see I am not
the bad guy you think I am.

556
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,088
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley.

557
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,990
- It wasn't like that.
- It was exactly like that!

558
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,825
No, it wasn't.
Let me tell you what,

559
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,226
- Junior...
- No, no. Ah!

560
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,162
I don't want to hear it.
This whole thing with Jinx?

561
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,697
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

562
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,835
Can't let you do that.

563
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,038
We'll be watching you.

564
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,239
Like a hawk.

565
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,142
(hawk screeches in distance)

566
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,745
(Garfield yelps)

567
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,083
(groans) Is today a Monday?

568
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,219
'Cause it feels
an awful lot like a Monday.

569
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,287
It's Thursday.

570
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,454
Not to me it's not.

571
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,590
Look, I know this isn't ideal,

572
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,358
but we have to do this.

573
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,994
So let's just try and make
the best of our time together.

574
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,797
Our time together?
What are you talking about?

575
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,332
Once we get this milk,

576
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,467
I want you out of my life.
Forever.

577
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,902
All right, just relax.

578
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:04,137
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

579
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,439
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

580
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,907
This will be
a quick grab and go.

581
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,409
You'll be back home
before you know it.

582
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,944
- (laughs)
- (sighs)

583
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,247
So how do we even get
to Lactose Farms?

584
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,648
It's way out in the country.

585
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,483
You ever jumped a train?

586
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,118
I've never jumped.

587
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,988
Look, if jumping a train
is too hard, just say it.

588
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,390
- (scoffs) How hard could it be?
- Exactly.

589
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:28,094
(laughs) This is gonna be fun.

590
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:29,696
(birds chirping)

591
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,965
JON: (yawns) Garfield?

592
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,132
Odie?

593
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,367
Hello?

594
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,937
Garfield, how many times
have I told you

595
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,440
to close the refrigerator door?
Gar...

596
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,209
Wait, there's food on the floor.

597
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:46,312
(gasps) He's never
left food on the floor.

598
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,448
Garfield?

599
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,451
Garfield?

600
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,286
- (door creaks)
- Garfield?

601
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,421
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

602
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,091
Garfield!

603
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,226
- (train horn blowing)
- (Garfield grunting)

604
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:02,595
(groans)

605
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,264
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

606
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,099
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

607
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,835
the direction of the sun
and various angles.

608
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,571
Yes, I say we jump the train
from right here.

609
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,740
Didn't I just say that?

610
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,107
I've seen it on television
a million times.

611
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,375
We'll need a hundred feet
of rope.

612
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:16,576
Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay, great.

613
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,944
Uh-huh. Yep.
We'll throw the rope

614
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,246
- over that branch right there.
- Branch. Uh-huh. Got it.

615
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,382
GARFIELD: Can you follow me?
All right?

616
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:23,883
And then, timing it just right,

617
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,486
we swing over
as the train passes by

618
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,254
and land on top of the car.

619
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:29,922
- Boom.
- VIC: Or...

620
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,425
- we can do this.
- (screaming)

621
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,294
VIC: Odie, jump, boy.

622
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,628
(grunts)

623
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:36,896
Huh?

624
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,031
Uh-oh.

625
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,165
(screaming)

626
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,634
Whoa!

627
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,469
(screaming)

628
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,372
(meowing, whacking)

629
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,808
Part of me wants to help him.

630
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,511
No. This is how he learns.

631
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,283
(chuckles)

632
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,186
(gasps, screams)

633
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,988
I don't know.
It's kind of pricey.

634
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,923
- How does it handle?
- (Garfield screaming)

635
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,591
Whoa! I'll take it!

636
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:08,127
(screaming)

637
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:09,662
Whoa!

638
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,431
(yelping)

639
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,935
(screaming)

640
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,341
See? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

641
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,410
(hoarsely) You and I have
different definitions of fun.

642
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:27,447
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Hello?</i>

643
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,948
Oh, finally. Hello!

644
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,818
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>You've reached Find My Pet.</i>

645
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,385
<i>If your pet is lost,
we're here to help.</i>

646
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,821
Mm-hmm. Hi, yes. Great.

647
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,522
Okay, uh, my orange tabby
and my dog are both missing,

648
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,791
and I-I need your help.

649
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,025
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Please listen carefully,</i>

650
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:39,959
<i>as our menu options

651
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,194
- Okay.

652
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,662
<i>this call in Spanish...</i>
(speaking Spanish)

653
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:43,896
- What?
<i>- For Pig Latin,</i>

654
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,164
<i>- ess-pray even-say.</i>
- Come on.

655
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:46,332
<i>For gibberish...</i>
(speaks gibberish)

656
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,034
What do I press to talk

657
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,703
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Your call
is very important to us.</i>

658
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,071
- <i>There are...</i>
- DEEP VOICE: <i>1,346</i>

659
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,406
(in normal voice)
<i>...people ahead of you.</i>

660
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,808
Wha... What?

661
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,810
Garfield, where are you?

662
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,145
(train horn blowing)

663
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,617
Okay, Vic, you got
to figure this out.

664
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:07,186
(sighs) Jinx can't be trusted,

665
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,156
and you got to keep Junior safe.

666
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,393
You just got to figure out
a way to get him out of this.

667
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,662
GARFIELD: (clears throat)
Ah. Tell me, is it a burr?

668
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,698
It hurts.
Ah, you pulled my hair.

669
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:19,932
- Ow, ow, ow.
- (sighs)

670
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,534
GARFIELD: Is that...
Is it a bug?

671
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,903
A bug? (screams)

672
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,571
- Ow. Ow. Owie. Ow.
- Hmm?

673
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:26,639
GARFIELD: Odie, Odie.

674
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,574
(screaming)

675
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,210
(sighs) Okay. Ah.

676
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:32,645
(grunts)

677
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,249
(chuckling)

678
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,419
You know what, Junior?
This is gonna be good for you.

679
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,121
- What'll be good for me?
- What we're doing.

680
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:43,322
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

681
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,859
from a dairy to pay back
a deranged cat.

682
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,694
What part of that is
going to be good for me?

683
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,731
All of it.
You can't even imagine

684
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,432
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

685
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,001
- Oh, yeah. Name one.
- Well, for starters,

686
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,271
you already know
how to get on a moving train.

687
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,940
(laughing)

688
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,076
(clears throat)
I found it funny.

689
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,979
All I'm saying is that
to break into a dairy,

690
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,347
it's gonna take a few skills

691
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,683
I'm guessing a rounded,
mush-filled, overly-pampered

692
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:13,887
indoor cat like you
doesn't have.

693
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,889
So, we need to toughen you up.

694
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:19,091
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

695
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,461
You've obviously never been
in an Olive Garden

696
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,962
that's run out of breadsticks.

697
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,265
Anyway, I'm never gonna need
those skills

698
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,367
- you're talking about.
- But you'll have them.

699
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,002
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

700
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,438
or anything else, ever again.

701
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,173
You are missing the point.

702
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,776
You're going to learn
to improvise,

703
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,176
think on your feet,
develop moves

704
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,012
that'll come in handy out there
in the real world.

705
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,149
I wouldn't be in the real world
if it wasn't for you.

706
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,018
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

707
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,221
No. I would be asleep at home.

708
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,190
Missing out on life altogether.

709
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:54,260
Look, I'm just a dad trying
to teach his son some skills.

710
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,628
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

711
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,231
You can't make up for
five years of not being around.

712
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,032
- Ah, yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

713
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,601
- I think I can.
- In fact, you can't.

714
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:03,135
- Yes, I can.
- You really can't.

715
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,872
With your attitude, I can.

716
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,206
Ah! Okay, whatever, "Dad."

717
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,042
- Wow. Great lesson. Ugh!
- Hmm.

718
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,611
GARFIELD: I'm done
talking to you.

719
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:12,779
You do not know me.

720
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,480
You don't know
the first thing about me.

721
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:15,983
I am not pampered.

722
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,118
I'm not anything you think I am.

723
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,192
Okay. I'm just gonna say

724
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,561
that blanket is not
the best idea.

725
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,196
Ah, fantastic, thank you.

726
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,031
I'll take it from here.

727
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,768
(Garfield gasping)

728
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,402
Get them off, get them off!

729
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,739
Ah! Get them off me!

730
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,108
Wait, what are you doing?

731
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,343

732
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:45,645

733
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,548
- What did you do?
- Cedar chips.

734
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,750
Spiders hate them.

735
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:51,952
See?
Another life skill learned.

736
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,887
I-I-I, uh...

737
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,688
I think the words
you're looking for are...

738
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:56,790
"Thank you, Pops."

739
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,157
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

740
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,860
Oh! Here's our stop.

741
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,394

742
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,863

He's one of the mascots

See? On the side of the barn?

Yes, he does. Hmm.

six seconds, twice a day.

from that place?

Oh, you know,
a couple quarts of milk.

851
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,635

Now, pay attention.

861
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,394
Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

862
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,864
And here are the two places
you need to go.

863
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:42,235
First, the truck with your milk
is back here.

864
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,272
And this delicate buttercup
is my Ethel.

865
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,774
My North Star
and reason for living

866
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:50,810
is being kept by
those barbarians in...

867
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,946

868
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,414
Located here.

869
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,151
This cricket represents
the electrical room,

870
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,320
this snail,
the refrigeration room.

871
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,655
This toadstool
is the loading dock

872
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,191
where you'll find the keys
to the trucks.

873
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,492
Wait, what's the pine cone?

874
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,694
The pine cone is
the cheese and butter room.

875
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:11,097
Ooh, cheese is my love language.

876
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,431
Now, for this briefing,

877
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,433
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

878
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,370
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

879
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:20,040
- Oh!
- You are the majestic bullfrog.

880
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:23,109
(croaks)

881
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,978
Oh, yeah, that feels right.

882
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,181
OTTO: You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

883
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,083
- And you...
- Wait for it.

884
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,918
OTTO: ...are roadkill.

885
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:36,156
Huh? What? Oh. (laughing)

886
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:38,457
No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto.

887
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,260
Giving your new
best friend roadkill.

888
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,029
Seriously, though,
wh-what's my real token?

889
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:44,831
That is your real token.

890
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,433
Now, if you have
any chance of succeeding...

891
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,499
Wait, can I, uh... Excuse me.

892
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:48,567
Can I switch
to something living?

893
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,136
Like, like the snail
or the cricket?

894
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,438
You should've spoken up sooner.

895
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,639
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

896
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,909
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

897
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,444
Come on, Roadkill, focus.

898
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,413
Oh, really? You give Vic
the majestic bullfrog.

899
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,548
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk.

900
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:05,517
And then you give me,
your new BFF, roadkill?

901
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,586
I mean, it feels disrespectful,
not gonna lie.

902
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,222
What makes you think he's dead?

903
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:10,991
My eyes.
I have eyes and can see.

904
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,393
It's a possum. They're masters
at playing dead.

905
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,061
Well, then,
little Daniel Day-Possum here

906
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,196
should do
Shakespeare in the Park.

907
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,496
Things aren't always
what they seem.

908
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,932
You're right.
But in this case, they are.

909
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,734
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

910
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,002
Oh, do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

911
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,104
Do possums play possum?
Is that what they do?

912
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:25,839
Yes. Possums are very clever.

913
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,308
Yeah, I'm sure he was until
the day he ate a pickup truck.

914
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:29,776
Uh, just ignore him.

915
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,444
Please, continue.

916
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,913
I'll just put this back
where you had it, mm-hmm.

917
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,949
The straightest line
to the loading dock

918
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,516
is through the snail here,

919
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,918
then the cricket there,

920
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,788
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

921
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,958
Each of these rooms have their
own set of unique challenges.

922
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,525
Well, why can't we just go
straight through the pine cone?

923
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,961
You don't want to go
through the pine cone.

924
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,296
Looks like the straightest shot
is through the pine cone.

925
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,931
You like walking
with those feet, do you?

926
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:54,801
You a fan of
unimaginable pain and misery?

927
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,903
Then go through the pine cone.

928
00:38:57,037 --> 00:38:59,205
Stay away from the pine cone.
(clicks tongue) Got it.

929
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,940
Once you're inside
the facility...

930
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,509
("Mission: Impossible Theme"
playing)

931
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,044
OTTO: <i>...you will enter
the electrical room.</i>

932
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,645
<i>There you will locate
the air vent.</i>

933
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,717
<i>Pop the grate and climb up.</i>

934
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:17,023
<i>Then you'll crawl through
a maze of vents</i>

935
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,590
<i>and drop down...</i>

936
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,361
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

937
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:24,663
<i>Next, you will need to hurl
your body over a 30-foot drop</i>

938
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:27,467
<i>to a series of hand rungs.</i>

939
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,736
<i>You'll propel yourselves
hand over hand</i>

940
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,239
<i>and drop down
directly into a loading dock.</i>

941
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:37,710
<i>From there, you'll locate
the keys to the milk truck.</i>

942
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:40,313
<i>Drive that truck to the
west pasture of the complex,</i>

943
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,948
<i>cut the lock on the gate,</i>

944
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,484
<i>and find the closest thing
we have</i>

945
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,619
<i>to an angel here on earth.</i>

946
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:53,126
<i>You'll escort my sweet Ethel
onto the truck</i>

947
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,562
<i>and drive her to freedom.</i>

948
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,130
(music ends)

949
00:39:57,263 --> 00:40:00,333
It's going to take mad skills
to get that milk

950
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,802
and free my dear, sweet Ethel.

951
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:05,772
Clearly, this one is qualified
for the mission.

952
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:09,709
But I have some serious doubts
here about all of... this.

953
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:11,211
He's pointing to you,

954
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:12,278
- Roadkill.
- (growls)

955
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,080
Let's get to work.

956
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:15,215
(Garfield sighs)

957
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:18,518
Stupid roadkill.

958
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,854
Hey! I'm working here!

959
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,890
Ugh, definitely a Monday.

960
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,493
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Your call
is fairly important to us.</i>

961
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,528
<i>If you've lost a cat,
please press one.</i>

962
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,864
<i>If your cat is orange,
please press two.</i>

963
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:32,899
<i>This doesn't really
accomplish anything</i>

964
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:36,002
<i>but gives you the false sense
that we're engaged with you.</i>

965
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,337
(whimpering)

966
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,705
(moaning)

967
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,176
OTTO: All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

968
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,411
that you'll need to master

969
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:47,580
in order to break into
Lactose Farms.

970
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:50,617
Number one, develop
lightning-fast reflexes.

971
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,918
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

972
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,052
on the other side of that wall,

973
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,488
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

974
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,656
Yeah, no, no, no.
Depends what kind of pasta.

975
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,060
This pebble represents
danger you may encounter.

976
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:03,296
You need to grab it
before it grabs you.

977
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,663
(scoffs) It grabs me.

978
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,799
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

979
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:07,666
Too slow!

980
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,469
Ow. What was that for?

981
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:10,904
Being able to grab the pebble

982
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:13,506
could be the difference
between life and death.

983
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,674
All right,
let me try that again.

984
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,477
(grunts) Ha! Got it!

985
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,913
Ah! Now, what was that for?!

986
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:21,614
It's never just
about the pebble.

987
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:22,982
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

988
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,652
Your head's got to be
on a swivel at all times.

989
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,053
You got to be ready
for anything.

990
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,955
I was ready.
He changed the game.

991
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,424
Sounds like
someone's making excuses.

992
00:41:34,194 --> 00:41:36,496
And what was that about
being ready for anything?

993
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:37,730
You were distracting me!

994
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,566
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

995
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,800
You should have
seen that coming.

996
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,769
Toes on the line.
Guard your grill.

997
00:41:42,902 --> 00:41:44,237
Cover your stomach.

998
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,873
There are surprises around
every corner at Lactose Farms.

999
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:49,409
You need to stay alert.
Too slow.

1000
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:50,977
A baby could have
seen that coming.

1001
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,314
- Too slow. Too slow.
- (blows landing)

1002
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:57,784
- (slurping)
- OTTO: Too slow!

1003
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,919
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

1004
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,287
if you can't survive
this training.

1005
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:04,190
- Are you for real?
- Wh-What kind of dairy is this?

1006
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:07,827
The kind of dairy that
requires teamwork to survive.

1007
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,029
Danger could be anywhere,
gentlemen.

1008
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,164
(yells)

1009
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:13,433
You've got to be ready
to outrun it.

1010
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:14,968
(screaming)

1011
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,707
- (train horn blowing)
- Here comes the pain.

1012
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,908
- Left, right, left, right.
- You're confusing me.

1013
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:23,843
(screaming)

1014
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:27,013
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1015
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:28,514
(bees buzzing)

1016
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:29,816
(screaming)

1017
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,719
Shh.

1018
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,654
(screaming)

1019
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:35,755
(crashing)

1020
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,490
(crunching, groaning)

1021
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:40,293
I think I'm gonna need rehab.
Oh!

1022
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:41,761
(moaning)

1023
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:43,796
(sighs)

1024
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,465
If this is going to work,

1025
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:47,700
these two have to be
on the same page.

1026
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,302
I'm out of ideas.

1027
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:50,503
You got any?

1028
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,774
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere,

1029
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,676
getting beaten up
against my will

1030
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:59,512
by a former celebrity steer.

1031
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:00,947
- Odie?
- Hmm?

1032
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,449
Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

1033
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,586
Odie, can you tell Vic that
I collapsed on this tree first

1034
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,121
and that he needs
to find another one?

1035
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:12,692
Odie, can you tell my son that
I will gladly find another one

1036
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:14,894
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

1037
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:16,696
Odie, can you tell my father

1038
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:17,897
that he wouldn't be
lying in pain

1039
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:19,065
if he led a better life

1040
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:20,867
and didn't create problems

<i>Okay, I'm done.
Hang up the phone.</i>

1216
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:07,928
<i>Ha ha.
What an evil genius I am.</i>

1217
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,129
(line beeps)

1218
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:11,564
Well, then, still seem like
a prank to you?

1219
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:13,432
Eh, that last part did a little.

1220
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:15,235
What's our next move, Chief?

1221
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,571
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

1222
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:21,473
and formulate an ingenious plan.

1223
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:24,577
And you go get my car waxed.

1224
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,513
Well, well, well,

1225
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:30,183
would you look at that,
Margie Malone.

1226
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:33,352
We're having company tomorrow.

1227
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:36,223
I guess I better take out
my finest china

1228
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:38,457
to serve a heaping plate...

1229
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,393
of justice.

1230
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:44,463
(lively chatter in distance)

1231
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,270
What are those for?

1232
00:52:50,402 --> 00:52:51,570
For us to communicate

1233
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:55,507
once you're inside
the belly of the beast.

1234
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:57,811
- (growls)
- Uh... 'kay.

1235
00:52:57,944 --> 00:53:01,147
Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

1236
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,415
(sighs) Indoor cat.

1237
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:04,985
These are better.

1238
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:06,452
It just feels like Bluetooth
would be better.

1239
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:07,553
These are better than Bluetooth.

1240
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,122
These-these are better
than Bluetooth?

1241
00:53:10,123 --> 00:53:11,291
They're equal.

1242
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:13,026
And I don't have to pay
for the brand.

1243
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,160
(static hums)

1244
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:18,530
- Hmm. Hmm?
- (static hums)

1245
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:21,101
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk.

1246

- Do you copy?
- (barks) Mm-hmm.

1247
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:24,804
Of course you can hear him.

1248
00:53:24,938 --> 00:53:27,573
He's standing
three feet away from you.

1249
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,876
Oh, I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

1250
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,779
Now, we just need to find...

1251
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:36,383
a way in.

1252
00:53:36,515 --> 00:53:38,084

All right, look alive.

00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:22,428
<i>in five minutes.</i>

1390
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,432
Okay, Otto,
we're in the loading dock.

1391
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:27,600
Where are the keys?

1392
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:28,736
OTTO: <i>They should be
hanging on</i>

1393
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:30,503
<i>a pegboard on the far wall.</i>

1394
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:31,771
(barks)

1395
00:59:31,904 --> 00:59:33,539
What do you mean
we have a problem?

1396
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:35,008
Uh, pegboard's empty.

1397
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:36,209
OTTO: <i>Empty?</i>

1398
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:37,711
MARGE: Now, would you

1399
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,545
look at this.

1400
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,948
Three misguided stray pets

1401
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,916
trying to steal a truck of milk.

1402
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,987
Never a dull moment at
this dairy, is there, Margie?

1403
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,889
Well, you're looking for these,
aren't you?

1404
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:51,824
Well, here you go, then.

1405
00:59:56,062 --> 00:59:58,064
So how's this gonna
play out, fellas?

1406
00:59:58,197 --> 01:00:00,333
The easy way or the hard way?

1407
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,436
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm up for either.

1408
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:07,206
Follow my lead.

1409
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,374
Huh? What?

1410
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:15,615
(groans)

1411
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:17,550
- (neck cracks)
- Who's next, then?

1412
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:18,786
(screams)

1413
01:00:18,918 --> 01:00:20,953
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

1414
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,423
Crazy eyes?
Tragic sense of fashion?

1415
01:00:23,556 --> 01:00:24,557
Yeah. How did you know?

1416
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:25,992
Marge Malone.

1417
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:27,460
<i>Ethel!</i>

1418
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,762
ETHEL: (echoing) <i>Otto!</i>

1419
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:30,630
She's not just my nemesis.

1420
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,832
She's also my enemy.

1421
01:00:32,965 --> 01:00:34,867
Love to hear about it,
but right now, what do we do?

1422
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,302
Get those keys.

1423
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:38,504
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

1424
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:41,074
- MARGE: Come here, you!
- (grunting)

1425
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:47,080
- (growling)
- (both whimpering)

1426
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:52,485
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style.

1427
01:00:52,618 --> 01:00:54,053
(grunts)

1428
01:00:56,422 --> 01:00:57,623
(electricity crackling)

1429
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:59,292
(screams)

1430
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:03,831
No, no, no, no.
You're not getting away.

1431
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,198
I've already called the pound.

1432
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:07,900
Your days of thievery end today.

1433
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:09,135
(alarm blaring)

1434
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:11,304
COMPUTER:
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1435
01:01:12,238 --> 01:01:14,640
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1436
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:17,343
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1437
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:18,846
Otto.

1438
01:01:18,978 --> 01:01:21,280
COMPUTER:
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1439
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:23,916
Attempted perimeter breach.

1440
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,386
Junior, sorry about this.

1441
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,920
Sorry? For what?

1442
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:29,288
- (grunts)
- (Garfield shouts)

1443
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:32,058
- (Marge gasps)
- (grunts)

1444
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,192
Vic?

1445
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,668
What are you doing?

1446
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:46,472
Vic!

1447
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:48,908
Don't you go. Vic!

1448
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:50,443
(electrical whirring)

1449
01:01:50,576 --> 01:01:52,011
Please!

1450
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:56,149
(Marge panting)

1451
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:59,552
Send security
to the loading dock.

1452
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:06,559
(gasps)

1453
01:02:06,692 --> 01:02:08,361
(shouts)

1454
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:09,562
(gasps)

1455
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:11,030
Otto.

1456
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:17,103
You do not want
to try me today, mister.

1457
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,040
(roaring)

1458
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:27,146
(screams)

1459
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:30,183
Get him!

1460
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:49,235
(intense music playing)

1461
01:02:57,009 --> 01:02:59,612
- (alarm beeping)
- (screaming)

1462
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:01,414
(tires squealing)

1463
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:07,721
(panting)

1464
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,822
Whew.

1465
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,256
JINX: Welcome back...

1466
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:12,492
(chuckles)

1467
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,093
...Victor.

1468
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:19,967
Oh, hey, Jinx.

1469
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,736
Why are you here?
I-I was bringing this to you.

1470
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,403
Were you?

1471
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:25,839
Really?

1472
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:27,139
Yeah, of course I was.

1473
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,809
That's what we agreed to, right?

1474
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:30,142
Mm.

1475
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,211
(sighs)

1476
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:35,147
So, you and me square now?

1477
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:37,483
(chuckles) Not quite.

1478
01:03:37,617 --> 01:03:40,219
There's still the matter
of those five years

1479
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:42,655
- I lost because of you.
- What?

1480
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,557
But I thought this settled that.

1481
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,827
(laughs)

1482
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,996
It was never about the milk.

1483
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:51,564
It was about you getting
caught trying to steal it

1484
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,934
and being sent to the pound.

1485
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:56,369
Like I was.

1486
01:03:56,502 --> 01:04:00,239
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer.

1487
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:02,508
Like I did.

1488
01:04:03,676 --> 01:04:04,778
Oh.

1489
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:06,914
I see.

1490
01:04:07,046 --> 01:04:08,715
And I'm guessing
you have an idea about

1491
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:10,851
how that should happen.

1492
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:14,487
As a matter of fact, I do.

1493
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,296
I can't believe he did that.

1494
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:26,132
He ran out and he left me.

1495
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:30,202
Again.

1496
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,371
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

1497
01:04:33,072 --> 01:04:34,340
it was a lie.

1498
01:04:35,374 --> 01:04:36,509
All of it.

1499
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:40,413
(sighs)

1500
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:43,583
How could I have been so stupid?

1501
01:04:45,351 --> 01:04:46,586
(sighs)

1502
01:04:48,654 --> 01:04:50,489
MAURICE:
Oh, come on, kid.

1503
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:52,793
Don't beat yourself up.

1504
01:04:52,926 --> 01:04:55,996
Vic, man,
we've all been burned by Vic.

1505
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:57,196
- (overlapping agreement)
- Yeah, that's right.

1506
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:59,733
Burned every cat I know.

1507
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:02,769
Ah, yeah, the one thing
about Vic you can count on

1508
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:04,670
is that you can't count on him.

1509
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:05,973
Tell me about it.

1510
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:07,573
MAURICE: Yeah,
I'll tell you about it.

1511
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:11,078
Long story short,
we all used to run in a pack

1512
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,112
until we had to kick him
out the crew.

1513
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:14,748
(overlapping agreement)

1514
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:17,483
Like I said,
couldn't count on him.

1515
01:05:17,617 --> 01:05:18,719
Sounds about right.

1516
01:05:18,852 --> 01:05:20,620
He'd leave
in the middle of a job

1517
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:22,521
just to go see his kid.

1518
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:25,291
Yeah, he said he wanted
to check up on him,

1519
01:05:25,424 --> 01:05:27,259
make sure he was doing okay.

1520
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:28,561
OLIVIA:
But get this:

1521
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:30,196
he'd never actually visit.

1522
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:32,766
He'd just sit across the street
from his kid's house

1523
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:34,101
in a giant oak tree.

1524
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:35,334
That never happened.

1525
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:38,105
He'd watch that kid
eat and eat and eat...

1526
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:39,740
He'd put a notch in the bark...

1527
01:05:39,873 --> 01:05:42,541
- ...and eat and eat...
- ...every time he was there.

1528
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:44,044
Oh, yeah. Sure, he did.

1529
01:05:44,176 --> 01:05:47,748
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

1530
01:05:47,881 --> 01:05:49,215
Said that it was his kid's...

1531
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:51,952
CATS:
Family dinner night.

1532
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:53,887
(overlapping chatter)

1533
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,793
Okay, hate to tell you guys...

1534
01:05:59,926 --> 01:06:02,261
I guarantee that never happened.

1535
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:04,965
Okay? You all fell for
another one of Vic's lies.

1536
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,900
We all have.

1537
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,869
Because that's
what he does best.

1538
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,738
(Odie barks)

1539
01:06:12,571 --> 01:06:14,041
(barks happily)

1540
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:16,076
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

1541
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,878
Quick, pick the lock on my cage.

1542
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:20,446
- Garfield, there you are!
- (gasps) Jon!

1543
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,515
(crying) Oh, take me away
from all of this.

1544
01:06:22,648 --> 01:06:24,084
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

1545
01:06:24,216 --> 01:06:25,618
You want this one, too?

1546
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:26,853
Oh, yes, I do.

1547
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:28,487
You sure he's yours?
He didn't have a tag.

1548
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:31,190
JON: Uh-huh, yeah.
Oh, he has a tag.

1549
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:33,592
Huh? I have a collar
and a tag?

1550
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:35,929
- How long have I had those?
- POUND WORKER: Okay.

1551
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:36,997
I'm just gonna
need you to hold...

1552
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,800
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

1553
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:41,701
The Jon who was on hold is dead!

1554
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,602
Do you understand?

1555
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:45,172
(whoops)

1556
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:48,340
That's right.

No. I brought takeout.

Sorry my rescue didn't work out.

No, you gave me another chance.

Drop them now! (gasps)

What are you waiting for?

1826
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:11,077
Their love for one another
indicates that,

1827
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,246
despite their
current circumstance,

1828
01:20:13,379 --> 01:20:15,147
- they are at peace.
- (grunts)

1829
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:18,351
- Because they are together.
- So?

1830

If the point of your revenge
was to hurt them,

1831
01:20:21,087 --> 01:20:23,122
it has done the opposite.

1832
01:20:23,256 --> 01:20:25,124
It's actually textbook irony.

1833
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:28,427
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

1835
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,832
You two are still
as weak as you were

1836
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:34,166

in the pound.

1837

(imitating Roland)
Oh, no one will adopt us.

1838
01:20:36,803 --> 01:20:38,604
I never grew into my folds.

1839
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:41,008
I hide behind them because
I'm socially awkward.

1840
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,508
(imitating Nolan)
Please, somebody love me,

1841
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:44,443
even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

1842
01:20:44,577 --> 01:20:47,313
and have the attention span
of a bloody goldfish!

1843
01:20:47,446 --> 01:20:50,216
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

1844
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:52,618
I even spoke
with this ridiculous accent

1845
01:20:52,753 --> 01:20:54,520
to make you feel more at home.

1846
01:20:54,654 --> 01:20:55,889
But no more.

1847
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:57,925
(in New York accent)
I'm New York, loud and proud.

1848
01:20:58,057 --> 01:21:00,192
I love myself the way I am,

1849
01:21:00,326 --> 01:21:03,229
and I'm a big, brave boy, baby!

1850
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:06,098
And I've been working on
my attention span.

1851

(growls)

1860
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:53,613
Might I just say,

1861
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:56,182
as someone else
with a zaftig figure,

1862
01:21:56,315 --> 01:21:57,951
you have a beautiful body, sir.

1863
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,754
- Whoa!
- Oh, dear.

1864
01:22:00,887 --> 01:22:02,856
(all screaming)

1865
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:07,526
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

1866
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,730
There's something about your
cadence that really throws me,

1867
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:10,797
but thank you.

1868

Did not see that coming.

1874
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,516
Well, when you live in the wild,

1875
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:32,919
you got to keep your head
on a swivel.

1876
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:35,022
- Right.
- Mmm.

1877
01:22:35,154 --> 01:22:38,157
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

1878

And that had
bird poop on it. (spits)

Hey. You good, Roadkill?

1880
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:45,564
Mm, not quite.

1881
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:48,501
There's one last thing
to take care of.

1882
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:49,903
Cut to...

1883
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,172

<i>On nights like this,
you can't swing a cat</i>

1888

<i>without hitting shady characters</i>

1889
01:23:09,455 --> 01:23:12,625
<i>making shady deals
all over town.</i>

<i>Oh, but this night
was going to be different.</i>

1892

<i>With a helping of retribution
on the side.</i>

1893
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:28,709
Is that... (clears throat)
the package?

1894
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,509
(distorted voice) It is.

1895
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:33,512
Then we have a deal.
(whistles)

1896
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:38,985
(distorted voice) No one
will come looking for her?

1897
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:40,053
MARGE: Nope.

1898
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,253
I did what you said.

1899
01:23:41,387 --> 01:23:43,023
I burned her paperwork,

1900
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:45,424
and then shredded it
and burned it some more.

1901
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:48,294
It's like she never existed.

1902
01:23:48,427 --> 01:23:49,963
Except for the image of her face

1903
01:23:50,097 --> 01:23:51,798
on millions of dairy products.

1904
01:23:54,968 --> 01:23:56,302

(panting)

1906
01:24:11,017 --> 01:24:12,018
This...

1907
01:24:12,152 --> 01:24:13,787
(distorted voice)
...never happened.

1908
01:24:14,286 --> 01:24:15,621
Agreed.

1909
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:18,290
(Jinx growls)

1910
01:24:18,424 --> 01:24:20,292
Oh, save it, Cat Fancy.

1911
01:24:20,426 --> 01:24:21,728
I know you planned
the milk truck heist

1912
01:24:21,862 --> 01:24:23,395
and then tried to throw
those innocent cats

1913
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:25,098
