1
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,616
OK... Here we go. Focus.

2
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,917
Speed. I am speed.

3
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:46,170
One winner, 42 losers.

4
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,694
I eat losers for breakfast.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,094
Breakfast.

6
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,167
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

7
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,785
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

8
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,562
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

9
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,159
I am lightning!

10
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,460
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

11
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:11,065
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

12
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,822
Ka-chow!

13
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,989
Get your antenna balls here!

14
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:44,376
Go, Lightnin'!

15
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:48,277
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

16
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,157
Uh!

17
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:15,932
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

18
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,479
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

19
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:22,421
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

20
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,438
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

21
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,959
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

22
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,046
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

23
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,640
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

24
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,718
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

25
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,363
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

26
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,057
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

27
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,429
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

28
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,983
<i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

29
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,160
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

30
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,460
<i>And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

31
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:52,949
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

32
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,096
<i>Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

33
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,818
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

34
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,782
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

35
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:04,376
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

36
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,967
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

37
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,468
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

38
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:12,438
<i>Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

39
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,998
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

40
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,821
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

41
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:30,933
No you don't.

42
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:35,445
Hey!

43
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,965
What a ride!

44
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,417
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

45
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,828
I love you, Lightning!

46
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:55,449
Dinoco is all mine.

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,374
Trouble, turn three!

48
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,538
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

49
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,285
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

50
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,068
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

51
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:28,313
Not in one piece, that is.

52
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,961
Yeah!

53
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:45,919
Lightning! Oh!

54
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:50,110
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

55
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,542
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

56
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,647
Yeah! Ka-chow!

57
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,850
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

58
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,767
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

59
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,970
While everyone
heads into the pits,

60
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,730
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,669
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

62
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:14,590
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

63
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,510
- McQueen made it!
- What?

64
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,589
He's not pitting!

65
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:20,663
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

66
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,426
McQueen's not going into the pits!

67
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:25,910
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

68
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,187
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

69
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,394
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

70
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,725
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

71
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,093
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

72
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,258
Come on, come on, come on!

73
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,303
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

74
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,961
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

75
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,070
You need tires, you idiot!

76
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,246
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

77
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:14,686
Right. No tires again.

78
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,337
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

79
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:20,920
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

80
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:32,762
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

81
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,580
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,850
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,202
Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:48,180
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

85
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:50,873
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

86
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:53,398
You fool!

87
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,086
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

88
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,580
Go, go, go!

89
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,049
He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:12,218
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,075
Come on.

92
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,009
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,462
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,463
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

95
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:35,355
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

96
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:38,106
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

97
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:39,484
Lightning!

98
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,644
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

99
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,035
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

100
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,053
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

101
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:01,205
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

102
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,384
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

103
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,886
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

104
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,318
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

105
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:09,331
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

106
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

107
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,326
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

108
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:19,133
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

109
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,054
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

110
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,159
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

111
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,303
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

112
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,749
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

113
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,789
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

114
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:31,384
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

115
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,080
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

116
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,777
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

117
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,756
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

118
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:40,279
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

119
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,245
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

120
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,945
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

121
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:49,626
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

122
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,501
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

123
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,160
Oh, whatever.

124
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,173
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

125
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,411
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

126
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,618
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,108
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

128
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,736
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

129
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,182
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

130
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,011
In your dreams, Thunder.

131
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,046
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

132
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,836
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

133
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,627
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

134
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,029
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

135
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:25,721
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

136
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,198
Right in the lens.

137
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,431
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

138
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,667
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

139
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,036
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

140
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,059
Thank you, King.

141
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:45,786
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

142
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,164
It's the least I could do.

143
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:50,330
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

144
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,082
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

145
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,777
Kch-i-ka-chow!

146
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,400
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

147
00:10:57,471 --> 00:11:00,602
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

148
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:03,060
I love being me.

149
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:06,102
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

150
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,716
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

151
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,277
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

152
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,075
You got more talent in one lug nut

153
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,598
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

154
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:19,159
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

155
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,686
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

156
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,726
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

157
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,701
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

158
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,938
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

159
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,625
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

160
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,517
Yeah...

161
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:44,436
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

162
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,333
Oh, Lightning!

163
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:09,436
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

164
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:12,983
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

165
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,429
Thank you, Mr. The King.

166
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,502
Ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,713
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

168
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:22,329
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

169
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,734
Yes!

170
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:26,621
...we have a three-way tie.

171
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:35,933
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

172
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,552
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

173
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,844
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

174
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,969
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

175
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,330
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

176
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,944
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

177
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,862
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

178
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:03,098
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

179
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,169
Yep! All right! Got it!

180
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:09,556
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself. "

181
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,151
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

182
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,270
Huh?

183
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,539
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

184
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:19,356
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

185
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,528
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

186
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,509
Gotta make your personal appearance.

187
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:26,038
No. No! No, no, no, no!

188
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,476
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

189
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:32,023
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

190
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:35,641
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.</i>

191
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,365
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

192
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,009
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

193
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,289
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

194
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,340
I met this car from Swampscott.

195
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,350
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

196
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:54,172
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

197
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:58,298
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

198
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:01,629
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

199
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,477
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

200
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,340
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

201
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,749
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

202
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:12,702
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

203
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,654
Hey, look! There he is!

204
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,606
Our almost champ!

205
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,264
Get your rear end in here.

206
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,277
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

207
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,423
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

208
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,469
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

209
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,299
Yes, I know.

210
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,861
"Fred. " Fred, thank you.

211
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,420
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

212
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,375
Looking good, Freddie!

213
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,813
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

214
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,300
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

215
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,317
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

216
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:41,627
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

217
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:44,564
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

218
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,548
because the track is always lit.

219
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:49,689
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

220
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,011
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lightning McQueen!

221
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,717
Free Bird!

222
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,979
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

223
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,835
ran a great race today.

224
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:10,459
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

225
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,631
And an insane
amount of luck,

226
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:17,046
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

227
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,989
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

228
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,421
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

229
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:24,730
Just like this year!

230
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,446
Not on your life.

231
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:32,086
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

232
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,029
<i>California, here we come!</i>

233
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,688
Dinoco, here we come!

234
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,773
Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?

235
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,295
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

236
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,406
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

237
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:35,129
<i>And it is such an honor
to be your agent</i>

238
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:38,100
<i>that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

239
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:43,062
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

240
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:45,523
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

241
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,679
Thanks, Harv.

242
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,264
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

243
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,920
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

244
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,990
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.</i>

245
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:57,917
Yes, there's...

246
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,304
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

247
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:04,374
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

248
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:06,518
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

249
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,663
<i>Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!</i>

250
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:10,709
That'd be great!
We should totally...

251
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:13,433
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

252
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,509
What? A minivan?

253
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,208
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.</i>

254
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,515
<i>This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.</i>

255
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,004
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

256
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,412
<i>- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.</i>

257
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,057
<i>We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

258
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:36,153
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

259
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:39,157
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

260
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,238
All those sleeping trucks.

261
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:43,929
<i>Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.</i>

262
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,373
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

263
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,675
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

264
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,492
<i>- All night?
- All night long.</i>

265
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:10,071
Uh!

266
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,852
Ah-choo!

267
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,286
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

268
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,252
We got ourselves a nodder.

269
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:20,733
Pretty music.

270
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,060
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

271
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:26,523
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

272
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,557
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

273
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:51,386
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

274
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:54,171
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

275
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,479
Gesundheit!

276
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,478
One should never drive while drowsy.

277
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:14,358
Uh! Ah!

278
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,614
Mack!

279
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,555
Mack!

280
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,461
Mack!

281
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,251
Hey, Mack! Mack!

282
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:39,765
Mack!

283
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,260
Mack, wait for me!

284
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,672
Mack!

285
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,397
Mack! Mack!

286
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,853
Mack! Mack...

287
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:20,285
...wait up! Mack.

288
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,161
Mack! Mack!

289
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,336
What? You're not Mack.

290
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:29,978
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

291
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,854
Turn on your lights, you moron!

292
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,670
Mack... The Interstate!

293
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:53,629
Huh?

294
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:56,444
Not in my town, you don't.

295
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,297
Oh, no.

296
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,820
Oh, maybe he can help me!

297
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:07,065
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

298
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,362
I haven't gone this fast in years.

299
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,148
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

300
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:15,450
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

301
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,144
What in the blue blazes?

302
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:18,675
Crazy hot-rodder.

303
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:21,589
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

304
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,471
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

305
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,568
What? That's not the Interstate!

306
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,426
Ah! Oh!

307
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:45,657
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

308
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:50,875
No, no, no, no, no, no!

309
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,269
Ow!

310
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,292
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

311
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:00,343
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

312
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:01,691
- No!
- Hey!

313
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:03,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

314
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,073
My tires!

315
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:52,952
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

316
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:05,533
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

317
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,448
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

318
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:13,940
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

319
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:16,218
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

320
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:18,141
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>

321
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:19,318
<i>What's your strategy?</i>

322
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,863
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

323
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:28,571
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

324
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,435
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>

325
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,965
<i>Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.</i>

326
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,139
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

327
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:45,240
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

328
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,277
<i>Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!</i>

329
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,147
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

330
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,159
Oh, boy.

331
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,166
Where am I?

332
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:00,724
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

333
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:03,795
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

334
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,455
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

335
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:09,303
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

336
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:14,130
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

337
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:17,141
I like you already. My name's Mater.

338
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,538
Mater?

339
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:22,429
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

340
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:25,625
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

341
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:26,642
Uh...

342
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:29,979
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

343
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,028
What?

344
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:35,673
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

345
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,914
Where are you? Shoot!

346
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:39,476
You're in Radiator Springs.

347
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,811
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

348
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:45,627
Oh, great. Just great!

349
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:50,037
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

350
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,754
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

351
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,667
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

352
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,352
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

353
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,561
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

354
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,091
- Cool!
- Mater!

355
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,916
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

356
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,411
To not to.

357
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:11,741
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

358
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,813
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

359
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,636
"Later, Mater. "
That's funny!

360
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:17,842
Ah!

361
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:21,464
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

362
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,916
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

363
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,292
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

364
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:28,340
- Fascist!
- Commie!

365
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,999
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

366
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,761
I gotta get to California, pronto.

367
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,943
Where's your lawyer?

368
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:37,145
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

369
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:42,135
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

370
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,115
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

371
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:47,674
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

372
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:51,354
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

373
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:52,758
Show-off.

374
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,026
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

375
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,239
All right,

376
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,309
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

377
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,204
I want his hood on a platter!

378
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,823
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

379
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:08,505
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

380
00:29:08,574 --> 00:29:12,086
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

381
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,619
I'm...

382
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,373
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

383
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:20,667
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

384
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:22,324
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

385
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:24,569
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

386
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,044
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

387
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,867
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

388
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:33,309
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

389
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,708
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

390
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,629
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

391
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,727
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

392
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,213
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

393
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:46,166
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

394
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:49,173
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

395
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,692
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

396
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,359
Agh! Ow!

397
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,732
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

398
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,740
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

399
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:02,426
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

400
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,981
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

401
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,599
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

402
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,589
Ka-ching!

403
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:11,701
Ah!

404
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:13,692
I'll keep that in mind.

405
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,155
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

406
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,714
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

407
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:20,370
You know her?

408
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:23,293
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

409
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:24,306
What?

410
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:28,310
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

411
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:32,059
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

412
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:33,719
What do you want, Sally?

413
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,019
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

414
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,119
No. I know his type. Racecar.

415
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,164
That's the last thing this town needs.

416
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:46,548
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

417
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:50,397
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

418
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,836
Here she goes again.

419
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,487
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

420
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,038
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

421
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:01,754
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

422
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:04,691
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

423
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:05,878
Ignore him.

424
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,179
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

425
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,482
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

426
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,233
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

427
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:15,731
And if no one can get to you?

428
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:19,962
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

429
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,747
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

430
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:26,075
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

431
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:29,525
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

432
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,946
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

433
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:36,021
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

434
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,549
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

435
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:41,339
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

436
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:44,504
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

437
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,712
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

438
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,724
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

439
00:31:48,797 --> 00:31:49,746
Oh, he can do it.

440
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:52,505
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

441
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:53,980
Fix the road!

442
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,460
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

443
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:01,880
Order in the court!

444
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:05,273
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

445
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,251
- Yeah!
- No!

446
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,602
Nice ruling.

447
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:12,658
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

448
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:16,443
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

449
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,263
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

450
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,854
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

451
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,478
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

452
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:29,395
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

453
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,404
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

454
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:35,096
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

455
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,402
What? This place is crazy!

456
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,542
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

457
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:42,483
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

458
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:43,506
What?

459
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:46,997
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

460
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,596
You gotta be kidding me.

461
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,222
You start there where the road begins.

462
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:54,451
You finish down there
where the road ends.

463
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,521
Holy shoot!

464
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:01,339
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

465
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:04,821
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

466
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,006
Five days?

467
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:08,893
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

468
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,805
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

469
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,258
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

470
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,152
Freedom!

471
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:32,628
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

472
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:36,537
...and then...
then took the boot off.

473
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,251
Whoo-hoo!

474
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:44,787
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

475
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:48,571
California, here I come! Yeah!

476
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:52,755
Oh, feel that wind.

477
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:54,708
Yes!

478
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,780
No. No, no, no.

479
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,282
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

480
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,259
How can I be outta gas?

481
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:06,130
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

482
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,442
But how did,
how did... you...?

483
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,746
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

484
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:13,595
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

485
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,963
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

486
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,077
Hey, Sheriff.

487
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,321
<i>- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

488
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,778
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

489
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:31,642
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

490
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,427
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

491
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:37,211
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

492
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:39,896
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

493
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:42,747
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

494
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:46,042
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

495
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,248
That's why we made him the judge.

496
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:52,407
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

497
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:53,787
Now, I'm not one to brag

498
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:57,018
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

499
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,451
Oh!

500
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,242
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

501
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,033
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

502
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,273
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

503
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:09,848
No, no, no!

504
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:12,154
That won't be necessary.

505
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:16,345
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

506
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,934
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

507
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:22,226
Where's he goin'?

508
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:25,597
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

509
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,123
I shouldn't put up with this.

510
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:29,947
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

511
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:32,916
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

512
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,247
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

513
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,838
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

514
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,739
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

515
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:45,018
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

516
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:47,093
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

517
00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:49,074
I must scream it to the world!

518
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:53,208
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

519
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,667
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,589
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

521
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:02,140
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

522
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,269
Is that what I think it is?

523
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:11,992
Customers.

524
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:15,378
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

525
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:16,763
- OK!
- Customers?

526
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,546
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

527
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,068
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

528
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,524
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

529
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:28,150
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

530
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:32,444
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

531
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:35,062
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

532
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,981
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

533
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:40,216
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

534
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,267
How can we help you?

535
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:45,236
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

536
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,408
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

537
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:50,812
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

538
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,595
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

539
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,596
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

540
00:36:56,669 --> 00:37:00,564
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

541
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,263
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

542
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:05,400
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

543
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,666
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

544
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,970
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

545
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:13,274
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

546
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:16,375
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

547
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:20,023
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

548
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:23,409
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

549
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:27,260
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

550
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,438
No we just topped off.

551
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,219
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

552
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,652
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

553
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:37,914
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

554
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:41,014
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

555
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:43,289
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

556
00:37:43,357 --> 00:37:44,634
Maybe ghost flames!

557
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:47,156
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

558
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:50,971
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

559
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:53,939
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

560
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,442
Ow!

561
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:58,583
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

562
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,821
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

563
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:04,242
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

564
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,764
OK! Yes. You bet.

565
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:10,008
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

566
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:13,045
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

567
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:15,190
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

568
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,814
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:19,292
No, not really. But listen.

570
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:22,837
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

571
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,331
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

572
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:29,083
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

573
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,184
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

574
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:35,963
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

575
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:39,062
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

576
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,141
I'm becoming one of them!

577
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:44,981
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

578
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:46,744
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

579
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:49,563
<i>We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

580
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:52,247
<i>- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>

581
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:56,059
<i>Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

582
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,442
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

583
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:02,551
<i>It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

584
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:06,233
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

585
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,256
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

586
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,074
Ha-ha!

587
00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:21,714
Yeah!

588
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:35,098
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

589
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:37,305
Oh!

590
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:38,682
Let me get this straight.

591
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:41,564
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

592
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,207
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

593
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:46,325
I got a road to finish.

594
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:59,995
- He's done!
- Done?

595
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:02,330
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

596
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,386
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

597
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:10,203
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

598
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:14,294
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

599
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,372
Oh!

600
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:20,247
It rides purty smooth.

601
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:23,793
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

602
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:27,250
Oh!

603
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,523
Red.

604
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,306
Who do you think you are?

605
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:36,537
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

606
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:39,900
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

607
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,332
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

608
00:40:42,397 --> 00:40:45,877
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

609
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,378
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

610
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:51,511
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

611
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:55,226
- What?
- Me and you. That a joke?

612
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,562
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

613
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,215
If I win, you do the road my way.

614
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:01,746
Doc, what're you doin'?

615
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:03,865
I don't mean to be rude here,

616
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:07,511
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

617
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:10,003
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

618
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:14,550
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

619
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,643
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

620
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:23,027
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

621
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:25,916
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

622
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:28,403
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

623
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:33,398
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

624
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,160
and no lollygaggin'.

625
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:36,723
Speed. I'm speed.

626
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,252
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

627
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:45,049
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

628
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:47,539
- Peet stop!
- Uh...

629
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:50,363
The race is only one lap, guys.

630
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,818
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

631
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:56,570
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

632
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:01,531
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

633
00:42:01,629 --> 00:42:03,538
Gentlemen...

634
00:42:04,157 --> 00:42:06,874
...start your engines!

635
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:15,642
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

636
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:18,677
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

637
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,281
Luigi?

638
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,415
On your mark, get set...

639
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:25,624
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

640
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:31,160
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

641
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,570
Huh?

642
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:43,602
Doc... the flag means go.

643
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:46,873
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

644
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,559
Doc, what are you doing, man?

645
00:42:49,629 --> 00:42:53,044
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

646
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:56,117
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

647
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:58,839
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

648
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,852
You got your tow cable?

649
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,022
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

650
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:06,297
Oh, just in case.

651
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,598
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

652
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:18,327
No, no, no, no, no!

653
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:20,763
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

654
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,673
- Ow!
- Bad trip, man.

655
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:32,467
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

656
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,810
I'm confused.

657
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:36,884
You drive like you fix roads.

658
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:40,023
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

659
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:45,433
Ah!

660
00:43:46,141 --> 00:43:48,989
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

661
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:52,053
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

662
00:43:55,037 --> 00:43:56,892
I can make a little turn on dirt.

663
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:58,332
You think?

664
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:02,674
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

665
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:05,116
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

666
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:08,028
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

667
00:44:08,093 --> 00:44:10,362
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

668
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:14,706
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

669
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:16,308
Nah, not me, Flo.

670
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:18,748
I'm on one of them there special diets.

671
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:23,221
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

672
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:25,944
"You race like you fix roads. "

673
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:30,585
I'll show him.
I will show him!

674
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:42,746
Oh, great! I hate it!

675
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,293
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

676
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:49,908
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

677
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,599
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

678
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:55,571
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

679
00:44:58,013 --> 00:45:01,657
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

680
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:15,187
Wow.

681
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,143
Mornin', Sally!

682
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:22,199
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

683
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:24,211
Yes! Uh, amazing!

684
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:28,149
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

685
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,246
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

686
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,772
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

687
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:38,805
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

688
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:40,982
<i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

689
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:44,631
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

690
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:46,777
Boy, I tell you what.

691
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,562
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

692
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,222
Doc, look at this!

693
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:54,107
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

694
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:57,522
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

695
00:45:57,597 --> 00:46:00,444
Guido, look at Luigi!

696
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,679
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

697
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:06,065
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

698
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:10,265
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

699
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,495
That crazy old devil woman.

700
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:17,210
Oh!

701
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,033
She's right!

702
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,595
- Ah!
- Guido!

703
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:24,280
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

704
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:29,145
Well, now... where the heck is he?

705
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,847
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

706
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:41,146
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

707
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:43,482
and asked me if he could
come down here.

708
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:45,851
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

709
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:48,634
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

710
00:46:49,085 --> 00:46:51,506
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

711
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:57,426
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

712
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,842
I'll keep an eye on him.

713
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:02,651
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

714
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:18,811
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

715
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:21,495
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

716
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:24,761
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

717
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:28,178
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

718
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:31,188
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

719
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,228
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

720
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:35,894
I'll put it simple.

721
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:39,958
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

722
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:46,172
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

723
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:47,960
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

724
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:51,476
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

725
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:57,435
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

726
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:06,619
Turn right to go left.

727
00:48:07,836 --> 00:48:09,746
Hmm...

728
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:10,835
Whoa!

729
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:14,491
Oh!

730
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:18,738
Ow! Oh, that...

731
00:48:20,253 --> 00:48:23,482
Ow!

732
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,991
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

733
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:31,028
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

734
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:34,362
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

735
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:38,203
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

736
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,212
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

737
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:52,475
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

738
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:56,882
Oh, Lord.

739
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:58,517
Mater!

740
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:00,661
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

741
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,896
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

742
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:06,681
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

743
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:09,115
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

744
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:11,766
Oh...

745
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:14,390
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

746
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:16,916
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

747
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:20,120
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

748
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:22,392
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

749
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,402
You make-a such a nice new road.

750
00:49:24,477 --> 00:49:27,030
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

751
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:28,628
Even though you not a Ferrari.

752
00:49:28,701 --> 00:49:32,629
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

753
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:36,410
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

754
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:39,859
I like your style, eh?

755
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:43,348
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

756
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:46,737
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

757
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,405
Oh, would you look at that?

758
00:49:48,477 --> 00:49:50,517
Ramone, Ramone!

759
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,596
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

760
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:55,538
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

761
00:49:55,612 --> 00:49:59,093
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

762
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:03,671
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

763
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,490
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

764
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:08,949
Ah!

765
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:11,060
Stop! Let me...

766
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:15,130
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

767
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:17,139
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

768
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:20,409
Stop, stop! That's cold!

769
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,865
Help! Please! Stop!

770
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,169
Thanks, Red.

771
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,567
What was that for?

772
00:50:28,637 --> 00:50:30,677
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

773
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:32,178
If you do, you gotta be clean.

774
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:34,674
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

775
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:36,407
What, I...? I don't get it.

776
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:38,965
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

777
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:42,135
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

778
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:46,645
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

779
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:50,426
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

780
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,794
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

781
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,992
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

782
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:59,127
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

783
00:50:59,197 --> 00:51:02,513
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

784
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:06,550
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

785
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:09,850
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

786
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:13,431
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

787
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:16,732
Cone number one, if you want.

788
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,058
Oh...

789
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:24,726
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

790
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:27,764
Oh...
That's just a... Oh!

791
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:33,433
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

792
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:36,021
Gonna... Yeah.

793
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:43,060
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

794
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,561
Good-lookin' girl.

795
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:47,801
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

796
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,218
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

797
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:54,651
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

798
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:58,677
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

799
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,742
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

800
00:52:02,813 --> 00:52:06,228
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

801
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:08,505
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

802
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,263
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

803
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:13,202
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

804
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:15,513
I can handle anything.

805
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,217
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it!

806
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:23,859
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

807
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,267
All right, listen.

808
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:30,162
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

809
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:31,992
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

810
00:52:32,956 --> 00:52:34,844
Mater!

811
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:36,283
Wait, Mater!

812
00:52:37,981 --> 00:52:39,290
OK, here's what you do.

813
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:42,619
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

814
00:52:42,685 --> 00:52:45,074
And they do the rest. Watch this.

815
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:53,593
Oh!

816
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,646
Oh... Oh! Oh...

817
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:08,277
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

818
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:11,993
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

819
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,548
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

820
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,892
Oh!

821
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:23,412
Oh! Oh...

822
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:30,162
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

823
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:31,928
Oh, your turn, bud.

824
00:53:31,997 --> 00:53:34,298
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

825
00:53:34,364 --> 00:53:36,503
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

826
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:40,858
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

827
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,022
That's Frank.

828
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:52,361
Run!

829
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:54,341
Here he comes, look out!

830
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:56,872
Whoa!

831
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:02,603
Run! He's gonna get ya!

832
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,214
Oh! Customers!

833
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,810
Oh!

834
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:28,070
Ah, no, no, no.

835
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:29,801
Oof! Oh!

836
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:34,061
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

837
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:37,476
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

838
00:55:37,743 --> 00:55:41,671
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

839
00:55:41,743 --> 00:55:43,598
Oh, yeah... yeah.

840
00:55:43,663 --> 00:55:46,630
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

841
00:55:46,703 --> 00:55:49,769
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

842
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:50,788
Oh...

843
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:55,915
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

844
00:55:55,983 --> 00:56:00,074
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

845
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:03,886
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

846
00:56:03,952 --> 00:56:06,570
Where, where?

847
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,128
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

848
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,272
- Yes, you do.
- No way.

849
00:56:11,343 --> 00:56:12,488
- Way.
- Come on, look...

850
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,893
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

851
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,520
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

852
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:18,380
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

853
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:20,390
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

854
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,925
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

855
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,909
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

856
00:56:23,983 --> 00:56:27,147
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

857
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:31,917
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

858
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:34,983
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

859
00:56:35,055 --> 00:56:37,608
What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

860
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:39,021
Mater? Mater!

861
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:42,543
Mater!

862
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:54,605
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

863
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:01,100
Oof!

864
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,429
Yee-hee!

865
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,668
He's nuts.

866
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:10,057
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

867
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:14,410
Just need to know where I've been.

868
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,479
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

869
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:21,381
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

870
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:24,554
Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

871
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:28,006
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

872
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:33,033
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

873
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:35,340
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

874
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:38,310
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

875
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:41,799
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

876
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:43,465
with private helicopters.

877
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:46,667
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

878
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:48,775
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

879
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:53,992
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

880
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:57,096
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

881
00:57:57,423 --> 00:58:01,930
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

882
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:06,407
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

883
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,163
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

884
00:58:09,231 --> 00:58:10,922
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

885
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:14,795
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

886
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,620
In what?

887
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:19,342
My best friend.

888
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,178
See you tomorrow, buddy!

889
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:30,564
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,</i>

890
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,153
<i>K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!</i>

891
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:39,367
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

892
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:46,348
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

893
00:58:47,312 --> 00:58:49,701
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

894
00:58:51,215 --> 00:58:53,735
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

895
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:55,847
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

896
00:58:55,919 --> 00:58:58,886
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

897
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:01,577
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

898
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:04,266
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

899
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:06,245
Something about a helicopter ride.

900
00:59:06,704 --> 00:59:09,354
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

901
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:11,246
- Did you mean it?
- What?

902
00:59:11,312 --> 00:59:13,254
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

903
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:16,230
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

904
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,213
Uh-huh.

905
00:59:18,287 --> 00:59:21,353
You know... Mater trusts you.

906
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:24,941
Yeah, OK.

907
00:59:25,007 --> 00:59:27,592
- Did you mean that?
- What?

908
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:33,065
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

909
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,689
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

910
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:39,116
Yeah, OK. G'night.

911
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:42,568
Oh...

912
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,745
Hey, thank you.

913
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,552
What did you just say?

914
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:51,336
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

915
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:55,117
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

916
00:59:55,183 --> 00:59:58,598
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

917
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,892
- G'night.
- Good night.

918
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,364
Hmm.

919
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,121
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

920
01:00:25,195 --> 01:00:28,872
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

921
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,865
Ah!

922
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,099
No!

923
01:00:54,028 --> 01:00:57,192
No!

924
01:00:57,547 --> 01:00:58,922
I gotta get outta here!

925
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,186
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

926
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:05,383
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

927
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:08,801
I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

928
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,915
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

929
01:01:10,987 --> 01:01:13,540
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

930
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:16,000
Hope you enjoyed the show!

931
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:30,759
Whoa, Doc.

932
01:01:30,827 --> 01:01:34,405
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

933
01:01:49,612 --> 01:01:51,368
What?

934
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:55,111
He has a Piston Cup?

935
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:03,590
Oh, my gosh.

936
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,850
Three Piston Cups?

937
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,577
Sign says stay out.

938
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:23,875
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

939
01:02:23,947 --> 01:02:26,915
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

940
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:29,890
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

941
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:32,385
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

942
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,118
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

943
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:37,700
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.

944
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:40,389
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.

945
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:43,077
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

946
01:02:43,147 --> 01:02:46,443
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

947
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:56,552
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

948
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,342
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

949
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:01,510
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!

950
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:05,157
- Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

951
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:06,242
There he is.

952
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:09,185
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

953
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:14,950
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

954
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:17,507
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

955
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,751
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

956
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:22,983
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

957
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:25,026
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

958
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,547
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

959
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:32,329
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

960
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,631
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

961
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,739
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

962
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:39,113
I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.

963
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:41,830
- Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.

964
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:43,590
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

965
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:49,186
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?

966
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,845
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

967
01:03:52,748 --> 01:03:54,984
Hmm... I trust him.

968
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,119
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

969
01:03:58,187 --> 01:03:59,431
Yeah, a drive.

970
01:03:59,499 --> 01:04:02,499
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

971
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:05,157
Ah... No. No, we don't.

972
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:30,408
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

973
01:04:35,979 --> 01:04:37,124
Mm-hm!

974
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:40,512
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

975
01:04:40,588 --> 01:04:42,922
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

976
01:04:43,915 --> 01:04:45,803
That's so too much!

977
01:04:47,755 --> 01:04:50,122
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

978
01:04:50,188 --> 01:04:52,097
I don't know.

979
01:04:56,779 --> 01:04:58,688
Whoa! Yes.

980
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,388
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

981
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:19,972
Bleah!

982
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,266
Oh!

983
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,277
Wow. What is this place?

984
01:06:46,955 --> 01:06:48,265
Wheel Well.

985
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:51,462
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

986
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:57,573
This place?

987
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:03,010
Yeah, imagine.

988
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,237
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

989
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,977
You know, I don't get you.

990
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:14,150
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

991
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:16,324
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

992
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:20,389
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

993
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:23,875
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

994
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:27,209
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

995
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:30,467
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

996
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:32,230
And you know what?

997
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:35,779
It never felt... happy.

998
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:40,322
Yeah. I mean... really?

999
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,053
Yeah. So I left California.

1000
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:45,287
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1001
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,678
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1002
01:07:48,747 --> 01:07:51,617
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1003
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:54,469
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1004
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:57,256
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1005
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,901
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1006
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:05,152
I fell in love.

1007
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:08,740
- Oh.
- Yep.

1008
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:12,230
- Corvette?
- No.

1009
01:08:17,547 --> 01:08:20,198
I fell in love with this.

1010
01:08:31,723 --> 01:08:35,301
Whoa. Look at that.

1011
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:38,376
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1012
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:40,548
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1013
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:43,751
Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1014
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,439
Oh, yeah?

1015
01:08:46,507 --> 01:08:50,250
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1016
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:52,288
Really?

1017
01:08:52,363 --> 01:08:54,949
Yeah. Back then,

1018
01:08:55,019 --> 01:08:57,768
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1019
01:08:58,987 --> 01:09:00,264
How do you mean?

1020
01:09:00,331 --> 01:09:03,593
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1021
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:07,685
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1022
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:11,041
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1023
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,559
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1024
01:09:15,627 --> 01:09:18,082
They drove on it to have a great time.

1025
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:53,001
Well, what happened?

1026
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:56,383
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1027
01:11:19,019 --> 01:11:22,467
How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1028
01:11:22,538 --> 01:11:25,222
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1029
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,804
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1030
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:32,388
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1031
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,215
I had a great time.

1032
01:11:34,283 --> 01:11:36,901
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1033
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:39,587
You're welcome.

1034
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,877
Hey, listen, listen!

1035
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:50,915
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1036
01:11:50,986 --> 01:11:52,994
Wha... what?

1037
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,666
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1038
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:21,639
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

1039
01:12:21,706 --> 01:12:25,154
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

1040
01:12:25,227 --> 01:12:27,431
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1041
01:12:27,499 --> 01:12:30,401
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1042
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:32,872
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1043
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:34,826
There's one goin' this way.

1044
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,860
I got it.

1045
01:12:41,227 --> 01:12:43,431
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

1046
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:45,670
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1047
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:47,048
No, no, no, no, come here.

1048
01:12:47,115 --> 01:12:48,424
What are you doing?

1049
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:51,076
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1050
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,640
...alone.

1051
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:07,653
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

1052
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:16,262
Come on, Doc, drive.

1053
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:32,678
Ah... Yeah.

1054
01:14:32,747 --> 01:14:34,340
- Wow.
- Huh?

1055
01:14:34,411 --> 01:14:35,938
You're amazing!

1056
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:40,006
What are you doin'?

1057
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,700
Doc, wait!

1058
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:47,753
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1059
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:53,605
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1060
01:14:53,675 --> 01:14:56,839
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1061
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:58,663
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1062
01:14:58,731 --> 01:15:01,600
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1063
01:15:01,674 --> 01:15:03,584
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1064
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:06,593
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1065
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:09,482
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1066
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:13,641
You think I quit?

1067
01:15:25,707 --> 01:15:27,332
Right.

1068
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,467
Your big wreck in '54.

1069
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,382
They quit on me.

1070
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,865
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1071
01:15:36,938 --> 01:15:39,720
You know what they said?
"You're history. "

1072
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:42,721
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1073
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:47,589
There was a lot left in me.

1074
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:51,168
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1075
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:56,481
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1076
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,644
I just never expected that
that world would...

1077
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:02,820
...would find me here.

1078
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:06,370
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1079
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:07,391
No, I'm not.

1080
01:16:07,466 --> 01:16:11,143
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1081
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:15,618
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1082
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:20,256
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1083
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:24,262
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1084
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:27,875
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1085
01:16:28,426 --> 01:16:30,368
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

1086
01:16:30,442 --> 01:16:32,581
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1087
01:16:33,226 --> 01:16:35,201
Who's caring about only himself?

1088
01:16:35,275 --> 01:16:37,958
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1089
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:54,116
Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?

1090
01:16:54,187 --> 01:16:56,521
Respect the classics, man.

1091
01:17:05,866 --> 01:17:08,550
Ah...

1092
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,208
He's done.

1093
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:26,373
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1094
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:28,581
Good riddance.

1095
01:17:36,138 --> 01:17:37,513
He's gone?

1096
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:40,481
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

1097
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:49,863
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!

1098
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,778
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

1099
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:53,988
I'm glad he's gone!

1100
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,053
What's wrong with Red?

1101
01:18:02,122 --> 01:18:05,384
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town

1102
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,265
and went to your big race to win
the Piston Cup

1103
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:11,080
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life

1104
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:16,449
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1105
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,110
Wait a minute!

1106
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:27,175
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1107
01:18:27,243 --> 01:18:29,861
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.

1108
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:33,444
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1109
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:34,627
Thank you, Sheriff.

1110
01:18:34,698 --> 01:18:36,738
But you know I can't go just yet.

1111
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:38,239
Well, why not?

1112
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:41,032
I'm not sure these tires...

1113
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:43,881
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?

1114
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:47,077
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?

1115
01:18:47,147 --> 01:18:48,427
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1116
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,183
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!

1117
01:18:50,378 --> 01:18:52,866
<i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>

1118
01:18:52,938 --> 01:18:56,866
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!

1119
01:18:56,938 --> 01:19:00,386
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1120
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:04,168
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!

1121
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:08,064
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1122
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,444
No! No, no, no.

1123
01:19:09,514 --> 01:19:12,743
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.

1124
01:19:13,835 --> 01:19:18,025
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.

1125
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,497
But-a this...

1126
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:21,542
Whitewall tires!

1127
01:19:21,611 --> 01:19:26,564
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me. "

1128
01:19:26,634 --> 01:19:28,357
All right, you're the expert.

1129
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:31,241
Don't forget the spare.

1130
01:19:31,306 --> 01:19:34,023
<i>- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!</i>

1131
01:19:44,938 --> 01:19:47,753
What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1132
01:19:47,818 --> 01:19:51,135
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1133
01:19:51,883 --> 01:19:52,995
Eh... No.

1134
01:19:56,714 --> 01:20:00,162
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1135
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:02,143
It's a conspiracy, man!

1136
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:04,585
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1137
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:07,749
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1138
01:20:07,818 --> 01:20:09,858
OK, I'll take a case.

1139
01:20:24,298 --> 01:20:25,705
Ow! Eh!

1140
01:20:34,186 --> 01:20:35,746
Ah... Yeah.

1141
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,728
Ka-chow.

1142
01:20:38,571 --> 01:20:41,418
- Here she comes!
- Places, everybody. Hurry!

1143
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,140
Act natural.

1144
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:44,487
<i>- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!</i>

1145
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:46,310
All right, what's goin' on?

1146
01:20:46,378 --> 01:20:48,451
Ladies and gentlecars,

1147
01:20:48,523 --> 01:20:52,297
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!

1148
01:20:52,906 --> 01:20:54,816
Pow! What do you think?

1149
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,996
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.

1150
01:20:57,067 --> 01:20:58,790
I'll say.

1151
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:01,924
Ka-chow.

1152
01:21:01,994 --> 01:21:04,416
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1153
01:21:05,258 --> 01:21:08,258
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1154
01:21:08,331 --> 01:21:10,087
Yeah, everybody except one.

1155
01:21:11,274 --> 01:21:16,063
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1156
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:19,040
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1157
01:21:19,114 --> 01:21:21,219
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1158
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,918
They fixed their neon!

1159
01:21:54,026 --> 01:21:58,815
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1160
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:06,151
Just like in its heyday, right?

1161
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:09,447
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1162
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:37,128
Shall we cruise?

1163
01:22:37,194 --> 01:22:39,431
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1164
01:22:39,498 --> 01:22:40,905
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1165
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:45,127
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1166
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:47,944
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1167
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:51,239
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1168
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:01,640
...and again and I said, "No. "
He asked me again, and I said, "No. "

1169
01:23:01,706 --> 01:23:05,863
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1170
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:09,192
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive. "

1171
01:23:11,274 --> 01:23:14,143
Oh!

1172
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,354
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1173
01:23:20,426 --> 01:23:22,630
Good evenin', you two.

1174
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:30,053
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1175
01:23:33,994 --> 01:23:37,639
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1176
01:23:37,706 --> 01:23:43,140
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1177
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,698
Not that. That.

1178
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:45,834
Customers?

1179
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:48,070
Customers?

1180
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:50,691
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1181
01:23:50,762 --> 01:23:52,835
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1182
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:56,418
It's the ghostlight!

1183
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,977
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1184
01:23:59,818 --> 01:24:01,225
McQueen, over here!

1185
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:03,940
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1186
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,050
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1187
01:24:06,122 --> 01:24:08,740
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1188
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,759
Stickers!

1189
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:11,906
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1190
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:14,345
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1191
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:17,476
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1192
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:19,073
Sally! Sally!

1193
01:24:19,146 --> 01:24:21,121
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1194
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:22,853
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1195
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:25,223
Come on, give us some bolt!

1196
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:29,600
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1197
01:24:29,674 --> 01:24:32,903
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1198
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:36,679
You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1199
01:24:36,746 --> 01:24:39,365
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1200
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:41,223
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1201
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:43,778
<i>Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?</i>

1202
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:46,272
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1203
01:24:47,818 --> 01:24:50,633
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1204
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:53,830
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1205
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:56,064
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1206
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:57,918
- Harv?
- Come on!

1207
01:24:57,994 --> 01:25:00,579
<i>- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?</i>

1208
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,203
<i>My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!</i>

1209
01:25:03,274 --> 01:25:05,379
<i>- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.</i>

1210
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:09,673
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1211
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,673
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?</i>

1212
01:25:12,746 --> 01:25:15,113
<i>That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1213
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:17,382
<i>Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1214
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,871
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1215
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:23,011
<i>- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1216
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:24,227
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1217
01:25:24,298 --> 01:25:27,975
<i>While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1218
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:29,667
<i>- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!</i>

1219
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:33,218
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1220
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:35,363
<i>- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?</i>

1221
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:38,914
<i>You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1222
01:25:38,986 --> 01:25:42,117
<i>- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1223
01:25:42,186 --> 01:25:46,016
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1224
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,748
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1225
01:25:47,914 --> 01:25:49,539
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1226
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:52,742
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1227
01:25:56,714 --> 01:25:59,397
Sally, I... I want you to...

1228
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:02,977
Look, I wish...

1229
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:07,144
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1230
01:26:09,226 --> 01:26:14,212
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1231
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:20,292
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1232
01:26:20,362 --> 01:26:23,461
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1233
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,148
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1234
01:26:26,218 --> 01:26:28,357
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1235
01:26:30,634 --> 01:26:33,536
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1236
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,617
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1237
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,789
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1238
01:26:38,858 --> 01:26:40,865
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1239
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:49,125
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?</i>

1240
01:26:49,194 --> 01:26:51,463
<i>- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1241
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:54,115
<i>You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.</i>

1242
01:26:54,186 --> 01:26:56,390
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1243
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,328
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1244
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,164
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1245
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:13,287
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1246
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:15,655
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1247
01:27:23,786 --> 01:27:27,364
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1248
01:27:27,978 --> 01:27:30,978
Best for everyone or best for you?

1249
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,477
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1250
01:28:46,602 --> 01:28:49,799
Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1251
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,070
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1252
01:28:52,138 --> 01:28:54,276
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1253
01:28:54,345 --> 01:28:56,712
There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1254
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:59,233
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1255
01:28:59,306 --> 01:29:03,462
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1256
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,985
The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1257
01:29:06,058 --> 01:29:09,255
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1258
01:29:09,322 --> 01:29:12,420
I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1259
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:16,319
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1260
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:18,630
In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1261
01:29:18,697 --> 01:29:22,626
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century. "

1262
01:29:22,698 --> 01:29:25,218
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1263
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:29,218
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1264
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:32,257
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1265
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,279
He's hot!

1266
01:29:33,353 --> 01:29:35,906
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1267
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:38,945
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1268
01:29:39,018 --> 01:29:41,439
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1269
01:29:41,514 --> 01:29:44,329
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1270
01:29:44,394 --> 01:29:47,045
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1271
01:29:47,114 --> 01:29:50,114
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1272
01:29:50,186 --> 01:29:54,942
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1273
01:29:55,018 --> 01:29:58,760
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1274
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,036
Sorry, pal.

1275
01:30:00,106 --> 01:30:04,197
OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1276
01:30:04,937 --> 01:30:07,621
I am speed.

1277
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:10,435
Victory.

1278
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:12,546
One winner, two losers.

1279
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:19,873
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1280
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:26,368
Lightnin'! You ready?

1281
01:30:26,442 --> 01:30:29,028
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1282
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:44,551
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1283
01:30:44,618 --> 01:30:47,106
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1284
01:30:47,177 --> 01:30:49,479
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1285
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,814
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1286
01:31:08,393 --> 01:31:09,735
Uh-oh

1287
01:31:20,169 --> 01:31:23,017
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1288
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,317
And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1289
01:31:25,386 --> 01:31:28,385
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1290
01:31:28,457 --> 01:31:30,759
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1291
01:31:30,825 --> 01:31:33,760
Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1292
01:31:34,858 --> 01:31:37,858
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1293
01:31:39,113 --> 01:31:41,350
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1294
01:31:41,418 --> 01:31:44,200
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1295
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:47,135
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1296
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:50,243
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1297
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,784
Agh! Shoot!

1298
01:31:58,858 --> 01:32:01,858
Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1299
01:32:07,882 --> 01:32:09,376
Come on, you can do it!

1300
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,392
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1301
01:32:12,554 --> 01:32:15,620
Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1302
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:18,788
McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1303
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:22,946
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1304
01:32:23,017 --> 01:32:25,319
Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1305
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:27,044
He lost momentum,

1306
01:32:27,113 --> 01:32:29,317
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1307
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:40,320
McQueen spins out in the infield!

1308
01:32:44,137 --> 01:32:46,625
Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1309
01:32:46,698 --> 01:32:50,080
McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1310
01:32:51,209 --> 01:32:55,104
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1311
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:56,552
I don't think I...

1312
01:32:56,617 --> 01:32:59,235
I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1313
01:32:59,466 --> 01:33:00,927
Doc?

1314
01:33:03,497 --> 01:33:06,018
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1315
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:09,701
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1316
01:33:09,769 --> 01:33:11,592
You said you'd never come back.

1317
01:33:11,658 --> 01:33:15,106
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1318
01:33:15,177 --> 01:33:17,960
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1319
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:25,119
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1320
01:33:25,194 --> 01:33:28,325
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1321
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,303
Now, get back out there!

1322
01:33:32,457 --> 01:33:35,305
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1323
01:33:35,369 --> 01:33:37,573
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1324
01:33:37,641 --> 01:33:40,674
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1325
01:33:40,745 --> 01:33:42,371
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1326
01:33:42,441 --> 01:33:45,703
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1327
01:33:56,938 --> 01:33:58,760
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1328
01:33:58,825 --> 01:34:02,437
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1329
01:34:02,505 --> 01:34:05,025
It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1330
01:34:05,097 --> 01:34:07,399
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1331
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:10,051
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1332
01:34:10,122 --> 01:34:13,318
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1333
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:19,711
<i>Wow, this is history
in the making.</i>

1334
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,567
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!</i>

1335
01:34:22,633 --> 01:34:23,975
Hey, Doc!

1336
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:28,035
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1337
01:34:32,746 --> 01:34:36,390
- McQueen passes on the inside!
- He's nearly a lap down.

1338
01:34:36,457 --> 01:34:39,239
Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1339
01:34:39,305 --> 01:34:42,088
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1340
01:34:42,154 --> 01:34:43,681
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1341
01:34:43,753 --> 01:34:46,536
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1342
01:34:46,602 --> 01:34:49,897
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1343
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:53,505
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1344
01:34:53,578 --> 01:34:56,611
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1345
01:35:10,473 --> 01:35:13,157
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1346
01:35:14,665 --> 01:35:15,876
What do you think of this?

1347
01:35:15,946 --> 01:35:18,018
Yeah, that's it, kid.

1348
01:35:21,193 --> 01:35:22,437
What?

1349
01:35:22,505 --> 01:35:24,229
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1350
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:30,020
- I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1351
01:35:30,089 --> 01:35:32,937
What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1352
01:35:33,001 --> 01:35:34,757
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1353
01:35:34,825 --> 01:35:37,859
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1354
01:35:41,353 --> 01:35:44,419
Look at that boy go out there!

1355
01:35:49,897 --> 01:35:52,101
Oh!

1356
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:54,495
No, you don't.

1357
01:35:57,449 --> 01:35:59,358
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1358
01:35:59,433 --> 01:36:02,728
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1359
01:36:02,794 --> 01:36:05,958
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1360
01:36:07,817 --> 01:36:09,857
We gotta get him
back out there fast

1361
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:12,744
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1362
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,881
Guido! It's time.

1363
01:36:18,985 --> 01:36:21,952
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1364
01:36:30,697 --> 01:36:32,071
I don't believe it!

1365
01:36:32,137 --> 01:36:33,763
That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1366
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:36,288
It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1367
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:37,987
It's gonna be close.

1368
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,960
Yeah, baby!

1369
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:43,334
<i>He's back in!</i>

1370
01:36:44,617 --> 01:36:45,566
Peet stop.

1371
01:36:46,954 --> 01:36:48,808
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1372
01:37:03,465 --> 01:37:06,400
This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1373
01:37:06,473 --> 01:37:08,742
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1374
01:37:08,809 --> 01:37:12,192
A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1375
01:37:12,266 --> 01:37:13,476
This is it, kiddo.

1376
01:37:13,545 --> 01:37:15,934
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1377
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,344
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1378
01:37:18,409 --> 01:37:19,751
Go!

1379
01:37:22,345 --> 01:37:23,425
We'll see about that!

1380
01:37:24,873 --> 01:37:26,367
McQueen's going inside!

1381
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:32,127
- Chick and King are loose!
- I think McQueen's out!

1382
01:37:42,378 --> 01:37:44,744
- McQueen saved it!
- He's back on the track!

1383
01:37:45,129 --> 01:37:47,682
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1384
01:37:48,713 --> 01:37:52,193
Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1385
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:56,575
Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1386
01:37:56,649 --> 01:37:58,656
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1387
01:38:00,105 --> 01:38:03,750
I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1388
01:38:13,673 --> 01:38:15,495
Oh, no!

1389
01:38:33,257 --> 01:38:35,363
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1390
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:39,012
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1391
01:38:40,265 --> 01:38:42,305
What's he up to, Doc?

1392
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:53,575
What are you doin', kid?

1393
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:56,740
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1394
01:38:59,785 --> 01:39:02,655
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1395
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:06,177
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1396
01:39:06,249 --> 01:39:08,224
It's just an empty cup.

1397
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,705
Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1398
01:39:12,778 --> 01:39:16,291
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1399
01:39:16,362 --> 01:39:18,565
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1400
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:21,219
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1401
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:23,460
That's what I call racin'.

1402
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:41,696
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!</i>

1403
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:44,257
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1404
01:39:44,329 --> 01:39:48,672
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1405
01:39:50,633 --> 01:39:53,928
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1406
01:39:53,993 --> 01:39:55,335
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1407
01:39:55,401 --> 01:39:58,249
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1408
01:39:58,313 --> 01:40:01,313
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1409
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:03,524
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1410
01:40:03,593 --> 01:40:07,041
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1411
01:40:07,113 --> 01:40:10,277
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1412
01:40:10,345 --> 01:40:11,752
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1413
01:40:11,913 --> 01:40:13,375
- Boo!
- Boo!

1414
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:16,417
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1415
01:40:16,489 --> 01:40:18,497
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1416
01:40:24,169 --> 01:40:26,558
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1417
01:40:28,874 --> 01:40:31,208
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1418
01:40:31,273 --> 01:40:33,183
You're The King! Yeah!

1419
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:46,493
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1420
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:52,098
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1421
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:53,890
Thanks, Doc.

1422
01:40:54,985 --> 01:40:56,262
Hey, Lightnin'.

1423
01:40:56,329 --> 01:40:58,882
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1424
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:02,655
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1425
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:05,379
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1426
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,304
But I didn't win.

1427
01:41:11,369 --> 01:41:14,882
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1428
01:41:14,954 --> 01:41:17,539
He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1429
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:21,603
buzzards used to circle the car!

1430
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,332
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1431
01:41:23,401 --> 01:41:26,979
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1432
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:30,115
I'm gonna stick with them.

1433
01:41:30,185 --> 01:41:33,120
Well, I sure can respect that.

1434
01:41:33,194 --> 01:41:34,306
Still, you know,

1435
01:41:34,377 --> 01:41:38,087
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1436
01:41:38,153 --> 01:41:40,574
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1437
01:41:41,993 --> 01:41:44,862
Actually, there is one thing.

1438
01:41:45,545 --> 01:41:47,683
Whoo-hoo!

1439
01:41:47,753 --> 01:41:51,462
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1440
01:41:55,785 --> 01:41:58,654
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1441
01:42:02,153 --> 01:42:04,357
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1442
01:42:07,369 --> 01:42:10,664
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1443
01:42:10,729 --> 01:42:11,678
to get tires.

1444
01:42:11,753 --> 01:42:15,779
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1445
01:42:15,849 --> 01:42:20,835
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1446
01:42:20,905 --> 01:42:23,109
A real Ferrari!

1447
01:42:23,177 --> 01:42:25,217
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1448
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:28,605
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1449
01:42:29,865 --> 01:42:33,280
<i>Wow.
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>

1450
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:35,590
<i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>

1451
01:42:51,209 --> 01:42:52,670
Just passin' through?

1452
01:42:52,745 --> 01:42:54,949
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1453
01:42:55,017 --> 01:42:58,148
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1454
01:42:58,217 --> 01:43:01,829
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1455
01:43:01,897 --> 01:43:04,264
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1456
01:43:04,329 --> 01:43:07,046
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1457
01:43:07,113 --> 01:43:09,502
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1458
01:43:09,577 --> 01:43:13,538
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1459
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:15,681
blah, blah, blah.

1460
01:43:16,073 --> 01:43:18,942
<i>McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,</i>

1461
01:43:19,017 --> 01:43:23,457
<i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>

1462
01:43:23,817 --> 01:43:25,704
Great timing, Mater!

1463
01:43:25,768 --> 01:43:29,598
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

1464
01:43:29,673 --> 01:43:32,007
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1465
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:34,888
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1466
01:43:34,953 --> 01:43:37,539
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1467
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:40,097
Hmm... Nah.

1468
01:43:41,769 --> 01:43:43,913
Yeah! Ka-chow!

1469
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:50,142
Ah-choo!

1470
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,709
All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1471
01:44:55,784 --> 01:45:00,356
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1472
01:45:00,424 --> 01:45:03,271
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1473
01:45:03,336 --> 01:45:07,231
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1474
01:45:07,304 --> 01:45:10,620
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1475
01:45:10,696 --> 01:45:14,340
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1476
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:20,577
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1477
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:23,070
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1478
01:45:23,144 --> 01:45:26,079
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

1479
01:45:30,184 --> 01:45:32,039
Doc! Doc!

1480
01:45:32,328 --> 01:45:33,735
Whoo-ah!

1481
01:45:34,184 --> 01:45:36,289
Not all my tricks, rookie!

1482
01:45:52,232 --> 01:45:55,581
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.

1483
01:45:55,656 --> 01:45:58,951
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!

1484
01:45:59,016 --> 01:46:02,693
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!

1485
01:46:02,952 --> 01:46:05,734
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

1486
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,709
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1487
01:46:07,784 --> 01:46:10,501
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

1488
01:46:13,032 --> 01:46:14,941
Huh? Look at this!

1489
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:17,089
It's my hood! It's my hood!

1490
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:20,127
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

1491
01:46:20,712 --> 01:46:24,509
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

1492
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,170
Oh, dang.

1493
01:46:36,136 --> 01:46:39,519
<i>You are a toy car!</i>

1494
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:44,164
<i>You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>

1495
01:46:44,552 --> 01:46:47,170
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>

1496
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:50,785
<i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!</i>

1497
01:46:50,856 --> 01:46:53,125
<i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>

1498
01:46:53,192 --> 01:46:56,388
Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

1499
01:46:56,456 --> 01:46:58,911
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

1500
01:46:59,432 --> 01:47:03,458
<i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!</i>

1501
01:47:03,528 --> 01:47:07,140
<i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!</i>

1502
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:11,299
<i>- You're still not listening!
- Ah!</i>

1503
01:47:11,368 --> 01:47:14,849
<i>Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?</i>

1504
01:47:15,144 --> 01:47:18,690
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

1505
01:47:19,207 --> 01:47:21,117
<i>Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!</i>

1506
01:47:21,192 --> 01:47:22,533
<i>Circus cars?</i>

1507
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,967
<i>How can you be circus cars?</i>

1508
01:47:25,032 --> 01:47:27,453
<i>These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,</i>

1509
01:47:27,528 --> 01:47:29,438
<i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>

1510
01:47:29,512 --> 01:47:30,592
Wait a minute here.

1511
01:47:30,664 --> 01:47:33,031
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

1512
01:47:33,096 --> 01:47:35,551
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

1513
01:50:52,968 --> 01:50:57,441
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?

1514
01:50:57,512 --> 01:51:01,570
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
