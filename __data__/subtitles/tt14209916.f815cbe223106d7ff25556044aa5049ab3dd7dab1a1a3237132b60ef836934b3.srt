1
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,723
Yeah!

2
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,763
You know
the first thing I thought

3
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,668
when I saw you?

4
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,502
I thought, I want to make
a child with that person.

5
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,147
What if it's a her?

6
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,978
What would you call her?

7
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,252
Ragni, maybe.

8
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,788
Sorry?

9
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,583
Ragni.

10
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,183
Let me think about
that for a second.

11
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,819
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

12
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,363
- Boy's name?
- Texas.

13
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,291
You kidding me?

14
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,632
- Texas is, like, a state, you know?
- I know.

15
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,933
There's about
three or four hours

16
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,974
till we reach the peak.

17
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,166
Ah, great.

18
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,852
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

19
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,545
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

20
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,157
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

21
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,658
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

22
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,125
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

23
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,129
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

24
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,131
to use your brother's band.

25
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,564
- Why not?
- Honey...

26
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,191
He's super, super good.

27
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,134
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,297
And he even takes
vocal lessons now.

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,340
Yeah, I know this.

30
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,309
I know this. It's just that,
well, Eric is no good.

31
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,813
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

32
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,246
His singing is like shit.

33
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,413
Hey. I mean,
he has a nice b...

34
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,717
Olaf!

35
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,058
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, God.

36
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,559
Wait for me.

37
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,221
Why are you so sensitive?

38
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,170
Told you I could
get us here.

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,877
It's beautiful.

40
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,914
Thank you.
I love you.

41
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,357
Elsa.

42
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,458
- Look. Look.
- What is it?

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,932
Look.

44
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,898
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,941
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

46
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,545
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

47
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,876
We have such good luck
in nature.

48
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,952
What do you see?

49
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,329
It's demented or something.

50
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,564
What?

51
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,062
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera.

52
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,798
Demented?

53
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,765
I think
we should leave it.

54
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,637
It's something wrong
with it. Come on.

55
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,767
Come on...

56
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,108
- Come on.
- It's so cute.

57
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,014
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,347
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

59
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,855
Oh, sweetie, now,
of course not.

60
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,983
Oh, fuck.

61
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,520
Don't panic.

62
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,654
What do we do?

63
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,494
If it's black, fight back.

64
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,500
If it's brown, lay down.

65
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,104
But is it black
or is it brown?

66
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,501
I mean,
it looks brown to me.

67
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,266
We're in Appalachia.
It's black.

68
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,864
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

69
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,534
You're not a bear expert.

70
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,704
Whatever you do, don't...

71
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,713
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

72
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,477
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

73
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,009
- Run!
- Where do we go?

74
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,555
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,658
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

76
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,692
Run!

77
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,024
He's coming! Come on!

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,325
No! It's following...

79
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,564
Olaf! No!

80
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,901
God!

81
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,512
- Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

82
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,416
Olaf!

83
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,180
This is drugs.

84
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,615
This is your brain on drugs.

85
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,212
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

86
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,551
The thrill can kill.

87
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,389
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

88
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,622
and pulling the trigger.

89
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,966
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

90
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,303
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

91
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,968
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

92
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,307
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

93
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,313
when his parachute
failed to open.

94
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,083
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

95
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,780
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

96
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,789
and his neighbor,
Ralph Johnson.

97
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,791
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

98
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,895
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

99
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,726
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

100
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,164
wrapped in
football-size packages

101
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,565
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

102
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,311
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

103
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,308
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

104
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,747
Nothing.

105
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,114
Here's the I.D.

106
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,914
I know who that is.

107
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,616
Full name,
Andrew C. Thornton II.

108
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,456
Man was out of his mind.

109
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,528
What's the "C" stand for?

110
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,657
You said full name, but
you didn't say his full name.

111
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,831
Thornton was one of Syd White's guys
out of Missouri.

112
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,945
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

113
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,843
Part of the Bluegrass Conspiracy.

114
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,781
And there's more of this
out there.

115
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,819
They dumped it somewhere.

116
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,722
Hey, Reba,
you have a dog, right?

117
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,815
Had.

118
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,690
Border collie. Barry.

119
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,354
Sorry for your loss.

120
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,361
Border collie, huh?

121
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,329
That's a cool dog.

122
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,499
Did he play fetch and stuff?

123
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,695
He loved fetch.

124
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,640
What?

125
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,972
Nothing. I just...

126
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,170
That's just awesome.

127
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,923
Damn it, Gabe.

128
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,160
Hi, Daveed.

129
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,832
Mind if I order first?

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,704
This won't take long.

131
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,016
Damn, I just bought these.

132
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,349
Hey, how's Gabe doing,
anyway?

133
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,685
Did you hear about Thornton?

134
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,719
It's a tough way to go.

135
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,024
He only had 30 kilos on him.

136
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,724
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

137
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,263
Chattahoochee.

138
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,426
Georgia?

139
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,437
There's an area
called Blood Mountain.

140
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,267
When the plane's
going down,

141
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,273
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

142
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,040
And then we just go
and get it.

143
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,276
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

144
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,109
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

145
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,580
Eddie's in mourning.

146
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,379
Joanie just died.

147
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,715
And he quit.

148
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,619
Joanie's the reason
why he quit.

149
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,281
She's not here anymore.

150
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,483
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

151
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,561
Syd, I just don't...

152
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,925
Stop.

153
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,898
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,129
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

155
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,465
Grandpa Syd, watch.

156
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,501
Yeah, that's great.

157
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,511
Got to go.
Shift starts at 8:00.

158
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,512
Tomorrow's lunch is in the fridge,
and the chicken's...

159
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,850
Chicken's in the microwave.
Just hit start.

160
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,749
Thought you were off tonight.

161
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,657
We talked about this,
remember?

162
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,456
Me picking up
some extra shifts?

163
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,519
You said
you were okay with it.

164
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,792
I was okay with it
until I realized

165
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,459
why you want
those extra shifts.

166
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,367
So you could go and do overtime
with Ray the Pediatrician.

167
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,302
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

168
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,346
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

169
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,038
this weekend
to see his band play.

170
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,880
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

171
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,678
I know,
but it's gonna be fun.

172
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,184
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

173
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,049
It's Nashville.

174
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,722
He's a good guy, Deirdra.

175
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,283
Just...

176
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,691
Give him a chance.

177
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,661
Please don't do that.

178
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,159
Do what?

179
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,562
You know what.

180
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,862
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

181
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,635
Close my door.

182
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
That's enough for today.

183
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,382
Wait, what?

184
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,921
Hey, Eddie.

185
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,162
They spelled
her name wrong, Daveed.

186
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,055
It says John.

187
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,430
- Says John.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,663
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

189
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,865
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

190
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,872
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

191
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,067
I got seven more days
of John.

192
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,077
The chutist
has been identified

193
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,840
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

194
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,242
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

195
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,012
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

196
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,513
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

197
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,026
I'm so sad, man.

198
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,688
I'm so fucking sad.

199
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,060
Okay?

200
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,241
Can I get the...
the penne, please?

201
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,075
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just...

202
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,804
It's just plain.

203
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,384
I knew you'd be late.

204
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,587
It finally came in.
Check it out.

205
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,458
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

206
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,588
Like a thousand,
but worth it.

207
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,327
- Can I use the toilet?
- No.

208
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,664
My mom is gonna
be home soon.

209
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,297
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

210
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,572
Why by lunch?

211
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,166
The light, Henry.

212
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,345
But I got to go pee.

213
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,846
Go outside.

214
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,780
Why do I skip school
with you?

215
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,148
You're bossier than
the teachers.

216
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,913
Now, the adoption people...

217
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,081
I'm not sure
who I talked to over there,

218
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,319
told me I was supposed to be
getting me a Lab.

219
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,089
A fun one...
a man's-best-friend type.

220
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,790
I don't know
if there was an error,

221
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,526
because the one I got
is just kind of...

222
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,329
- Bob?
- I don't know.

223
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,959
Just kind of fancy.

224
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,596
- Bob, Captain says it's time to go.
- Got it.

225
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,972
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

226
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,501
Hey, Reba.

227
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,840
You got plans for tonight?

228
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,848
Bob, you're a nice guy.

229
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,044
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after Rosette?

230
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,520
I have to go to Georgia

231
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,852
for the Thornton case,

232
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,482
and you said
you were good at dogs.

233
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,493
I said I had a dog.

234
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,189
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

235
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,822
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

236
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,457
talking at a bar
last night.

237
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,227
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

238
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,964
Pretty sure
they're Syd's guys.

239
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,906
Oh, come on.
You got to be sort of good with them.

240
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,010
I only had her for a day.

241
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,543
Please?

242
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,206
I don't know if I could trust
anyone else around here.

243
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,909
Just go.

244
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,542
We'll be fine.

245
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,980
Thanks.

246
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,223
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

247
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,056
I can. I know the way.

248
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,857
School's gonna call, you know.

249
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,864
You know what?
Let 'em.

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,900
And your mom's
gonna be pissed.

251
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,832
So's your dad.

252
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,564
He doesn't care
if I play hooky.

253
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,367
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

254
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,997
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

255
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,577
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

256
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,007
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

257
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,102
Admit it.

258
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,181
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

259
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,474
Jesus! Fuck!

260
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,147
Coral, it's Sari.

261
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,648
Is Dee Dee over there?

262
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
School just called.

263
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,811
No.

264
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,214
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

265
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,387
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

266
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,621
so can you please
just put him on?

267
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,224
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

268
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,132
What the hell
is wrong with him?

269
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,295
Never mind.

270
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,814
50 cents.

271
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,718
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

272
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,726
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

273
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,024
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

274
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,189
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,559
Vest pocket. Come on.

276
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,836
Is that perfume?

277
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,638
That's none of
your business.

278
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,074
Well, it smells
really nice.

279
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,509
Yeah, well,
it's European.

280
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,375
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

281
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,245
Is it too much?

282
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,375
Not at all.

283
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,817
Smells expensive.

284
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,583
Well, it is.

285
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,154
You want a sucker?

286
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,352
Sure.

287
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,352
I like the green one.

288
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,725
This is a red one.

289
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,694
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,432
Oh, shit. He's here.

291
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,543
Am I in the right place?

292
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,254
Right.

293
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,788
Told you it was big.

294
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,413
Oh, it's big.

295
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,450
What's that smell?

296
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,958
It's European.

297
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,430
Someone been smoking?

298
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,193
He was.

299
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,359
- Can you believe it?
- What?

300
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,233
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

301
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,772
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

302
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,897
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

303
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,976
Yeah, and you should be
educating yourself

304
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,443
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

305
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,877
Just get out of here.

306
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,416
Get out.

307
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,541
Unbelievable.

308
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,916
You got a dusty beaver here,
Ranger.

309
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,990
Yeah, well,
I'm working on that.

310
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,809
Hey, Henry!

311
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,980
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

312
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,484
Hold on.

313
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,292
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

314
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,191
Marking our territory.

315
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,022
Don't shit out here!

316
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,031
I'm not shitting.

317
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,628
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

318
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,104
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

319
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,665
Hey, Henry.

320
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,617
Check it out.

321
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,548
It's drugs, I think.

322
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,354
It's drugs?

323
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,554
Remember that guy
from assembly?

324
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,792
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

325
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,390
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

326
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,730
No.

327
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,230
This is definitely cocaine.

328
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,204
Yeah. Of course.

329
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,970
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

330
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,912
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

331
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,082
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

332
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,310
When I do it.

333
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,409
Oh, yeah?

334
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,543
With who?

335
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,087
With Faulk.

336
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,547
After church.

337
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,523
Faulk does not
do cocaine after church.

338
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,058
Are you friends
with Faulk?

339
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,252
No. He's a pervert.

340
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,556
Then you wouldn't know.

341
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,887
Liar.

342
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,228
You're just mad
you're never invited.

343
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,267
I don't care
I'm not invited.

344
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,063
Sounds like you care.

345
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,097
Do some then.

346
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,741
What?

347
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,868
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

348
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,745
Well, we're exercising though.
Shooting and stuff.

349
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,682
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

350
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,185
That wouldn't be good.

351
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,278
Fine.

352
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,884
Knife me.

353
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,430
Okay, so how do I do it?

354
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,731
You eat it.

355
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,739
How much?

356
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,402
Like a tablespoon's worth.

357
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,089
Son of a bitch!

358
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,056
Oh, what the hell?

359
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,891
Rookie.

360
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,456
You do it then.

361
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,580
Ah, shit!

362
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,644
What the hell?

363
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,813
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

364
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,593
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

365
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,633
Let's sell drugs together.

366
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,759
Yeah, we could sell them
on the street like you and Faulk.

367
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,700
There's more.

368
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,678
Something got into it.

369
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,171
A deer, maybe.

370
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,149
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

371
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,516
It'd be like this.

372
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,816
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like, bang!

373
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,515
Bang!
Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

374
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,786
Yeah, and then
it'd be so sad.

375
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,057
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think my dad
has ever done cocaine?

376
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,996
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

377
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,702
My throat's really runny.

378
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,637
Stop that.

379
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,986
Did it do the cocaine?

380
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,319
Don't move a muscle.

381
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,225
Listen to me.

382
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,338
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

383
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,429
- Now we have trouble. You understand?
- Got it.

384
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,701
I'll take care of it.

385
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,867
Gabe, knock that off.
Gabe.

386
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,036
- Grandpa Syd!
- Gabe, driving me nuts.

387
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,443
Little...

388
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,673
Fuck.

389
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,645
Joan loved this song.

390
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,915
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

391
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,056
Eddie, listen.

392
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:23,458
When Joanie died,

393
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,965
I'm sorry
I didn't, you know...

394
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,797
It's fine.

395
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,596
No, I could've did more.

396
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,760
It's fine.

397
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:33,837
I should've been there.

398
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,098
I didn't need you there.

399
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,663
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

400
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,173
It's against
my constitution.

401
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,111
I'm more than a drug dealer.

402
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,475
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

403
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,809
We're friends, right?

404
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,916
No.

405
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:46,841
Fine.

406
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,177
I think he's happy
she's dead.

407
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,812
He's not happy she died.

408
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,153
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

409
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,760
if we can call it that.

410
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,187
Sometimes...

411
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,191
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

412
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,858
No, Joanie died of cancer.

413
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,162
I know.

414
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,293
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

415
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,769
You can't give no one cancer.

416
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,432
Yes, you can. With stress.

417
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,305
Stop protecting him.

418
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,338
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

419
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,468
No!

420
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,221
Okay.

421
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,820
Okay, so we start...

422
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,863
- Did you notice my nails?
- Those are beautiful.

423
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,060
- Thank you. We start...
- Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

424
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,296
I'm wearing the stuff.

425
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,135
Did either of you
see a girl,

426
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,901
13, come through here?
My daughter...

427
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,976
You lost your daughter
in the park.

428
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,546
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

429
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,547
Yeah. Hikers under 16
must be accompanied by an adult.

430
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,378
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

431
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,179
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

432
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,017
bad apples, youngsters
who aren't too happy

433
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,420
with the way
things are at home.

434
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,548
She's not a runaway.

435
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,854
She just came to paint the...

436
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,222
Can someone
just please point me

437
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,692
in the direction
of Blood Mountain?

438
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,264
This is Blood Mountain.

439
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,764
Sorry. I'm Peter.

440
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,335
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

441
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,496
We're about to
head up there ourselves.

442
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,003
Do you mind
if I tag along?

443
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,402
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

444
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,905
is a very important process.

445
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,339
We wouldn't
want you distracted

446
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,775
by our little
damsel in distress here.

447
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:21,937
Nothing can distract me

448
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,447
from making sure
the entire biological community

449
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,608
is safe
for all our friends.

450
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,708
Friends?

451
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,016
He means animals.
I don't like that word.

452
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,283
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

453
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,119
Well, I won't be a burden.

454
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,120
I'll get my hat.

455
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,926
Okay.

456
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,963
Shoes okay for hiking?

457
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,869
Oh, yeah.
I think I'll be okay.

458
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,738
- I have on boots.
- Yep.

459
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,274
Come on, Eddie.

460
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,935
I'm done playing this game.

461
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,240
You wanted...

462
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,973
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

463
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,913
You still have
three more questions.

464
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,984
- Listen.
- What?

465
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,388
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

466
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,150
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

467
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm-a go in here and take a piss,
all right?

468
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,426
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

469
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,969
Park rangers
are peace officers.

470
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,095
Which means
we can shoot people.

471
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,672
Forest is a dangerous place.

472
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,776
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

473
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,241
Gang of pubes?

474
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,676
Teens. Delinquents.

475
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,110
They've been attacking hikers.

476
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,776
They hurt anyone?

477
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,683
They cut them with a knife.

478
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,317
Call themselves the Doochamps.

479
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,290
Watch your back.

480
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,987
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

481
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,496
Out of nowhere.

482
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,141
Fuck is this?

483
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,216
He's afraid, buds.

484
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,945
Empty your pockets.

485
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,488
No.

486
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,954
Empty your pockets, please.

487
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,391
Since you asked so nicely.

488
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,391
You think this is a joke?

489
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,525
I do.

490
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,231
Get him, buds.

491
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,631
I'm shaking a fucking knife, man.
Come on.

492
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,229
- Just stab him.
- Come on, man. It's a fucking knife!

493
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,899
Go on!

494
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,211
Come on, Rocky.
Come on, Rocky.

495
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,907
- Come on, Rocky.
- Banzai!

496
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,054
Give me
this fucking board!

497
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,650
You're going down, man!

498
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,329
Submit! Submit!

499
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,559
What the...

500
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,239
Hold this!

501
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,602
Fucking skateboard!

502
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,586
Oh, my.

503
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,537
The fuck is wrong
with y'all?!

504
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,128
Shit!

505
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,700
I love this road.

506
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,402
Ah, love it up there.

507
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,239
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

508
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,710
What? The falls.

509
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,408
The Secret Falls.
Right, well, we can go up this way

510
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,880
- or take the loop.
- I love the loop.

511
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,419
- Well, you can see the top of the...
- This is a more direct...

512
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,316
All right.
We're going this way.

513
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,117
Well, crap.

514
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,124
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

515
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,751
Just distracting you
completely.

516
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,319
She can hear you.

517
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,592
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

518
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,292
What's taking you so long?

519
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,767
What'd you do?

520
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,644
Please tell me
you found them like this.

521
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:20,751
They attacked me.

522
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,910
Are they dead?

523
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,181
Well, one might be.

524
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,154
The one that stabbed me
might be dead.

525
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,924
Jesus Chr... They're kids.

526
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,020
I loved
this fucking jersey, man.

527
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,632
Okay, they're fine.

528
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,097
Thank God.

529
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,360
No fucking way.

530
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,666
Daveed?

531
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,542
What happened?

532
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,649
Hey.

533
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,978
Wake up.

534
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,346
Where'd you find this?

535
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,489
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

536
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,148
You tried to fucking kill me.

537
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,487
You got
a foul mouth there, bud.

538
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,992
I tell him that
all the time.

539
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,627
Where did you find this?

540
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,324
Up on the mountain.

541
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,399
Where's the rest of it?

542
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,527
I don't know.

543
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,128
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

544
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,833
What do you think
I'll do to just you

545
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,842
when you're already
on the floor?

546
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,206
Okay. Okay.

547
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,538
We stashed it
under a gazebo.

548
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,410
Going back for it
later tonight.

549
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,381
A gazebo?

550
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,544
It's a pavilion-type structure.

551
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,315
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

552
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,515
I didn't.

553
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,226
Are my buds dead?

554
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,761
- Show us where.
- Oh, God.

555
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,991
You know, I'm feeling
kind of tired.

556
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,396
I think I should rest.

557
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,399
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

558
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,900
Eddie, go get the gun.

559
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,061
It's in the glove.

560
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,605
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

561
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,538
Yeah. Same.

562
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,610
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

563
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,442
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

564
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,673
Okay.

565
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:00,783
Okay.

566
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,011
All right, all right.

567
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,554
All right, I'm coming.

568
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,880
Relax.

569
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,792
It's getting real cold out.

570
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,141
Let's go.

571
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,655
So, where you guys from?

572
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,554
Shut up. Keep walking.

573
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,059
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

574
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,061
It better
not be a long hike.

575
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,494
Friend's pretty serious,
ain't he?

576
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,065
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

577
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,656
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

578
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,893
Well, it wasn't me.

579
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,094
I don't blame him though.

580
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,466
Getting stabbed sucks.

581
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,004
Hey, shut the fuck up.

582
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,151
Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.

583
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,985
I was wondering
how Rosette is doing.

584
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,119
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

585
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,592
I don't know if dogs think
about that sort of thing, but...

586
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,928
Anyway, I...

587
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,136
Thanks again for helping out.

588
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,368
Bye.

589
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,445
Look at this.

590
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,879
Oh, no.

591
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,213
Look at this mess.

592
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,218
People don't have
any respect.

593
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,220
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

594
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,619
I...
Let me pick that up.

595
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,886
- All right. Thank you, Ranger.
- Dee Dee!

596
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,654
That is sticking.
I got some oil in the car.

597
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,956
Dee Dee! Henry!

598
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,553
'Cause if that stays open,

599
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,325
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

600
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,457
What kind of critters?

601
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,036
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

602
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,229
- Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

603
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,806
- Dee Dee!
- Skunks.

604
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,306
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

605
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,173
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

606
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,209
- Yeah, with their cute little outfit.
- I think they're cute.

607
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,471
Skunks.

608
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,637
Skunks.

609
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:10,839
- Possums.
- Possums.

610
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,074
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

611
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,184
Hey, possum.

612
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,377
Mrs. McKinndry!

613
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,579
Henry?

614
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,349
Here! Hello?

615
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,582
Henry?

616
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,090
Up here!

617
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,356
Hey.

618
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,329
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

619
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,389
No.

620
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,195
- No, that's not safe at all.
- No.

621
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,099
It's too high.
You got to come down.

622
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,227
Get down here.

623
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,239
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

624
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,036
- No shit, Henry.
- It's high.

625
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,440
But there was a bear.

626
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,875
A really terrible bear.

627
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,447
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

628
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,345
- It was fucked!
- Hey!

629
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,350
That's inappropriate.

630
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,581
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

631
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,086
It attacked you?

632
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,123
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
- No, no.

633
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,192
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

634
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,853
You must have done something
to upset it.

635
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,726
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

636
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,855
Nothing!
Y'all need to hide!

637
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,628
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

638
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,635
You have to
listen to me!

639
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,535
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

640
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,232
The monster took her.

641
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,968
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

642
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,136
Get down here now.

643
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,742
I...

644
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,376
Dee Dee!

645
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,733
Peter!

646
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,605
- No!
- Peter!

647
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,073
Oh, no!

648
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,413
It let me go! He ran off!

649
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,147
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

650
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,483
Is it gone?

651
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,113
Do you see it?

652
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,356
Yeah.

653
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,491
Why are you shooting at me?

654
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,762
Get your ass down!

655
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,269
This is your fault.

656
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,806
Right behind you. I saw it.

657
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,132
Stay down.

658
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,951
What?

659
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,036
Help me!

660
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,872
Help!

661
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,874
Ranger! Ranger!

662
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,380
Did it get you?

663
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,246
That asshole!

664
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,150
I'm gonna get him.

665
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,585
I'm gonna get that asshole.

666
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,355
I'll get help.

667
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,722
Where are you going?

668
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,158
God Almighty.

669
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,163
Hey. What...

670
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,061
Where is it?

671
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,437
Hey!

672
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,600
What should I do?

673
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,232
Motherfucker!

674
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,538
Come back! Help us!

675
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,846
Oh, fuck!

676
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,589
There's something wrong
with it.

677
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,020
Yeah, I told you there was.

678
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,286
Why is it
acting like this?

679
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,360
Did you feed it cocaine?

680
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,590
No. But you're safe.

681
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,529
Bears can't climb trees.

682
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,862
Of course they can!

683
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,869
Then why are you up here?

684
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,155
It's okay. It's okay.

685
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,810
Okay.

686
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,861
No.

687
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,132
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

688
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,537
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

689
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,109
- Climb.
- Go, Henry!

690
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,439
Go!

691
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,445
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

692
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,445
Go up!

693
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,315
Henry, go!

694
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,217
Oh, God.

695
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,815
Go, Henry! No!

696
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,016
No!

697
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,127
Oh, God. Henry!

698
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,907
Oh, God.

699
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,414
Oh, shit.

700
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,211
No, no, no, no!

701
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,385
Get off of me! No, no!

702
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,551
Get off! Get off of me!

703
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,835
Henry, jump! Jump down!

704
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,927
Move, Henry!

705
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,840
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

706
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,348
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

707
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,441
Come on. Let's go.

708
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,519
Come on.

709
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,738
Go. Hide.
Come here. Come here.

710
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,278
That was so messed up.

711
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,044
That little man
was an expert on bears

712
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,746
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

713
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,583
Wait. What did you say?

714
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,452
We found cocaine,
Mrs. McKinndry.

715
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,993
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

716
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,391
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

717
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,658
and now on that guy
back there.

718
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,596
Did you hear him scream?

719
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,394
He's so dead.

720
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,504
I'd love to
not remember that.

721
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,501
But it kind of seems like

722
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,132
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

723
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,147
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

724
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,146
Alive? Yeah.

725
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,841
It chased her that way.

726
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,820
We got to go. Let's go.

727
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,251
He get at you too?

728
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,020
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

729
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,493
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

730
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,489
Keep him awake.

731
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,999
Yeah, I've been trying.

732
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,514
You piles of shit!

733
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,952
- You're the Doochamps!
- Hey, that's not ours.

734
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,524
We found it.

735
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,962
It's not ours.

736
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,029
I'm a park ranger.

737
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,190
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

738
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,735
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

739
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,464
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

740
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,336
I'd have been
at Yellowstone by now

741
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,498
if it weren't for you shits!

742
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,803
Buds.

743
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,306
There's someone outside.

744
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,639
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

745
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,910
Yeah.

746
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,850
Now, open it
when I count to three.

747
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,822
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

748
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,152
Hell yes,
I'm gonna shoot him!

749
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,747
He took a bite
out of my ass!

750
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,522
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

751
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,597
Now, open it when I say so.

752
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,198
Now.

753
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,362
That's a fucking bear.

754
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,245
What the fuck?

755
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,515
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,422
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

757
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,119
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

758
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,285
Where's the bear?

759
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,227
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

760
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:24,028
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

761
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,431
Close the door.

762
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,236
Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.

763
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,045
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

764
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,342
He's up there.

765
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,777
He's up there.

766
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,547
I got it. I got it.

767
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,524
Maybe the kid
can help you.

768
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,822
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

769
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,657
- What game?
- 20 questions.

770
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,199
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

771
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,631
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

772
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,727
Like, is it a spider?

773
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,737
Is it an arrow?

774
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,001
What are you, new?

775
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,037
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

776
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,476
Everybody knows that.

777
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,139
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

778
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,841
Is that one of
your questions?

779
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,508
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

780
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,086
No, no, no.
Daveed needs to ask.

781
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,052
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

782
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,727
Is it bigger
than a bread box?

783
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,222
Yes.

784
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,592
Yeah!

785
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,325
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

786
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,561
What? No.

787
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,831
Broad, then narrow
it down, man.

788
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,873
You have
one question left.

789
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,755
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

790
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,299
You sure this is the way?

791
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,236
Pretty sure.

792
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,502
Dee Dee! It's okay.

793
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,134
It's Mama.

794
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,416
Thank God.

795
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,316
What the heck?

796
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,649
It's paint.
It's just red paint.

797
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,019
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

798
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,024
I'm a nurse, Henry.

799
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,286
Good point.

800
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,193
Come on.

801
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,968
Oh, smart girl.

802
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,469
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

803
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,510
Mrs. McKinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

804
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,044
What?

805
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,615
Why do you ask?

806
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,878
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects,

807
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,283
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

808
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,619
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

809
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,194
What if they never want
to do it again?

810
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,729
Oh, then it...
it should be fine.

811
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,629
But Mama Bear and Papa Bear
would be very angry

812
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,895
because drugs,
especially cocaine,

813
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,129
are very, very bad.

814
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,831
What if they would
never find out?

815
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,372
Oh, Henry.

816
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,635
We always find out.

817
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,472
Dee Dee!

818
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,401
Medic!

819
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,767
Just open it.

820
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,272
- Yeah, open it.
- You think?

821
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,433
Can you just push?
Harder.

822
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,772
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

823
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,038
- All right. You go.
- Let me do it.

824
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,112
You go. Yeah.

825
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,339
Please, show me
how it's done.

826
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,750
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

827
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,877
Oh, yes, I am.
Let me see.

828
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,922
What is that?

829
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,923
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

830
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,527
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

831
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,186
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

832
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,957
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

833
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,223
Oh, fuck.

834
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,460
Come on.

835
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,264
God, I'm trying.

836
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,873
Come on, push.

837
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,270
I'm trying.

838
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,103
You said they called in
a concussion.

839
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,741
They did.

840
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,710
Jesus.

841
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,287
This guy's been shot.

842
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,116
Yeah. Obviously.

843
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,649
Holy shit.

844
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,885
It's the ranger.

845
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,291
Tom.

846
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,090
Come here.
She's got a gun.

847
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,100
Tom! Hello?

848
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:36,095
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

849
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,263
It's okay.

850
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,967
Did you shoot that guy?

851
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,080
B... B...

852
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,272
Buh?

853
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,418
B... B...

854
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,136
Beth?

855
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,004
It's okay.
It's okay. Calm.

856
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,037
Beth, we should go.

857
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,874
It's okay. It's okay.

858
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,009
Bear.

859
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,723
Bear.

860
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,754
Let's go.

861
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,693
Tom, get up!

862
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,991
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

863
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,676
Hang on. Push.

864
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,178
Oh, shit.

865
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,116
Sorry. Sorry.

866
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,057
Come on. Come on.

867
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,457
Anybody else surprised by

868
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,858
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

869
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,294
Leave him!

870
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,381
Our next story, the weather

871
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,748
- at the top of the hour, but first...
- Go! Drive!

More of your favorite hits
here on 103.7 BOB FM.

873
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,153
- Tom, get in!
- Wait! Wait!

874
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,158
- Wait!
- Oh, God.

875
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,731
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

876
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,733
Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

877
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,133
What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?

878
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,306
What the hell
have you got a gun for?

879
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,807
Hey, move! Move!

880
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,910
Put that away!

881
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,107
Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

882
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,350
- Oh, shit!
- Kill it!

883
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,579
Not the tree!

884
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,178
- The big fucking bear!
- Shut up!

885
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,813
Why is it chasing us?

886
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,318
Tom, try to shut
the fucking door!

887
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,760
Close the fucking door,
you dumbass!

888
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,332
Guys, you got to stop
yelling at me!

889
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,828
Oh, shit.

890
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,474
Beth, speed up!

891
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,602
I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

892
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,698
Like, what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

893
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,912
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

894
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,575
And what a man you are.

895
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,411
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

896
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,541
Can you not?

897
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,911
I'm sorry.
Just continue.

898
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,920
Well, when my daddy died,

899
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,388
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

900
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,289
It was the coolest little thing.

901
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,521
It had all these
green scales on it.

902
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,792
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

903
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,696
I thought
that was so awesome.

904
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,302
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

905
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,268
but I practiced
conversation starters

906
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,931
on that lizard every day.

907
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,872
And then that's how I met
Rocky and Joe.

908
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,037
That's my team, man.

909
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:46,116
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

910
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,212
Those are my buds, man.

911
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,718
So I should
get Gabe a lizard?

912
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,984
Well, you know what?

913
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,821
Lizards are
good listeners, bud,

914
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,661
but people...

915
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,493
people are good at hearing.

916
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,965
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

917
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,802
- Can we...
- It's okay.

918
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,671
Y'all are hugging.

919
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,142
It's okay.

920
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,845
Where the fuck
is the gazebo?

921
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:39,185
Can I say something
without you getting angry with me?

922
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,722
I'm already
angry with you.

923
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,601
It's gone.

924
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,330
What the actual...

925
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,908
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

926
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,372
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

927
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,739
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

928
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,403
I promise.
I don't know where it went.

929
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,604
It's just gone.

930
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,073
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

931
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,116
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

932
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,414
I'm-a give you
one more chance.

933
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,113
Where's the ba...

934
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,692
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

935
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:15,356
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

936
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,797
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

937
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,197
I ain't fucking around.

938
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,464
Just do it.

939
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,537
Fuck.

940
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,809
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

941
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,276
I'm coming down there.

942
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,966
I'm just trying to...

943
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,071
find a safe spot to hop down.

944
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,606
How did you get up there?

945
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,166
Well, I jumped
from that tree over there, but...

946
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,800
I hurt my hip a little.

947
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,970
I can try to catch you
if you want.

948
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,412
No, no! You stay
right where you are!

949
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,979
Let's see...

950
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,314
Get it.

951
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,652
Fuck!

952
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,183
Fuck!

953
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,194
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

954
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,992
Oh, yeah? I shot
my own fucking fingers?

955
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,657
I told you not to move.

956
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,771
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

957
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,532
They're not even
next to each other.

958
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,975
Fuck you!

959
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,774
Come out of there!

960
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,506
Shit! Come on out!

961
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:38,808
No fucking way!

962
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,678
God! Goddamn it!

963
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,019
You two, on your bellies.

964
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,148
Now! And no more moving.

965
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,156
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

966
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,523
Can you grab them for me?

967
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,823
Can I grab his fingers?

968
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,397
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

969
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,498
Slow. Slow.

970
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,664
Easy.

971
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,068
God.

972
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:07,633
All right.

973
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,178
Now, you get back
on your belly.

974
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,007
I'll hold on to these.

975
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,687
Now, where you at?

976
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,246
Shit.

977
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,519
What?

978
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,856
Oh, no. The river.

979
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,492
Henry, look.

980
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,068
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

981
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,363
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

982
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,097
We're on
the right track.

983
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,434
I can feel it.

984
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,254
Mama?

985
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,183
Fuck.

986
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:00,725
Fuck, man.

987
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,528
My fucking jersey, man.

988
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,703
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

989
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,530
Until that guy
in the gazebo

990
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,198
throws his weapon
into the woods.

991
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,934
Well, then
we'll be here forever.

992
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,773
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

993
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,108
We don't need to die
because of this.

994
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,911
- Eddie, I got this.
- Do you?

995
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,746
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

996
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,285
You're all gonna
get arrested.

997
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,651
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

998
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,384
so get ready
for 10 to 15 years

999
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,461
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1000
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,393
and supervised shower time.

1001
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,057
Detective, Your Honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1002
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,464
I've never
even done coke.

1003
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,571
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1004
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,799
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1005
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,430
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1006
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,100
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1007
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,007
I like to shit in peace.

1008
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,645
Nobody move.

1009
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,617
It's a bear.

1010
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,155
Yeah.

1011
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,122
No, no.

1012
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,353
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1013
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,141
Oh, fuck.

1014
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,152
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1015
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,483
Just play dead.

1016
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:28,868
Oh, fuck.

1017
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,247
Oh, man. You fucked.

1018
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,446
Eddie, can you breathe?

1019
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,354
What the fuck?

1020
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,926
I think that's a yes.

1021
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,520
Can someone do something?

1022
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,063
Maybe your boy
can do something.

1023
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:51,794
Can you just, like...
move it?

1024
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,198
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1025
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,134
Dee Dee!

1026
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,144
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1027
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,049
Oh, God.

1028
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,974
Look.

1029
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,313
Hello.

1030
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,617
Is he okay?

1031
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,455
Help me, please.

1032
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,062
Does he have food?

1033
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,930
Her name was Elsa,

1034
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,124
and she was so beautiful.

1035
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,938
Are you...
Are you hurt?

1036
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,666
Were you attacked?

1037
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,435
Devil bear.

1038
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,602
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1039
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,836
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1040
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,945
Have you seen her?

1041
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,607
You have?

1042
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,307
- Was she alive?
- Yes.

1043
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,508
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1044
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,177
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1045
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,253
I haven't...

1046
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:46,321
Henry!

1047
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,632
I'll show you.

1048
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,802
I'll show you. Come.

1049
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,179
It's not moving.

1050
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,676
I think it died.

1051
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,784
It died on top of me?

1052
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,046
Check its pulse.

1053
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,553
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1054
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,054
I'm not sure.

1055
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,890
Hey, guy?

1056
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,052
Detective.

1057
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,357
Can we call a truce

1058
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,124
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1059
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,389
Yeah.

1060
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,029
Fuck.

1061
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,073
You okay?

1062
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,008
What do you think?

1063
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,232
Still breathing.

1064
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,529
We should go.

1065
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,871
He'll probably be all right.

1066
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,940
What the hell, man?

1067
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,405
He's gonna
wake up eventually.

1068
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,271
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1069
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,572
She.

1070
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:17,702
What?

1071
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,773
The bear is a girl.

1072
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,509
Oh, yeah.
How do you know that?

1073
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,416
Because its vagina
is on my ear.

1074
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,249
Oh, shit.
She's moving.

1075
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,756
She's awake.

1076
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,019
- Oh, shit.
- Well, stay back. Stay back.

1077
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,594
Okay.

1078
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,694
Chill out.
Just chill out!

1079
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:42,635
Homes, hey, hey.

1080
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,365
Stay back.

1081
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,067
What the hell?

1082
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,613
Okay. Okay.

1083
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,618
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1084
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,653
I will be goddamned.

1085
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,258
Should we shoot her?

1086
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,588
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1087
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,455
What the fuck?

1088
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,903
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1089
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,778
- Eddie!
- Daveed, help.

1090
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,317
What is this?

1091
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,476
No, no.

1092
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,577
- Okay, I have...
- What is it doing?

1093
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,247
I don't like this.

1094
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,483
Please stop.

1095
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,855
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1096
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,828
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
- Don't shoot!

1097
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,023
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1098
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,190
Eddie, you got to
fight back, all right?

1099
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,301
It's playing with you.

1100
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,698
I'd stay still
if I were you.

1101
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,965
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1102
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,165
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1103
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,537
Daveed!

1104
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,508
All we've been through!
Come on!

1105
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,669
Come on, help him!

1106
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,712
Get lower.
You're not listening!

1107
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,146
Eddie.

1108
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,842
Oh, my God.
He's gonna die.

1109
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,313
No!

1110
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:07,650
Hey, girl.

1111
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,462
There you go, girl.

1112
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,030
There you go.

1113
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,303
There you go.

1114
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,571
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1115
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:44,650
Go!

1116
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,229
Don't have to tell me twice.

1117
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,322
Come on!

1118
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,424
Daveed!

1119
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,229
That bag's
worth $14 million.

1120
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,203
We had a truce, and a truce
is on God where I'm from.

1121
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,706
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1122
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,607
I need that bag.

1123
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,713
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1124
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,941
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1125
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,920
Shot...

1126
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,896
No. I didn't.

1127
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,063
Run! Go, go!

1128
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,031
Oh, shit!

1129
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,715
Holy shit.

1130
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,225
- Dad. What are you doing here?
- Oh, shit.

1131
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,159
Where's Gabe?
You didn't bring him here, did you?

1132
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,763
Calm down.

1133
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,922
He's safe at home
watching TV.

1134
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,761
What? How long
has he been alone?

1135
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,494
You left him with me!

1136
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,298
Do I look like
daddy day care center to you?

1137
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,507
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1138
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,479
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1139
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,606
The bear ate most of it.

1140
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,616
- What?
- The bear.

1141
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,584
It fucking did cocaine.

1142
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,177
A fucking...

1143
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,313
A bear did cocaine, Dad!

1144
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,653
Fuck this!

1145
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,591
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1146
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,493
Eddie, Eddie,
just calm down.

1147
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,100
Look at me. Look at me.

1148
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,534
I'm on the hook here.

1149
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:38,300
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1150
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,135
And the people
that I deal with,

1151
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,506
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1152
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,635
And look at me.

1153
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,045
They're gonna come
after me, my family

1154
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,983
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1155
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,353
You hear what I'm saying?

1156
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,290
It's you and Gabe.

1157
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,126
You understand?

1158
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,019
We don't have a choice.

1159
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,668
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1160
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,170
over at
the pavilion structure.

1161
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,530
Come on.

1162
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,379
Come on, son. Come on.

1163
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,517
Who's there?

1164
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,323
- Easy.
- Stay away.

1165
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,859
Where's the duffel?

1166
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,518
I gave it to the bear.

1167
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,527
You gave it to the bear?

1168
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,654
Yeah. The bear.

1169
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,064
It loves coke.

1170
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,167
Which way did it go?

1171
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,171
I'm not
fucking around here.

1172
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,832
Syd White.

1173
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,200
Man, I've been
following you for years.

1174
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,938
They all have.

1175
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,548
Reba.

1176
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,054
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1177
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,351
I got you now.

1178
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,722
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1179
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:05,885
They're kind of shifty.

1180
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,692
What...

1181
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,125
What are you doing?

1182
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:20,232
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1183
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,037
You shot him?

1184
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,236
I told you not to hurt him.

1185
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,904
I don't work for you.

1186
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,708
The department trusted you.

1187
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,818
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1188
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:34,980
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1189
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,819
I know.

1190
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,121
- I trusted you with Rosette.
- I know.

1191
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,052
Who's Rosette?

1192
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,324
The dog in my car.

1193
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,761
You left a dog in the car?

1194
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,731
You left my son
in Saint Louis.

1195
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,302
How is she?

1196
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,511
She being a good girl?

1197
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,978
Yeah.
She's such a good girl.

1198
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,412
Enough.

1199
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,576
Tell me which way
the bear went,

1200
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,155
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1201
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,757
Oh, no, no, please,
don't do that.

1202
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,848
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1203
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,688
but that's just me.

1204
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,626
Well, what do you guys say?

1205
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,754
What's so funny?

1206
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,432
Apex predator,

1207
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,632
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1208
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,376
Dead north, man.

1209
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,313
Yes, we will.

1210
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:38,045
Dead... Dead north.

1211
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:39,678
Let's go.

1212
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,831
The devil bear is in there.

1213
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,492
You can't go in there.

1214
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,862
Do you have kids?

1215
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,529
We would have.

1216
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,197
I have to go find mine.

1217
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,366
And his name would be Texas.

1218
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,934
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1219
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,676
Here.

1220
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:45,877
Thank you.

1221
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,456
Bye, lady and little man.

1222
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,853
Bye, you both.

1223
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,286
Okay.

1224
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,254
Wait.
What about me?

1225
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,212
Watch where you step.

1226
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,654
I got you. Stay close.

1227
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,586
What's that?

1228
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,466
Don't move.

1229
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,002
Stay still, Henry.

1230
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:44,242
They look like
polar bears.

1231
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,644
- Henry?
- Dee Dee?

1232
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,977
- Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1233
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,573
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1234
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,949
- No, no. Them, they're harmless.
- Dee Dee!

1235
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,419
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1236
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,515
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1237
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,921
Are you hurt?

1238
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,152
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1239
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:00,693
That locks really deep.

1240
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,763
- Here. Don't touch it.
- Henry!

1241
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,333
Let's keep you warm.

1242
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,763
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1243
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,158
You smart girl.

1244
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,792
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1245
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,268
We found you.

1246
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:11,840
Put that on.

1247
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,636
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1248
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,267
Oh, my God.

1249
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,846
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1250
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,948
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay. Henry told me everything.

1251
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:21,606
Everything?

1252
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:22,878
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1253
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,508
- You told her?
- No.

1254
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,452
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1255
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,820
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1256
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,689
What was that?

1257
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,559
Cocaine bear's back.

1258
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,290
- Can you walk?
- A little.

1259
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,696
Come on.
Let's go, Henry.

1260
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,858
Go that way.
Go ahead.

1261
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,196
It's okay. Come on.

1262
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,967
Look.
It's a way out.

1263
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,014
It's the falls.

1264
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,886
Henry, stay away
from the ledge!

1265
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,392
Oh, God.

1266
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,374
This is it.

1267
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,545
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1268
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,418
All right?
Let's just deal with the fallout.

1269
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,945
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1270
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,656
What is that?

1271
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,898
Oh, fuck!

1272
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,067
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

1273
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,634
Come on.

1274
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,001
Eddie.

1275
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,306
Take this.

1276
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,181
Fuck.

1277
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,155
Thank you.

1278
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,533
Goddamn bear.

1279
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,006
Eddie, put the rest
in the bag.

1280
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,380
You got
what you wanted?

1281
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,510
Let's go.

1282
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,726
There's a lot more
out there.

1283
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,624
We got to keep looking,
understand?

1284
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:25,898
We're not whole yet.

1285
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:27,896
I'm leaving, Syd.

1286
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,397
Go.

1287
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,397
Give me the bag.

1288
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,001
When did you all
get so soft?

1289
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,870
All got sand
in your pussies.

1290
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,537
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1291
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,581
It's a dead end.
What do we do?

1292
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,241
Stay away from the bears.

1293
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:20,715
This way.

1294
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,282
Come on.
There's an opening.

1295
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,018
Henry, come here.

1296
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,858
- Dee Dee, get in here.
- Someone's coming.

1297
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,460
He has a gun.

1298
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,733
No!

1299
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:38,897
Come on!

1300
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,068
The hell is this?

1301
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,440
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1302
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:46,308
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1303
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,143
I'm a mom.

1304
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,112
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1305
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,415
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1306
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,650
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1307
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,123
You understand?

1308
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,219
Go.

1309
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,820
- Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1310
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,100
It's stuck.

1311
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,129
Fuck!

1312
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,067
Who are these guys?

1313
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,340
We're going home.

1314
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,814
We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1315
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,246
Nobody's going anywhere!

1316
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,782
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1317
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,513
- Dad!
- Shut...

1318
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,353
Get away.
Back off. Back off.

1319
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,960
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1320
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,925
Fuck.

1321
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,130
Get back! Get... Fuckers!

1322
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,356
Stay away.

1323
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,466
Stay away.

1324
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,658
He hit the bear.

1325
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,030
Just give 'em the bag.

1326
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,830
Shoot the fucking bears!

1327
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,337
Get over here.

1328
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:45,962
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1329
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,939
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1330
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,636
The fuck's
the matter with you?

1331
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:53,706
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1332
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,276
Get 'em off me!

1333
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:57,044
- Fuck him.
- Help me out!

1334
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,142
Eddie!

1335
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,710
No.

1336
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:01,981
Coward. Daveed!

1337
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,184
Here, catch.

1338
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:10,522
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1339
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:12,859
Mama!

1340
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,197
Hell yeah,
Mrs. McKinndry.

1341
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:16,995
Look around, Dad.

1342
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,170
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1343
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,901
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1344
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,136
People are dead.

1345
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,236
You are no son of mine.

1346
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,541
Hey, you!

1347
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:27,842
You did this.

1348
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,645
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1349
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,015
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1350
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:34,019
because you're
a piece of crap person

1351
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,180
and a bad dad!

1352
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,587
Who the fuck are you?

1353
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,322
I'm Henry,

1354
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,421
and I am so fucking tired!

1355
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,656
Yeah, me too.

1356
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,593
She's protecting the cubs.

1357
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:15,753
Oh, shit!

1358
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,365
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1359
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:18,455
- What? I'll be fine!
- It's gonna be okay.

1360
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,795
We're gonna be okay.

1361
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,061
Here, here, here.

1362
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,601
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1363
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,102
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1364
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,901
We're gonna be all right.

1365
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,476
Ready?

1366
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,773
Three, two, one. Jump!

1367
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,246
Oh, shit.

1368
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,628
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1369
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:54,993
Let's go!

1370
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,968
Come on. It's okay.

1371
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,868
- Eddie. Help.
- We made it.

1372
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,225
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1373
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:05,227
Oh, shit. He shot you.

1374
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,562
Help! Help!

1375
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,136
Six more days of John.

1376
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,300
Okay.

1377
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,442
Six more days...

1378
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,311
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1379
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,543
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1380
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,312
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1381
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,547
All right?

1382
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,291
Hey, hey, I...

1383
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,258
I got my last question.

1384
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:34,384
What?

1385
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,163
It's 20 questions.

1386
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,992
I got my last one.

1387
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,659
What? All right. Sure.

1388
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:44,470
Is it Joanie?

1389
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,603
It's Joanie, right?

1390
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1391
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:50,438
How'd you guess?

1392
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,804
You're so fucking obvious.

1393
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,780
I just didn't want
to guess it

1394
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,612
to have you crying
on me all day.

1395
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:09,091
She's a nurse!

1396
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,254
He got grazed by a bullet.

1397
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,458
He's in shock.

1398
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,329
Put pressure on him.

1399
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:13,690
I've called backup.

1400
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,888
Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1401
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,194
You should get going.

1402
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:21,362
Take care of yourself.

1403
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,272
Hi. Hi.

1404
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,175
Rosette.

1405
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,384
Whose dog is this?

1406
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,790
I think it's mine.

1407
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,522
Mine and Gabe's.

1408
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:50,928
Is it on cocaine?

1409
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,089
No.

1410
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:55,868
That's a good dog.

1411
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,772
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1412
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:01,932
Yeah.

1413
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:07,813
I knew you'd be okay.

1414
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,144
You're the toughest person
I know.

1415
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,217
I think you get that
from your mom.

1416
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:14,551
I think you're right.

1417
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:16,556
Thanks for coming to get me.

1418
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,820
I'm your mom.
I love you.

1419
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,621
You too, Henry.

1420
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:24,059
Hey, I'm sorry
I pushed Ray on you too soon.

1421
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:26,566
No. You deserve
to be happy.

1422
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:29,898
Henry, let's walk
over here.

1423
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:32,098
- Stay away from that. Come on.
- I want to look.

1424
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,639
I also don't want to look.

1425
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,265
Don't look.

1426
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,640
Let's just cruise on by.

1427
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:40,111
Oh, here come the po-po.

1428
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,579
Hey, Mom.

1429
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,913
I want to go to Nashville
with you and Ray.

1430
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:46,749
Maybe we can go after me and Henry
get out of rehab.

1431
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,185
Rehab?

1432
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,813
We're cokeheads now.

1433
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,114
You know?

1434
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,682
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1435
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,193
Mrs. McKinndry.

1436
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,423
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1437
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,307
Rodney,
are you getting it?

1438
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:15,816
I swear to God, Carol.

1439
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,317
Well, then zoom in.

1440
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:19,710
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1441
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,512
Oh, they're so cute.

1442
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,022
Oh, this is
gonna be good.

1443
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,319
Wait.

1444
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,825
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1445
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:29,686
Oh, shit.

1446
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,428
Hey.

1447
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,063
Oh, hold up.
Hold up.

1448
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:55,543
Daddy!

1449
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,951
- Is that for me?
- Hey.

1450
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,320
Yeah, what do you think?

1451
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:08,785
What's it eating?

1452
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:14,292
Oh, my God.

1453
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,427
They're weren't gonna
put 'em back on.
