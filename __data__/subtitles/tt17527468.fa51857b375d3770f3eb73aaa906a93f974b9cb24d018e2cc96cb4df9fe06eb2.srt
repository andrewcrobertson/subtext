1
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,239
<i>Tonight is
the fucking night, okay?</i>

2
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,868
We've looked like shit for
years, and we are developing.

3
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,828
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

4
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,039
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

5
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,499
We're getting out there.

6
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,042
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

7
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,754
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,422
Man, speak for yourself.

9
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,549
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

10
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,069
just like nobody wanted to fuck
me last year or the year before.

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,471
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

12
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,555
I think that it's time.

13
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,765
Oh, really? It's time?

14
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,017
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,619
we've all been going
to school together?

16
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,853
I've been building tension.

17
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,289
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

18
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,355
Yeah, okay.

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,857
And just what would I say?

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,319
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

21
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,154
How's his penis?

22
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,157
Still awesome and big and throbbing
and, uh, like a male penis?"

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,880
They could have broken up,
you never know.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,660
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

25
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,330
I'm not doin' that with
Isabel, you know what I mean?

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,583
Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'
the long game with her, okay?

27
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,585
Mmm. -Here's how
it's gonna shake out.

28
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,879
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

29
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,090
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

30
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,550
I show up, I'm in a little suit

31
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,636
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,845
It's probably white, okay?

33
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,348
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

34
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,433
What the fuck happened to her?

35
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,977
She's washed up.

36
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,938
I mean Jeff has run her ragged.

37
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,066
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

38
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,653
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

39
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,154
Josie, tick-tock.

40
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,299
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

41
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,200
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

42
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,452
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

43
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,537
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,121
I might have a good shot
that way.

45
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,500
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,253
What the fuck are you wearing?

47
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,590
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

48
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,384
I think you wanna be here.

49
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,802
Who said that?

50
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,363
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

51
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,473
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

52
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,976
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,912
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

54
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,146
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

55
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,499
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

56
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,024
You have Munchausen's.

57
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,734
Look, just follow my lead.

58
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,111
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh.

59
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,505
Oh.
You know what?

60
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,756
- Just keep going.
- How was your summer?

61
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,490
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

62
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,950
Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?

63
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,952
This school has such
a gay problem.

64
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,538
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

65
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,125
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

66
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,043
Like, look at Matthieu.

67
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,837
Rock on, man. Killin' it.

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,131
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

69
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,894
Thanks, bitch.

70
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,136
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

71
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,697
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

72
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,598
- Every show.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,933
Ooh. Popcorn.

74
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,059
Don't mind if I do.

75
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,990
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

76
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,326
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

77
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,536
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

78
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,901
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

79
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,374
yeah, it was good.

80
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,792
What are you guys doing here?

81
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,936
You guys never come to the fair.

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,170
What happened to your arm?

83
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,547
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

84
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,031
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,176
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

86
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,886
No, I just tripped and I...

87
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,888
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

88
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,431
Did you go to juvie?

89
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,117
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

90
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,660
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- <i>it's time to get ready,</i>

91
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,271
<i>get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!</i>

92
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,106
Oh, my God, what did you do?

93
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,692
<i>And the
man who will lead us to victory</i>

94
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,778
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

95
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,155
<i>shit-eating Huntington Ferrets,</i>

96
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,574
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

97
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,242
Jeff! Have my babies!

98
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,953
Jeff, fill me with your seed!

99
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,015
I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

100
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,750
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

101
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,210
What's the grossest animal?

102
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,296
Jeff, come sign my tits!

103
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,465
Eat my pussy!

104
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,343
That's right.

105
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,472
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

106
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,683
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

107
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,184
- Take this.
- No.

108
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,686
Really quick.
This is the moment.

109
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,562
Stop yelling at me!

110
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,206
Could you give that back
really quickly?

111
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,983
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

112
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,694
I am loving all the...

113
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,445
holes in your pants.

114
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,571
Thanks.

115
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,573
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

116
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,700
Thank you.

117
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,035
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

118
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,079
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

119
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,581
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- No, not that.

120
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,208
Brittany.

121
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,769
Are you thinking of riding the
Ferris wheel at all tonight?

122
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,212
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

123
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,296
I need to pull trig.

124
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,798
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

125
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,067
I'm gonna say something crazy.

126
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,636
I think you could eat food,

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,222
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

128
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,557
Mmm, gross.

129
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,225
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

130
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,578
Oh, no. -Yeah, this
is fucking disgusting. Ugh.

131
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,396
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

132
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,689
Oh, I don't know.

133
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,125
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

134
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,192
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

135
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,028
- Yes, you could.
- No.

136
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,071
No bun. Okay.

137
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,365
Um, Isabel.

138
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,659
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

139
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,827
I don't think so.

140
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,495
I think so.
It was really good.

141
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,955
It was super funny.

142
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,463
You're just so...
You're skinny too, as well.

143
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,966
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

144
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,718
Yeah, you're skinny...

145
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,237
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

146
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,180
You probably should eat.

147
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,658
They're gonna send you to the
hospital with how skinny you are.

148
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,101
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

149
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,914
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

150
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,023
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

151
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,778
Fuck! Fuck!

152
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,780
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

153
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,323
You know what? I'm good.

154
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,325
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

155
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,785
If it's not happening here,

156
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,537
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

157
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,748
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

158
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,833
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

159
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,418
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

160
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,878
That's the only hope for me.

161
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,421
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

162
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,839
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

163
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,692
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

164
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,842
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

165
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,986
We're going to have
to join a church.

166
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,220
He'll be the gay pastor.

167
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,805
My whole life's fucked!

168
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,640
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

169
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,391
but everybody knows he's fruity.

170
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,811
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

171
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,522
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

172
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,190
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

173
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,418
but we try to make it work
for him, but he's not happy.

174
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,777
And yeah, guess what?

175
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,613
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

176
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,990
He's fucking the evangelist!

177
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,910
I don't wanna live like that.

178
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,746
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

179
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,625
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

180
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,545
- Isabel.
- Leave me alone!

181
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,980
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

182
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,172
- What?
- Look.

183
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,049
- Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

184
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,467
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

185
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,636
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

186
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,888
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

187
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,223
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

188
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,225
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

189
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,309
Yes, come on.

190
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,853
Irish Catholic.

191
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,330
And I'm regular Christian!

192
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,082
- Josie, ask her. Come on.
- PJ, stop.

193
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,899
You're hurting my head.

194
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,360
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

195
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,797
And it's giving me PTSD about all
the other times I've had migraines.

196
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,656
- Just do it now.
- No.

197
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,385
Just go fucking ask her. -No.
Isabel, would you like a safety ride?

198
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,410
Isabel.

199
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,246
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

200
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,723
Isabel...

201
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,166
Get out of the car.

202
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,500
You can't tell me what to do.

203
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,377
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- Okay,

204
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,422
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

205
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,549
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

206
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,801
Move, you prick!

207
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,845
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

208
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,072
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

209
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,765
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

210
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,049
Hey. -Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

211
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,520
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

212
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,189
Get out! Come on.

213
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,416
- I feel like we should just drive.
- Drive.

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,649
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

215
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,294
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

216
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,569
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

217
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,695
He's gonna move.

218
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,173
- We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

219
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,115
- Drive. He'll move.
- Just drive. Josie, go.

220
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,576
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

221
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,420
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

222
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,630
Jeff?

223
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,341
Jeff!

224
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,693
Are you...
Are you okay?

225
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,861
When people move cars,
don't people move?

226
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,595
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

227
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,180
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

228
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,724
- Back up! Back up!
- We didn't even do anything.

229
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,061
No, come here.

230
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,371
- Man down! Man down!
- You!

231
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,647
Oh, my God.

232
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,416
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

233
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,650
We should go. Let's go.

234
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,109
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

235
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,694
Let's just kind of peel on out.

236
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,255
- Fine.
- What did you do to him?

237
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,114
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

238
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,450
You fucking cowards!

239
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,618
You better fucking run!

240
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,497
- I don't understand.
- What the fuck?

241
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,750
They're not gonna
get away with this!

242
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,481
<i>Attention.</i>

243
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>The library is out of use again.</i>

244
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,467
<i>Huntington shot up
our remaining books,</i>

245
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,221
<i>so there will be no reading
again this year. Thank you.</i>

246
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,140
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

247
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,311
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

248
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,147
I know I won't even digest it.

249
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,315
I have to throw up."

250
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,359
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

251
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,486
She's like, "No, not, just...

252
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,029
Maybe, but not the bun."

253
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,032
Oh, it was just really sweet.

254
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,951
You had to be there.

255
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,035
I was there.

256
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,288
Are you serious?

257
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,998
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

258
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,666
You're the sidekick, not me.

259
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,710
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

260
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,670
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

261
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,339
Thanks.

262
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,901
Do you feel like people are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

263
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,510
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

264
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,721
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

265
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,432
Hi.

266
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,227
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

267
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,770
What? Yeah.

268
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,415
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- All right, kiddos.

269
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,316
Welcome back to class.

270
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,192
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

271
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,485
That belongs to the school.

272
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,362
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

273
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,613
Nice try, PJ,

274
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,532
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

275
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,534
All right, check it out.

276
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,263
- Today I got a special lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

277
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,288
Do what?

278
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,126
Holy shit. Is he okay?

279
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,461
Hey, you good, man?

280
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,839
What the fuck?

281
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,133
- Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

282
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,277
Meanwhile, back at the ranch...

283
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,635
Okay, so, did he fight back?

284
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,238
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

285
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,990
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

286
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,557
or anything, just let me know...

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
I heard you did something to
him, I just don't know what.

288
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,411
And I'll totally let you
lean on me.

289
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,395
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

290
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,105
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

291
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,231
That's how, okay?

292
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,067
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

293
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,610
Overall bitch.

294
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,445
This is you.

295
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,405
God damn it, Jeff.

296
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,907
What the fuck?

297
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,368
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

298
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>Hello, this is Principal Meyers</i>

299
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,165
<i>with an important
Huntington update.</i>

300
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,792
<i>So, listen to this girl.</i>

301
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,878
<i>Last night, outside the fair,</i>

302
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,671
<i>a Huntington player
followed me home,</i>

303
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,883
<i>pinned me against my car
and punched me in the face.</i>

304
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,886
<i>And now my face
is totally fucked.</i>

305
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,055
Fuck.

306
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,866
<i>We haven't faced the
violence of Huntington for 20 years.</i>

307
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,475
<i>They think they can get
in our heads</i>

308
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,685
<i>by picking on our weak
and defenseless.</i>

309
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,622
<i>Well, we can't let them
break our spirit, folks.</i>

310
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,272
<i>Keep your heads in the game.</i>

311
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,357
They're gonna pork us!

312
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,775
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

313
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,169
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

314
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,793
Oh, great. More violence.

315
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,981
Just what this school needs.

316
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,615
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

317
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,659
- That's class?
- Latte.

318
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,743
Get my shit.

319
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,620
Solid class.

320
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,164
Hey.

321
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,168
Josie, right?

322
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,630
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

323
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,676
Um, weren't you there?

324
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,636
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

325
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,013
- and killed girls in juvie.
- Really?

326
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,474
Um, what did you think
about that?

327
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,077
<i>Excuse me.</i>

328
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,728
<i>Could the ugly, untalented gays</i>

329
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,689
<i>please report
to the principal's office?</i>

330
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,691
Guess that's you guys.

331
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,374
Hello, Principal Meyers. First of
all, I want to say, God bless...

332
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,946
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

333
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,656
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

334
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,117
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

335
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,953
all-American, red-blooded, muscular
man this town has ever seen.

336
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,097
Sir, please, look in the mirror.

337
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,706
- Shush.
- Okay.

338
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:32,127
The homecoming game with
Huntington is nearly a month away.

339
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,563
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

340
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,255
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

341
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,607
- Twenty years.
- Couldn't be clearer.

342
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,692
I think I can explain.

343
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,967
I can explain.

344
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,011
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

345
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,512
Ha! Sure.

346
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,973
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

347
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,308
Yeah, actually.

348
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,393
How come you can't buck up

349
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,104
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

350
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,274
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

351
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,027
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

352
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,612
Did you ever think of that, sir?

353
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,840
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

354
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,116
Okay. What? What? Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

355
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,118
- Can we just calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

356
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,828
- You know what?
- What?

357
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,372
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

358
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,957
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

359
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,461
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

360
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,672
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

361
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,800
for...

362
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,762
for our self-defense club.

363
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,894
Self-defense... What is that?

364
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,355
- Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

365
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,398
- Well, here's the thing...
- Yes! Yes!

366
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,359
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

367
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,693
A fight club.

368
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,196
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

369
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,280
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

370
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,657
No, we don't. Shut up.

371
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,176
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

372
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,552
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

373
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,537
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

374
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,330
while you perform
<i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

375
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,041
Just stay in your lane until
you're munching beaver at Wesleyan.

376
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,876
Yes, sir.

377
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,271
I can't believe they're
letting you guys start a fight club.

378
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,589
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

379
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,150
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

380
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,175
We're doing it.

381
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,094
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

382
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,681
Josie, did you see the way that Isabel
and Brittany were looking at us?

383
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,475
Also, you
heard the announcements.

384
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,685
Girls are terrified.

385
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,395
It's perfect. They need this.

386
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,022
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

387
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,234
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

388
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,545
Guys do that all the time, okay?

389
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,712
That's the point of feminism.

390
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,029
That's not the point
of feminism.

391
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,906
You also don't care
about feminism.

392
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,259
Your favorite show is <i>Entourage.</i>

393
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,742
You're missing the point!

394
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,804
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

395
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,347
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

396
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,081
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

397
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,583
About juvie?

398
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,477
- Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

399
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,895
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

400
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,254
I just didn't correct you.

401
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,548
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

402
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,901
You try to punch me in the
face, I stop it from happening.

403
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,011
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

404
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,263
Look, this is how we do this.

405
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,681
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

406
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,057
Which I've got covered.

407
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,184
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

408
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,269
Hub-bub-bub-bub.

409
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,854
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

410
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,105
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

411
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,708
You know Stella-Rebecca?

412
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,452
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

413
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,587
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

414
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,696
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

415
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,532
- Josie.
- What?

416
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,034
- We're doing this.
- No.

417
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,744
Yeah. Listen to me.

418
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,555
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

419
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,498
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

420
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,167
They are grateful to us.

421
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,711
We build a community, we bond,

422
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,963
we share, we connect.

423
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,966
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

424
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,426
Next thing you know,

425
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,237
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

426
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,621
- Jeffrey!
- Josie...

427
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,766
Isabel knew your name.

428
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,851
- Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

429
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,062
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

430
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,688
we just run the risk of becoming

431
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,666
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

432
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,010
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

433
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,320
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

434
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,989
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

435
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,193
We're the lowest of the low.

436
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,760
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

437
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,828
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

438
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,498
There's a serious lack of female
solidarity at this school.

439
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,708
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

440
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,211
Yeah, I mean, we just felt like

441
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,838
there's a serious lack of female
solidarity at this school.

442
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,717
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

443
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,762
What's your plan here?

444
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,472
I don't need a plan.

445
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,599
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

446
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,940
Okay.

447
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,149
What's up, lads?

448
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,402
What the fuck?

449
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,487
- These girls are ugly.
- Okay.

450
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,988
Where is Stella?

451
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,615
She was booked
for a car convention.

452
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,242
What? It's a Monday.

453
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,910
Um, maybe we should go

454
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,179
before someone cool shows up?

455
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,705
Before I die? Pick one.

456
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,290
Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

457
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
I love David Fincher.

458
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,795
- Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

459
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,798
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

460
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,383
and stopped huffing paint.

461
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,218
She'll never stop huffing paint.

462
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,445
So, I thought we'd start...

463
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,470
Um...

464
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,431
- Okay.
- Sorry.

465
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,683
All right.

466
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,936
Listen up, you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

467
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,688
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

468
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,523
Um, it's a self-defense club.

469
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,858
It's not really, "Fight."

470
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,445
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

471
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,155
and they're picking on the weak

472
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,824
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

473
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,535
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

474
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,704
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

475
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,998
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

476
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,666
Then, punch-bucket,

477
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,668
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

478
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,837
and we punch you
until you bleed.

479
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,883
Before that, perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

480
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,152
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

481
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,219
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

482
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,305
Juvie was way crazier.

483
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,390
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

484
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,517
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

485
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,353
I get up. I'm blind.

486
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,731
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

487
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,691
Broke her fuckin' nose.

488
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,568
Josie?

489
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,736
Care to share?

490
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,364
Yeah, all right.

491
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,201
Juvie was insane.

492
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,537
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

493
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,457
so I took her outside and I
punched her till she died.

494
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,877
So, you killed a girl?

495
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,754
Uh, no.

496
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,924
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

497
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,259
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

498
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,220
when she came back
to life, so...

499
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,056
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl...

500
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,849
She came back to life.

501
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,519
Mmm. But I remember her being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

502
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,521
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

503
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,689
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

504
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,066
Josie, if you'll step forward.

505
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,443
No, I don't wanna do that.

506
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,505
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

507
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,030
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

508
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,615
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

509
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,843
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

510
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,118
They wanna see the punch.

511
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,203
Who am I gonna punch?

512
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,579
Punch me. Just punch me.

513
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,248
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

514
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,332
I can punch you.

515
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,834
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

516
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,237
Something people
would always say,

517
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,395
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

518
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,587
Come on up.

519
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh!

520
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,675
Oh, fuck!

521
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,368
Will there an advisor
for this club?

522
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,060
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

523
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

524
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,147
where we punch each other
in the face?

525
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,110
The Holocaust. It happened.

526
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,863
Yes, it did.

527
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,949
But how? The seeds were sown
in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>

528
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,869
which y'all are gonna reenact while
I do some little reading over here.

529
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,787
I mean, he's perfect.

530
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,873
No.

531
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,165
- What?
- No.

532
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,750
Please.

533
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,562
Dude, we're not fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

534
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,438
Yeah, and I've never had so many
girls look at me in my life.

535
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,672
Fuck! When did you show up?

536
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,173
Hey, guys.

537
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,718
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

538
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,762
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

539
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,615
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

540
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,684
and they were coming at me with,
like, swords and, like, knives

541
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,477
and, like, guns and stuff,

542
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,689
and you taught me how to punch
like that, then I wouldn't die.

543
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,191
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

544
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,443
But, unfortunately,

545
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,166
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

546
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,946
What? Why?

547
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,031
I don't know.

548
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,824
Why? It was just
so empowering.

549
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,117
What was empowering?

550
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,078
Oh, my God, hi. Um...

551
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,331
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

552
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,459
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

553
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,961
Isabel, let's go.

554
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,052
Hi, boo-boo.

555
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,511
I'm so strong.

556
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,141
I mean...

557
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,607
Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.

558
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,108
Great class today.

559
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,110
Hey, uh, girl.

560
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,612
Thanks for coming in today.

561
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,906
We have to come in.
It's class.

562
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,116
Try telling Dimitri Walker that.

563
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,453
Little motherfucker came the first
week and I ain't seen him since.

564
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,038
Dimitri Walker committed suicide

565
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,790
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

566
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,292
Sure, he did.

567
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:55,713
Anyways, um, we were wondering if
you wanted to be our club advisor.

568
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,924
- What kind of club is that?
- It's a women's club.

569
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,801
We talk about women's issues.

570
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,971
For example, periods,

571
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,098
declining egg count,

572
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,265
skirts...

573
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,517
Skirts?

574
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,395
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

575
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,690
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

576
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,775
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

577
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,419
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

578
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,361
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

579
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,113
Listen. I'm kind of,

580
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,365
you know, retiling the bathroom.

581
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,034
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

582
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,037
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

583
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,831
Back to the club,

584
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,767
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off of stuff.

585
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,418
Can I be honest?
You're a man

586
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,044
who's not coping
with what's going on.

587
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,504
- Yeah.
- You know what?

588
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,132
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

589
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,341
And here's one thing

590
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,735
- my mom's always said to me.
- Mmm.

591
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,804
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

592
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,431
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

593
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,766
It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

594
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,690
but you don't even come
to the dang club. -No.

595
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,812
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

596
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,123
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

597
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,232
You just say
you're doing something

598
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,984
and then you don't do
any of those things.

599
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,212
You know what I mean? You say,
"I support women." You don't.

600
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,779
Don't come. Yeah.

601
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,575
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

602
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,618
- Amazing.
- What?

603
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:08,870
- Yeah.
- Really?

604
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,163
- Okay.
- So cool.

605
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,046
How many girls go
to this school, again?

606
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,799
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

607
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,051
Hey, guys.

608
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,846
Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

609
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,974
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

610
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,018
Hey, ladies.

611
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,103
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

612
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,314
All right. Um...

613
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,608
Hello, everybody.

614
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,693
Okay, excuse me.

615
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,153
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

616
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,446
Um...

617
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,618
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

618
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,253
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

619
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,758
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

620
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:08,179
There are serious rules that
we need to establish, 'kay?

621
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,057
First...

622
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,392
listen.

623
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,894
Second,

624
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,648
be on time.

625
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,275
Yeah.

626
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,039
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

627
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,197
What time is it?

628
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,990
- 3:30.
- 3:30!

629
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,618
Club starts at 3:15.

630
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,204
Not 3:16.

631
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,874
Not 3:17,

632
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:41,420
but the doors close at 3:15.

633
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,172
No exceptions.

634
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,883
I don't care if you're like...

635
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,719
"Oh, but I had
to go to extra help for math

636
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,515
because I... I need
to get a full ride

637
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,058
because my mom
lives in a trailer

638
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,310
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

639
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,479
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

640
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,106
Shut up, okay?

641
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,693
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

642
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,660
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

643
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,953
Nice.

644
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,913
Uh, we're just getting
started here.

645
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,540
So, um...

646
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,353
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

647
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,045
We're gonna do wrestling.

648
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,339
I think I need a volunteer.

649
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,091
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

650
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,177
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

651
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,655
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

652
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,990
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

653
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,348
Don't be late.

654
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,659
- But this week is good...
- Yeah. No worries.

655
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,910
If you're late.
Take it easy.

656
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,120
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

657
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,062
This is a self-defense
class, right?

658
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,373
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

659
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,940
against, like, football players.

660
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,027
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

661
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,446
They're gonna pork us.

662
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,531
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

663
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,949
There's a cash prize, right?

664
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,913
I thought this was
to be part of, like,

665
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,245
a local underprivileged
female community.

666
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,124
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

667
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,752
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

668
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,979
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

669
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,463
So, uh, you know, like...

670
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,050
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

671
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,052
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

672
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,470
- Love that.
- Yeah.

673
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,513
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

674
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,312
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

675
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,647
I don't know about this shit.

676
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,066
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

677
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,151
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

678
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,629
- Look.
- We can take it slower.

679
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,013
- Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

680
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,614
Take that route.
Little slower.

681
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,158
Look. You just use your natural
instincts, just come at me.

682
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,368
Whatever you want, 'kay?

683
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,578
Oh, fuck.

684
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:38,913
Okay.

685
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,540
That's great.
I say that we go again.

686
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,209
- Oh!
- Ow, fuck! My back.

687
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,294
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

688
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,939
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

689
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,565
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

690
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,424
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

691
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,426
- No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

692
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,904
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

693
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,763
I know that,

694
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,641
you know, this is
a little messy right now

695
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,685
but, like, the only way

696
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,063
that we can learn how to defend
ourselves is by teaching each other.

697
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,441
Huntington is coming.

698
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,319
We need this.

699
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,865
I know that things
might seem scary,

700
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,034
but that's okay, because...

701
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,121
because...

702
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,207
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

703
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,875
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

704
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,294
- Right?
- Yes.

705
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,546
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

706
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,507
You are never gonna get
assaulted on your birthday again.

707
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,259
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

708
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,804
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

709
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,389
Yeah, absolutely.

710
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,557
And for me,

711
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,392
I'll be able to kill my stepdad.

712
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,853
- Awesome.
- Okay.

713
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,247
And if you believe in yourselves

714
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,481
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

715
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,567
I'm like,
"Let's fucking do this!"

716
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,027
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

717
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,154
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

718
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,613
So good.

719
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,116
Yeah! Yes!

720
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,451
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

721
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,289
Yes! Yes, queen, slay!

722
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,416
Yes! Yes!

723
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,753
Slay! Yeah!

724
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,381
Cool.

725
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,384
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.

726
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,594
Yeah, for sure.

I told you.

766
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,069
I know. I feel like
if we keep it up,

767
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,853
we can actually take on
Huntington, you guys.

768
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,598
No, if we keep it up,
we can put our fingers

769
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,475
inside of each other. Grow up.

770
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,601
All right.

771
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,186
You know, PJ,

772
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,122
I feel like people are
actually liking more than just

773
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,106
the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

774
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,484
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

775
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,403
No, I mean, seriously, to
have a safe space like this,

776
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,988
it means a lot to people,

777
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,449
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

778
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,201
and actually get
to know these girls,

779
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,703
like, it would be
really important,

780
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,872
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

781
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,547
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

782
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,150
Yeah. -I love talking
about my trauma.

783
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,344
I literally jack off
after every single

784
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,637
- therapy session.
- What?

785
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,431
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

786
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,742
- Don't say "girls." It's you.
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

787
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,810
I just wanted to say

788
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,062
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

789
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,564
It seems so supportive of women.

790
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,774
Especially the hot ones.

791
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,609
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

792
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,570
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

793
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:07,575
but we're getting a little
close to the game now and, um...

794
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,909
I'm just a bit concerned

795
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,036
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

796
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,374
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

797
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,544
Okay.

798
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,925
So, we know
that the club has been a place

799
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,969
where we can feel
empowered physically,

800
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,763
but we also thought it could be

801
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,433
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

802
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,892
and talk about our feelings.

803
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,646
Okay, so who's been raped?

804
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,011
Just, you know, raise your hand.

805
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,736
Gray area stuff counts too.

806
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,869
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

807
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,001
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

808
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,838
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

809
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,632
fuck, whatever.

810
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,258
You know?

811
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,594
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

812
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,804
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

813
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,890
And then the form
tells me to call,

814
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,185
so I call and then they say they can't
get involved until he tries to kill me.

815
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,668
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

816
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,605
but that doesn't count.

817
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,690
So, it's just, like, annoying.

818
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,067
Been there.

819
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,527
We've all been there.

820
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,322
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

821
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,616
but I'm more annoyed

822
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,912
that everyone knows me for
being beautiful and popular

823
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,998
and no one knows that I'm
actually smart and super driven.

824
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:41,919
Like, I literally own a jewelry
business and no one talks about it!

825
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,005
See?

826
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,633
Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

827
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,594
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

828
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,263
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

829
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,182
It's been really, really dark.

830
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,243
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

831
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:01,689
get to know some new people who
actually want to, like, get to know me.

832
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,452
I want to bring it back to Brittany
for one second. -I can go next,

833
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,235
if that's okay.

834
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,241
I don't really like talking
about juvie

835
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,160
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

836
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,330
You know, obviously, we get
a lot of props or whatever

837
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,774
'cause people think
it's so badass.

838
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,627
But, really wasn't.

839
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,298
I mean, unless you consider getting
hazed horrifically every single night,

840
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,634
like, badass. I mean, um,

841
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:34,012
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

842
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,098
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

843
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,142
fight people basically
every single night.

844
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:41,353
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

845
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,815
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

846
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,151
and, um, pipes as well.

847
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,362
And, um, we had to just, like, fight
people, sometimes to the death.

848
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,197
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

849
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,492
um, and that guilt probably will,
like, always shackle me forever.

850
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,664
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

851
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,500
Like, I don't have
to just let things

852
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:07,087
happen to me 'cause of you guys.

853
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,090
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

854
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,676
for what the club
has become and...

855
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,386
Um...

856
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,930
Just especially, you know, from
where we started and, uh...

857
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,058
Yeah, sorry.

858
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,745
I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

859
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,936
I've never really,

860
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,356
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

861
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,108
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

862
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,568
I'm going through a divorce.

863
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,739
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

864
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,240
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

865
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,326
men... men need therapy.

866
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,995
Yeah.

867
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,873
I think that's
a good place to maybe wrap up.

868
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

869
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,220
Um...

870
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,014
Thank you, um, for that.

871
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,434
Um...

872
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,105
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

873
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:11,485
but I was going to study for Mr. G's
women murdered in history test,

874
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,821
if you wanna...

875
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,367
Yeah.

876
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,661
Yeah, okay, sure.

877
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,541
Mom?

878
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,632
Mom?

879
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,096
Oh, hi, honey.

880
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,722
What are you doing home
so early?

881
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,603
Uh...

882
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,480
Are you kidding me?

883
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,150
I had a long day.

884
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,252
Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

885
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,301
First club fundraiser.

886
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,952
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

887
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,371
Hello, ladies.

888
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,932
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

889
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,059
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

890
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,626
It's so weird.

891
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,212
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

892
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,463
Thanks, PJ.

893
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,173
Ah. We're havin' fun.

894
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,758
We're selling panties.

895
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,094
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

896
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,805
Very nice.

897
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,181
Do you wanna, um, celebrate?

898
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,025
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

899
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,979
Um, I can't. Uh...

900
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,733
Isabel and I have plans, so...

901
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,944
You're hanging out with Isabel?

902
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,195
Yep.

903
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,448
Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

904
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,283
I have to keep up.

905
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,618
Hazel, what is wrong?

906
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,994
Are you constipated
or something?

907
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,329
I'm fucking tired.

908
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,664
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

909
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,625
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

910
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,102
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

911
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,544
He's like the crybaby.

912
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,964
With the balls?

913
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,300
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

914
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,054
He's like the main guy.

915
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
Jeff?

916
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,534
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

917
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,061
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

918
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,729
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

919
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,856
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

920
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,525
I'm good.

921
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,235
Looking good, Stella!

922
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,732
Are you gonna tell her?

923
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,035
Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

924
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,371
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

925
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,619
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

926
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,668
Hit me! Ow!

927
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,380
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

928
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,675
Got it. Thank you.

929
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,266
Jeff!

930
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,609
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

931
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,319
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

932
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,406
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

933
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,788
I wanted to...

934
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,457
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

935
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,334
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

936
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,837
Me too.

937
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,216
I think it's really impressive

938
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,428
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

939
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,889
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

940
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,308
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

941
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,603
You're really, really brave.

942
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,022
No.

943
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,440
No. No, no.

944
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,776
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl.

945
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,861
You're...

946
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,988
Yeah, you're...

947
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,574
really, really brave.

948
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,078
What?

949
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,710
Actually, Isabel, uh...

950
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,713
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

951
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,257
There's something
you maybe should know.

952
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,508
Uh...

953
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,721
I mean it's pretty insane.

954
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,556
Okay.
What... what is it?

955
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,559
I just, I...

956
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,522
I heard Jeff is cheating on you.

957
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,737
Wait...

958
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,158
Wait, what?

959
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,453
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

960
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:36,541
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

961
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:41,421
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

962
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:45,133
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

963
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,011
like, constantly.

964
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:52,140
I mean, just at it with each
other, which is pretty fucked up.

965
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,227
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

966
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,229
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

967
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,855
Oh.

968
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,201
Thanks.

969
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,164
Jeff so hungy.
Hungy hungy, hungy.

970
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,791
Jeff so hungy.

971
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:18,959
Swoosh!

972
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,423
What the fuck is this?

973
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,587
Is there pineapple in this?

974
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,885
We talked about this, Janice.

975
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,249
Jeffrey's allergic to pineapple.

976
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:34,558
Eat a bag of dicks.

977
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,261
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
but this is the last straw.

978
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,696
How was last night?

979
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,913
Uh, bad, probably, I would say.

980
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,081
Wait, really?

981
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,046
She's walking really fast.

982
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,884
She usually walks a lot slower.

983
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,722
Hi.

984
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,285
Are you having sex
with Mrs. Callahan?

985
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,437
Baby, you look so beautiful.

986
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,606
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

987
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,983
Bad. Are you having sex
with her?

988
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,610
I'm... I'm...

989
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,654
helping her with her taxes.

990
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,156
Aren't you
in eighth grade algebra?

991
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,116
I can't answer that question

992
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,552
because I... I don't know
how to read.

993
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,785
She's asking you to your face!

994
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,329
Fuck, that usually works.

995
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,165
Are you cheating on me again?

996
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,376
Baby, no! No!

997
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,780
No, why would...
why would I do...

998
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,380
That was one time
with your sister, just once,

999
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,673
two, four times.

1000
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,593
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

1001
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,679
I promise you
I am not sleeping with her.

1002
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,181
I literally saw you yesterday.

1003
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,807
Shut up, nerd!
I fucked your mom!

1004
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,851
Mmm. Mmm.

1005
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:01,937
Wait.

1006
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,731
- Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

1007
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,153
I'm getting revenge.

1008
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,964
I'm gonna fuck up some football players.
And I'm buyin' a gun.

1009
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,740
Hell yeah.
I'll get my stepdad's.

1010
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,200
What about, like, egging?

1011
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,636
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

1012
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,845
Ooh, we could cook 'em
and be like...

1013
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,120
- "You're cooked."
- Yes. Yeah.

1014
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,324
Or what about, like, a bomb?

1015
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,001
Like a...
like a super small bomb.

1016
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,503
I mean, they're super easy
to make,

1017
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,213
and I can just put it
under his car,

1018
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,416
and it can be a distraction.

1019
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,885
Yeah, Hazel, let's do terrorism.

1020
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,442
Fuck you.

1021
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,462
Sylvie, you can't just throw it.

1022
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,030
You have to fucking jump
with it.

1023
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,193
I'm trying.
Okay, watch me. Just...

1024
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:46,166
Damn, we're, uh... We're
really gonna scare them off.

1025
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,917
Nice! Nice!

1026
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,462
I think I'mma help Isabel
keep watch, so...

1027
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,256
Okay, well,
don't get distracted,

1028
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,051
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

1029
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,014
Thought you might want
some company.

1030
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,851
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1031
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,522
It's nice everybody's here,
like...

1032
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,566
vandalizing...

1033
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,443
Jeff's house.

1034
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,530
It is nice.

1035
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,909
I, uh...

1036
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,495
Like, how are you doing?

1037
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,332
I mean,
I think it's for the best.

1038
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:31,461
But I did kind of miss
when he would touch my hair

1039
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,671
and go, like,

1040
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:39,052
"Shiny, shiny, shiny."
You know?

1041
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,597
I wanted to tell you
this before, but...

1042
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,101
I really appreciated
you fighting

1043
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,853
and speaking loudly
at my boyfriend.

1044
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,189
I really value

1045
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,983
when people use violence
and raise their voices for me.

1046
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,029
It's actually one
of my love languages.

1047
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,322
- Is the other one gifts?
- The other one is gifts.

1048
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,077
Um, I know

1049
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,788
everything is, like,
really fucked up and...

1050
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,459
you still probably miss Jeff,
which I get,

1051
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,878
but I just think

1052
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:17,424
you deserve way better, Isabel.

1053
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,345
'Kay, guys.

1054
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,948
Let's make sure
we return or donate these, okay?

1055
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,974
Does anybody know
where the fuck Hazel is?

1056
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,813
Like, 15 minutes?

1057
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,650
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

1058
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,527
Okay. Um...

1059
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,830
It's gonna blow!

1060
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,874
Oh, wow, yeah,
it's gonna blow, guys.

1061
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,836
Oh, my God.

1062
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:56,546
What the fuck?

1063
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,048
Holy shit.

1064
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,929
Oh, fuck, there's no door!

1065
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,665
- Annie, Annie, back up!
- I'm going, I'm going!

1066
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,708
Stop fucking yelling at me!

1067
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:16,732
- I'm going!
- Fuck.

1068
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,908
Oh, fuck!

1069
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,553
Can you listen to me for,
like, once...

1070
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,704
Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!

1071
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,081
- You're awesome!
- No, you're awesome.

1072
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,642
Great. What are we supposed
to do now?

1073
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,793
Relax. No one knows it's us.

1074
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:36,878
Hey, guys.

1075
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,005
Great show last night.

1076
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,799
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1077
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,843
Oh, you don't.
No, it's really all good.

1078
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:46,054
Jeffrey needed a new car,
anyway, so...

1079
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,556
don't worry about it.

1080
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,436
What's wrong, Josie?

1081
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:55,939
You seem a little off.

1082
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,907
Your club is over.

1083
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,825
You understand?

1084
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,913
Good.

1085
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,600
All right, well,
some of us clearly

1086
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,167
have a different definition
of egging,

1087
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:19,128
but if we keep our mouths
shut, stay calm, we'll be fine.

1088
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,772
They're gonna shut us down,
aren't they?

1089
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,340
What?

1090
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,008
No. We don't know that.

1091
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,736
What... Why...
Principal Meyers will believe

1092
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,428
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1093
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,232
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1094
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:31,349
Man...

1095
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,351
Fuck.

1096
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,019
You know, it's been real, guys.

1097
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,230
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1098
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,440
with the goodbyes and...

1099
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,276
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

1100
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:44,880
And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1101
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,614
I mean, that was fucking insane!

1102
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,576
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1103
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,578
Wait. Stop.

1104
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,871
We don't... Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1105
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:57,959
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1106
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,670
All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1107
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,339
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1108
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,758
No matter what,

1109
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,428
this club has brought me
so much.

1110
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,512
I feel...

1111
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,684
so much more powerful and, um...

1112
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,644
protected.

1113
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,896
Me too.

1114
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,398
- Great.
- Oh, my God, PJ.

1115
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1116
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,377
what you wanted
out of this group,

1117
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,278
but I think the rest of us did.

1118
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,863
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1119
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,198
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1120
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,950
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1121
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,036
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1122
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,746
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1123
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,141
You really think that you're the
reason that we have this club?

1124
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,333
The reason? No.

1125
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,560
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1126
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,961
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1127
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:43,546
You're really ungrateful.

1128
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,649
You're so lucky that we even
let you be a part of this.

1129
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,383
PJ, you're a liar.

1130
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,098
Yeah, well, you have no friends,

1131
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,392
and a skank as a mom, so...

1132
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,949
Hazel.

1133
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:22,794
PJ...

1134
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,194
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1135
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,776
Hazel.

1136
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,531
Whoa.

1137
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:56,536
I love God.

1138
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:58,871
Yes, same.

1139
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,590
Yeah.

1140
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,801
Oh, my God, I always
wanted one of these.

1141
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,390
But my mom says they hide your
figure and make you look ugly.

1142
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,517
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1143
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,352
Like, as a joke or...

1144
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,563
whatever.

1145
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,731
Thanks.

1146
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:25,815
Yeah.

1147
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,449
Wow, you and PJ

1148
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,409
really have been
friends forever.

1149
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,162
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1150
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,040
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1151
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,877
PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I
think she's kind of like a mentor.

1152
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,842
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1153
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,844
She's so, like...

1154
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,263
like...

1155
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,515
You know?

1156
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,839
- Yeah.
- And you're...

1157
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,560
You're so, like...

1158
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,444
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1159
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:16,532
Josie...

1160
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,124
I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1161
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,793
- Really?
- Yeah.

1162
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,276
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1163
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,508
Wow.

1164
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:19,345
This is, um, a total shithole.

1165
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,185
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1166
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,817
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1167
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,151
they give you a tax break.

1168
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,199
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1169
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,493
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1170
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,704
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1171
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,206
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1172
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,293
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1173
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,295
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1174
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,683
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1175
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:11,272
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1176
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,733
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1177
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:15,985
Watch out.

1178
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,371
What?

1179
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,416
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1180
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,754
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1181
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:39,383
Your wrists are so small, and the
pen is so heavy that I'm like,

1182
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,802
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1183
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,766
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1184
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,014
with all the surface area

1185
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,457
that yours are taking up.

1186
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,351
Wow.

1187
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,786
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1188
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,312
Okay, does this hurt?

1189
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,332
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1190
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,076
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1191
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,543
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1192
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,607
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1193
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,329
Um...

1194
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:09,914
Uh...

1195
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,377
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1196
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:20,800
Oh.

1197
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:24,595
Um...

1198
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,142
Yeah. Um...

1199
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:33,270
- I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1200
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,190
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1201
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,917
Um...

1202
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,503
I wanted to tell you something.

1203
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,256
What?

1204
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,925
Like, something that happened
last night.

1205
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:05,720
What happened?

1206
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,431
With Isabel.

1207
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:13,769
Wait.

1208
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,232
Wait, seriously?

1209
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,655
That's... that's amazing.
That's...

1210
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,576
<i>Everybody,</i>

1211
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,328
<i>- even the fucking losers...</i>
- Even the fucking losers!

1212
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:34,165
<i>Make some noise!</i>

1213
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,713
I thought you were
super Christian.

1214
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,841
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1215
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,694
<i>All right, uh, so we're gonna
do the pep rally.</i>

1216
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,219
<i>First up, cheerleaders.</i>

1217
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,735
Football!

1218
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,449
<i>Whoo! Yeah,
thank you, ladies. Ooh!</i>

1219
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,993
<i>Thank you all for joining us
here today, folks.</i>

1220
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:13,037
<i>There's been some</i>

1221
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,123
<i>exciting stuff happening
at Rockbridge Falls recently.</i>

1222
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,208
Oh.

1223
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,710
<i>How many of you</i>

1224
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:23,714
<i>know about that little girl
fight club that could?</i>

1225
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,093
Ay, there go my girls.

1226
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:31,347
<i>Well, do we have
a surprise for you.</i>

1227
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,683
<i>We're gonna bring...
Where is she?</i>

1228
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,936
<i>Hazel down.</i>

1229
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:40,481
<i>One of the founding members.</i>

1230
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,817
<i>To show us everything
the club's taught her</i>

1231
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,319
<i>in a fun little challenge.</i>

1232
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,657
- Let's go, Hazel!
- Go, Hazel!

1233
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,451
- What is this?
- I... I don't know.

1234
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,998
<i>Hazel will be fighting Tucker,</i>

1235
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,751
<i>the school's number one boxer.</i>

1236
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,094
Wait, I thought I was gonna be
fighting PJ?

1237
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,097
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but don't be alarmed.</i>

1238
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,890
<i>Girls can do anything
guys can do, right?</i>

1239
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,225
Yeah, kick his ass!

1240
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:18,894
<i>Ready?</i>

1241
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:20,855
- Fuck.
<i>- Go.</i>

1242
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,520
Oh, my God.

1243
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,477
- You got this, Hazel.
- Come on, Hazel!

1244
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,461
You got it.

1245
00:57:58,934 --> 00:57:59,977
Shit.

1246
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,522
Whoo! Get him!

1247
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,638
- The fuck are you doing?
- Is she, like,

1248
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,830
sort of winning or...

1249
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,668
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1250
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,838
Fuck.

1251
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,423
Oh. Oh, my God.

1252
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,133
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

1253
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:35,554
<i>You may be wondering how a
girl under the training of...</i>

1254
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,808
<i>of two juvie convicted killers</i>

1255
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,354
<i>can't even stand up for herself
against a regular old guy.</i>

1256
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:47,608
<i>Well, truth is, they...</i>

1257
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:51,904
<i>they didn't go to juvie.</i>

1258
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,073
<i>No.</i>

1259
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,013
<i>There's no record of them there.</i>

1260
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,663
<i>And according to Hazel...</i>

1261
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,541
<i>they never fought anyone at all.</i>

1262
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,543
<i>And you know what else?</i>

1263
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:10,130
<i>They didn't start the club
to empower women.</i>

1264
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,218
<i>They did it
to fuck cheerleaders.</i>

1265
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,223
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

1266
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,435
<i>It is such a shame.</i>

1267
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,940
<i>We were really rooting
for you girls.</i>

1268
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,485
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1269
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,153
<i>Okay.</i>

1270
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,406
<i>- Thank you for attending...</i>
- Hazel!

1271
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,050
<i>Today's pep rally. Go Vikings! Fuck
Huntington! </i>- Is she okay?

1272
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,450
- Hazel!
<i>- Whoo!</i>

1273
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,119
- Yes!
<i>- Yes!</i>

1274
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,712
Is that true?

1275
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,256
That's why you started this?

1276
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,925
No, no, no.

1277
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,635
Not... not entirely.

1278
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,345
Not entire... Okay.

1279
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,348
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1280
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,934
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1281
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,312
The point of the club

1282
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:10,232
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1283
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:13,360
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1284
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:14,796
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1285
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,197
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1286
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,907
This is the second wave
all over again.

1287
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,332
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1288
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,792
PJ made me do this.
I didn't want to.

1289
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,076
I would never want to do this.

1290
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:35,149
You're pathetic, Josie.

1291
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,334
Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1292
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,563
All right, look.

1293
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,940
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1294
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,233
I just look like this.

1295
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,486
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1296
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:58,405
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked y'all group

1297
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,656
and what y'all stood for.

1298
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,326
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1299
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,661
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1300
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,498
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1301
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,874
Is this about the time I said

1302
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,959
Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?

1303
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,420
Because it's true.

1304
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:16,673
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1305
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:17,957
but you never hear about them.

1306
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,094
And then it's like,

1307
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,471
"Oh,
it's so hard to be a girl."

1308
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,139
"We, like, make less money."

1309
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,183
"We had to lose
our last names."

1310
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,643
"I love you."

1311
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,662
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1312
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,232
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1313
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,584
And all of a sudden,

1314
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,402
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1315
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:39,279
and suddenly, the fucking
kitchen is lime green.

1316
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,739
I think...

1317
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,242
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1318
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,744
Oh, you look confused, like
how I'm confused right now,

1319
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:48,497
on how you created a fucking
fight club to get some cooch.

1320
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,750
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1321
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,710
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1322
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,021
you know what I'm talking about?

1323
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,272
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1324
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,173
of that neck and all type of...

1325
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,177
Sorry, I just don't know if you're
supposed to be talking to us like that.

1326
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,719
Just, like, as a teacher...

1327
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,388
Man, I knew women were evil.

1328
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,433
Motherfuckers always tellin'
me like, "No, that's not true."

1329
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,477
But time and time again...

1330
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,068
Women ain't
nothing but the fuckin' devil.

1331
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,363
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1332
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:24,575
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1333
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:30,497
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1334
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,834
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1335
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,128
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1336
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,672
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1337
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,382
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1338
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,176
and then he wouldn't be so upset

1339
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,571
and then whatever the fuck just
happened would not have happened.

1340
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:47,556
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1341
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,142
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1342
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,145
Well, I mean, yeah, it was your
idea to start the whole club.

1343
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,899
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1344
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,984
You know that.

1345
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,070
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1346
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,907
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1347
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,660
about girls betting on you to
fight other girls with shivs.

1348
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,538
You're just mad
because I did this.

1349
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:14,625
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1350
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,084
Without you.

1351
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,896
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1352
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,379
ever.

1353
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,048
I'm the one who made it
happen for you.

1354
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:26,053
You know what's so funny about
this whole fucking thing,

1355
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,387
all your little schemes,

1356
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,432
all your,
"Oh, we'll have our year

1357
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,727
and we'll fuck so many
girls," and whatever?

1358
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,190
Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1359
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,567
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1360
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,236
Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.

1361
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,779
Does it even matter?

1362
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,990
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1363
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,451
Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

1364
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:50,869
Just find some other girl

1365
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,121
to fucking jack off to
and do nothing about.

1366
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,379
Cool. Yeah, I will.

1367
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:05,717
PJ.

1368
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:49,386
- Ted?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1369
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:51,555
Ted.

1370
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:54,016
Ted!

1371
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,478
Ted!

1372
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,062
Josie, what the hell?

1373
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,629
Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1374
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,258
Hey, Rhodes.

1375
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,718
Do you have a minute to talk?

1376
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,470
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1377
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,264
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1378
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,474
Like, for advice?

1379
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,476
I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

1380
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,728
You're too old for this shit.

1381
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,189
Girl, when I was in high school,

1382
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,859
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1383
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,152
And back then it was worse

1384
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,029
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1385
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,157
Not for being
gay and untalented.

1386
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,033
Mmm.

1387
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,910
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1388
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:20,954
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1389
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:22,873
And I used to say,

1390
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,308
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1391
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,727
Look, that's not the point.

1392
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,752
You want some advice?

1393
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,628
Invest in yourself,

1394
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,472
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1395
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:33,592
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1396
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:34,926
I just, um...

1397
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,262
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1398
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,680
So, like...

1399
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,432
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1400
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,643
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1401
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,062
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1402
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,814
it's just gotten more sad.

1403
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,693
Okay, um...

1404
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,570
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1405
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:55,572
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1406
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:56,740
I wouldn't do that.

1407
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,908
Why not?

1408
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,951
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1409
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:03,079
Well, I'm guessing they've been fucking
people up for the past month, right?

1410
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,665
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1411
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,185
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1412
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,044
I don't know. Football?

1413
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,172
Game? Tackle?

1414
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,340
Oh, girl.

1415
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,968
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1416
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,012
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1417
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:21,932
How you don't know...

1418
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,768
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1419
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,938
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1420
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,066
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1421
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,442
It's called quartering.

1422
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:33,985
I know... I know
what it's called.

1423
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,112
So, tonight, I'm stayin' inside

1424
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,656
and double boltin' those doors.

1425
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,621
- If you ever grab a...
- Nah, I don't care.

1426
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,749
I didn't understand a word
of that, I'm so sorry.

1427
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,611
Just go. Go, just, go.
I don't wanna go.

1428
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,031
Oh, my God.

1429
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,200
- Hey.
- How did you find me?

1430
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,077
Why are you breathing so heavy?

1431
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,663
Okay. I know we're not
in a great place right now...

1432
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,040
Yeah, because I'm pissed.
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1433
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:31,418
Okay, well, I just still think
we need to talk

1434
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,336
about everything
that's, like, going on.

1435
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,547
Yeah, cool, well,
I don't wanna hear it, so...

1436
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,632
Okay, maybe you
should reconsider

1437
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:40,218
because I saw Rhodes,
she says hi, by the way.

1438
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,622
She said this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

1439
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,390
Apparently, every time
Huntington plays Rockbridge,

1440
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,601
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

1441
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:48,894
The pets?

1442
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,896
It's bloodlust, man.
That's not the point.

1443
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,147
Sounds like I should get

1444
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,291
the fuck out of here now.
Okay? -No.

1445
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:54,691
PJ, seriously, come on.

1446
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,210
We need to get
the club back together,

1447
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,820
so we can save them.

1448
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,946
What?

1449
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,451
Sorry, you're saying
you want me and then you

1450
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,995
and then all of the girls
that fuckin' hate us

1451
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:10,206
to get together and save
some fucking football player,

1452
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,625
who we hate?

1453
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,335
Circle of bad vibes.

1454
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,021
Okay, well, obviously, why
would you lay it out like that?

1455
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,129
Because it sounds insane.

1456
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,006
'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1457
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,176
Because we made these girls trust
us and then we humiliated them.

1458
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,764
They deserve a shot
at showing everybody

1459
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,390
what they know,
what they learned,

1460
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:28,892
how fucking cool they are.

1461
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,728
Let's do this for the club.

1462
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,064
What do you say?

1463
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,317
Can we save the damn day?

1464
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,571
Wow.

1465
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:42,697
Pulling out the necklace

1466
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,741
- in the final fuckin' hour.
- Well...

1467
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,244
Yeah.

1468
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,540
Mmm. Nice.

1469
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:55,919
<i>Rockbridge, this is the
most important day of your life.</i>

1470
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:59,005
<i>Forget your wedding,
forget your funeral,</i>

1471
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,757
<i>fuck your bar mitzvah.</i>

1472
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,676
<i>This is what matters.</i>

1473
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,637
<i>Gameday, let's do this!</i>

1474
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,932
<i>- Let's go, Vikings!</i>
- We're almost there.

1475
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:15,271
Okay, first off, PJ has
something to say to Hazel, so...

1476
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:18,108
The apology. Do the apology.
Do the apology, instead.

1477
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,734
Okay.

1478
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,278
I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

1479
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:27,117
And I'm sorry

1480
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,996
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

1481
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,914
in front of all of your friends.

1482
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:36,543
And I'm sorry for being an
asshole a lot of the time.

1483
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,505
Most of the... All of the time.

1484
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,009
And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

1485
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:48,388
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1486
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,767
and I really appreciate it.

1487
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,355
Do you forgive me?

1488
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,484
Yes.

1489
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,129
I don't want to
interrupt this gorgeous moment

1490
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:04,863
but we don't have time now

1491
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,490
because I got information from
a very confidential source

1492
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:09,159
that Huntington
is trying to kill

1493
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,535
someone on this team tonight.

1494
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,679
What are you even
talking about, Josie?

1495
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:12,996
Nobody's even over there.

1496
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,914
Oh, my God,
nobody is even over there.

1497
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,666
Well, that is obviously
a red flag.

1498
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,085
Are we not reading that
as a red flag? That's crazy.

1499
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:21,212
- What?
- Please, Annie.

1500
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,776
Even though
you're a Black Republican,

1501
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,091
you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

1502
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,153
I mean, obviously I know that.
You think I don't know that?

1503
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,095
Then help us figure this out.

1504
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:31,765
We need to stop the game.
We need to save them.

1505
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,100
Wait, wait, hang on.
Hazel...

1506
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,978
we need a distraction.

1507
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,524
Oh, now you want a bomb.

1508
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,544
Oh, fuck.

1509
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,488
So sorry. Okay. Fuck.

1510
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:54,162
Isabel.

1511
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,247
I know you really must
hate me right now,

1512
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:57,749
but the club needs you.

1513
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,000
To what? Have sex with them?

1514
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:01,294
Guys, we really,
really need you. We do.

1515
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,088
In your fucking dreams, PJ.

1516
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,798
Which you don't deserve to have.

1517
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,342
When you sleep,

1518
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,362
- it should be, like... Total darkness.
<i>- Rockbridge, are you ready?</i>

1519
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,222
- Oh, fuck.
- Wow, okay.

1520
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,365
Okay, wait, seriously,

1521
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,808
maybe if you
just listened to us.

1522
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,434
- Just listen to us. Whoa!
- Brittany.

1523
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:18,120
- <i>Here comes your team!</i>
- Isabel.

1524
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,189
I wouldn't be asking you
if this wasn't important!

1525
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,672
We don't have time for this.

1526
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,400
- Josie, come on.
- Hazel!

1527
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:25,795
<i>- Okay, now that you're all...</i>
- Ugh. Uh...

1528
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,070
<i>warmed up, I want you guys...</i>

1529
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,446
Is it the red wire?

1530
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,824
Shit, or is it the yellow?

1531
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,343
<i>Shawshank your way out.</i>

1532
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,594
<i>- Put your hands together...</i>
- You got this, Jeff.

1533
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:34,845
<i>- And shake your tanks.</i>
- You got it!

1534
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,956
Hazel! It's starting!

1535
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,917
<i>Jeff!</i>

1536
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,128
Jeff! Eat my pussy!

1537
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,337
Come on, come on!

1538
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,090
<i>Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!</i>

1539
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,467
- Hurry, Hazel!
- It's gonna blow.

1540
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,428
- Hazel, come on!
- Hazel!

1541
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,888
Hazel, come on!

1542
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,060
- Hazel, it's not working.
- Hazel, it's not going.

1543
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,480
- Oh, no.
- Fuck. Fucking...

1544
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:03,833
- Maybe turn it off...
- Maybe hit it?

1545
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:04,858
No. Give me space. Stop.

1546
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,261
Turn it off and then back on.

1547
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:07,652
Jeff!

1548
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:13,867
<i>I want you
to rub Vicks VapoRub on your tanks</i>

1549
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,245
<i>and dance around like the
fruitbats that you are!</i>

1550
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:20,373
Okay, plan B. We need to get
the cheerleaders to make out.

1551
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,059
Wait, okay, which cheerleaders
do you think?

1552
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,544
It's a distraction.
We need a distraction.

1553
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,844
- Guys.
- Hey, guys.

1554
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,137
Guys, kiss each other.

1555
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,447
Make out.
Make out with each other!

1556
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,791
We need to delay the game.

1557
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:41,144
Guys! Make out
with each other!

1558
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,902
<i>Everyone, get your
guns out, hide your children</i>

1559
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,654
<i>because here comes Huntington.</i>

1560
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,556
- Fuck you! Bitch!
- What the frick is up?

1561
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,373
- Yeah! Get back!
- Yeah! Wake up, pussy!

1562
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:04,000
Hold me back!

1563
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,127
You're so lucky!
You're so fucking lucky.

1564
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,630
Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!

1565
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:09,756
What do we do?

1566
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,760
Look, look, look.

1567
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,153
Oh, wait. I'm gay.

1568
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,157
Okay, yeah, I'm not.

1569
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,285
I just like gay porn.

1570
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,037
This is nothing
like porn at all.

1571
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,123
Wait.

1572
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,918
Is porn even real?

1573
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:03,309
Can we cut the gay shit
and get this show on the road?

1574
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:08,523
I came here for some good man-on-man
grappling and slapping football!

1575
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,234
<i>Can everybody stop
looking at the dyke parade?</i>

1576
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:16,114
<i>Who do I have to blow to get
this game started already?</i>

1577
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:19,575
Yes! <i>-Now make 'em eat
a bag of urine cakes.</i>

1578
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,203
Look, I found empty
barrels of pineapple juice.

1579
01:16:22,287 --> 01:16:24,330
There is pineapple here.

1580
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:26,124
So, they're gonna
poison Jeff then.

1581
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,501
Where the fuck is it?

1582
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,128
Fuck, I'm thinking really quick.

1583
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,939
What if it's in their mouths
and they're swishing it around

1584
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,965
and then they're gonna
spit it out mid-game?

1585
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,425
- What?
- I hate to say it,

1586
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,986
but it might have something
to do with their semen.

1587
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:39,470
Obviously, it does not.
What is wrong with you?

1588
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:40,972
They kissed on the mouth.

1589
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:43,349
- With tongue.
- As a distraction,

1590
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,019
and we can do it again
if people are asking.

1591
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,080
- Wait, when was this?
- The bomb didn't work,

1592
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,605
and there was no
other distractions!

1593
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,166
- Yeah, there was...
- And because we were...

1594
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,085
- They're gonna spray the field.
- What?

1595
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,962
- Okay, we're gonna have to run.
- No!

1596
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:57,172
We're gonna have to run. We're gonna have to run.
- We can't run. No!

1597
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:58,323
No!

1598
01:16:58,406 --> 01:16:59,907
- Oh, my asthma.
- No, please!

1599
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:00,992
You don't have asthma.

1600
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,910
I feel like I have asthma now!

1601
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,623
PJ!
Cover the sprinklers.

1602
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:08,708
I got it.

1603
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:14,565
Oh, fuck!

1604
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,538
Get back here,
you fuckin' weasel!

1605
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,729
I'm sorry.

1606
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,231
You saved me.

1607
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,526
You're... you're welcome?

1608
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:43,946
Oh, no.

1609
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:46,741
- I... Would...
- Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh.

1610
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:49,952
Are you okay?

1611
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:51,787
Yeah.

1612
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,998
- Whoa.
- Hazel!

1613
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,666
- Hazel! Hazel! Look out!
- Hey.

1614
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,072
It's pineapple juice!

1615
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,657
It's pineapple juice!

1616
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,092
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- 'Scuse me.

1617
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,161
Turn it off!
Please just turn it off!

1618
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,342
Yes.

1619
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,803
Yes!

1620
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,264
Yes, this is the Viking way!

1621
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,224
Yes, thank you, thank you.

1622
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,142
You did it.

1623
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:57,979
You fucking saved me.

1624
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,232
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1625
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,279
Thanks.

1626
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:17,164
- What is...
- I mean...

1627
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,375
- Okay.
- I guess we did it.

1628
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,960
We did that shit!

1629
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,044
I mean...

1630
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,129
Really proud of you.

1631
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,048
I'm proud of us.

1632
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,346
I do wanna say, um,

1633
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,474
I feel like you killed that guy.

1634
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,143
Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed...

1635
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,227
I think we killed...

1636
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,187
- You killed that guy...
- No.

1637
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:42,940
- Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.
- No. Oh, my God.

1638
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,567
Yeah, we killed a couple.
We killed...

1639
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,485
we killed a lot of guys.

1640
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,130
I... Let's just...
We'll process it later.

1641
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,196
- Much later.
- Later.

1642
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,740
- Yeah.
- Um...

1643
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:52,908
Do you wanna...

1644
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,202
Yeah.

1645
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:03,878
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1646
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,464
You don't have to forgive me
at all or anything.

1647
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:10,134
But I, like, really want
you to know how sorry I am.

1648
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,346
I was kind of insane,

1649
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,724
and the sheer amount
of lies I told is...

1650
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,434
is shocking,

1651
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:19,977
and it doesn't excuse
what I did.

1652
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,813
But I really liked
getting to know you.

1653
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:28,235
And I still really like you.

1654
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,719
I just... -You know, you didn't
have to start, like, a whole

1655
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,032
fight club just to date me.

1656
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:38,913
You could have just,
like, talked to me.

1657
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,457
Oh. Okay, uh,
I don't really know

1658
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,168
how true that is.
You know what I mean...

By the way, what the fuck
are you wearing?

1682
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,900
You got suspenders over your
nipples like a goddamn freak.

1683
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,075
Not gonna come to any meetings.

1684
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,285
It's gonna be fine.

1685
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,808
He's so preoccupied
with his divor...

1686
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,456
Yeah.

1687
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,166
I drank before I came to class.

1688
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,709
- What?
- Sorry.

1689
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,550
You got this, Jeff!
You got it!

1690
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:58,135
Oh, shit.

1691
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:00,197
You scarin' the shit out of me, boy.
You all right?

1692
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:01,222
- Good shit.
- I got this.

1693
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:26,705
Y'all were two of my top
students, I think.

1694
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,141
Oh, no, that was
two other students.

1695
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,000
But at the end of the day,
it don't matter.

1696
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,837
This shit is, like, beyond me.

1697
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,841
Not Beyond Meat,
like the fake meat,

1698
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:38,801
but beyond me, like...

1699
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,555
Who does that?
Where do they do that at?

1700
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:46,642
Y'all out here forty-two
fakin' for the bacon.

1701
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:47,965
You understand what I'm sayin'?

1702
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,984
God, this is
the most depressing shit ever.

1703
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,819
Oh, wait, fuck me.

1704
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,281
Idiot. Idiot!

1705
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,843
She's still
laughing because of the last laugh.

1706
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,994
No! Fuck!

1707
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,456
Cut, cut.

1708
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:14,128
Hey, guys.

1709
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,171
Hey, guys. Hi.

1710
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:19,675
Hey, guys. Sorry.

1711
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,445
You look like you yodel.

1712
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,906
You look super religious.

1713
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,788
Get fucked, Janice.

1714
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,415
Get railed, Janice.

1715
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,666
Eat a dick, Janice.

1716
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,797
God, what is happening
to this country?

1717
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,633
- Why?
- Why?

1718
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,843
