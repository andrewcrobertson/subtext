2
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,810
Mum!

3
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,070
Mum!

4
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,260
Mommy!

5
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,650
Mum!

6
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,970
Mum!

7
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,500
I had that dream again

8
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,140
And he climbed down that chimney

9
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,890
Straight into the huge black pot

10
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,240
That was the end of the big bad wolf

11
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,350
Did they really killed the wolf mum?

12
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,350
I am sure they did

13
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,340
I' ll kill the monster when it comes

14
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,710
I'll smash its head in

15
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,000
It's time to go to sleep now sweetie, it's very late

16
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,360
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,220
A long time ago, just yesterday in fact

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,480
There were three little pigs

19
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,070
And one nasty big wolf

20
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,349
It's not broken it just slipped

21
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,440
Non l'ho rotto è scivolato

22
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,060
Don't you were firing things over the house anymore?

23
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,439
Wait, wait, wait, watch this! When the monster comes

24
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,710
I'm gonna do this!

25
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Please don't!

26
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,130
Nothing in my hands, nothing in my hands

27
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,480
Stand still please

28
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,479
Look at me, mum!

29
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,350
C'mon Samuel

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,660
Look at me!

31
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,889
Stand still please

32
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,889
Nothing in my hands nothing in my hands

33
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,490
I don't wanna you making weapons anymore

34
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,990
It wont work if you don't look at me

35
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,000
This monster thing has got to stop

36
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,960
All right?

37
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't do that!

38
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,100
Ready?

39
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,940
C'mon

40
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,510
Who get late already?

41
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,220
What have you got in there?

42
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,740
See you later alligator!

43
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,000
Here is one for you Norma has got milk in it

44
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,840
What?

45
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,840
One with your milk in it

46
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,840
I don't want milk

47
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,780
No worries I'll make you another one

48
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,300
Ah just where all the women should be, in the kitchen

49
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,780
Get to work woman!

50
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,770
Do you want a cup of?

51
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,000
Nah, I'm headed to the dementia ward

52
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,000
Just a few years before you end up there isn't it?

53
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,920
Right?

54
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,180
Amelia, your son's school is on the phone

55
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,650
Oh my God

56
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,069
Did he hurt anyone?

57
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,900
A dart could have gone into a child's eye or even worse

58
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm gonna have a serious talk with him

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,810
Mrs Fanning we had the talks

60
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,930
We had decisions with the counselor

61
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,930
We're going to have to employ

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,930
a monitor for him

63
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,070
A monitor?

64
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,269
He'll be separated from the other children

65
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,920
The monitor will supervise him one on one

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,250
Sammy wont cope with this he already feels so different

67
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,249
I'll have a talk with him

68
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,359
I'll have a serious talk

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,030
Mrs Fanning the boy has significant behavioral problems

70
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,769
You know, Sammy doesn't need a full time monitor

71
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,769
what he needs is some understanding

72
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,320
I have 24 other first graders in that class

73
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,879
Do you want me to put them all on risk because of your son?

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,580
I think I'll just find another school

75
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,989
,Mrs Fanning you can't just take the boy out of school

76
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,299
You'll look after your business and I'll go find a school

77
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,949
that sees my son as a human being

78
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,850
and not just as another problem to be gotten rid of

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,620
That's very unfair we're only trying to help the boy

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,220
Please

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,110
Stop calling him "the boy"

82
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,110
He's name's Samuel

83
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,070
We can see Ruby and auntie Claire at the park today

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,730
You can play in that swing you
like for as long as you like ok?

85
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,790
Mrs Browning hates me

86
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,790
No, she doesn't

87
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,930
You just need a brake that's all

88
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,350
Don't tell auntie Claire what happened

89
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll tell her later

90
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,240
Mum come and look at this!

91
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,970
I can do it again

92
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,970
Samuel

93
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,209
Don't bother the lady

94
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,469
No no no that's all right!

95
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,280
We have to go home see daddy there haven't we?

96
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,880
My dad's in the cemetery

97
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,349
Oh, that's...

98
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,459
He got killed driving mum to the hospital to have me

99
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,390
Samuel!

100
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,279
I'm sorry he just...

101
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
No, that's all right I shouldn't have...

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,300
Well your mum is very lucky to have you then isn't she?

103
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,300
We have to go

104
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,300
Say see you later Kathy -Bye

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,590
Yeah and he was so drunk he vomited

106
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,590
right in front of his own installation

107
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,060
Lost all the sales!

108
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,060
You're not listening

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,060
Oh, I am I am

110
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,149
So you've lost all these sales and then what happened?

111
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,280
Ruby! Don't play there it's wet!

112
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,550
Mum! Mum!

113
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,610
I'm gonna smash its head!

114
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,229
Be careful!

115
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,230
Mum! Mum! I'm gonna smash it!

116
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,220
What would you like me to do for Wednesday?

117
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,730
I can get the birthday cakes, that's easy

118
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,880
I was hoping Ruby would change her mind

119
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,050
She doesn't want to join party with Sam this year

120
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,050
Mum!

121
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,959
MUM!

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,500
She wants to have a princess party

123
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,740
Mum!

124
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,810
Mum!

125
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,270
That's ok

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,270
We don't have to come

127
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,590
He can still come

128
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,620
Mum!

129
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,819
She just doesn't want to share the day with Sam anymore

130
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,539
I understand

131
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,170
Mum!

132
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,319
I understand

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,670
Mum! I can go really high! Watch!

134
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,300
Maybe you wanna celebrate his
birthday properly this year anyway

135
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,959
On the day

136
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,110
Yeah we'll see

137
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,899
You know Amelia I just want you to be happy

138
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,689
and then this birthday thing rose
around and I end up feeling awful

139
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,690
I don't want you to feel awful Claire

140
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,409
We'll be fine

141
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,819
We're absolutely fine

142
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Mum! Look at me!

143
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,940
Mum!

144
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,109
Who do we have here?

145
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,379
Hello Mrs Roach

146
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
You look tired little one!

147
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,499
You've been in the worse today?

148
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,760
The worse

149
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,619
He just had a big day, that's all

150
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,009
He's just exhausted

151
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,779
Poor little sweetheart!

152
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,620
Betsy

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,620
You little girl!

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,710
Hello

155
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,099
You look tired too love

156
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,510
You ok?

157
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,460
Nothing five years of sleep wouldn't fix

158
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,459
I'll put your rubbish out for you Grace

159
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,109
No no no you just got in pet

160
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,110
I'll do it now then it's done

161
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,500
You can choose one tonight

162
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,660
Where did you get this?

163
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,810
On the shelf!

164
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,870
If it's in a word or it's in a look

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,140
You can't get rid of the babadook

166
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,200
If you are a really clever one and
you know what it means to see

167
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,110
Then you can make friends with a
special one a friend of you and me

168
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,010
He's name is Mr Babadook

169
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,490
And this is his book

170
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,580
A rumbling sound then

171
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,580
three sharp knocks

172
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,830
Ba baba dook dook dook

173
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,320
That's when you'll know he's around

174
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,320
You'll see him if you look

175
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
Ba baba dook dook dook

176
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,119
We might read another one tonight eh?

177
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
But you said I could choose!

178
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,190
This is what he wears on top

179
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,700
He's funny don't you think?

180
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,860
Seeing him in your room at night

181
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,330
Mum does it hurt the boy?

182
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:15,940
Mum?

183
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,660
Does it live under the bed?!

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,620
Mum!

185
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,940
Mommy!

186
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,939
Mummy!

187
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
How sweet did they sound

188
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,730
Telling of the happiness and loveliness
secretly at the bottom of the ocean

189
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,660
and in treating the seals not to be afraid

190
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,119
right time the night again turn

191
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,119
If that's what the doctor ordered I...

192
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,310
Yeah yeah that's what the doctor ordered

193
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,109
It's in my room!

194
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,629
What is?

195
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,499
The babadook!

196
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh no

197
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,959
No no no this is not going to happen

198
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,770
The closet's door were closed and now they're wide open!

199
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,920
It's just a book

200
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,920
It can't hurt you!

201
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,540
You've had a big day

202
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,170
You're just exhausted

203
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,430
I don't want anything bad to happen to you mum

204
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,370
Nothing bad it's gonna happen Sam

205
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,350
I'm gonna protect you

206
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,900
Mum it's nine o'clock!

207
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,270
He's not running a fever anymore

208
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,860
No no no my sister is gonna take him. Put it back!

209
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,610
Put it back or it goes in the bin

210
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Sorry what was that?

211
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,790
Oh no I couldn't get to the phone he was vomiting

212
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,750
Yeah no worries I'll see you soon

213
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,540
Samuel no monster talking at auntie Claire's ok?

214
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,820
Samuel!

215
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
No babadook, no nothing

216
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,200
All right?

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,630
88! Number 88!

218
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,629
Too fair ladies!

219
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,470
Cool Alaine another few days and
someone cuckoo will say loud bingo!

220
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,830
Number 11! Who has number 11!

221
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,420
Next 11! All right...

222
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,640
Five billion!

223
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,010
Anyone got 50000000000?

224
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,530
Pewey's not very impressed with your Bingo skills

225
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,500
Are you all right?

226
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,500
Yeah yeah no I'm fine

227
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,500
How are you? How's Stevie?

228
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,520
Fine yeah, just a bunch of "milkavour"

229
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,370
You don't have to be fine you know?

230
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,280
Just a bit stressed at the moment

231
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,690
Why don't you go home?

232
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, cranky bitch? She goes after lunch I can cover for you

233
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
You'd do that?

234
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,240
Yeah

235
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,709
I'll give you my pay

236
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,710
Oh, no that would be ridiculous

237
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,150
You've got a sick boy is a part to assure

238
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,160
You're so sweet Robbie Ethan

239
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,790
You should go now

240
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,869
Say hi to Sam from me

241
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,700
Yeah I will

242
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,620
Where have you been?!

243
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,370
You weren't at work rung you million times!

244
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,840
,Just scared the crap out of Ruby that's all

245
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,530
He insist her on talking to this bloody babadook thing
all day. Just talking to the air and freaked me out!

246
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,409
I'm so sorry

247
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,809
You need to get him to see someone Amelia it's not
normal for a kid to carry on with this rubbish

248
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,809
It's not rubbish it's real!

249
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,810
Don't you talk to auntie Claire like that

250
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,990
Where did you get those firecrackers?

251
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,279
You've gotten for me on the Internet!

252
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Well that's the end of the Internet!

253
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,639
If the babadook was real we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?

254
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,089
He wants to scare you first

255
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,419
Then you'll see it

256
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,450
Well I'm not scared

257
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,260
You will be when it creeps into your room at night

258
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,590
That's enough!

259
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,509
You will be when he eats your insides!

260
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,740
I decided you're not having your
birthday with Ruby this week

261
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,850
No cake no games that's the end of it

262
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,960
Samuel!

263
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,730
Ladies and gentleman

264
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,729
Mum and Dad

265
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,450
Life is not always as it seems

266
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,370
It can be a wondrous thing

267
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,080
But it can also be very treacherous

268
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,610
Don't worry Dad, I'll save Mum!

269
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,990
I'm gonna trap the babadook like this!

270
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,400
And when is trapped I'm gonna kill it!

271
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,400
Samuel?

272
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,639
I was just putting something back!

273
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,019
All your father's things are down there!

274
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,090
He's my father you don't own him!

275
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,160
Just thought to see how are you going

276
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,720
Can I come in?

277
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,080
Hi matey! This is for you!

278
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,980
My mom always got me a model flight when I was sick

279
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,980
I'm not sick!

280
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,980
Oh

281
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,339
I... I... I thought...

282
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,549
No he's not actually. The truth is he's so
disobedient he can't go to school anymore

283
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,849
You said it's not true!

284
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,279
The only 6 years old junior boy Robbie
which still believes in monsters

285
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,349
I hate you!

286
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,349
She wont let me have a birthday party and

287
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,350
And she wont let me have a dad!

288
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,390
Don't eat it

289
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,920
The babadook did it mum!

290
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,439
Go and watch a DVD and I'll make something else

291
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,770
Babadook did it!

292
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,770
Just go and watch a DVD Samuel

293
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,200

Girls and boys!

295
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,430

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,980
To the great Martin's DVD school of magic!

297
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,360
Life is not always as it seems

298
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,430
It can be a wondrous thing

299
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,690
But it can also be very treacherous

300
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,670
In this DVD you will learn magic tricks to surprise

301
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,790
To delight!

302
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,940
And perhaps even shock!

303
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,450
Your family and friends!

304
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,430
Do you think this is funny?

305
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,340
Oh no, no, no!

306
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,320
Give it to me!

307
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
Do you wanna die?!

308
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,060
Don't let it in!

309
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,120
Don't let it in!

310
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,270
Don't let it in!

311
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,470
Don't let it in!

312
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,720
Don't let it in!

313
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,000
Don't let it in!

314
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,740
Mum do we have to go to Ruby's party?

315
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,440
I've already got this doll mum!

316
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,760
No you've just got a twin!

317
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,210
They can go shopping together

318
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,360
Be good

319
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,800
He's just really tired

320
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,510
Go and play, right now!

321
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,320
Claire told me you are a writer

322
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,650
No, not really. Not anymore

323
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,689
What kind of writing did you do?

324
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,689
I wrote some articles for some
magazines and get some kid's stuff

325
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,000
It takes time to get into it, that's all!

326
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,000
It must be difficult

327
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,310
I do volunteer work with some disadvantage women and

328
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,860
well a few of them have lost their
husbands and they find it very hard

329
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,230
How's Richard's marriage going?

330
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,259
Oh good, I mean his wife has just ballooned

331
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,870
I've got the kids 24/7 and feels like...

332
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,669
Don't tell me about it

333
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,149
I don't even have time to go to
the gym anymore it's ridiculous

334
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,150
That's a real tragedy!

335
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,900
Not having time to go to the gym anymore. How do you cope?!

336
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,770
You must have so much to talk about
with those poor disadvantaged women

337
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,419
This is my tree house your not allowed in here

338
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
I'm not hurting anybody!

339
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,200
Bye

340
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,810
Thanks

341
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,300
Thanks

342
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,150
How your mum know if it's real or not

343
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,109
She never comes to our house!

344
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,479
Mum told dad she didn't want to go to
your house because is too depressing!

345
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,749
The babadook would eat your mum for breakfast

346
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,419
And then rip her arms off!

347
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,049
Shut up!

348
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,449
They feel sorry for me Claire there's a big difference

349
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,779
God Amelia as soon anyone mentions Oscar you can't cope!

350
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,529
That's not true

351
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,010
It will be 7 years!

352
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,699
Isn't it time you moved on?

353
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,210
I have moved on!

354
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,210
When do I mention him?

355
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,639
When I talk about him?

356
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,760
What strain is that on you Claire?

357
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,480
You're not even good enough to have a dad!

358
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,919
Everyone else has one you don't!

359
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,279
I do have a dad!

360
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,389
I listen to your life day in day out

361
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,569
And you never stopped asking anything about mine

362
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,270
I do!

363
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,269
I want to know how you are!

364
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,649
You're not coming around the house anymore!

365
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,550
Because I can't stand being around your son!

366
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,550
I can't believe you just say that

367
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,129
You can't stand being around him yourself!

368
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,839
Your dad died so he didn't have to be with you

369
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,060
That's not true!

370
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,060
Your mum doesn't want you

371
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,860
No one wants you

372
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,339
What did you do!

373
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,220
She said I didn't have a dad! She kept saying it!

374
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,250
Is she all right?

375
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,570
Stay here and look after the children
or do you want another one to get hurt?

376
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,120
Mummy! She won't believe me!

377
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,120
Mommy!

378
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,460
Mommy!

379
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,140
Mommy!

380
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,340
Mommy!

381
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,420
Why can't you just be normal?!

382
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,420
There is no babadook!

383
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,720
Get out!

384
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,359
Get out!

385
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,160
Samuel?

386
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,569
Mommy!

387
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,569
Stop please now!
- Get out!

388
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,570
Get out! Get out!

389
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,340
Please help me!

390
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,340
There's something wrong with my son!

391
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,340
Nothing more than a febrile convulsion

392
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,339
It's when the brain hardly heats

393
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,639
It always looks worst than it is

394
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,370
But I've never seen anything like this!

395
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,469
We have to wait until the tests come back

396
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,470
all these other results are normal

397
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,200
He's obviously suffering a high level of anxiety

398
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,409
Very committed to the monster theory

399
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,040
Yet an understatement

400
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,610
All children see monsters

401
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,010
Not like this!

402
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,390
And it's getting worse

403
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,900
He's becoming aggressive

404
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,900
He could see a psychiatrist

405
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,320
I can refer you

406
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,129
Takes a few weeks to get in

407
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,050
That'd be great

408
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,599
But can you...

409
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,910
Just give me something for now, just...

410
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,910
To make him sleep?

411
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,800
And just until...

412
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,730
Just until we get an appointment....

413
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,470
Please!

414
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,820
I haven't slept in weeks and...

415
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,819
Neither has Samuel…

416
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,840
And when we go home tonight this whole nightmare
will start up again and I am really...

417
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,410
I'm really not coping

418
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,210
I can...

419
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,070
I can give you a short course of sedatives

420
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,070
Just until the tests come back

421
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,650
Less the mothers

422
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,500
are too keen on them unless it's really bad

423
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,990
It's really bad

424
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,760
These can make children feel

425
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,130
Foggy

426
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,450
Perhaps in temporary nausea

427
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,140
but certainly help him sleep back

428
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,619
That's for one week

429
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,780
Thank you

430
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,620
Why don't people like me

431
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,620
Why do you say that?

432
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,100
Ruby said people don't like me because I'm weird

433
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,940
Sometime people say things that aren't true

434
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,150
You just need to take your medicine

435
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,150
Have a big sleep and not worrying

436
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,150
I don't want you to die

437
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,340
I'm not gonna die for a long time yet

438
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,550
Did you think that about my dad before he died?

439
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,550
Just take your pill so you can go to sleep

440
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,460
I've got the day off tomorrow, maybe we can do something uh?

441
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,990
Will these make the babadook go away?

442
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,770
I think so but you have to promise
me not to mention it again

443
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,820
I promise to protect you if you promise to protect me

444
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,820
Then I wont mention it

445
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,819
I promise

446
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,080
To protect you

447
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,080
C'mon

448
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,460
C'mon

449
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,720
Can you stay here with me?

450
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,420
Yes

451
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,420
I love you mum

452
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,420
Me too

453
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,619
The nose is broken in two places and then the surgery

454
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,840
I'll pay for everything

455
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,840
You can't even pay your own bills!

456
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,100
Look I really have to go

457
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,670
Claire... I think somebody is stalking me and Samuel

458
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,930
What?!

459
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,000
A book ended at our place

460
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,410
I threw it away but somebody glued it
back together and put it on our door step

461
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,580
Amelia

462
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,329
I just can't help you right now

463
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,710
I don't expect you to help I just wanted

464
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,600
If it's that urgent you should go to the police

465
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,320
I have to go

466
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,530
Claire!

467
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,800
Hello?

468
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,440
BA-BAA

469
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,940
DOOK

470
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,740
DOOK

471
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,740
DOOK!

472
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,190
Hi

473
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,800
I want to report someone stalking me and my child

474
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,799
Can you tell us what happened?

475
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,670
Somebody sent me

476
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,670
A children's book

477
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,560
And?

478
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,890
And it contained violent and graphic
images of my child and me being murdered

479
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,890
Can we have a look at the book please?

480
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,890
I burnt it

481
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,560
You burnt it

482
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,810
Yes

483
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,580
Well unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it

484
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,900
He's been making phone calls to me as well

485
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,130
What's he being saying?

486
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,600
Nothing he was just making this...

487
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,250
Noises...

488
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,249
How do you know is the same person?

489
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Because of what he wrote in the book!

490
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,250
The book you burnt

491
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,250
Yes

492
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,790
Ok

493
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,750
Don't worry about it

494
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,479
Did you get your things hon?

495
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,479
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's

496
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,479
That's why she shakes like this!

497
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,160
Samuel you don't have to say
everything that goes to your head

498
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,340
It's all right love!

499
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,340
He wanted to know

500
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,340
So we talked about it

501
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,560
Sammy sees things as that they are that one

502
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,090
Oscar was the same

503
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,089
He always spoke his mind

504
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,090
Do you have to keep on bringing him up?

505
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,440
Hey Bugsy!

506
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,380
Hey!

507
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,380
Hey!

508
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,180
Don't come in here!

509
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,580
I don't wanna buy anything

510
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,580
Are you Amelia Vannick?

511
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,610
Yes

512
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,689
I'm Warren and this is

513
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,170
Prue Flanery from the department of community services

514
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,029
My son's only been away for two days!

515
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,800
He's not actually registered at Babidge bay anymore

516
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,070
If I could just come in and meet Samuel and get
you look at these papers that it'd be great

517
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,700
I'm just in the middle of cleaning
up the house at the moment

518
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm sorry there's stuff everywhere

519
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,860
Hello Samuel!

520
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,859
I'm Prue

521
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,920
And this is Warren

522
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,110
How are you?

523
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,130
I'm a bit tired from the drugs mother gave me

524
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,270
Not drugs, tranquilizers

525
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,919
From the doctor!

526
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,240
You know he had a fever yesterday

527
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,920
I am really tired actually

528
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,120
That's no good!

529
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,030
May I have a glass of water please?

530
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,540
Yes of course I'll get you one

531
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,440
It's a real mess I...

532
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,979
I just found this cockroach infestation

533
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,540
Normally I have the house sprayed and I
did actually already have it sprayed but

534
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,010
There's this hole in the wall behind
the fridge and that's why I...

535
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,820
I didn't mean...

536
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,370
Hole in the wall

537
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,940
There was a hole in the wall paper that's
where they were laying the insects I think

538
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,510
We've caught you with a bad time

539
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,390
I'll leave you with this

540
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,920
We are required to come back in a week

541
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,920
To talk through your options

542
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,920
Here's my card

543
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,430
Mum

544
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,290
I think I'm gonna vomit

545
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,050
What was that noise I've heard

546
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,279
I didn't hear any noise

547
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,279
The howling dogs

548
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,060
Then what? I declare but I think this house is haunted

549
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,710
Mum?

550
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,390
I'm gonna go to bed

551
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,600
Are you sick?

552
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,600
Oh no granny!

553
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,779

It's only six o'clock

555
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,930
Don't you wanna stay up with your mum for a while?

556
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,260
No

557
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,100
If you go to bed now the pills wont work properly

558
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,710
You have to stay up for a while sweetheart

559
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,020
This is not escaped

560
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,270
Koalas don't leave their babies around

561
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,099
Are you off now there?

562
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,430

565
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,839
And the prince and the princess live
happily together in a beautiful palace

566
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,180
for the rest of their days

567

574
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,000

I need to eat something

584
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,130
I couldn't find any food in the fridge

585
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,430

586
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,209

I'm so sorry

593
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,300
I don't know why I said that

594
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,800
It was terrible

595
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,250
I've had absolutely no sleep

596
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,400
I don't know what I was saying

597
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,290
I'll cook you something ok?

598
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,820

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,920
I'm not hungry anymore

600
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,250
We really need to get out of this house we've
been cooped up here too long that's the problem

601
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,130
Do you wanna go to Wally's?

605
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,829

00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,830
No -Sit down!

609
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,930
Where are we going?

610
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,230
I just wanna drive for a little while

611
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,630

612
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,399

I just bought this bloody car what were you thinking!

617
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,050
Oh driving on the wrong side of the road with a
kid in the back you could have killed someone!

618
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,300
Hey, what are you doing?!

619
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,300
Hey crazy bitch!

620
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,220
Hi sweetheart!

621
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:14,720
Mum

622
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,990
I can call auntie Claire

623
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,590
I can call and she can come over

624
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,080
Mum?

625
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,050
Auntie Claire doesn't want to talk to us anymore

626
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,640
Mum?

627
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,640
Mum look at me!

628
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,960
It's nice and worm in here

629
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,990
I don't want you to go away

630
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,380
I'm not going anywhere

631
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:31,210
Mum?

632
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,390
Mum?

633
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,440
I don't think we should stay here tonight

634
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,320
I can call Mrs Roach

635
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,160
I don't want you to call anyone

636
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,090
I just need to sleep

637
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,410
Mum?

638
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:02,090
Leave it!

639
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,790
...something is in the house...

640
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,460
There is someone in the house!

641
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,949
The babadook is making her sleep

642
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,669
Mrs Roach

643
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,970
Can we come and stay tonight?

644
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,219
Gracie, I'm so sorry!

645
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,890
Someone broken into the house?

646
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,319
Sam said that...

647
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,120
No no we're fine Samuel is just being very disobedient again

648
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,380
I told him not to call anyone!

649
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,339
He asked if he could stay the night...

650
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,140
No no we are fine I just had an headache that's all

651
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,680
I really have to go tough now Gracie

652
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,410
I'm so sorry for troubling you

653
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,919
Yes talk soon

654
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,920
No worries talk soon

655
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,340
I told you to do not call anyone
and you deliberately disobeyed me

656
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,850
Do you wanna frighten Mrs Roach?

657
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,480
An old lady who can hardly walk. Do you wanna make her sick?

658
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,920
Get that bloody thing off!

659
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,639
Is this the only way

660
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,890
I can trust you not to embarrass
me in front of our neighbors?!

661
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,390
Is this what I have to do?

662
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,889
I'm sorry mommy

663
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:19,200
it's just that the babadook maybe crashed
the car engine -What did you say?

664
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,449
I said the babadook...

665
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,450
The babadook is not real Samuel

666
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,450
It's just something you made up

667
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,039
In your stupid little head

668
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,470
I just didn't want you to let it in!

669
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,449
I'll make sure nothing gets in tonight

670
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,030
All right Samuel?

671
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,450
Nothing is coming in here tonight!

672
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,450
NOTHING!

673
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,490
I feel sick

674
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,490
If you don't take the pill

675
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,490
You'll feel worse

676
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,109
Mum I don't think I need

677
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,860
I am the parent and you are the child so take the pill!

678
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:52,620
Good boy

679
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,240
Mum!

680
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,189
Hey Bugsy

681
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,190
Hey sweetie

682
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,860
Come here sweetie

683
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,310
Here we call

684
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,660
There's more where that came from

685
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,820
Be mind or we all die!

686
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,520
What's the secret

687
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,069
You sent her a message didn't you?

688
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,080
No not for a minute

689
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,210
Don't lie you call me and that it was why

690
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,600
You don't wanna go in there by yourself do you?

691
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,030
Police say the woman used a kitchen knife to stab her son

692
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,880
His body was found in the basement

693
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,929
The woman later attacked officers with a knife

694
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:12,179
They drew their guns and shot her to death

695
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,619
Little is known about the tragedy

696
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,899
but neighbors say the boy was celebrating his birthday today

697
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,900
He had just turned 7

698
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,840
Samuel?

699
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,950
Wake up mommy!

700
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,950
But you're the one whose asleep sweetheart

701
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,000
Don't go down there!

702
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,990
It's not safe!

703
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,680
I thought you were dead!

704
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,070
I thought you were dead!

705
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,060
We can be together

706
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,840
You just need to bring me the boy

707
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,110
You mean Samuel?

708
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,400
You can bring me the boy

709
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,380
You can bring me the boy

710
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:42,829
You can bring me the boy

711
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:43,840
Stop calling him the boy

712
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,510
I think it's going to rain

713
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,390
No

714
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,350
It isn't real it isn't real it isn't real

715
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,290
No

716
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:39,880
No

717
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:43,750
No

718
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,190
Bugsy!

719
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,540
I beg you!

720
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,410
Samuel!

721
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,620
Samuel

722
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,110
Bugsy is hurt we need to get help

723
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,810
You don't want him to die do you?

724
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,040
Samuel

725
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,930
Are you listening to me?

726
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,520
Let me in you little shit!

727
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,290
Let me in!

728
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,009
Let me in!

729
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,009
Let me in!

730
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,010
Let me in!

731
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,350
You little pig!

732
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,980
Six years old and you're still wetting yourself

733
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,980
You don't know how many times

734
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,979
I wished that was you

735
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,979
not him that died

736
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,659
I just want you to be happy

737
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,660
I just want you to be happy

738
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,540
Sometimes

739
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,759
I just wanna smash your head against the prick wall

740
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,939
Until your fucking brain pops out

741
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,280
You're not my mother

742
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,969
What did you say?

743
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,539
I said your not my mother!

744
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,580
I am your mother!!!

745
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:36,990
Run run run as fast as you can!

746
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,339
Get away!

747
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,340
Didn't I tell you not to play with weapons?!

748
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,229
I'm sorry love

749
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,859
I know it's late

750
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,320
I just wanted to make sure you were ok

751
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,570
I'm ok

752
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,480
I know

753
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:46,180
This time of the year is terribly hard for you

754
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,490
And I know you don't want me to go on about it so I wont

755
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,910
I just want you to know that I
would do anything for you and Sam

756
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,910
I love you both

757
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,800
Samuel

758
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,080
I'm sorry

759
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,880
I understand you're scared

760
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,700
I haven't been good since your dad died

761
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,430
I haven't been good at all

762
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,310
I'm sick Sam

763
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,770
I need help

764
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,960
I just spoke with Mrs Roach

765
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,010
We're gonna stay there tonight

766
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,740
Do you want that?

767
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,920
I wanna make it up to you Sam

768
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,630
I want you to meet your dad

769
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,610
It's beautiful there

770
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,060
You'd be happy

771
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:18,210
Sorry mommy!

772
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,220
Mum!

773
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,220
Mum!

774
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,040
I'm not leaving you

775
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,750
Mum!

776
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,750
Mum?

777
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,020
We said we protect each other

778
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,250
And now you don't love me

779
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:41,030
The babadook wont let you

780
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,300
But I love you mum

781
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,540
And I always will

782
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:58,599
You let it in!

783
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
You have to get it out!

784
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:07,180
I don't want you to go away

785
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,960
No! Mommy!

786
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:02,790
Mommy!

787
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,630
Mommy!

788
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,000
Mommy!

789
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,210
Mommy!

790
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,600
Mommy!

791
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,600
Mommy!

792
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,600
Mommy!

793
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:52,869
What is it that?

794
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,870
You can't get rid of the babadook

795
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,000
What do you want?

796
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,030
What do you want!

797
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,470
No

798
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:13,460
Keep breathing

799
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,470
Put your sit back sweetheart ten
more moments and we are there

800
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,250
I think it's gonna rain

801
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,450
Stop!

802
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,460
You're nothing!

803
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,810
You're nothing!

804
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,280
This is my house!

805
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:58,730
You're trespassing in my house!

806
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,439
If you touch my son again

807
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,680
I'll fucking kill you!!!

808
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,400
Mommy don't!

809
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:16,810
Don't!

810
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,519
Watch out for your mum's leg little one!

811
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
He's fine I got the stitches out!

812
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:10,519
What time is the party?

813
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,819
Anytime after 3 it's fine

814
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,820
I'll see you in a few hours then

815
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,640
Bye!

816
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,640
Bye Sam!

817
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,290
That school is a good choice!

818
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,289
I've been doing a lot of reading about it

819
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,289
and I think Sam will be happy there

820
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,289
He's been out of school over two weeks now

821
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:26,500
It's time to get back

822
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,090
We needed sometime to sort a few things out

823
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,619
And you are having a party!

824
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,620
It's Sam's birthday today

825
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,769
My first birthday I've ever celebrated

826
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,770
- That's not true!
- Yes it is!

827
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:42,920
My first party on the day!

828
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:43,980
That's unusual

829
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,440
My husband died the day that Sam was born

830
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:54,230
He got killed driving mum to the hospital to have me!

831
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,870
Sam's just like his dad was

832
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:00,160
Always speaks his mind

833
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,900
Parties are a lot of fun! Especially when they are yours!

834
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:09,220
My cousin's not coming because I
broke her nose in two places!

835
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,360
I'll take that for you

836
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,830
Good shot!

837
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,830
Look there's another one!

838
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,830
Get your bowl

839
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,480
Wow you've got a lot today!

840
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,690
And may I begin to see it?

841
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
One day when you're bigger

842
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,000
You go outside

843
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,000
And you don't come in until I tell you

844
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:48,600
It's all right

845
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,600
It's all right

846
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,600
It's all right

847
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,890
How was it?

848
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,680
Just a bit quiet today

849
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,820
Come here

850
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,210
It's getting much better mum

851
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,970
Wait!

852
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,100
I have a new trick

853
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,740
Life is not always as it seems

854
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,760
Nothing in my hands nothing in my hands

855
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,519
Oh that's great!

856
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,540
I haven't finished

857
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,040
Abracadabra!

858
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,720
How did you do that!

859
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,320
Come here you! Come here

860
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,869
Happy birthday sweetheart
