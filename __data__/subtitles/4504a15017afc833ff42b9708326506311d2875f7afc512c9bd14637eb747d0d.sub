{3474}{3556}You lost your|adolescent already?
{3559}{3639}This will complicate matters...
{3642}{3695}A young one is on the way,
{3698}{3834}but the mother will be harder to control|without a nestling around.
{4528}{4661}So, who is the woman|in the station wagon?
{4706}{4748}Beth.
{4806}{4866}"Herr K�nig".
{4869}{4920}Herr... Konish?
{4923}{4959}"�". It's not an "E".
{4962}{5016}"�". "Herr K�nig".
{5019}{5060}Where's Gretchen?
{5063}{5140}Gretchen and the movers|are right behind us.
{5143}{5224}Okay, so,|she's not your mother?
{5275}{5362}No, she's Beth.
{5398}{5449}Ah, okay.
{5452}{5515}And what is going on|with your sister?
{5518}{5585}She deaf or something?
{5588}{5638}No.
{5666}{5745}But she can't speak.|It's fucking annoying.
{6149}{6207}You okay, honey?
{6210}{6309}The nice man who owns this place|will take us to our new home.
{6534}{6591}Good afternoon.
{6628}{6711}Good afternoon, Mr. K�nig.
{6714}{6763}Ah, very good, Luis!
{6766}{6820}You've been practicing?
{6823}{6851}How was your journey?
{6854}{6894}Oh, very pleasant, thank you.
{6897}{6947}We almost forgot how beautiful|it is here.
{6950}{7007}Ah, we almost forgot|how beautiful you are, Beth.
{7010}{7041}Oh, stop!
{7044}{7082}Keep going!
{7085}{7174}Gretchen, come say hi.
{7220}{7259}Gretchen.
{7262}{7290}What's up?
{7293}{7325}Oh, Jesus.
{7328}{7370}Nice to meet you.|Willkommen.
{7373}{7393}Thank you.
{7396}{7428}No, thank you, Beth.
{7431}{7497}We are so glad|to have you back.
{7500}{7573}And please do not worry|about your late arrival.
{7576}{7604}I completely understand.
{7607}{7693}- We have something for you.|- I'm sorry.
{7696}{7763}It's...
{7766}{7822}The original sketch.
{7825}{7858}We drew that up
{7861}{7929}the night that you showed us|the land you acquired.
{7932}{7991}Beth, that is...
{7994}{8122}Well, we will display this|in the new guest lodge.
{8138}{8220}You know, you two lovebirds|stumbled into my nest
{8223}{8282}almost eight years ago|to the day.
{8285}{8326}And I believe|there were more
{8329}{8395}than just architectural plans|that were conceived this day.
{8398}{8470}Hello, Alma.
{8485}{8565}Hello.|It's nice to meet you.
{8568}{8607}The pleasure is all mine.
{8610}{8671}Your German is already better|than your father's.
{8674}{8735}- Yes.|- She said yes.
{8738}{8813}Ja, ja.
{8903}{8960}Hey, Gretchen.|How are you holding up?
{8963}{9037}I wish we could have spent a little more|time together after the funeral,
{9040}{9087}but I get it.
{9090}{9174}You're all over Europe|with your dad's family?
{9182}{9233}Don't forget you have a band|that needs your voice.
{9236}{9283}Anyway, I'm sending you|the new mix.
{9286}{9355}I knew your mom|would have loved it.
{10421}{10494}Beth? It's occupied.
{11195}{11249}Gretchen, let's go!
{11252}{11292}Herr K�nig is taking us|to the new house.
{11295}{11362}Can you sit with Alma|this time?
{12888}{12959}Car? What?|Car what?
{13701}{13761}What?
{13950}{14014}Hello there!
{14230}{14312}My name is Bonomo.|I'm your neighbor.
{14315}{14353}I have my hands full.
{14356}{14415}Me too.
{14442}{14489}Are you the housekeeper?
{14492}{14533}No, I'm a daughter.
{14536}{14566}Oh, really?
{14569}{14665}Haven't heard about you.|Are you from England as well?
{14668}{14701}No, I'm not.
{14704}{14753}Why would you have|heard about me?
{14756}{14789}I told...
{14792}{14825}Jesus.
{14828}{14886}Forgive me, my dear.
{14908}{14950}Didn't mean to startle you.
{14953}{15013}I told Dr. Bonomo|about your family.
{15016}{15092}Dr. Bonomo is the medical superintendent|of the local hospital
{15095}{15182}and also the chronic disease|treatment facility,
{15185}{15254}which I am also funding.
{15257}{15306}This is Gretchen.
{15309}{15361}Gretchen.
{15364}{15398}Yeah.
{15401}{15490}Gretchen is|from the United States.
{15502}{15595}It has been decided that|she is moving in with her father.
{15667}{15727}What a pleasant surprise.
{15883}{15948}Hi, you have reached the|Vanderkurt residence.
{15951}{16003}Neither Gretchen nor Olivia|are here now,
{16006}{16060}but we are dying to hear|what you have to say,
{16063}{16141}so get ready to say it.
{16206}{16260}Hi, mom.
{16357}{16430}I know this is weird...
{16450}{16521}But it's good to hear|your voice.
{16577}{16694}Going with dad was a bad idea,|and I miss our house.
{16707}{16803}I'm short on money, but I'm gonna try|to come home soon.
{17060}{17102}I know it's been tough.
{17105}{17175}But we are very happy|you're here.
{17210}{17260}Excuse me.
{17263}{17323}Gretchen, my dear.
{17326}{17373}I...
{17376}{17495}I've been thinking, for a young woman|like you there's...
{17498}{17609}not so many things to do|here in the summer, and so...
{17621}{17692}I have a little idea.
{17695}{17719}A proposal.
{17722}{17805}How would you like|to come work for me at the resort?
{17808}{17837}Oh, Herr K�nig...
{17840}{17879}Well, it's an easy job,
{17882}{17922}and it will give you|something to do
{17925}{17972}while your parents build|a new resort for me.
{17975}{18036}I could use some more|English-speaking staff.
{18039}{18086}Herr K�nig,|I think Gretchen...
{18089}{18132}I would pay you|an appropriate salary, of course.
{18135}{18211}- I don't...|- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.
{18386}{18419}Sch�n.
{18422}{18449}Wonderful.
{18452}{18539}Come by the reception|tomorrow.
{18578}{18617}Here's your ID badge, sir.
{18620}{18706}Would you like to pay|with cash or credit card?
{18770}{18832}Cash, or credit?
{18857}{18885}Cash.
{18888}{18972}"That will be 45 euro|for a single room."
{18975}{19084}That will be 45 euro|for a single room.
{19122}{19245}Oh, and this is Beatrice|and I am Gretchen.
{19248}{19297}- Can I go now?|- No.
{19300}{19418}You can help me teach Gretchen|how to sell things in the shop.
{19451}{19549}You have to be polite and friendly,|even if the guest is rude.
{19552}{19616}And remember to put up the sign|if you go to the bathroom.
{19619}{19703}But if you have any real trouble,|just call the boss.
{19706}{19802}He lives up the resort street,|on the hill.
{19818}{19883}He lives in a|vacation bungalow?
{19886}{19957}No, he has a villa|way up there.
{19960}{19989}He bought the hotel,
{19992}{20097}and so the bungalows are basically|in the front yard of his villa.
{20100}{20141}Weird, right?
{20144}{20193}Super.
{20356}{20392}I'm so sorry.
{20395}{20442}No problem.
{20445}{20512}This happens sometimes.
{20576}{20649}How's your first day,|my dear?
{20713}{20761}Can't complain.
{20764}{20838}And how is your German|coming along?
{20841}{20902}Not good.
{20905}{20934}This is okay.
{20937}{21078}You know, there are English-speaking|schools over the border, in Italy.
{21186}{21305}Well, I'll be along to pick you up|in one hour.
{21341}{21405}Oh, I have my bike.
{21425}{21465}No.
{21468}{21517}No, no, no.
{21529}{21601}No, it will be too dark|on the country roads by then.
{21604}{21676}This is why|you will not work late.
{21679}{21745}You will help Beatrix|with the peak times.
{21748}{21780}What?
{21783}{21872}I thought we were going to split|the evening shifts.
{21890}{21924}You have a car.
{21927}{21986}I have a life, too.
{22011}{22063}Beatrix, I will not get drawn|into another debate with you.
{22066}{22101}I don't want to have|a debate with you.
{22104}{22165}No. Every time I raise|an issue with you,
{22168}{22210}there is something|you have to say about it.
{22213}{22263}- I do everything you ask!|- No.
{22266}{22302}What?|I work every day late shifts!
{22305}{22372}You're blasting your scheisse music|on the car radio on your way to work.
{22375}{22462}I hear it across the forest.|This is a nature reserve,
{22465}{22561}and you are disturbing the wildlife|with this "boom, boom, boom"...
{23236}{23339}They can dance|on the carpet...
{24823}{24900}Hey, Alma!|What the fuck are you doing?
{25466}{25545}Hey, Alma!|What the fuck are you doing?
{26108}{26169}Gretchen, turn it down!
{26172}{26221}Alma?
{26227}{26309}It's okay, it's okay.
{26427}{26494}What happened to your face?
{26497}{26618}My father's daughter|scratched me.
{26627}{26657}Your sister?
{26660}{26707}She's not my sister.
{26710}{26750}Come on now.
{26753}{26843}I'm sure she really wants you|to be her sister.
{26946}{27033}She had a chance at getting one|but she ate her twin.
{27130}{27201}It's called|vanishing twin syndrome.
{27204}{27308}It's when one fetus dies|in the early stages of the pregnancy
{27311}{27422}and then the surviving fetus|absorbs the dead one.
{27425}{27495}I always thought|it was kind of badass.
{27522}{27579}But yeah, she's a bitch.
{27612}{27661}Okay.
{27720}{27790}Another reason|to not have kids.
{27793}{27909}Thanks for finishing my shift.|Erik and I haven't been on a date in ages.
{27912}{27960}Here's my master key.
{27963}{28019}There's only one.|Don't lose it.
{28022}{28119}And at 10 p.m. sharp you lock|everything up like I showed you.
{28122}{28180}And boss|doesn't need to know.
{28183}{28255}- It's fine.|- Okay.
{28312}{28389}Good luck tonight!
{29240}{29295}Can I get a room?
{29306}{29380}May I see your ID|or passport?
{29383}{29452}Can't you just ask|for my name?
{29632}{29755}Is it just you|or are you here with a partner?
{29758}{29925}We have special rates and amenities|for couples and newlyweds.
{29969}{30045}For now, just me.
{30048}{30097}Okay.
{30184}{30235}I'm Ed.
{30276}{30340}What's your name?
{30357}{30410}I'm Gretchen.
{30436}{30525}You look like you|don't belong here, Gretchen.
{30574}{30640}I won't be here|for long anyways.
{30761}{30827}You like music?
{30899}{30951}Sure.
{31022}{31106}Then you should|come to Paris.
{31229}{31285}Okay.
{31873}{31937}Is this normal?
{31952}{31995}It's only my second day.
{31998}{32060}Better go check on her.
{32342}{32369}Resort Alpschatten...
{32372}{32419}Beatrix, why are you still|at the hotel?
{32422}{32460}I can see the light from...
{32463}{32504}Gretchen?
{32507}{32560}- Yes.|- Where's Beatrix?
{32563}{32628}I stayed longer|and let her leave.
{32631}{32692}But I know how to lock up,|it's no trouble.
{32695}{32736}Gretchen.
{32739}{32788}I want you to lock up the doors|and wait for me,
{32791}{32861}and I'll come pick you up|right now.
{32888}{32947}Yeah, Herr K�nig, it's fine.
{32950}{33026}There's a confused guest|and I need to go check on her.
{33029}{33105}But I have my bike here,|so you don't need to pick me up.
{33108}{33200}Gretchen, listen to me carefully.|I need you to lock the doors...
{34742}{34798}Fuck no.
{35808}{35898}Yes, okay.|Call me back.
{35964}{36026}Damn it.
{36079}{36135}Shit.
{36150}{36199}Gretchen?
{37219}{37272}Where are you?
{37275}{37380}Where are you?|Come here.
{38885}{38949}Hello!
{38963}{39018}Please let me in!
{39045}{39104}- Yes?|- Please let me in right now!
{39107}{39180}- Please!|- I'm coming. Yes, yes.
{39554}{39628}I told you I'm coming!
{40271}{40322}I started bleeding.
{40325}{40437}The woman stood there|until the police arrived.
{40442}{40472}I was chased.
{40475}{40535}Fuck!
{40539}{40644}It's really important that|your statement is as accurate as possible.
{40647}{40674}The receptionist,
{40677}{40785}she stated that she did not see|any woman in the parking lot.
{40811}{40863}May I suggest...
{40866}{40944}we change|the last part into...
{40947}{41092}"The woman stood there until|Mrs. So-and-so entered the room...
{41106}{41167}"Then the police arrived."
{41234}{41298}That is so much better.
{41302}{41357}I think...
{41361}{41434}you are the victim of a prank.
{41463}{41510}Everybody is|very nice here, honey.
{41513}{41632}It's best we run some tests,|but this is actually very common.
{41651}{41719}- Dad.|- Gretchen?
{41722}{41832}- What happened? Did you fall?|- Yeah, that's not the important part.
{41835}{41928}Your sister had some kind of seizure.|We need to get her checked out.
{41931}{41978}Dad, I was attacked.
{41981}{42002}By who?
{42005}{42054}I don't know, the cops think|it was a prank...
{42057}{42104}A prank?|Did somebody hit you?
{42107}{42180}- No, I fell, but...|- Gretchen?
{42292}{42353}She fell, it's okay.
{42404}{42473}We are going to do|an MRI...
{42808}{42889}It might be|childhood epilepsy.
{42892}{42968}Epilepsy?|It might be?
{42971}{43034}It means it might be genetic and|not caused by an injury or tumor.
{43037}{43132}The cause itself isn't life-threatening.
{43135}{43191}- Well, that's good.|- Yeah.
{43194}{43276}The better news is|I'm the superintendent
{43279}{43367}of the chronic disease|treatment center up here.
{43416}{43469}What's causing the seizures?
{43472}{43542}There are many possible triggers|for a seizure in a child.
{43545}{43589}Fever. Certain lights.
{43592}{43671}Certain sounds.|A change in hormone levels.
{43674}{43719}But Alma is|too young for that.
{43722}{43844}Has there been a stressful event|or disruption in your family lately?
{44098}{44157}Hi, you have reached the|Vanderkurt residence.
{44160}{44216}Neither Gretchen nor Olivia|are here now,
{44219}{44276}but we are dying to hear|what you have to say,
{44279}{44350}so get ready to say it!
{44353}{44418}Mom, this place|is completely fucked.
{44421}{44529}Alma keeps freaking out, and they say|she has epilepsy or something.
{44553}{44623}I think Dad is blaming me.
{44641}{44696}I'm coming back home.
{44699}{44756}I got the money.
{44891}{44965}- What happened to you?|- Jesus.
{45005}{45085}I don't want to talk about it.
{45239}{45328}I'm police investigator|Henry Lando.
{45338}{45409}I'd like to ask you|a few questions about the...
{45412}{45496}incident last night.
{45691}{45727}Which one?
{45730}{45816}You told the police|that you were chased by a woman.
{45909}{46003}- I don't want to talk to you.|- Excuse me?
{46007}{46125}Excuse me.|There's another guest waiting.
{46287}{46376}I think there's something wrong|with my air conditioning.
{46397}{46473}Could you come see me|when you're done?
{46484}{46537}Fine.
{46824}{46886}I'm checking out.
{46950}{46999}Okay.
{47236}{47361}You didn't charge me.|Don't I have to pay for the room?
{47427}{47504}No, you don't.
{47671}{47735}Do you smoke?
{48084}{48147}You coming?
{48159}{48253}Yeah, just give me a minute.
{49206}{49315}I have a house back in the States.|I just need to get to an airport.
{49325}{49382}Well, lucky you.
{49419}{49492}We have|one of these in Paris.
{49701}{49795}And then the woman went|into that weird pink bungalow.
{49805}{49862}I wasn't going in there.
{49889}{50001}That pink bungalow|is called the "Lover's Nest".
{50245}{50327}...and then the woman|went into that weird pink bungalow.
{50337}{50400}I wasn't going in there.
{50418}{50526}That pink bungalow|is called the "Lover's Nest".
{50745}{50852}...and then the woman|went into that weird pink bungalow.
{50855}{50927}I wasn't going in there.
{51070}{51119}Watch out!
{53760}{53827}Do you smell this?
{53873}{53925}Yes.
{54026}{54195}Or are those molecules binding|to a receptor in your nasal cavity?
{54292}{54348}Got me.
{54651}{54715}And are you...
{54718}{54835}right now, in this moment...
{54870}{55034}are you putting your slashed skin|back together yourself?
{55110}{55236}And what makes you think|you can take charge of the rest?
{55280}{55336}If I were you...
{55339}{55449}I would stay home|until my body was done
{55452}{55534}growing back those cells.
{55568}{55649}I wouldn't want to|get hurt even more.
{55652}{55744}As if I was stuck in a loop.
{55751}{55832}Can you do this?
{55930}{55980}Good.
{56123}{56180}Apology accepted.
{56230}{56280}Luis.
{56591}{56624}What are you doing?
{56627}{56688}I'm getting my stuff.
{56692}{56755}What? You aren't going|to sleep in the bed?
{56758}{56802}I mean, they said we can...
{56805}{56885}I can't sleep here again, Gretchen.|I've got work to do.
{56888}{56973}Beth has been watching Alma|while I've been here looking after you.
{56976}{57055}I have to go home|and give her a break.
{57082}{57106}Please don't leave.
{57109}{57168}You'll be fine.|There are people in here all the time.
{57171}{57223}No, there's not.|It's deserted all night.
{57226}{57303}It's fine.|You'll be home soon.
{57348}{57381}What if she comes back?
{57384}{57417}Gretchen, stop it!
{57420}{57462}But why?|I'm not making this up!
{57465}{57539}I don't want to hear|any more about this shit.
{57542}{57630}You're making it|very difficult for your sister.
{57802}{57882}- I wasn't high.|- You were!
{57885}{57945}You were tested.
{57948}{57996}You stole money|from Herr K�nig
{57999}{58066}and then you ran away|with a complete stranger.
{58069}{58112}I can't force you|to do anything.
{58115}{58224}You're almost eighteen years old.|But you don't have a job anymore
{58227}{58319}and you will not be|getting an allowance.
{58323}{58378}If you want to run away,
{58381}{58464}you take your|fucking bicycle.
{58711}{58775}Hi, you have reached|the Vanderkurt residence.
{58778}{58831}Neither Gretchen nor Olivia|are here now,
{58834}{58889}but we are dying to hear|what you have to say,
{58892}{58979}so get ready to say it!
{59006}{59059}Mom? Mom...
{59062}{59141}Mom, I really want to|come home.
{59163}{59229}It's really bad.
{59304}{59371}I want to come home.
{59473}{59501}Where's Gretchen?
{59504}{59546}Or what do you think?
{59549}{59599}Where's Gretchen?
{59602}{59685}What do you think, mom?
{59994}{60069}I told you to come see me.
{60109}{60176}I saved your life.
{60197}{60270}I saw the woman.
{60327}{60385}You saw her?
{60388}{60444}And you didn't tell anyone?
{60447}{60497}They think I'm crazy.
{60500}{60582}I need you to help me|find that woman.
{60605}{60644}She's wanted for murder.
{60647}{60735}And I expect her|to come for you again.
{60776}{60839}I can protect you.
{60850}{60914}If we find her...
{60917}{61064}I personally take you|wherever you want to go.
{61110}{61167}Does Alma listen to music often?
{61170}{61197}She loves music,
{61200}{61239}especially since Gretchen|moved in with us.
{61242}{61291}Now...
{61294}{61342}And this is extremely important.
{61345}{61453}Nobody must know|about this investigation.
{61456}{61512}I don't know who to trust.
{61515}{61595}Loud music has showed to trigger seizures|in people with Alma's condition.
{61598}{61699}Alma, Dr. Bonomo says,|music, no more.
{61702}{61775}It's just music.
{61778}{61840}You going out?
{61898}{61982}That's very cool.
{62036}{62109}No, it's not.
{62236}{62370}A month ago,|a married couple on vacation
{62373}{62424}had rented this cabin.
{62427}{62487}A cabin not far from here.
{62490}{62556}The husband told the police|that in the evening
{62559}{62630}he lost consciousness.
{62648}{62707}When he woke up...
{62710}{62841}he found a strange, blonde woman|in his bedroom.
{62869}{62962}Along with his wife,|who he found unconscious.
{62965}{63089}The blonde woman's voice|had a hypnotic effect on the man.
{63097}{63187}He chased the woman into the woods,|but she got away.
{63190}{63275}When the husband|returned to the cabin,
{63310}{63390}his wife had choked on her vomit.
{63461}{63511}Jesus.
{63675}{63725}Dude...
{63728}{63825}The other night, a half-naked woman|came into the reception,
{63828}{63924}and she wasn't|responding to anything.
{64041}{64130}Where was she staying?
{64329}{64398}The Lover's Nest.
{64684}{64791}You're right.|The next bungalow is not in use.
{65055}{65141}I didn't know|stakeouts were gonna be so boring.
{65171}{65234}When are we gonna see|some action?
{65237}{65275}Almost 11.
{65278}{65377}Be on the lookout|and listen for anything strange.
{66087}{66132}What are you doing here?
{66135}{66183}What do you think?|You imbecile!
{66186}{66242}We can't, not here.|We're leaving. Now!
{66245}{66342}Why? I'm cleaning this|fuck-pad all the time!
{66522}{66586}I beg you!
{66619}{66704}You'll have to|make it up to me.
{66727}{66792}I promise.
{66850}{66914}Okay, fine.
{66949}{67031}Let me dry my hair,|then we can go.
{68314}{68409}I know how you can|make it up to me!
{69051}{69157}Erik, I know how you can|make it up to me!
{69433}{69536}Erik, I know how you can|make it up to me!
{73444}{73501}She'll choke.
{73557}{73622}Last time I was too late.
{74159}{74216}Gretchen?
{74253}{74312}Did we wake you?
{74467}{74574}All the owls|have individual calls,
{74577}{74667}so that they can understand each other|over long distances.
{74670}{74730}And maybe we can|make a secret call
{74733}{74802}so that we can|understand each other.
{74805}{74858}Now, I brought you something.
{74861}{74934}I know|that you will like this.
{75127}{75170}Gretchen, come sit with us.
{75173}{75204}Gretchen?
{75207}{75272}I'm so sorry, did we wake you?
{75328}{75357}No.
{75360}{75446}Okay, good.|Please join us.
{75460}{75520}I went out last night.
{75534}{75578}Where did you go?
{75581}{75647}The resort.
{75667}{75721}What were you|doing there?
{75724}{75789}I was with Trixie.
{75838}{75915}I didn't know Beatrix|was working late last night.
{75918}{75964}She wasn't.
{75967}{76033}She was really confused.
{76042}{76080}Come to think of it,|a lot like the guest
{76083}{76140}we spoke about over the phone|the other night.
{76143}{76216}I will look into this.
{76219}{76303}Why is there nobody|working the reception after ten?
{76306}{76383}Seems like a lot of people|need assistance after ten.
{76386}{76487}- It doesn't make sense economically.|- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
{76490}{76568}I can show you the numbers if you'd|like. It's not so interesting, but...
{76571}{76629}Maybe another time.
{76660}{76735}- It's quite the place you got here.|- Gretchen, what's the matter?
{76738}{76798}Why did you|bring us here?
{76942}{77002}Your parents are planning a...
{77005}{77062}A new resort, I know.
{77104}{77131}Why do we have to live here?
{77134}{77174}Gretchen!
{77177}{77274}- Because it's pretty outside?|- Calm down right now.
{77702}{77791}You are here because|your family belongs here.
{77885}{77926}That's a fucking weird way|to put it!
{77929}{77976}Gretchen, that's enough!|What has gotten into you?
{77979}{78001}I don't know, dad!
{78004}{78062}I'm just reflecting on this very|fucking weird living situation
{78065}{78109}that everybody just|seems to be cool with.
{78112}{78197}Out, now!
{78214}{78265}- Great.|- No, no, Luis.
{78268}{78311}A gentleman knows|when it's time to leave.
{78314}{78356}You need some family time,|I understand.
{78359}{78406}No, Herr K�nig,|we don't want you to leave.
{78409}{78455}It's okay, thank you|for the wonderful afternoon
{78458}{78487}and I wish you a good evening.
{78490}{78509}I'm very sorry.
{78512}{78562}No, Luis, we are|so very happy to have you here.
{78565}{78629}We've been desperately eager|for you to be here.
{78632}{78729}And Gretchen, if there is|anything that... bothers you,
{78732}{78799}don't be afraid to...
{78802}{78860}talk to me.
{78894}{78980}Oh, I leave your package|just here.
{78999}{79054}Oh, it was a surprise.
{79057}{79103}I was not supposed|to say anything.
{79106}{79134}I am so sorry.
{79137}{79193}What package?
{79210}{79227}What package?
{79230}{79300}It has your family name on it.
{79608}{79677}It was your mother's stuff.
{79693}{79748}The small stuff, at least.
{79751}{79793}I received it this morning.
{79796}{79897}I... Your father should perhaps|change the address on the counter...
{79901}{79970}What is it doing here, dad?
{80081}{80139}I sold the old house.
{80243}{80306}It was... still my house.
{80320}{80398}And I put the money|in an account for you.
{80455}{80539}I... I didn't want you|to get worked up again...
{80756}{80821}Hi, you have reached|the Vanderkurt residence.
{80824}{80878}Neither Gretchen nor Olivia|are here now,
{80881}{80939}but we are dying to hear|what you have to say,
{80942}{81002}so get ready to say it.
{81005}{81098}Mom, I really want to go home.
{81109}{81175}It's really bad.
{81249}{81321}I really want to come home.
{81429}{81485}What do you think?
{81585}{81650}What do you think, mom?
{81656}{81729}What's your take on that, mom?
{82123}{82204}Next message.
{82229}{82316}Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,|my name is Alma.
{82319}{82392}I'm calling you|because of my sister, Gretchen.
{82395}{82447}Gretchen calls you|when she feels bad,
{82450}{82492}but you never answer.
{82495}{82550}I can hear her from my room.
{82553}{82588}I'm worried.
{82591}{82697}If you get my message, I want you|to call Gretchen back on the phone.
{82700}{82758}You can tell her|that you love her.
{82761}{82813}It would mean a lot to her.
{82816}{82865}It would make her happy.
{82868}{82942}If you'd like to,|you can come visit us.
{82945}{83012}You are always welcome here.
{83472}{83546}Good, you're packed.
{83559}{83625}Do you even know how to drive?
{83634}{83699}Where is everybody?
{83736}{83804}They're at the hospital|with Dr. Bonomo.
{83807}{83901}Alma had a very strong seizure.
{83922}{83977}It's your fault, Gretchen.|You know that.
{83980}{84048}You terrified her.
{84064}{84184}I want you now to write|a farewell note.
{84190}{84248}Then we will pick up|some money for you at my house
{84251}{84294}and I'll drive you to the station.
{84297}{84368}The last train leaves in one hour.
{84754}{84823}Bring your bike.
{85526}{85574}You like it?
{85577}{85612}Sure.
{85615}{85707}You know it?|A common cuckoo.
{85710}{85781}A magnificent creature.
{85791}{85831}Common.
{85834}{85947}But its behavior is not.
{85950}{86045}Its nature is quite remarkable.
{86071}{86159}A nature modern man|destroys by disregard.
{86162}{86295}Some species need our help|to survive and reproduce.
{86328}{86407}I'm a preservationist,|you know?
{86865}{86907}Oh, come along now.
{86910}{87031}I want you to understand|who you got involved with.
{87034}{87182}Herr Lando here was trespassing|on my property with an illegal firearm.
{87185}{87224}What are you doing?
{87227}{87279}He's a cop.
{87297}{87354}No, he's not.
{87357}{87398}Not anymore.
{87401}{87508}You see, Erik here,|he's actually a policeman.
{87511}{87601}He has access|to police files.
{87604}{87684}Herr Lando|was recently discharged
{87687}{87769}when they found out|he was investigating a case,
{87772}{87870}one that he is|personally involved with.
{87873}{87973}Okay, Erik, I think it is time to take|Herr Lando to the police station.
{87976}{88049}Gretchen,|let's get your money.
{88138}{88195}This way, please.
{88198}{88260}Come along, now.
{89677}{89786}You are a liability, Gretchen.|I can't let you out.
{89789}{89848}What the fuck|did you spray me with?
{89851}{89894}Just pheromones.
{89897}{90024}I am giving you the chance to be of great use|in our quest for preservation.
{90027}{90105}The adolescent|needs to be trained.
{90156}{90223}Consider yourself lucky.
{90430}{90512}- It's a mild sedative.|- What?
{90515}{90600}It'll make Alma sleep|through the night.
{90710}{90778}I'm staying here tonight.
{90834}{90927}These creatures|can't speak like you or I.
{90930}{91090}But when trained, their song|can be dizzyingly persuasive.
{93018}{93105}No, no! Stay focused!
{93944}{94019}That's enough for today.
{94481}{94541}Come here.
{94752}{94821}Something is not right.
{95097}{95248}It is always something of a confirmation|of my dreams and good intentions.
{95303}{95380}Gretchen, your parents need to hurry up|with those construction plans.
{95383}{95468}This one needs her own|mating grounds soon, no?
{95487}{95564}And you know what else|she needs, Erik?
{95576}{95690}What happened to Herr Lando's wife|must not repeat itself.
{95752}{95846}I'm very sorry for what happened|to your wife, Herr Lando.
{95849}{95988}But this one's mother|wandered off my area of authority.
{95997}{96100}She got nervous|when this one left the nest
{96103}{96205}before we had another offspring|ready to replace her.
{96208}{96308}There were family matters|prolonging my endeavor.
{96410}{96462}Actually...
{96465}{96545}Are you aware that|you have had the good fortune
{96548}{96639}to witness three laying ceremonies|as of now?
{96642}{96683}Wow.
{96686}{96781}Most people don't get|to attend a single one.
{96784}{96859}And those that do|don't remember that they did.
{96862}{97002}A sacred process that keeps|an ancient creature alive and well.
{97005}{97075}A magnificent creature|whose approach to family
{97078}{97164}is beyond|human comprehension.
{97218}{97262}Which brings me|back to you, Erik.
{97265}{97348}You will get Beatrix|ready to conceive.
{97351}{97442}Consider your mishap last night|a dry run.
{97554}{97607}Erik?
{97620}{97699}I told him,|not in the house.
{98191}{98222}Stay here.
{98225}{98270}No, no, no, no.
{98273}{98311}You should be on your side.
{98314}{98379}You could choke, my dear.
{98695}{98744}Nein!
{99124}{99168}Honey?|Honey, what's wrong?
{99171}{99231}I don't feel so good.
{99259}{99315}Take this.
{99611}{99687}Everything's fine.
{99714}{99782}Everything's fine.
{99944}{100043}I think they|impregnate women at the resort.
{100718}{100786}After my mom died,
{100789}{100871}I accidentally|called our house...
{100889}{100982}and I heard her voice|on the answering machine.
{101031}{101107}It kind of helped,
{101118}{101185}so I kept calling.
{101234}{101308}Maybe you can do that too.
{102371}{102453}Do you know|what this bird is famous for?
{102508}{102642}This bird lays its eggs|in the nests of other bird species
{102645}{102776}and then lets those birds|raise its offspring.
{102826}{102896}No! Not in here!
{103608}{103696}Your parents spent|their honeymoon here?
{103935}{104022}How old is your sister?
{104135}{104190}Gretchen?
{104203}{104253}Yes, I'm fine.
{104256}{104309}We are in the treatment center|by the hospital.
{104312}{104405}If you come back in the morning,|Alma won't even know you were gone.
{104408}{104517}Alma is going to stay here for the evening.|Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor her sleep.
{104520}{104573}- Dad...|- Beth and I are coming home.
{104576}{104652}Dad, I really need to|talk to you about...
{104680}{104745}What is it, Gretchen?
{104755}{104813}We can't trust them.
{104816}{104871}Gretchen, we can talk|when we're home.
{104874}{104956}I told you|I will protect you.
{105020}{105058}Get ready.
{105061}{105127}What's wrong with Beth?
{105476}{105585}Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.
{105598}{105712}This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.
{105723}{105837}Astonishing resemblance|to her surrogate mother, Beth.
{105840}{105938}The surrogate mother's distress|grows in close proximity
{105941}{105981}to the biological mother.
{105984}{106107}Thus both host parents|have been removed from the premises.
{106154}{106224}Compared to|animal brood parasites,
{106227}{106353}homo-cuculidae developed|a unique evolutionary trait.
{106356}{106451}Instead of leaving their offspring|in the care of a host,
{106454}{106566}homo-cuculidae returns|to claim their young.
{106569}{106614}Contact with the biological mother
{106617}{106710}speeds up the process|of the offspring's physical development
{106713}{106810}and its abilities significantly.
{106877}{107004}We are about to initiate|the first close-distance encounter
{107007}{107078}with the biological mother.
{107538}{107600}Brood parasites.
{107642}{107687}They don't impregnate.
{107690}{107774}They implant eggs.
{107811}{107903}My wife and I|tried to get pregnant.
{107945}{108051}I was supposed to|fertilize that egg.
{108096}{108154}Like your father...
{108164}{108220}on his honeymoon.
{108256}{108322}And then what do they do?
{108343}{108414}Release them into the wild.
{108443}{108500}When the mother shows up...
{108503}{108582}I end this experiment.
{108603}{108676}What about my sister?
{108716}{108811}That is not your sister.
{108831}{108868}Two.
{108871}{108987}Yeah, the sister of the young woman|and a rogue police detective.
{108990}{109092}Yeah, I am afraid we must commence|definitive measures immediately.
{109095}{109155}She's dead.
{109159}{109307}The feather I wrote my name with,|the plumage of the apportioners.
{109403}{109461}We're in the middle|of an experiment.
{109464}{109537}What happened?|You're bleeding.
{109540}{109608}The recordings you made|behind my back...
{109611}{109713}Are they still under the staircase|at your house?
{109805}{109854}Yeah.
{109915}{109984}I'm sorry, Danielle.
{110488}{110541}No! No!
{110736}{110800}I'm not going to hurt you.
{111628}{111681}Alma. Alma?
{111684}{111735}Alma, we have to go.
{111738}{111802}We have to go now.
{112442}{112497}Just stay right here.
{113718}{113795}Cover your ears|and stay close to me.
{114868}{114926}Alma?
{126106}{126209}Herr K�nig, she's dead!
{126212}{126300}Mom is dead!
{126303}{126378}Where's your machine gun,|my dear?
{126381}{126453}Is it under your cast?
{126504}{126531}Why me?
{126534}{126616}It's not about you,|you little brat.
{126619}{126673}This is nature.
{126685}{126841}She is supposed to be focusing|on reproduction and breeding.
{126844}{126990}And you are competing|for resources with her offspring.
{126993}{127123}Our process here ensures|that each new generation we breed
{127126}{127197}is more powerful|than the last.
{127200}{127268}And my dear,|when I am done with you
{127271}{127363}and reunite Alma with...
{129271}{129356}I'm sorry.
{129439}{129626}I would never hurt you.
{129672}{129763}Stay away from her, Alma.
{129778}{129935}We have to leave now.
{130310}{130433}My mom called.
{130612}{130754}She got your message.
{130913}{131011}Will she come to visit?
{131149}{131199}No.
{131207}{131311}She can't.
{131338}{131482}But she says thank you.
{131486}{131557}Thank you, Alma.
{132281}{132350}Thank you, Alma.
{132512}{132588}I really need your help.
{132874}{132926}Henry!
{132929}{133005}You said you'll protect me.
{133060}{133113}I stand by it.
{133116}{133204}Did you ever tell your wife|you'd protect her?
{133288}{133343}What?
{133369}{133482}Did you tell her|you'd protect her?
{133581}{133633}Did you?
{133713}{133773}Yes!
{133776}{133851}Okay, we are coming out now.
{134450}{134496}Alma!
{134499}{134588}I need you to come|to me now, my angel.
{134615}{134700}What are you doing?|She's one of them!
{134703}{134774}- Alma!|- I don't think so.
{134777}{134874}- Come to me.|- She will be.
{134878}{134943}She will become!
{134946}{134986}I don't think so.
{134989}{135012}Alma!
{135015}{135063}We need to find out|how many there are.
{135066}{135158}I need to take my sister|away from this place.
{135161}{135224}- Stop!|- Let her go.
{135227}{135296}Let her go,|she's destined to become a mother.
{135299}{135351}She is not your sister!
{135354}{135389}They stopped|reproducing before.
{135392}{135430}They will go extinct|without preservation.
{135433}{135471}Oh, they will go extinct.
{135474}{135521}Hundreds of years of research.
{135524}{135573}This is the will|of the apportioners.
{135576}{135631}Let her go.
{135634}{135699}You don't know|what you're doing!
