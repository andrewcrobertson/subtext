1
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Yeah!

2
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,800
You know the first thing I thought
when I saw you?

3
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,320
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

4
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
What if it's a her?

5
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
What would you call her?

6
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Ragni, maybe.

7
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Sorry?

8
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Ragni.

9
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,200
Let me think about that for a second.

10
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,920
- Boy's name?
- Texas.

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
You kidding me?

13
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
- Texas is, like, a state, you know?
- I know.

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,240
There's about three or four hours
till we reach the peak.

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Ah, great.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,680
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,240
Then, I swear, no more wedding talk.

18
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Of course.

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,640
It's about the band.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,176
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

22
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Yeah, it's just that I don't want
to use your brother's band.

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
- Why not?
- Honey...

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
He's super, super good.

25
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,360
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,536
And... and he... he even takes

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,896
- vocal lessons now.
- Yeah, I know this.

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,760
I know this. It's just that,
well, Eric is no good.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,400
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

30
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,000
His singing is like shit.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
Hey.

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
I mean, he has a nice b...

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Olaf!

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,120
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, God.

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,920
Wait for me.
Why are you so sensitive?

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Told you I could get us here.

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
It's beautiful.

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Thank you. I love you.

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Elsa.

40
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,520
- Look.
- What is it?

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Look.

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,920
Look.

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Quick, the camera. Get the camera.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,160
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,480
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

46
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
We have such good luck in nature.

47
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
What do you see?

48
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,440
It's demented or something.

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
What?

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,376
- Can I get the camera?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Give me the camera.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,520
Demented?

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,520
I... I think we should leave it.

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,376
It's... it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Come on.

56
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,520
- Come on.
- It's so cute.

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,400
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

59
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,680
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Oh, fuck.

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,120
- Don't panic.
- What do we do?

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,880
"If it's black, fight back.
If it's brown, lay down."

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,576
But is it black or is it brown?

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,456
- I mean, it looks brown to me.
- We're in Appalachia.

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
It's black.

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,336
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
You're not a bear expert.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Whatever you do, don't...

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh, no...

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,520
- I said don't run! Stop...!
- Uphill...

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,640
- Run!
- Where do we go?

72
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,080
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
Oh, my God...!

74
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,200
Run!

75
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,360
- Run! He's coming! Come on!
- It's following us! No!

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
Olaf! No!

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
God!

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Olaf!

79
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
- Olaf! Help me!
- Come on...!

80
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
Olaf!

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
This is drugs.

82
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,800
This is your brain on drugs.

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,280
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,480
The thrill can kill.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,680
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

86
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
and pulling the trigger.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Millions of dollars' worth of cocaine
dropped from the sky

88
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,320
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

89
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Kenley Jones reports tonight

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,480
it was found on the body
of a man who fell to his death

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
when his parachute failed to open.

92
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
The body of
the heavily armed parachutist

93
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,560
was found early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

94
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

95
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,296
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open

96
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,120
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,280
wrapped in football-size packages

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,520
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,840
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,960
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
Nothing.

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480
Here's the ID.

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
I know who that is.

105
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Full name: Andrew C. Thornton II.

106
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,600
Man was out of his mind.

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,480
What's the "C" stand for?

108
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,320
You said "full name",
but you didn't say his full name.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,480
Thornton was one of
Syd White's guys out of Missouri.

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,440
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,040
{\an5}Part of the Bluegrass Conspiracy.

112
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,480
And there's more of this out there.

113
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,560
They dumped it somewhere.

114
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
Hey, Reba, you have a dog, right?

115
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Had. Border collie.

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Barry.

117
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,800
Sorry for your loss.

118
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,880
Border collie, huh?

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,520
That's a cool dog.

120
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
Did he play fetch and stuff?

121
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,080
He loved fetch.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,000
What?

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,680
Nothing. I just...

124
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,000
That's just awesome.

125
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Damn it, Gabe.

126
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Hi, Daveed.

127
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,560
Mind if I order first?

128
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,200
This won't take long.

129
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Damn, I just bought these.

130
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,480
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

131
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
Did you hear about Thornton?

132
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,680
It's a tough way to go.

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
He only had 30 kilos on him.

134
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
- Chattahoochee.
- Georgia?

136
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,960
There's an area
called Blood Mountain.

137
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
When the plane's going down

138
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
And then we just go and get it.

140
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,200
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
Eddie's in mourning.

143
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Joanie just died.

144
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
And he quit.

145
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,480
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

146
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
She's not here anymore.

147
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,160
The sooner he moves on, the better.

148
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,560
Syd, I... I just don't...

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Stop.

150
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

152
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
Grandpa Syd, watch.

153
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
Yeah, that's great.

154
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
{\an5}I got to go. Shift starts at eight.

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,320
Tomorrow's lunch is in the fridge,
and the chicken's...

156
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,360
Chicken's in the microwave.
Just hit "start".

157
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
Thought you were off tonight.

158
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,560
We talked about this, remember?
Me picking up some extra shifts?

159
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,776
You said you were okay with it.

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
I was okay with it until I realized
why you want those extra shifts

161
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,040
so you could go and do
overtime with Ray the Pediatrician.

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,040
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

163
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
You know, he invited us

164
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,600
to go to Nashville this weekend
to see his band play.

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,280
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

166
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,736
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

168
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
It's Nashville.

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,680
He's a good guy, Deirdra.

170
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,600
- Just give him a chance.
- Give him a chance.

171
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,680
- Please don't do that.
- Please don't do that.

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
Do what?

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,800
You know what.

174
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,240
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,480
Close my door.

176
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,760
That's enough for today.

177
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Wait, what?

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Hey, Eddie.

179
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
They spelled her name wrong, Daveed.

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,280
It says "John".

181
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Says "John."

182
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

183
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,440
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

184
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,400
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

185
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,800
I got seven more days of "John".

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
<i>The chutist has been identified</i>

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,520
<i>as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.</i>

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,840
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,160
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,680
Says you haven't seen Gabe in weeks.

191
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm so sad, man.

192
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm so fucking sad. Okay?

193
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,880
Can I get the... the penne, please?

194
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,336
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just...

195
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,680
It's just plain.

196
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,840
I knew you'd be late.

197
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,880
It finally came in. Check it out.

198
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
How many weeks' allowance is that?

199
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Like a thousand, but worth it.

200
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,600
Can I use the toilet?

201
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,720
No. My mom is gonna be home soon.

202
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,240
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

203
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,200
Why by lunch?

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,680
The light, Henry.

205
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
But I got to go pee.

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Go outside.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Why do I skip school with you?
You're bossier than the teachers.

208
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,560
Now, the adoption people

209
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,400
I'm not sure
who I talked to over there

210
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
told me I was supposed
to be getting me a Lab.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,400
A fun one, a...
a man's-best-friend type.

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,056
I don't know if there was an error

213
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,640
because the one I got
is just kind of...

214
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,640
- Bob?
- I don't know

215
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,080
just kind of fancy.

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,400
- Bob, Captain says it's time to go.
- Got it.

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,760
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

218
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,160
Hey, Reba.

219
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
You got plans for tonight?

220
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,160
Bob, you're a nice guy.

221
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,120
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after Rosette?

222
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,000
I have to go to Georgia
for the Thornton case

223
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,520
and you said you were good at dogs.

224
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
I said I had a dog.

225
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,880
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

226
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,200
A trucker overheard a couple of guys
talking at a bar last night.

227
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
I'll tell you in the car.

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
No...

229
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,840
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

230
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

231
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,200
I only had her for a day.

232
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Please?

233
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,400
I don't know if I could trust
anyone else around here.

234
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,200
Just go. We'll be fine.

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Thanks.

236
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,120
Can't believe I left the backpack.

237
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
I can. I know the way.

238
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,280
School's gonna call, you know.

239
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,760
You know what? Let 'em.

240
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,120
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

241
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,160
So is your dad.

242
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

243
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,736
For a girl who likes to be left alone

244
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,160
you do a lot of shit for attention.

245
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,056
Look, I'm not ditching for attention.
I just want to paint the waterfall.

246
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,680
Admit it. You want her
to find out and worry about you.

247
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,960
Jesus! Fuck!

248
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Coral, it's Sari.
Is Dee Dee over there?

249
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
School just called.

250
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
No.

251
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,160
Yeah, well,
can you just put Elliot on?

252
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school

253
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,480
so can you please just put him on?

254
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,120
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,760
What the hell is wrong with him?

256
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Never mind.

257
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,080
50 cents.

258
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,960
I'm not gonna see that wrapper
outside on the ground, now, am I?

259
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,080
No, ma'am.

260
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,120
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

261
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
What?

262
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,320
Empty your pockets.

263
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,600
Vest pocket. Come on.

264
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
Is that perfume?

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
That's none of your business.

266
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,680
Well, it smells really nice.

267
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,960
Yeah, well, it's European.

268
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Oh.

269
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,800
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

270
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
- Is it too much?
- Not at all.

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Smells expensive.

272
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,160
Well, it is.

273
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,560
You want a sucker?

274
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,160
Sure.

275
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,200
- I like the green one.
- This is a red one.

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
Oh, shit. He's here.

278
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,960
Am I in the right place?

279
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Oh!

280
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Right. Told you it was big.

281
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
Oh, it's big.

282
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
What's that smell?

283
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,640
It's European.

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,240
Someone been smoking?

285
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
He was.

286
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,496
- Can you believe it?
- What?

287
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,240
You know, cigarettes kill people.

288
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

289
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

290
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,776
Yeah, and you... you should
be educating yourself

291
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,440
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

292
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Just get out of here.

293
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
Get out.

294
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
Unbelievable.

295
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,080
You got a dusty beaver here, Ranger.

296
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

297
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey, Henry!

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,000
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

299
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Hold on.

300
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,000
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

301
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
Marking our territory.

302
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,800
Don't shit out here!

303
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,560
I'm not shitting.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,760
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

305
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,280
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

306
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,120
Hey, Henry.

307
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,640
Check it out.

308
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,080
It's drugs, I think.

309
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,560
It's drugs?

310
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,680
Remember that guy from assembly?

311
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,760
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

313
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
No.

314
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,120
This is definitely cocaine.

315
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah. Of course. I'm just
not used to seeing it like that.

316
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,200
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

317
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,560
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

318
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,720
When I do it.

319
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Oh, yeah? With who?

320
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,840
With Faulk.

321
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
After church.

322
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,056
Are you friends with Faulk?

324
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,240
No. He's a pervert.

325
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,360
Then you wouldn't know.

326
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,640
- Liar.
- You're just mad

327
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
you're never invited.

328
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,760
I don't care I'm not invited.

329
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,600
Sounds like you care.

330
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Do some, then.

331
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,040
What?

332
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,120
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

333
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,760
Well, we're exercising, though.
Shooting and stuff.

334
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

335
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
That wouldn't be good.

336
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Fine.

337
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Knife me.

338
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,720
Okay, so how do I do it?

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
You eat it.

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How much?

341
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
Like a tablespoon's worth.

342
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,760
Oh!

343
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
Son of a bitch!

344
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,200
Oh, what the hell?

345
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Rookie.

346
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
You do it, then.

347
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
Shit!

348
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
What the hell?

349
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,040
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

350
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,360
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

351
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
Let's sell drugs together.

352
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,560
Yeah, we could sell them
on the street like you and Faulk.

353
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
There's more.

354
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Ow.

355
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
Something got into it.

356
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,240
A deer, maybe.

357
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,480
Could you imagine that?

358
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,040
Deer on cocaine?

359
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
It'd be like this.

360
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,680
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like... bang!

361
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,400
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

362
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

363
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Hey, Dee Dee.

364
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,560
Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
Your dad has definitely done cocaine.

366
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
My throat's really runny.

367
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Stop that.

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,000
Did it do the cocaine?

369
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
Don't move a muscle.

370
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,040
<i>Listen to me. You were supposed
to grab Eddie, not run your mouth.</i>

371
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,600
<i>Now we have trouble. You understand?</i>

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,480
Got it. I'll take care of it.

373
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,400
<i>Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.</i>

374
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
<i>Grandpa Syd!</i>

375
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,400
<i>Gabe, driving me nuts. Little...</i>

376
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Fuck.

377
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,480
Joan loved this song.

378
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,360
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

379
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Eddie, listen.

380
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,680
When Joanie died

381
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
It's fine.

383
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
No, I could've did more.

384
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,920
- It's fine.
- I should've been there.

385
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I didn't need you there.

386
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,736
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

387
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,080
It's against my constitution.

388
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm more than a drug dealer.

389
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

390
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
We're friends, right?

391
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
No.

392
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Fine.

393
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,520
I think he's happy she's dead.

394
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,920
He's not happy she died.

395
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,200
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business

396
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
if we can call it that.

397
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,320
Sometimes...

398
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,640
I wonder if he did it to her.

399
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,000
What? No, Joanie died of cancer.

400
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
I know.

401
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,720
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

402
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,160
You can't give no one cancer.

403
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, you can. With stress.

404
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,520
Stop protecting him.

405
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,736
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

406
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
No!

407
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay.

408
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Okay, so we start...

409
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,440
- Did you notice my nails?
- Those are beautiful.

410
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,816
- Thank you. We start...
- Excuse me.

411
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
Is the ranger in?

412
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm wearing the stuff.

413
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,960
Oh. Did either of you see a girl,
13, come through here?

414
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,736
- My daughter...
- You lost your daughter in the park.

415
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

416
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
Yeah. Hikers under 16
must be accompanied by an adult.

417
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,120
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

418
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,080
You know, we get
a lot of runaways, bad apples

419
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,040
youngsters who aren't too happy
with the way things are at home.

420
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,240
She's not a runaway.
She just came to paint the...

421
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,000
Can someone just please point me
in the direction of Blood Mountain?

422
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,280
This is Blood Mountain.

423
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,136
- Sorry. I'm... I'm Peter.
- Oh. This is Peter

424
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,360
wildlife inspection rep.

425
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
We're about
to head up there ourselves.

426
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,920
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

427
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,800
Now, Peter, the wildlife inspection
is a very important process.

428
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,520
We wouldn't want you distracted by
our little damsel in distress here.

429
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Nothing can distract me
from making sure

430
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,960
the entire biological community
is safe for all our friends.

431
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,080
Friends?

432
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,920
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

433
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,200
He doesn't like to call them animals.

434
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, I won't be a burden.

435
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,560
I'll get my hat.

436
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Okay.

437
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,400
Shoes okay for hiking?

438
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Oh, yeah. I think I'll be okay.

439
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,120
- I have on boots.
- Yep.

440
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Come on, Eddie.
I'm done playing this game.

441
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,520
You... you wanted... You were
the one who wanted to play this.

442
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,640
You still have three more questions.

443
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,880
- Listen.
- What?

444
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,856
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

445
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,600
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

446
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

447
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,520
I didn't know rangers carried guns.

448
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
Park rangers are peace officers.

449
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Which means we can shoot people.

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
Forest is a dangerous place.

451
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,760
That gang of pubes are dangerous.

452
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,120
"Gang of pubes"?

453
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,360
Teens. Delinquents.

454
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,840
They've been attacking hikers.

455
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
They hurt anyone?

456
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,040
They cut them with a knife.

457
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,520
Call themselves the Doochamps.

458
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Watch your back.

459
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,680
Pop-art punks pop up out of nowhere.

460
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
Out of nowhere.

461
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Fuck is this?

462
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,320
He's afraid, buds.

463
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,200
Empty your pockets.

464
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,880
- No.
- Empty your pockets, please.

465
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
Since you asked so nicely.

466
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,760
You think this is a joke?

467
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,160
I do.

468
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,560
Get him, buds.

469
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,656
I'm shaking a fucking knife,
man. Come on.

470
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,416
- Just stab him.
- Come on, man. It's a fucking knife!

471
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Go on!

472
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,840
- Come on, Rocky...
- Ah! <i>Banzai</i>!

473
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,400
Give me this fucking board!

474
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
You're going down, man!

475
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
Submit...!

476
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,840
What the...

477
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,200
Hold this!

478
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,400
Fucking skateboard!

479
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,200
Oh, my.

480
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,240
The fuck is wrong with y'all?

481
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,720
Shit!

482
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
I love this road.

483
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,800
Ah, love it up there.

484
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,816
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

485
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,120
What? The falls.

486
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,256
- The Secret Falls. Right, we can
- I thought...

487
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,400
- go up this way or take the loop.
- I love the loop.

488
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,000
- Well, you can see the top of the...
- This is a more direct...

489
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,120
All right. We're going this way.

490
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
Well, crap.

491
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,880
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

492
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,600
Just distracting you completely.

493
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,800
She can hear you.

494
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,080
I wanted to get up to see the sunset.

495
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,040
What's taking you so long?

496
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,160
What'd you do?

497
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,240
Please tell me
you found them like this.

498
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
They attacked me.

499
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,600
- Are they dead?
- Well, one might be.

500
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,440
The... the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

501
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,000
Jesus Chr... They're kids.

502
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,320
I loved this fucking jersey, man.

503
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,840
Okay, they're fine.

504
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Thank God.

505
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,480
No fucking way.

506
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,480
Daveed?

507
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,800
- What happened?
- Hey.

508
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,400
Wake up.

509
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
Where'd you find this?

510
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,600
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

511
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
You tried to fucking kill me.

512
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,200
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

513
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
I tell him that all the time.

514
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,920
Where did you find this?

515
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Up on the mountain.

516
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Where's the rest of it?

517
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I don't know.

518
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,720
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

519
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,920
What do you think I'll do to just you
when you're already on the floor?

520
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,520
Okay...

521
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,320
We stashed it under a gazebo.

522
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,720
Going back for it later tonight.

523
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,320
A gazebo?

524
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,280
It's a pavilion-type structure.

525
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,920
I know what the fuck a gazebo is.

526
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I didn't.

527
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,640
Are my buds dead?

528
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
- Show us where.
- Oh, God.

529
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,000
You know, I'm... I'm feeling
kind of tired. I think I should rest.

530
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,920
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

531
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Eddie, go get the gun.

532
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
It's in the glove.

533
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
I prefer we left guns out of this.

534
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Yeah. Same.

535
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,240
And I would prefer not to be stabbed.

536
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,600
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

537
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Okay.

538
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
Okay. All right... I'm coming.

539
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,360
Relax.

540
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,800
It's getting real cold out.

541
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's go.

542
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,720
So, where you guys from?

543
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,360
Shut up. Keep walking.

544
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,240
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

545
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
It better not be a long hike.

546
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Friend's pretty serious, ain't he?

547
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,936
Well, I don't think he's too happy

548
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,336
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

549
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Well, it wasn't me.

550
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,640
I don't blame him, though.

551
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,760
Getting stabbed sucks.

552
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
Hey, shut the fuck up.

553
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,440
Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.

554
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
I was wondering how Rosette is doing.

555
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,400
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye. I...

556
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,360
I don't know if dogs think
about that sort of thing, but...

557
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,160
Anyway, I...

558
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,880
Thanks again for helping out.

559
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Bye.

560
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,320
Look at this.

561
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,920
- Oh, no.
- Look at this mess.

562
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,680
People don't have any respect.

563
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,280
This is gonna end up in scat

564
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
- this plastic.
- I... Let me pick that up.

565
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
- Thank you, Ranger.
- Dee Dee!

566
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
That is sticking.

567
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
I got some oil in the car.

568
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,320
- Dee Dee! Henry!
- 'Cause if that stays open

569
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,560
critters can get in there.

570
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
Oh, yeah, critters.

571
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,320
What kind of critters? Huh?

572
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,280
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

573
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
- Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

574
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,560
- Dee Dee!
- Skunks.

575
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,936
Raccoon, you know, little burglar.

576
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,936
- That's right. Yeah,
- Got his own little mask on.

577
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,176
- With their cute little outfit.
- I think they're cute.

578
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
- Skunks.
- Skunks.

579
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,360
- Possums.
- Possums. Definitely possums.

580
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,680
- Possum.
- Hey, possum.

581
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,000
Mrs. McKinndry!

582
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Henry?

583
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,360
Here! Hello?

584
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,520
- Henry?
- Up here!

585
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,680
- Hey. Whoa.
- Oh.

586
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,360
Henry, what are you doing up there?

587
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,560
No... that's not safe at all.

588
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,680
- No.
- It's too high.

589
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,520
- You got to come down.
- Get down here.

590
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,720
Don't be mad, but we skipped school.

591
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,440
- No shit, Henry.
- It's high.

592
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,600
But there was a bear.

593
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,120
A really terrible bear.

594
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,600
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

595
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,400
- It was fucked!
- Hey!

596
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,160
That's inappropriate.

597
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,120
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

598
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
It attacked you?

599
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,760
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
- No...

600
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,640
Bears are very peaceful creatures.

601
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,360
You must have done something
to upset it.

602
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

603
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

604
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,760
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

605
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,800
You have to listen to me!

606
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,680
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

607
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,000
The monster took her.

608
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,680
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

609
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
Get down here now.

610
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
A...

611
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,600
I...

612
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Dee Dee!

613
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Peter!

614
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
- Peter!
- No!

615
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,120
Oh! Oh, no!

616
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,680
It let me go! He ran off!

617
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,080
Henry, jump down.

618
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,200
It's too high.

619
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Is it gone?

620
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,920
Do you see it?

621
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

622
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,920
Why are you shooting at me?

623
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Get your ass down!

624
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,560
This is your fault.

625
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,000
Right behind you. I saw it.

626
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,200
Stay down.

627
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
What?

628
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,160
Help me!

629
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Help!

630
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
Ranger!

631
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Ranger!

632
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,680
Did it get you?

633
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,800
That asshole!

634
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm gonna get him.

635
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm gonna get that asshole.

636
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
I'll get help.

637
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
Where are you going?

638
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,080
God Almighty.

639
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,560
Hey. What...

640
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Where is it?

641
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Hey!

642
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,800
What should I do?

643
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,160
Motherfucker!

644
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,720
Come back! Help us!

645
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,920
Oh, fuck!

646
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,416
There's something wrong with it.

647
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Yeah, I told you there was.

648
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,720
Why is it acting like this?

649
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,880
Did you feed it cocaine?

650
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,440
No. But you're safe.

651
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
Bears can't climb trees.

652
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,320
Of course they can!

653
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,280
Then, why are you up here?

654
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,800
It's okay...

655
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Okay.

656
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
No.

657
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,040
Henry, climb.

658
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,320
Henry, go.

659
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,840
Climb...!

660
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,960
You got to get higher!

661
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,280
- Climb.
- Go, Henry!

662
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Go!

663
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,400
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

664
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,400
- Go up!
- Henry, go!

665
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh, God.

666
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,840
Go, Henry! No!

667
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,360
No! Oh, God. Henry!

668
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,360
Oh, God.

669
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,040
Oh, shit.

670
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,800
No...!

671
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
Get off of me!

672
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,560
No...!

673
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,640
No! Get off of me!

674
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,760
Henry, jump! Jump down!

675
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,520
Move, Henry!

676
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,160
It's okay...
You're doing great.

677
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
You're almost there. Come on, baby.

678
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

679
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Go. Hide. Come here...

680
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,200
That was so messed up.

681
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,320
That little man was
an expert on bears

682
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,440
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

683
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,280
Wait. What did you say?

684
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,040
We found cocaine, Mrs. McKinndry.

685
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,576
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

686
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
and then went crazy on me and Dee Dee

687
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,520
and now on that guy back there.

688
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Did you hear him scream?

689
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,200
He's so dead.

690
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
I'd love to not remember that.

691
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,640
But it kind of seems like the thing
that stays with a man forever.

692
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,800
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

693
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,520
Alive? Yeah.

694
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,120
It chased her that way.

695
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
We got to go. Let's go.

696
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
He get at you, too?

697
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,000
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

698
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,200
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

699
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Keep him awake.

700
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,320
Yeah, I've been trying.

701
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,480
You piles of shit!

702
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
You're the Doochamps!

703
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
Hey, that's... that's not ours.

704
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,160
We found it.

705
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,680
"It's not ours."

706
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,320
I'm a park ranger.

707
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,720
I'm not dumb.

708
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,480
- I know.
- They say

709
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,840
I can't keep my park safe,
that I'm unfit for the big leagues.

710
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,520
I'd have been at Yellowstone by now
if it weren't for you shits!

711
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,920
- Buds.
- Huh?

712
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,200
There's someone outside.

713
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,000
It's him. Get to the door...

714
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Yeah.

715
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,560
Now, open it
when I... I count to three.

716
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Wait...
But you're gonna shoot him?

717
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,240
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!
He took a bite out of my ass!

718
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,800
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

719
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,560
Now, open it when I say so.

720
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Now.

721
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,200
That's a fucking bear.

722
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,760
What the fuck?

723
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,880
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

724
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,320
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

725
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,120
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

726
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,040
- Where's the bear?
- I don't know!

727
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Close the door!

728
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,600
Close the motherfucking door.

729
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,360
Jesus Christ.

730
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,560
Close the door.

731
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,640
Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.

732
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

733
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,560
He's up there.

734
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,680
He's up there.

735
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,280
I got it.

736
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
I got it.

737
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
Maybe the kid can help you.

738
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,400
Look, I'm done playing this game.

739
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,520
- What game?
- 20 questions.

740
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,840
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

741
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
What did he ask so far?

742
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
He just keeps guessing.

743
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,480
Like, "Is it a spider?
Is it an arrow?"

744
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,200
What are you, new?

745
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,480
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

746
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,600
Everybody knows that.

747
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,200
Look, are we close to the gazebo?

748
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,840
Is that one of your questions?

749
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,800
- Oh, is it bigger than a bread box?
- No... Daveed needs to ask.

750
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,400
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

751
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,000
Is it bigger than a bread box?

752
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Yes.

753
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Yeah!

754
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,320
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

755
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,360
What? No.

756
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,520
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

757
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
You have one question left.

758
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,320
Dee Dee!

759
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Dee Dee!

760
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,920
You sure this is the way?

761
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,400
Pretty sure.

762
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,200
Dee Dee! It's okay. It's Mama.

763
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,120
Thank God.

764
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,120
Ew! What the heck?

765
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
It's paint. It's just red paint.

766
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,800
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

767
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,120
I'm a nurse, Henry.

768
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,680
Good point.

769
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Come on.

770
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,520
Oh, smart girl.

771
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,280
Henry, come on. She left us a trail.

772
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,480
Mrs. McKinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

773
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
What?

774
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,360
Why do you ask?

775
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,960
Just wondering
if it has long-term side effects

776
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,040
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

777
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,480
Well, it could create a habit
for the bear.

778
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,800
What if they never want
to do it again?

779
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,680
Oh, then it... it should be fine.

780
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,520
But Mama Bear and Papa Bear
would be very angry

781
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,720
because drugs, especially cocaine,
are very, very bad.

782
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,400
What if they would never find out?

783
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Oh, Henry.

784
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,560
We always find out.

785
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Dee Dee!

786
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,880
Medic!

787
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,080
- Just open it.
- Yeah, open it. You think?

788
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,480
Can you just push? Harder.

789
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,056
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

790
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,336
- All right. You go...
- Let me do it.

791
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,880
Yeah. Please, show me how it's done.

792
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,440
Go ahead, Beth. You're strong, right?

793
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,400
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

794
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,400
What is that?

795
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,600
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

796
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,720
- Can you help...?
- Yeah.

797
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,496
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

798
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,160
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait...

799
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,200
Oh, fuck.

800
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
- Come on.
- God, I'm trying.

801
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,800
Come on, push.

802
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm trying.

803
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,800
You said they called in a concussion.

804
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
They did.

805
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,160
Jesus.

806
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,720
- This guy's been shot.
- Yeah.

807
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,000
Obviously.

808
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,000
Holy shit. It's the ranger.

809
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,080
Tom.

810
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,800
Come here. She's got a gun.

811
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,400
Tom! Hello?

812
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,200
No... Put that down...

813
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
It's okay.

814
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,040
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

815
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,560
B...

816
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
- B...
- "Buh"?

817
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,880
B... B...

818
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Beth?

819
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,760
It's okay... Calm.

820
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,480
Beth, we should go.

821
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,440
It's okay...

822
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Bear.

823
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
Bear.

824
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Let's go.

825
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,000
Tom, get up!

826
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,400
Don't look back...

827
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,080
Hang on. Push.

828
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,040
Oh, shit.

829
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,720
Sorry...

830
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Come on...

831
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,216
<i>Anybody else surprised by that rain
this morning? I know I was.</i>

832
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
Leave him!

833
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,880
<i>Our next story, the weather</i>

834
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,176

00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,520
Tom, get in!

837
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Wait...!

838
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,160
- Wait!
- Oh, God.

839
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
Oh, shit!

840
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,480
Jesus, Beth, I wasn't even on yet!

841
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,200
What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?

842
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,840
What the hell have you got a gun for?

843
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
Hey, move! Move!

844
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Put that away!

845
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,000
Jesus Christ! Shoot it...!

846
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,520
- Oh, shit!
- Kill it!

847
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,560
Not the tree! The big fucking bear!

848
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,440
- Shut up!
- Why is it chasing us?

849
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,960
Tom, try to shut the fucking door!

850
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,200
Close the fucking door, you dumbass!

851
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,760
Guys, you got to stop yelling at me!

852
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Oh, shit.

853
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,120
Beth, speed up!

854
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh, shit.

855
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,280
I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

856
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,000
Like, what... what do you say
to a kid who just lost his mommy?

857
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,160
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

858
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,720
And what a man you are.

859
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,480
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

860
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Can you not?

861
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,920
I'm sorry. Just continue.

862
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,920
Well, when my daddy died,
my mama bought me this pet lizard.

863
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,760
It was the coolest little thing.

864
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,880
It had all these green scales on it.

865
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,560
She used to call it a tiny dinosaur.

866
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,120
I thought that was so awesome.

867
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,560
I was real bad
at connecting with people

868
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,040
but I practiced conversation starters
on that lizard every day.

869
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,920
And then that's how
I met Rocky and Joe.

870
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,680
That's my team, man.

871
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,920
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

872
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,760
Those are my buds, man.

873
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,240
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

874
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,320
Well, you know what?

875
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,200
Lizards are good listeners, bud...

876
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,800
but people...

877
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,400
people are good at hearing.

878
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,400
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

879
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,160
- Can we...
- It's okay.

880
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,240
Y'all are hugging.

881
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,600
It's okay.

882
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,800
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

883
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,280
Can I say something
without you getting angry with me?

884
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,680
I'm already angry with you.

885
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
It's gone.

886
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,280
What the actual...

887
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,680
- Daveed, stop.
- No! Please!

888
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
- No...
- Please!

889
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,296
- The kid's messing with us, Eddie.
- No...! I'm not...!

890
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,000
I promise. I don't know
where it went. It's just gone.

891
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,320
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

892
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,480
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was

893
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,600
I'm-a give you one more chance.

894
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,000
Where's the ba...

895
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,560
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

896
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,040
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

897
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,400
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

898
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,680
I ain't fucking around!

899
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Just do it.

900
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
Fuck.

901
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,680
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

902
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,200
I'm coming down there.

903
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,120
I'm just trying to find
a safe spot to hop down.

904
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,480
How did you get up there?

905
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,680
Well, I jumped from
that tree over there, but...

906
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,600
I hurt my hip a little.

907
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,480
I can try to catch you if you want.

908
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
No...! You stay right where you are!

909
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,360
Let's see...

910
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Get it.

911
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Fuck!

912
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,280
Fuck!

913
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,240
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

914
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,800
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

915
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,480
I told you not to move!

916
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,160
How'd he take those two fingers off?

917
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,200
They're not even next to each other.

918
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,080
Fuck you!

919
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Come out of there!

920
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,800
Shit! Come on out!

921
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,000
No fucking way!

922
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,840
God! Goddamn it!

923
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,040
You two, on your bellies.

924
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,240
Now! And no more moving.

925
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,400
Eddie...!

926
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,280
Can you grab them for me?

927
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,520
Can I grab his fingers?

928
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,040
Okay. Get 'em...

929
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,000
Slow...

930
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Easy.

931
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,200
God.

932
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,160
- All right.
- Now, you get back on your belly.

933
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,920
I'll hold on to these.

934
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,360
Now, where you at?

935
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Shit.

936
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,960
What?

937
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,320
Oh, no. The river.

938
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,640
Henry, look.

939
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,000
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

940
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,120
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

941
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,640
We're on the right track.

942
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
I can feel it.

943
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Mama?

944
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,200
Fuck.

945
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,520
Fuck, man.

946
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,080
My fucking jersey, man.

947
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,240
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

948
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,720
Until that guy in the gazebo
throws his weapon into the woods.

949
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,360
Well, then we'll be here forever.

950
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,800
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

951
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,240
We don't need to die because of this.

952
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
Eddie

953
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,880
- I got this.
- Do you?

954
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,240
I have your fingers in my pocket.

955
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,120
You're all gonna get arrested.

956
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,400
Drug sentences since Nixon are fucked

957
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,160
so get ready for ten to 15 years
of shitting in front of your cellmate

958
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,800
and supervised shower time.

959
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,400
Detective, Your Honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

960
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,680
I've never even done coke.

961
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,520
I mean, maybe once.

962
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,560
Once at a party once.
I can't go to jail.

963
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,256
- Just saying, I can't shit
- You're not going to jail.

964
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,080
In front of people. I've never
been able to shit in front of people.

965
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,680
I like to shit in peace.

966
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,200
Nobody move.

967
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,240
It's a bear.

968
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,640
Yeah.

969
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,000
No...

970
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,560
I'm not falling for none of your...

971
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,240
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey, y'all just stay still.

972
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
Don't move.

973
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Just play dead.

974
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,680
Oh, fuck.

975
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,400
Oh, man. You fucked.

976
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,760
Eddie, can you breathe?

977
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,600
What the fuck?

978
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,160
I think that's a yes.

979
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,600
Can someone do something?

980
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,080
Maybe your boy can do something.

981
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,560
Can you just, like... move it?

982
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,880
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

983
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,360
Dee Dee!

984
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,520
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

985
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,240
Oh, God.

986
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
Look.

987
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,440
Hello.

988
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,680
Is he okay?

989
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,120
Help me, please.

990
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,560
Does he have food?

991
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,120
Her name was Elsa

992
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,120
and she was so beautiful.

993
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,360
Are... are you... are you hurt?

994
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,520
Were you attacked?

995
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,600
Devil bear.

996
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,816
My... I'm looking for my daughter.

997
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,000
She was attacked by the devil bear.
Have you seen her?

998
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,120
You have? Was she alive?

999
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,240
Yes.

1000
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,416
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1001
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,721
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her. I haven't...

1002
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,120
Henry!

1003
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,560
I'll show you... Come.

1004
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,760
It's not moving.

1005
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,240
I think it died.

1006
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,240
It died on top of me?

1007
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,440
Check its pulse.

1008
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,520
Can you, like, feel it breathing?

1009
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,200
I'm not sure.

1010
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
Hey, guy?

1011
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,080
Detective.

1012
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,040
Can we call a truce
so I can see if the bear is dead?

1013
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
Yeah.

1014
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,680
Fuck.

1015
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,440
You okay?

1016
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,120
What do you think?

1017
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,240
St... Still breathing.

1018
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,920
We should go.

1019
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,800
He'll probably be all right.

1020
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,120
What the hell, man?

1021
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,400
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1022
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,160
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1023
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
"She."

1024
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,520
What?

1025
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,320
The bear is a girl.

1026
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,160
Oh, yeah.
How... How do you know that?

1027
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,880
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1028
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,080
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1029
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,400
She's awake.

1030
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,400
Oh, shit. Well, stay back...

1031
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Okay.

1032
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,560
Chill out. Just chill out!

1033
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,520
Homes, hey...

1034
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,640
Stay back.

1035
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,560
What the hell?

1036
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,040
Okay...

1037
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,520
No... Don't eat that.
Don't eat that.

1038
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,840
I will be goddamned.

1039
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,720
- Should we shoot her?
- No.

1040
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Let's see what kind of effect
that has on it.

1041
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,240
What the fuck?

1042
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,680
No...!

1043
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,760
- Eddie!
- Daveed, help.

1044
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
What is this?

1045
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,320
- No... What is it doing?
- Okay, I have...

1046
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,760
I... I don't like this.

1047
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Please stop.

1048
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,600
Just go limp! Slide down!

1049
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,680
I'm limp already.

1050
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,360
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
- Don't shoot!

1051
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,320
No... Don't shoot...

1052
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,536
Eddie, you got to fight back,
alright? It's playing with you.

1053
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,880
I'd stay still if I were you.

1054
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,080
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1055
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,096
Eddie, please don't die like this.
Eddie, please.

1056
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,160
Daveed!

1057
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,480
All we've been through! Come on!
Come on, help him!

1058
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,480
Get lower. You're not listening!

1059
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Eddie.

1060
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,520
Oh, my God. He's gonna die.

1061
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
No!

1062
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,760
Hey, girl.

1063
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,480
There you go, girl.

1064
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,920
There you go.

1065
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,800
There you go.

1066
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,040
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1067
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,560
Go!

1068
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,480
Don't have to tell me twice.

1069
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,920
Come on! Daveed!

1070
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,720
That bag's worth 14 million.

1071
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,600
We had a truce,
and a truce is on God where I'm from.

1072
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,880
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1073
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,680
I need that bag.

1074
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,560
Leave it, man. Let's just go home.

1075
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,920
We're taking that bag to Syd, Eddie.

1076
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,960
Shot...

1077
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,120
No. I didn't.

1078
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,960
Run! Go...!

1079
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,640
Oh, shit.

1080
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,000
Holy shit.

1081
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
- Dad.
- Oh, shit.

1082
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,280
What are you doing here?

1083
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,336
Where's Gabe?
You didn't bring him here, did you?

1084
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,400
Calm down.

1085
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,560
He's safe at home watching TV.

1086
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,600
What? How long has he been alone?

1087
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,480
You left him with me!

1088
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,920
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1089
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
Huh?

1090
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,720
The fuck happened to you?

1091
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
A lot.

1092
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,240
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1093
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,360
The bear ate most of it.

1094
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,480
- What?
- The bear.

1095
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,760
It fucking did cocaine.

1096
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,040
A fucking...

1097
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,480
A bear did cocaine, Dad!

1098
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,280
Fuck this! Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1099
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,200
Eddie... just calm down.

1100
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,680
Look at me...

1101
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,880
I'm on the hook here.

1102
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,480
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1103
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,280
And the people that I deal with

1104
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,040
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1105
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,280
And look at me.

1106
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,960
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1107
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,680
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1108
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,000
You hear what I'm saying?

1109
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,000
It's you and Gabe.

1110
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,400
You understand?

1111
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,320
We don't have a choice.

1112
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,640
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1113
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,480
over at the pavilion structure.

1114
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
Come on.

1115
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,800
Come on, son. Come on.

1116
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,480
Who's there?

1117
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,400
- Easy.
- Stay away.

1118
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,760
Where's the duffel?

1119
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,520
I gave it to the bear.

1120
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,360
You gave it to the bear?

1121
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,200
Yeah. The bear.

1122
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,880
It loves coke.

1123
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,560
Which way did it go?

1124
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,720
I'm not fucking around here.

1125
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,200
Syd White.

1126
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,720
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1127
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,120
They all have.

1128
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,720
Reba.

1129
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,480
Oh, I always knew you were my girl.

1130
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,040
I got you now.

1131
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,480
Be careful when you cuff these guys.
They're kind of shifty.

1132
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,080
What...

1133
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,560
What are you doing?

1134
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,760
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1135
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,560
You shot him?

1136
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,240
I told you not to hurt him.

1137
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,720
I don't work for you.

1138
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,560
The department trusted you.

1139
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,560
The state of Tennessee trusted you.

1140
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,920
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1141
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,520
- I know.
- I trusted you with Rosette.

1142
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,600
I know.

1143
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Who's Rosette?

1144
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,560
The dog in my car.

1145
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,720
You left a dog in the car?

1146
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,600
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1147
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,120
How is she?

1148
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,040
She being a good girl?

1149
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,400
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1150
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,840
En... Enough.

1151
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,680
Tell me which way the bear went

1152
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,360
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1153
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,880
Oh, no... please,
don't... don't do that.

1154
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,200
I'd vote for not killing the dog
today, but that's just me.

1155
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,000
Well, what do you guys say?

1156
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,720
What's so funny?

1157
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,560
Apex predator

1158
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,880
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1159
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,200
Dead north, man.

1160
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,080
Yes, we will.

1161
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,000
Dead... dead north.

1162
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Let's go!

1163
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,840
The devil bear is in there.

1164
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,200
You can't go in there.

1165
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,360
Do you have kids?

1166
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,160
We would have.

1167
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,920
I have to go find mine.

1168
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,920
And his name would be Texas.

1169
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,560
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1170
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,880
Here.

1171
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,000
Thank you.

1172
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,720
Bye, lady and little man.

1173
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,880
Bye both.

1174
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,080
Okay.

1175
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,680
Wait. What about me?

1176
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,600
Watch where you step.

1177
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,880
I got you. Stay close.

1178
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
What's that?

1179
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Don't move.

1180
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,080
Stay still, Henry.

1181
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,880
They look like polar bears.

1182
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Henry?

1183
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,520
- Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1184
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,856
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1185
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,040
No... Them, they're...

1186
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,440
- they're harmless.
- Dee Dee!

1187
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,640
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1188
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,400
- Dee Dee, you're okay.
- Are you hurt?

1189
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,120
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1190
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,280
That looks really deep.

1191
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,400
- Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow...! Henry!

1192
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,560
Let's keep you warm.

1193
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,600
Oh, my gosh. You found my sweater.

1194
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,040
You smart girl. You left us clues.

1195
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,720
- Yeah.
- We found you.

1196
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
Put that on.

1197
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,120
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1198
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Oh, my God.

1199
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,760
- Mom, I'm so sorry...
- It's okay.

1200
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,360
- I just...
- Henry told me everything.

1201
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,040
- Everything?
- You mean that you guys did drugs?

1202
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,560
- You told her?
- No.

1203
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,400
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1204
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,720
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1205
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,000
What was that?

1206
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,120
Cocaine bear's back.

1207
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,040
Can you walk?

1208
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,080
- A little.
- Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1209
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,200
Go that way. Go ahead.

1210
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,560
It's okay. Come on.

1211
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,880
Look. It's a way out.

1212
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,480
It's the falls.

1213
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,880
Oh, wow.

1214
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,000
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1215
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,760
Oh, God.

1216
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,480
This is it.

1217
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,360
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1218
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,320
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1219
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,680
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1220
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,040
What is that?

1221
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,680
- Oh, fuck!
- No!

1222
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,360
- What the fuck? What the fuck?
- No!

1223
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Come on.

1224
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,960
Eddie.

1225
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,120
Take this.

1226
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,680
Fuck.

1227
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,200
Thank you.

1228
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,280
Goddamn bear.

1229
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,680
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1230
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,480
You got what you wanted?

1231
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,760
Let's go.

1232
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,720
There's... there's a lot more
out there.

1233
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,400
We got to keep looking, understand?

1234
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,600
We're not whole yet.

1235
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,360
I'm leaving, Syd.

1236
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,040
Go.

1237
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,640
Give me the bag.

1238
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,000
When did you all get so soft?

1239
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,880
All got sand in your pussies.

1240
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,320
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1241
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,320
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1242
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,800
Stay away from the bears!

1243
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,000
This way.

1244
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,440
Come on. There's an opening.

1245
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,120
Henry, come here.

1246
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,400
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1247
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,920
He has a gun.

1248
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,120
No!

1249
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,640
Come on!

1250
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,560
The hell is this?

1251
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,000
Whoa. Take it easy...

1252
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,680
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1253
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,480
I'm a mom.

1254
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,240
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1255
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,480
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1256
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,600
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1257
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,960
You understand?

1258
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,440
- Go.
- Come on. Help him out!

1259
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,520
Yeah...

1260
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,720
Come on.

1261
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,520
It's stuck.

1262
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,280
Fuck!

1263
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,200
Who are these guys?

1264
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,520
We're going home.

1265
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,736
We... We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1266
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,160
Nobody's going anywhere!

1267
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,880
Dad.

1268
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,280
- Shut up, Eddie.
- Dad!

1269
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,360
Shut...

1270
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,920
Get away. Back off...

1271
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,480
Get out of here, you little fuckers!

1272
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Fuck.

1273
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,720
Get back! Get... Fuckers!

1274
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,400
Stay away.

1275
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,880
- Stay away.
- He hit the bear.

1276
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,000
Just give 'em the bag.

1277
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,960
Shoot the fucking bears!

1278
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,720
- Get over here.
- Hey, can't get a shot.

1279
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,800
They're too close to me!

1280
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,800
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1281
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,360
The fuck's the matter with you?

1282
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,680
Shoot the little fucking cubs, Eddie!

1283
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,600
- Get 'em off me!
- Fuck him.

1284
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,200
Help me out! Ow. Eddie! Ow!

1285
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,680
No.

1286
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,320
Coward. Daveed!

1287
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Here, catch.

1288
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,320
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1289
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,480
Mama!

1290
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,800
Hell yeah, Mrs. McKinndry.

1291
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,640
Look around, Dad.

1292
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,800
Kids have been dragged into this.

1293
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,360
Get... get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1294
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
People are dead.

1295
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,560
You are no son of mine.

1296
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
Hey, you!

1297
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,720
You did this. You're the reason
this is all happening.

1298
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,880
And it's a good thing
he's not like you

1299
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,880
because you're a piece of crap person
and a bad dad!

1300
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Who the fuck are you?

1301
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,040
I'm Henry

1302
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,000
and I am so fucking tired!

1303
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,160
Yeah, me, too.

1304
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,800
She's protecting the cubs.

1305
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,600
- Oh, shit!
- We need to jump.

1306
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,640
- Wait, what?
- What?

1307
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,856
- I'll be fine!
- It's gonna be okay.

1308
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,880
We're gonna be okay.

1309
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,520
Here...
Have some coke, you little shits.

1310
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,736
- It's not that far, you guys.
- Get out of here!

1311
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,880
We're gonna be all right.

1312
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,040
Ready?

1313
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,960
Three, two, one. Jump!

1314
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,560
Oh, shit.

1315
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,480
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1316
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,760
Let's go!

1317
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,520
Come on. It's okay.

1318
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,400
- Eddie, help...
- We made it.

1319
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,200
Get the shit out of here, you fuck!

1320
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,360
Oh, shit. He shot you.

1321
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Help!

1322
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,840
Help!

1323
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,680
Si... Six more days of John.

1324
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,200
Six more days...

1325
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,280
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1326
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,056
You're more than
a drug dealer, all right?

1327
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,800
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1328
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,920
All right?

1329
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,400
Hey... I...
I got my last question.

1330
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,520
What?

1331
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,920
It's 20 questions.

1332
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,680
I got my last one.

1333
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,480
What? All right. Sure.

1334
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,160
Is it Joanie?

1335
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,120
It's Joanie, right?

1336
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1337
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,760
How'd you guess?

1338
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,240
You're so fucking obvious.

1339
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,680
I just didn't want to guess it
to have you crying on me all day.

1340
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,640
She's a nurse!

1341
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,000
He... he got grazed by a bullet.

1342
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,400
He's in shock.

1343
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,760
Put pressure on him.

1344
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,560
I've called backup.

1345
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,560
Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1346
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,000
You should get going.

1347
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,200
Take care of yourself.

1348
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,760
Hi...

1349
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,480
Rosette.

1350
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,040
Whose dog is this?

1351
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,400
I think it's mine.

1352
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,200
Mine and Gabe's.

1353
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,400
Is it on cocaine?

1354
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,760
No.

1355
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,240
That's a good dog.

1356
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,880
So we just grab Gabe and go, right?

1357
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah.

1358
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,000
I knew you'd be okay.
You're the toughest person I know.

1359
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,920
I think you get that from your mom.

1360
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,000
I think you're right.

1361
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,720
Thanks for coming to get me.

1362
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,800
I'm your mom. I love you.

1363
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,000
You, too, Henry.

1364
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,240
Hey, I'm sorry
I pushed Ray on you too soon.

1365
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,520
No. You deserve to be happy.

1366
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,680
Henry, let's walk over here.

1367
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,000
Stay away from that. Come on.

1368
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,080
I want to look.

1369
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,640
I also don't want to look.

1370
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,760
Don't look. Let's just cruise on by.

1371
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,360
Oh, here come the po-po.

1372
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,880
Hey, Mom. I want to go
to Nashville with you and Ray.

1373
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,080
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1374
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,480
Rehab?

1375
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,880
We're cokeheads now.

1376
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,456
You know? We got the bite,
and we're about that life

1377
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,600
Mrs. McKinndry.

1378
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,120
Yeah, you're too grounded for rehab.

1379
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,440
- Rodney, are you getting it?
- I swear to God, Carol.

1380
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,880
Well, then zoom in.

1381
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,640
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1382
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,200
Oh, they're so cute.

1383
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,600
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1384
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,320
Wait. Why are they
looking at us like that?

1385
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,400
Oh.

1386
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,160
Oh, shit.

1387
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,240
Hey.

1388
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,000
Oh, hold up... Hey.

1389
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,360
Daddy!

1390
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,360
- Is that for me?
- Hey.

1391
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,560
Yeah, what do you think?

1392
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,200
What's it eating?

1393
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,520
Oh, my God.

1394
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,200
They're weren't gonna
put 'em back on.
