1
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,106
<font color="#ffff54">You lost your adolescent already?</font>

2
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,317
<font color="#ffff54">This will complicate matters...</font>

3
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,779
<font color="#ffff54">A young one is on the way,</font>

4
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:38,534
<font color="#ffff54">but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.</font>

5
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,329
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

6
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,399
<i>Beth.</i>

7
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,236
Keenish.

8
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,036
<font color="#ffff54">Mr. König.</font>

9
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,772
Herr... Konish?

10
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,808
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

11
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,676
<i>'Ö.' "Herr König."</i>

12
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,912
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

13
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,349
<i>Gretchen and the movers</i>
<i>are right behind us.</i>

14
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:37,086
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

15
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,724
No, she's Beth.

16
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,629
Ah, okay.

17
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,565
And what is going on
with your sister?

18
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,967
She deaf or something?

19
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,003
<i>-No.</i>

20
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,806
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

21
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,160
You okay, honey?

22
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:22,131
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

23
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,134
Oh!

24
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,483
<font color="#ffff54">Good afternoon.</font>

25
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,071
<font color="#ffff54">Good afternoon, Mr. König.</font>

26
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,650
Ah, very good, Luis!

27
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,486
You've been practicing, huh?

28
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,688
How was your journey?

29
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,356
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

30
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,592
<i>We almost forgot</i>
<i>how beautiful it is here.</i>

31
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:52,228
<i>Ah,</i>
<i>we almost forgot</i>
<i>how beautiful you are, Beth.</i>

32
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:53,629
<i>-Oh, stop!</i>

33
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,331
Keep going!

34
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,200
Gretchen, come say hi.

35
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,471
Gretchen.

36
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,174
-What's up?
-Oh, Jesus.

37
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,443
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>Willkommen.</i>

38
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:08,477
Thank you.

39
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:09,811
No, thank you, Beth.

40
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,181
We are so glad to have you back.

41
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:15,817
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

42
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,086
I completely understand.

43
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,222
<i>We have something</i>
<i>for you.</i>

44
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,222
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry.</font>

45
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,757
It's...

46
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,628
The original sketch.

47
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,796
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

48
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,599
the land you acquired.

49
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,668
Beth, that is...

50
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:37,673
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

51
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,509
- Oh!
<i>- You know, you two lovebirds</i>

52
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:45,447
stumbled into my nest
almost eight years ago
to the day.

53
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:47,249
<i>And I believe there were more</i>

54
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,019
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

55
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,254
<i>Hello, Alma.</i>

56
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,482
<font color="#ffff54">Hello. It's nice to meet you.</font>

57
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,692
<font color="#ffff54">The pleasure is all mine.</font>

58
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,163
Your German
is already better
than your father's, huh?

59
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,031
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.
- "Yes", she says!</font>

60
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,435
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

61
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,475
<i>Hey, Gretchen.</i>
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

62
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,779
<i>I wish we could have spent</i>
<i>a little more time together</i>
<i>after the funeral,</i>

63
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,414
<i>but I get it.</i>

64
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:21,883
<i>You're all over Europe</i>
<i>with your dad's family, huh?</i>

65
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,054
<i>Don't forget you have a band</i>
<i>that needs your voice.</i>

66
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:27,056
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you</i>
<i>the new mix.</i>

67
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:29,191
<i>I knew your mom</i>
<i>would have loved it.</i>

68
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,605
Beth? It's occupied.

69
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,737
Gretchen, let's go!

70
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:51,006
<i>Herr König is taking us</i>
<i>to the new house.</i>

71
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,975
<i>Can you sit with Alma</i>
<i>this time?</i>

72
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:59,274
Car? What?
Car what?

73
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,976
What?

74
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:43,485
<i>Hello there!</i>

75
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:56,031
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

76
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:58,567
I have my hands full.

77
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,269
Oh, me too.

78
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,039
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

79
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:05,841
No, I'm a daughter.

80
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,476
Oh, really?

81
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:09,211
Haven't heard about you.

82
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,647
Are you from England as well?

83
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,948
No, I'm not.

84
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,217
Why would you have heard
about me?

85
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,852
I told...

86
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,220
Jesus.

87
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,788
Forgive me, my dear.

88
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:23,292
Didn't mean to startle you.

89
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,827
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

90
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:29,331
Dr. Bonomo is the medical
superintendent
of the local hospital

91
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:33,235
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

92
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,470
which I am also funding.

93
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,340
<i>This is Gretchen.</i>

94
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:39,675
Gretchen.

95
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,011
Yeah.

96
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:45,547
Gretchen is from
the United States.

97
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:49,651
It has been decided
that she is moving in
with her father.

98
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,856
What a pleasant surprise.

99
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

100
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,402
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

101
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,905
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

102
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:12,341
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

103
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,245
Hi, mom.

104
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,319
I know this is weird, um...

105
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,156
But it's good to hear
your voice.

106
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,297
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

107
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:39,868
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

108
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,116
<i>I know it's been tough.</i>

109
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,484
<i>But we are very happy</i>
<i>you're here.</i>

110
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,854
Excuse me.

111
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,790
Gretchen, my dear.

112
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,093
I, uh...

113
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:08,664
<i>I've been thinking,</i>
<i>for a young woman like you</i>

114
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:13,735
there's... not so many things
to do here during the summer,
and so...

115
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:17,205
I have a little idea.

116
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:22,277
<i>A proposal. How would you like</i>
<i>to come work for me</i>
<i>at the resort?</i>

117
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,980
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

118
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:25,547
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's an easy job,</i>

119
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,449
<i>and it will give you</i>
<i>something to do</i>

120
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,384
<i>while your parents build</i>
<i>the new resort for me.</i>

121
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,254
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

122
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:34,189
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

123
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,159
I would pay you
an appropriate salary,
of course.

124
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>I don't...</i>
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

125
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,201
Oh.

126
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:47,703
Schön.

127
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:49,337
<i>Wonderful.</i>

128
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:52,307
<i>Come by the reception tomorrow.</i>

129
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,411
<i>Here's your ID badge,</i>
<i>sir.</i>

130
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:59,281
<i>Would you like to pay</i>
<i>with cash or credit card?</i>

131
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:04,486
Cash, or credit?

132
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:07,489
Cash.

133
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,859
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

134
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,896
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

135
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,036
Oh, and this is Beatrice

136
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:22,437
and I am Gretchen.

137
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,553
<font color="#ffff54">Can I go now?</font>

138
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,554
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

139
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,142
<font color="#ffff54">You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.</font>

140
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:34,750
<i>You have to be polite</i>
<i>and friendly,</i>
<i>even if the guest is rude.</i>

141
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:37,753
<i>And remember to put up the sign</i>
<i>if you go to the bathroom.</i>

142
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,323
But if you have
any real trouble,
just call the boss.

143
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,860
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

144
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:48,563
He lives in a vacation
bungalow?

145
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:52,001
No, he has a villa way up there.

146
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,536
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

147
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,405
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

148
00:13:58,273 --> 00:13:59,908
Weird, right?

149
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,110
Super.

150
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,016
<font color="#ffff54">I'm so sorry.</font>

151
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,851
<font color="#ffff54">No problem.</font>

152
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,556
This happens
sometimes.

153
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,328
How's your first day, my dear?

154
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,400
Can't complain.

155
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:28,037
And how is your German
coming along?

156
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:30,772
Not good.

157
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,176
This is okay.

158
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,078
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

159
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,281
over the border, in Italy.

160
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:47,622
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

161
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh, I have my bike.

162
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,861
Oh?

163
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:54,629
No.

164
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,398
No, no, no.

165
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,836
<i>No, it will be too dark</i>
<i>on the country roads by then.</i>

166
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,405
<i>This is why you</i>
<i>will not work late.</i>

167
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,842
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

168
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,376
What?

169
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,346
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

170
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:14,317
<i>-You have a car.</i>

171
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,952
<i>-I have a life, too.</i>

172
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,189
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

173
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,690
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

174
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,359
<i>-No. Every time I raise</i>
<i>an issue with you,</i>

175
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,295
<i>there is something</i>
<i>you have to say about it.</i>

176
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,463
<i>-I do everything you ask!</i>
<i>-No.</i>

177
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,066
<i>-What? I work every day</i>
<i>late shifts!</i>

178
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,867
<i>-You're blasting your</i>
<i>Scheisse music on the car radio</i>

179
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,135
<i>on your way to work.</i>

180
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,171
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

181
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,738
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

182
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,207
<i>and you are disturbing</i>
<i>the wildlife</i>

183
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,941
<i>with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

184
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,174
They can dance on the carpet...

185
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:17,472
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

186
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,532
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

187
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,960
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

188
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:12,560
Alma?

189
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:16,232
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

190
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:24,373
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to your face?</i>

191
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:29,145
My father's daughter
scratched me.

192
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,546
Your sister?

193
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,016
-She's not my sister.
<i>-Oh.</i>

194
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,351
Come on now.

195
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:38,653
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

196
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:46,761
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

197
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,868
<i>It's called vanishing twin</i>
<i>syndrome.</i>

198
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,606
It's when one fetus dies
in the early stages
of the pregnancy

199
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,045
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

200
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,814
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>it was kind of badass.</i>

201
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,218
But yeah, she's a bitch.

202
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:12,754
Okay.

203
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:18,060
Another reason to not have kids.

204
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,795
<i>Thanks for finishing my shift.</i>

205
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,832
<i>Erik and I haven't been</i>
<i>on a date in ages.</i>

206
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,633
Here's my master key.

207
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:28,137
There's only one. Don't lose it.

208
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:32,341
And at 10 p.m. sharp
you lock everything up
like I showed you.

209
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:34,676
And boss doesn't
need to know.

210
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:36,312
It's fine.

211
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:37,246
Okay.

212
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,682
<font color="#ffff54">Good luck tonight!</font>

213
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:45,887
Uh-huh.

214
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,889
Can I get a room?

215
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:25,327
May I see your ID or passport?

216
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,096
You can't just ask for my name?

217
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,703
Uhm...

218
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,606
Is it just you...

219
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:40,842
or are you here with a partner?

220
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,878
We have special rates
and amenities

221
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:47,116
for couples and newlyweds.

222
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:52,154
For now, just me.

223
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:54,256
Okay.

224
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,062
I'm Ed.

225
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:04,366
<i>What's your name?</i>

226
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,303
I'm Gretchen.

227
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:12,141
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

228
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:17,112
I won't be here
for long anyways.

229
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,819
<i>-You like music?</i>

230
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:29,959
Sure.

231
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:36,398
Then you should come to Paris.

232
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:43,905
Okay.

233
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:05,327
Hey!

234
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:11,066
Is this normal?

235
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,403
It's only my second day.

236
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,071
<i>-Better go check on her.</i>

237
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,274
Uh-huh.

238
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:29,851
Resort Alpschatten...

239
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,394
<font color="#ffff54">Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?
I can see the light from...</font>

240
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,291
<i>Gretchen?</i>

241
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:37,526
-Yes.
<i>-Where's Beatrix?</i>

242
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,795
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

243
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,532
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

244
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:44,932
<i>Gretchen.</i>

245
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,002
<i>I want you to lock the doors</i>
<i>and wait for me,</i>

246
00:22:47,102 --> 00:22:49,138
<i>I will come pick you up</i>
<i>right now.</i>

247
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,105
Uh...

248
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:54,009
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

249
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:57,446
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

250
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:00,749
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

251
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,117
<i>Gretchen, listen to me</i>
<i>carefully.</i>

252
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,818
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

253
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:10,953
<i>Fuck no.</i>

254
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,661
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, okay. Call me back.</font>

255
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,209
<font color="#ffff54">Damn it.</font>

256
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,755
<font color="#ffff54">Shit.</font>

257
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:08,610
<i>Gretchen?</i>

258
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,844
<font color="#ffff54">Where are you?</font>

259
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,682
<font color="#ffff54">Where are you? Come here.</font>

260
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,225
Hello!

261
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,295
Please let me in!

262
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,128
<font color="#ffff54">Yes?</font>

263
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,166
Please let me in right now!
Please!

264
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,132
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, yes, I'm coming.</font>

265
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,442
<font color="#ffff54">I told you I'm coming!</font>

266
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:01,216
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

267
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,554
<i>The woman stood there</i>
<i>until the police arrived.</i>

268
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:07,991
-I was chased.

269
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,691
Fuck!

270
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:14,930
It's really important
that your statement
is as accurate as possible.

271
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:20,435
The receptionist, she stated
that she did not see any woman
in the parking lot.

272
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,939
May I suggest...

273
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:27,576
we change the last part into...

274
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:33,215
"The woman stood there
until Mrs. So-and-so
entered the room...

275
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,917
"Then the police arrived."

276
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:41,390
That is so much better.

277
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,859
I think...

278
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:47,130
you are the victim of a prank.

279
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,166
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>is very nice here, honey.</i>

280
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,168
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

281
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,437
<i>but this is actually</i>
<i>very common.</i>

282
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,941
-Dad.
-Gretchen?

283
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:01,543
What happened?

284
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:02,611
Did you fall?

285
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,546
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

286
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,815
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

287
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,316
<i>We need to get her checked out.</i>

288
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,252
Dad, I was attacked.

289
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:14,023
-By who?
-I don't know, the cops think
it was a prank...

290
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,958
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

291
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,460
No, I fell, but...
<i>- Gretchen?</i>

292
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,500
She fell, it's okay.

293
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:30,238
<i>We are going</i>
<i>to do an MRI...</i>

294
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:47,923
It might be childhood epilepsy.

295
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,726
Epilepsy?

296
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:51,793
<i>It might be?</i>

297
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,096
It means it might be genetic

298
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:54,730
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

299
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,533
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

300
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,170
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah.

301
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:04,773
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

302
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:07,743
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

303
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,447
What's causing the seizures?

304
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:15,985
<i>-There are many</i>
<i>possible triggers</i>
<i>for a seizure in a child.</i>

305
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,719
<i>Fever. Certain lights.</i>

306
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,090
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

307
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:23,192
But Alma is too young for that.

308
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,393
<i>Has there been</i>
<i>a stressful event</i>

309
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:27,796
<i>or disruption</i>
<i>in your family lately?</i>

310
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,576
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

311
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:43,945
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

312
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:46,515
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

313
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:49,284
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

314
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,988
<i>Mom, this place</i>
<i>is completely fucked.</i>

315
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:56,324
<i>Alma keeps freaking out,</i>
<i>and they say she has epilepsy</i>
<i>or something.</i>

316
00:30:58,027 --> 00:31:00,062
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

317
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,532
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

318
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
<i>I got the money.</i>

319
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:14,476
- <i>What happened to you?</i>
- Jesus.

320
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,481
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

321
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:29,524
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

322
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:33,428
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

323
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,598
incident last night.

324
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:46,808
Which one?

325
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:49,878
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

326
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,185
I don't wanna talk to you.

327
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,719
Excuse me?

328
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,488
Um... excuse me.

329
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,059
There's another guest waiting.

330
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,568
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

331
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:17,405
Could you come see me
when you're done?

332
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:19,941
Fine.

333
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,589
I'm checking out.

334
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:37,093
Oh.

335
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,128
Okay.

336
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:51,806
You didn't charge me.

337
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,442
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

338
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,612
Um...

339
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,415
No, you don't.

340
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:09,925
Do you smoke?

341
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:26,875
You coming?

342
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:31,613
Yeah, just give me a minute.

343
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:13,822
<i>I have a house</i>
<i>back in the States.</i>

344
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:15,857
<i>I just need to get</i>
<i>to an airport.</i>

345
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,693
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

346
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,165
<i>We have one of these in Paris.</i>

347
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,112
<i>And then the woman went</i>
<i>into that weird pink bungalow.</i>

348
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:38,713
I wasn't going in there.

349
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:44,719
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

350
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:58,000
...and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

351
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,070
<i>I wasn't going in there.</i>

352
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:06,175
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

353
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:19,921
...and then
the woman went into that
weird pink bungalow.

354
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:23,059
I wasn't going in
there.

355
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,633
Watch out!

356
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:24,046
<i>Do you smell this?</i>

357
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:28,117
Yes.

358
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:39,827
Or are those molecules
binding to a receptor
in your nasal cavity?

359
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,833
Got me.

360
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,317
And are you...

361
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:06,088
right now, in this moment...

362
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:14,330
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

363
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,937
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

364
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:24,106
Hm?

365
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:27,509
<i>If I were you...</i>

366
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:32,448
<i>I would stay home</i>
<i>until my body was done</i>

367
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:35,217
<i>growing back those cells.</i>

368
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:40,222
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

369
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:44,026
<i>As if I was stuck in a loop.</i>

370
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,762
<i>Can you... do this?</i>

371
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:53,801
Good.

372
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,177
Apology accepted.

373
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:06,315
Luis.

374
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:21,597
What are you doing?

375
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,265
I'm getting my stuff.

376
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,834
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

377
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,637
I mean, they said we can...

378
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:31,806
-I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

379
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:36,045
<i>Beth has been watching Alma</i>
<i>while I've been here</i>
<i>looking after you.</i>

380
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,580
I have to go home
and give her a break.

381
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,850
-Please don't leave.
-You'll be fine.

382
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:44,286
There are people here
all the time.

383
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:46,622
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

384
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:49,058
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

385
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:53,295
What if she comes back?

386
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:54,763
Gretchen, stop it!

387
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:56,432
But why? I'm not making this up!

388
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:59,468
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

389
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:02,571
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

390
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:11,879
I wasn't high.

391
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,749
Oh, you were!

392
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:15,551
You were tested.

393
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:18,853
You stole money from Herr König

394
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,724
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

395
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,659
I can't force you
to do anything.

396
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:26,061
You are almost eighteen
years old.

397
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,063
But you don't have a job anymore

398
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:31,367
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

399
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:34,269
If you wanna run away,

400
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,339
then take your fucking bicycle.

401
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,153
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

402
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:53,555
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

403
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:56,091
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

404
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:58,994
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

405
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:03,065
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

406
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:05,601
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

407
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:09,338
<i>It's really bad.</i>

408
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:15,277
<i>I just wanna come home.</i>

409
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,483
Where's Gretchen?

410
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,585
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

411
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:25,187
Where's Gretchen?

412
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:28,123
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

413
00:41:42,004 --> 00:41:44,373
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to come see me.</i>

414
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,943
<i>I saved your life.</i>

415
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,514
I saw the woman.

416
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,986
You saw her?

417
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:02,424
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

418
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:05,694
I need you to help me
find that woman.

419
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:09,164
<i>She's wanted for murder.</i>

420
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:12,201
<i>And I expect her</i>
<i>to come for you again.</i>

421
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:16,405
I can protect you.

422
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,908
If we find her...

423
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:25,981
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

424
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:30,686
<i>Does Alma</i>
<i>listen to music often?</i>

425
00:42:30,954 --> 00:42:34,122
<i>She loves music,</i>
<i>especially since Gretchen</i>
<i>moved in with us.</i>

426
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:35,824
<i>Now...</i>

427
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:38,327
<i>And this is extremely</i>
<i>important.</i>

428
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:42,364
<i>Nobody must know</i>
<i>about this investigation.</i>

429
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:45,167
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

430
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:47,336
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

431
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:48,972
in people with Alma's condition.

432
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:53,175
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

433
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:56,512
It's just music.

434
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:58,280
<i>You going out?</i>

435
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,873
<font color="#ffff54">That's very cool.</font>

436
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,087
<font color="#ffff54">No, it's not.</font>

437
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:21,036
<i>A month ago,</i>
<i>a married couple on vacation</i>

438
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:23,138
had rented this cabin.

439
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:25,841
<i>A cabin not far from here.</i>

440
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:29,077
<i>The husband told the police</i>
<i>that in the evening</i>

441
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:31,246
<i>he'd lost consciousness.</i>

442
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:34,850
When he woke up...

443
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:40,088
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

444
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:45,561
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

445
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,732
<i>The blonde woman's voice</i>
<i>had a hypnotic effect</i>
<i>on the man.</i>

446
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:54,971
<i>He chased the woman</i>
<i>into the woods,</i>
<i>but she got away.</i>

447
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,173
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

448
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:02,811
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

449
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:07,849
Jesus.

450
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:17,092
Dude...

451
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:22,031
The other night,
a half-naked woman
came into the reception,

452
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,233
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

453
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:33,675
Where was she staying?

454
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,820
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

455
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,370
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

456
00:45:12,948 --> 00:45:15,851
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>stakeouts were gonna be</i>
<i>so boring.</i>

457
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:20,355
When are we gonna see
some action?

458
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:22,324
<i>Almost 11.</i>

459
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:25,727
<i>Be on the lookout and listen</i>
<i>for anything strange.</i>

460
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,755
<font color="#ffff54">What are you doing here?</font>

461
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,924
<font color="#ffff54">What do you think? You imbecile!</font>

462
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,552
<font color="#ffff54">We can't, not here.
We're leaving. Now!</font>

463
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,722
<font color="#ffff54">Why? I'm cleaning
this fuck-pad all the time!</font>

464
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,565
<font color="#ffff54">I beg you!</font>

465
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,737
<font color="#ffff54">You'll have to make it up to me.</font>

466
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,073
<font color="#ffff54">I promise.</font>

467
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,496
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, fine.</font>

468
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,375
<font color="#ffff54">Let me dry my hair, then we can go.</font>

469
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,432
<font color="#ffff54">I know how you can make it up to me!</font>

470
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:03,047
<font color="#ffff54">Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!</font>

471
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,980
<font color="#ffff54">Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!</font>

472
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,566
<i>She'll choke.</i>

473
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,671
<i>Last time I was too late.</i>

474
00:51:33,029 --> 00:51:34,529
<i>Gretchen?</i>

475
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:38,533
Did we wake you?

476
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:50,012
<i>All the owls</i>
<i>have individual calls</i>

477
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:53,782
<i>so that they can understand</i>
<i>each other over long distances.</i>

478
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,950
<i>And maybe we</i>
<i>can make a secret call</i>

479
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:59,021
so that we
can understand each other.

480
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:02,124
Now, I brought you something.

481
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:04,293
I know that you will like this.

482
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:15,237
Gretchen, come sit with us.

483
00:52:15,337 --> 00:52:16,472
Gretchen?

484
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,807
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

485
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:22,710
No.

486
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,780
Okay, good. Please join us.

487
00:52:27,316 --> 00:52:28,850
I went out last night.

488
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,054
Where did you go?

489
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:33,956
<i>The resort.</i>

490
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,194
What were you doing there?

491
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:40,029
I was with Trixie.

492
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:41,896
<i>-Hm.</i>

493
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:46,068
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

494
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:48,370
<i>-She wasn't.</i>

495
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,440
She was really confused.

496
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,042
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

497
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:55,411
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

498
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,447
Hm. I will look into this.

499
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:01,783
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

500
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:05,521
<i>Seems like a lot of people</i>
<i>need assistance after ten.</i>

501
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,822
It doesn't make sense
economically.

502
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,459
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
<i>- Gretchen!</i>

503
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,693
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

504
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:13,395
It's not so interesting, but...

505
00:53:13,496 --> 00:53:15,064
Maybe another time.

506
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,733
It's quite the place
you got here.

507
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,369
-Gretchen, what's the matter?

508
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:22,104
Why did you bring us here?

509
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,547
Your parents are planning a--

510
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:33,115
A new resort, I know.

511
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,153
Why do we have to live here?

512
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:38,053
<i>Gretchen!</i>

513
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:39,821
Because it's pretty outside?

514
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,158
Calm down, right now.

515
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:03,445
You are here because your family
belongs here.

516
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,052
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

517
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:13,122
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?
<i>-I don't know dad!</i>

518
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:15,790
I'm just reflecting
on this very fucking weird
living situation

519
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,892
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

520
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:18,994
Out!

521
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:20,262
<i>Now!</i>

522
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:23,966
- Great.
<i>- No, no, Luis.</i>

523
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:26,101
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

524
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:27,970
You need some family time,
I understand.

525
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,938
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

526
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,906
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

527
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,310
and I wish you a good evening.
-I'm very sorry.

528
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,711
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

529
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:39,215
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

530
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:43,619
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

531
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,787
don't be afraid to...

532
00:54:46,555 --> 00:54:48,123
talk to me.

533
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:53,162
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

534
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:57,066
Oh... it was a surprise.

535
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,368
I was not supposed
to say anything.

536
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:00,502
I am so sorry.

537
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:02,037
What package?

538
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:06,408
What package?
-It has your family name on it.

539
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:22,191
It was your mother's stuff.

540
00:55:23,726 --> 00:55:25,793
<i>The small stuff, at least.</i>

541
00:55:26,095 --> 00:55:27,929
I received it this morning.

542
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,798
<i>I... your father should perhaps</i>
<i>change the address</i>

543
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,268
<i>on the counter...</i>

544
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:34,370
What is it doing here, dad?

545
00:55:39,774 --> 00:55:41,277
I sold the old house.

546
00:55:46,682 --> 00:55:49,752
It was... still my house.

547
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:52,254
<i>And I put the money</i>
<i>in an account for you.</i>

548
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,627
<i>I... I didn't want you</i>
<i>to get worked up again--</i>

549
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:10,472
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

550
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:13,242
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

551
00:56:13,342 --> 00:56:15,810
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

552
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,013
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

553
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:21,417
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

554
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:24,720
<i>It's really bad.</i>

555
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:30,858
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

556
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,533
<i>What do you think?</i>

557
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,807
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

558
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:47,875
<i>What's your take</i>
<i>on that, mom?</i>

559
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:07,429
<i>Next message.</i>

560
00:57:09,365 --> 00:57:12,934
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,</i>
<i>my name is Alma.</i>

561
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:15,903
<i>I'm calling you</i>
<i>because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

562
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:18,540
<i>Gretchen calls you</i>
<i>when she feels bad,</i>

563
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,442
<i>but you never answer.</i>

564
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:22,444
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

565
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:24,413
<i>I'm worried.</i>

566
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,947
<i>If you get my message,</i>

567
00:57:26,148 --> 00:57:28,550
<i>I want you to call Gretchen</i>
<i>back on the phone.</i>

568
00:57:29,118 --> 00:57:31,353
<i>You can tell her</i>
<i>that you love her.</i>

569
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:33,355
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

570
00:57:34,022 --> 00:57:35,758
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

571
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:38,827
<i>If you'd like to,</i>
<i>you can come visit us.</i>

572
00:57:39,294 --> 00:57:41,296
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

573
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,352
Good, you're packed.

574
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,955
Do you even know how to drive?

575
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:09,924
Where is everybody?

576
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:15,097
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

577
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:18,367
Alma had a very strong seizure.

578
00:58:20,035 --> 00:58:22,504
<i>It's your fault, Gretchen.</i>
<i>You know that.</i>

579
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:24,473
<i>You terrified her.</i>

580
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:30,646
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

581
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:33,882
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

582
00:58:33,982 --> 00:58:35,784
and I'll drive you
to the station.

583
00:58:35,884 --> 00:58:37,952
The last train leaves
in one hour.

584
00:58:54,837 --> 00:58:56,738
Bring your bike.

585
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:28,203
You like it?

586
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:30,472
Sure.

587
00:59:30,772 --> 00:59:33,642
<i>You know it? A common cuckoo.</i>

588
00:59:34,776 --> 00:59:36,645
<i>A magnificent creature.</i>

589
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,214
<i>-Common.</i>

590
00:59:39,915 --> 00:59:44,686
Ah. But its behavior is not.

591
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:47,823
Its nature is quite remarkable.

592
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:53,095
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

593
00:59:53,428 --> 00:59:58,267
<i>Some species need our help</i>
<i>to survive and reproduce.</i>

594
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,804
I'm a preservationist, you know?

595
01:00:23,058 --> 01:00:24,593
<i>Oh, come along now.</i>

596
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:29,364
<i>I want you to understand</i>
<i>who you got involved with.</i>

597
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:33,869
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

598
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,104
<i>with an illegal firearm.</i>

599
01:00:36,204 --> 01:00:37,974
What are you doing?

600
01:00:38,073 --> 01:00:39,374
He's a cop.

601
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:42,844
No, he's not.

602
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:45,014
Not anymore.

603
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:47,449
<i>You see, Erik here...</i>

604
01:00:47,716 --> 01:00:49,618
is actually a policeman.

605
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:53,188
He has access to police files.

606
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:57,092
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

607
01:00:57,192 --> 01:01:00,429
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

608
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:04,600
<i>one that he is personally</i>
<i>involved with.</i>

609
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:09,104
Okay, Erik. I think it is time
to take Herr Lando
to the police station.

610
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:11,406
Gretchen, let's get your money.

611
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:17,646
<i>This way, please.</i>

612
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,248
Come along, now.

613
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:23,779
<i>You are a liability, Gretchen.</i>
<i>I can't let you out.</i>

614
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,249
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

615
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,184
<i>-Just pheromones.</i>

616
01:02:29,284 --> 01:02:31,887
<i>I am giving you the chance</i>
<i>to be of great use</i>

617
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:34,189
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

618
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:37,225
<i>The adolescent</i>
<i>needs to be trained.</i>

619
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:41,964
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

620
01:02:51,473 --> 01:02:53,809
It's a mild sedative.

621
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:55,210
What?

622
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:57,846
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

623
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:05,287
I'm staying here tonight.

624
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:12,227
<i>These creatures can't speak</i>
<i>like you or I.</i>

625
01:03:12,394 --> 01:03:13,829
<i>But when trained,</i>

626
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:18,201
<i>their song can be dizzyingly</i>
<i>persuasive.</i>

627
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,878
<font color="#ffff54">No, no! Stay focused!</font>

628
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,666
<font color="#ffff54">That's enough for today.</font>

629
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,647
<font color="#ffff54">Come here.</font>

630
01:05:46,848 --> 01:05:47,716
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

631
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,822
Something
is not right.

632
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:11,134
<font color="#ffff54">It is always something of a confirmation
of my dreams and good intentions.</font>

633
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,245
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

634
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:17,779
with those construction plans.

635
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:20,649
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

636
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,187
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

637
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:27,957
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to Herr Lando's wife</i>

638
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:30,126
<i>must not repeat itself.</i>

639
01:06:33,262 --> 01:06:37,033
<i>I'm very sorry</i>
<i>for what happened</i>
<i>to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

640
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:43,638
But this one's mother
wandered off my area
of authority.

641
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:48,077
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

642
01:06:48,244 --> 01:06:50,478
<i>before we had another offspring</i>

643
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:51,981
ready to replace her.

644
01:06:52,348 --> 01:06:55,850
<i>There were family matters</i>
<i>prolonging my endeavor.</i>

645
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:02,457
Actually...

646
01:07:02,824 --> 01:07:06,461
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

647
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:10,765
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

648
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:11,833
Wow.

649
01:07:12,268 --> 01:07:15,972
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

650
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:19,141
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

651
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:25,247
<i>A sacred process that keeps</i>
<i>an ancient creature alive</i>
<i>and well.</i>

652
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:28,717
<i>A magnificent creature</i>
<i>whose approach to family</i>

653
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:31,988
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

654
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,591
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

655
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:39,561
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

656
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:43,099
<i>Consider your mishap last night</i>
<i>a dry run.</i>

657
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:49,938
Erik?

658
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,570
<font color="#ffff54">I told him, not in the house.</font>

659
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,055
Shh...

660
01:08:13,362 --> 01:08:14,562
Oh.

661
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,218
<font color="#ffff54">Stay here.</font>

662
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:18,367
No, no, no, no.

663
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:20,336
<i>You should be on your side.</i>

664
01:08:20,436 --> 01:08:22,171
<i>You could choke, my dear.</i>

665
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,614
<font color="#ffff54">No!</font>

666
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:56,205
<i>Honey?</i>
<i>Honey, what's wrong?</i>

667
01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:58,140
I don't feel so good.

668
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:01,210
Take this.

669
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,111
<font color="#ffff54">Everything's fine.</font>

670
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,365
<font color="#ffff54">Everything's fine.</font>

671
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:31,606
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

672
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:03,239
After my mom died,

673
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:06,142
I accidentally called
our house...

674
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:10,845
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

675
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:16,018
It kind of helped,

676
01:10:17,386 --> 01:10:19,221
so I kept calling.

677
01:10:22,057 --> 01:10:24,326
Maybe you can do that too.

678
01:11:09,405 --> 01:11:12,141
<i>Do you know what this bird</i>
<i>is famous for?</i>

679
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:20,683
This bird lays its eggs
in the nests
of other bird species

680
01:11:20,983 --> 01:11:25,720
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

681
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:30,725
No! Not in here!

682
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:04,026
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

683
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:17,506
How old is your sister?

684
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:24,480
Gretchen?

685
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:27,750
Yes, I am fine.

686
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,486
<i>We are in the treatment center</i>
<i>by the hospital.</i>

687
01:12:30,653 --> 01:12:31,853
-If you come back
in the morning,

688
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:34,256
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

689
01:12:34,423 --> 01:12:36,759
<i>Alma is going</i>
<i>to stay here for the evening.</i>

690
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:39,261
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor</i>
<i>her sleep.</i>

691
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:40,129
<i>Dad?</i>

692
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:41,697
<i>-Beth and I are coming home.</i>

693
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:43,931
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about--

694
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:47,835
<i>-What is it, Gretchen?</i>

695
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:51,006
We can't trust them.

696
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,442
<i>-Gretchen, we can talk</i>
<i>when we're home.</i>

697
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:56,378
<i>I told you</i>
<i>I will protect you.</i>

698
01:13:00,249 --> 01:13:01,550
<i>Get ready.</i>

699
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:03,552
What's wrong with Beth?

700
01:13:19,034 --> 01:13:22,404
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

701
01:13:24,106 --> 01:13:28,444
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

702
01:13:29,244 --> 01:13:33,716
<i>Astonishing resemblance</i>
<i>to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

703
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:38,120
<i>The surrogate mother's distress</i>
<i>grows in close proximity</i>

704
01:13:38,253 --> 01:13:40,155
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

705
01:13:40,456 --> 01:13:44,493
<i>Thus both host parents</i>
<i>have been removed</i>
<i>from the premises.</i>

706
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:50,299
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

707
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:55,371
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

708
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:59,874
<i>Instead of leaving</i>
<i>their offspring</i>
<i>in the care of a host,</i>

709
01:13:59,975 --> 01:14:04,213
<i>homo-cuculidae returns</i>
<i>to claim their young.</i>

710
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,515
Contact with the biological
mother

711
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:10,252
speeds up the process
of the offspring's physical
development

712
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:13,956
<i>and its abilities</i>
<i>significantly.</i>

713
01:14:17,393 --> 01:14:22,698
We are about to initiate
the first close-distance
encounter

714
01:14:22,998 --> 01:14:25,100
with the biological mother.

715
01:14:45,053 --> 01:14:46,921
Brood parasites.

716
01:14:49,558 --> 01:14:51,393
<i>They don't impregnate.</i>

717
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,129
They implant eggs.

718
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:59,435
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

719
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:05,574
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

720
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,012
Like your father...

721
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,748
<i>on his honeymoon.</i>

722
01:15:15,017 --> 01:15:17,019
<i>And then what do they do?</i>

723
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,689
Release them into the wild.

724
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:25,461
When the mother shows up...

725
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:27,696
I end this experiment.

726
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:31,633
What about my sister?

727
01:15:34,236 --> 01:15:37,339
That is not your sister.

728
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:40,375
Two.

729
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:42,678
<i>Yeah, the sister</i>
<i>of the young one</i>

730
01:15:42,778 --> 01:15:45,013
and a rogue police detective.

731
01:15:45,547 --> 01:15:49,518
<i>Yeah, I am afraid we must</i>
<i>commence definitive measures</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

732
01:15:50,085 --> 01:15:51,353
<i>She's dead.</i>

733
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:54,590
The feather
I wrote my name with.

734
01:15:55,591 --> 01:15:58,093
<i>The plumage</i>
<i>of the apportioners.</i>

735
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:05,103
<font color="#ffff54">We're in the middle of an experiment.</font>

736
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,605
<font color="#ffff54">What happened? You're bleeding.</font>

737
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,234
<font color="#ffff54">The recordings you made
behind my back...</font>

738
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,612
<font color="#ffff54">Are they still under the staircase
at your house?</font>

739
01:16:19,748 --> 01:16:20,749
Yeah.

740
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,873
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry, Danielle.</font>

741
01:16:48,143 --> 01:16:49,478
No! No!

742
01:16:58,453 --> 01:17:00,322
I'm not going to hurt you.

743
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:37,793
Alma. Alma?

744
01:17:38,093 --> 01:17:40,095
Alma, we have to go.

745
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:42,164
We have to go now.

746
01:18:09,725 --> 01:18:11,159
Just stay right here.

747
01:19:02,778 --> 01:19:05,280
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

748
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:52,427
Alma?

749
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,173
<font color="#ffff54">Mr. König!</font>

750
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:43,332
She's dead!

751
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,668
Mom is dead!

752
01:27:46,235 --> 01:27:50,705
<i>Where's your machine gun,</i>
<i>my dear?</i>

753
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:53,142
Is it under your cast, huh?

754
01:27:56,278 --> 01:27:57,246
Why me?

755
01:27:57,346 --> 01:28:00,115
It's not about you,
you little brat.

756
01:28:00,915 --> 01:28:03,586
This is nature.

757
01:28:03,686 --> 01:28:06,055
<i>She is supposed</i>
<i>to be focusing...</i>

758
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:09,757
<i>on reproduction and breeding.</i>

759
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:16,332
And you are competing
for resources
with her offspring.

760
01:28:16,599 --> 01:28:19,101
<i>Our process here ensures</i>

761
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:22,037
<i>that each new generation</i>
<i>we breed</i>

762
01:28:22,137 --> 01:28:24,939
<i>is more powerful than the last.</i>

763
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:28,477
<i>And my dear,</i>
<i>when I am done with you</i>

764
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,447
<i>and reunite Alma with--</i>

765
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:53,847
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry.</font>

766
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:05,109
<font color="#ffff54">I would never hurt you.</font>

767
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:11,447
Stay away
from her, Alma.

768
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:17,996
<font color="#ffff54">We have to leave now.</font>

769
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,767
<font color="#ffff54">My mom called.</font>

770
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:52,156
<font color="#ffff54">She got your message.</font>

771
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,791
<font color="#ffff54">Will she come to visit?</font>

772
01:31:09,872 --> 01:31:11,140
No.

773
01:31:12,441 --> 01:31:15,677
S-She... can't.

774
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:22,985
But she says thank you.

775
01:31:23,918 --> 01:31:26,088
Thank you, Alma.

776
01:31:57,085 --> 01:31:59,154
Thank you, Alma.

777
01:32:06,795 --> 01:32:09,097
I really need your help.

778
01:32:21,844 --> 01:32:23,645
<i>Henry!</i>

779
01:32:24,146 --> 01:32:26,415
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

780
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:31,320
I stand by it.

781
01:32:31,753 --> 01:32:34,656
<i>-Did you ever tell your wife</i>
<i>you'd protect her?</i>

782
01:32:39,061 --> 01:32:40,496
What?

783
01:32:42,297 --> 01:32:46,335
<i>Did you tell her</i>
<i>you'd protect her?</i>

784
01:32:51,473 --> 01:32:52,574
<i>Did you?</i>

785
01:32:56,845 --> 01:32:59,248
Yes!

786
01:32:59,348 --> 01:33:02,017
<i>-Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

787
01:33:27,676 --> 01:33:29,144
Alma!

788
01:33:29,511 --> 01:33:32,447
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

789
01:33:34,349 --> 01:33:36,485
<i>What are you doing?</i>

790
01:33:36,585 --> 01:33:37,853
She's one of them!

791
01:33:38,086 --> 01:33:39,922
<i>Alma!</i>

792
01:33:40,023 --> 01:33:41,323
I don't think so.

793
01:33:41,523 --> 01:33:42,491
<i>-Come to me.</i>

794
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:45,260
She will be.

795
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:47,563
She will become!

796
01:33:48,163 --> 01:33:50,699
- I don't think so.
<i>- Alma!</i>

797
01:33:50,866 --> 01:33:53,068
<i>We need to find out</i>
<i>how many there are.</i>

798
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:56,505
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

799
01:33:57,205 --> 01:33:59,474
-Stop!
-Let her go.

800
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:03,012
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

801
01:34:03,111 --> 01:34:04,846
She is not your sister!

802
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:06,181
They stopped reproducing before.

803
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:08,550
They will go extinct
without preservation.

804
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:10,252
Oh, they will go extinct.

805
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:12,321
<i>-Hundreds of years of research.</i>

806
01:34:12,421 --> 01:34:14,523
<i>This is the will</i>
<i>of the apportioners.</i>

807
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:16,191
<i>Let her go.</i>

808
01:34:16,725 --> 01:34:18,594
You don't know
what you're doing!
