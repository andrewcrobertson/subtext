1
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:27,236
<i>You lost your adolescent already?</i>

2
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,448
<i>This will complicate matters...</i>

3
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,826
<i>A young one is on the way,</i>

4
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:38,664
<i>but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.</i>

5
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,166
Mr. König.

6
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,614
Good afternoon.

7
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,201
Good afternoon, Mr. König.

8
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,700
I'm sorry.

9
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,612
<i>Hello. It's nice to meet you.</i>

10
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,823
The pleasure is all mine.

11
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:04,161
<i>Yes.</i>
- "Yes", she says!

12
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,601
Can I go now?

13
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,809
No.

14
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:29,273
You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.

15
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,064
I'm so sorry.

16
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,983
No problem.

17
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,813
Good luck tonight!

18
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:33,526
<i>Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?
I can see the light from...</i>

19
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,793
Yes, okay. Call me back.

20
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,340
Damn it.

21
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:05,886
Shit.

22
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:53,976
Where are you?

23
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:57,813
Where are you? Come here.

24
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,301
<i>Yes?</i>

25
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:13,264
<i>Yes, yes, I'm coming.</i>

26
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,574
<i>I told you I'm coming!</i>

27
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,006
That's very cool.

28
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:09,220
No, it's not.

29
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:57,888
What are you doing here?

30
00:45:58,264 --> 00:45:59,974
What do you think? You imbecile!

31
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:02,601
We can't, not here.
We're leaving. Now!

32
00:46:02,852 --> 00:46:05,855
Why? I'm cleaning
this fuck-pad all the time!

33
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:15,698
I beg you!

34
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,870
You'll have to make it up to me.

35
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,206
I promise.

36
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,629
Okay, fine.

37
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:34,508
Let me dry my hair, then we can go.

38
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,565
I know how you can make it up to me!

39
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:03,180
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

40
00:48:15,735 --> 00:48:19,113
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

41
01:04:39,427 --> 01:04:42,013
<i>No, no! Stay focused!</i>

42
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:19,800
That's enough for today.

43
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:41,781
Come here.

44
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:11,268
It is always something of a confirmation
of my dreams and good intentions.

45
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:53,704
I told him, not in the house.

46
01:08:15,393 --> 01:08:16,393
Stay here.

47
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:37,748
No!

48
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,244
Everything's fine.

49
01:09:18,706 --> 01:09:20,499
Everything's fine.

50
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:05,154
We're in the middle of an experiment.

51
01:16:05,363 --> 01:16:07,740
<i>What happened? You're bleeding.</i>

52
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:11,285
The recordings you made
behind my back...

53
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:14,747
Are they still under the staircase
at your house?

54
01:16:24,173 --> 01:16:26,008
I'm sorry, Danielle.

55
01:27:39,473 --> 01:27:41,309
Mr. König!

56
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,983
I'm sorry.

57
01:29:58,487 --> 01:30:05,244
I would never hurt you.

58
01:30:12,627 --> 01:30:18,132
We have to leave now.

59
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:38,903
My mom called.

60
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:52,291
She got your message.

61
01:31:00,216 --> 01:31:02,927
Will she come to visit?
