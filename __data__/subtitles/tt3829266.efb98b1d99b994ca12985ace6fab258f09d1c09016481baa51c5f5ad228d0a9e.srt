1
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,403
Picket One, copy.
Do you got eyes on the hostages?

2
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,239
Still negative.

3
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,616
Twenty bucks says they don't show.

4
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,826
You two morons really making bets

5
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,329
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

6
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,957
-Abso-fucking-lutely.
-I believe that was implied. Yeah.

7
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,750
Just checking. I'm in for 20.

8
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,188
I got two hostages.

9
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,236
No crosswind.

10
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,865
I'm not waiting. 10-50, out.

11
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,454
Bluebill Two, are you out there?

12
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,372
Over.

13
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,732
Goddamn it!

14
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,111
Dupree, Jesus!

15
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,155
Where's Haines?

16
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,782
Don't know. Comm's not fucking working.

17
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,951
Give me the pack.

18
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,666
It's evidence.

19
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,751
Ain't nobody gonna believe this one.

20
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,633
The fuck is that, Cap?

21
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,179
It's above our pay grade.

22
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,515
Haines! Come in. Over.

23
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,896
Haines, goddamn it, come in. Over!

24
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,692
Sir?

25
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,655
The fuck is that, Cap?
The fuck is that, Cap?

26
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,907
Comm's not fucking working.

27
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,751
Haines?

28
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,838
Light it up!

29
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,701
Gentlemen, remember...

30
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,703
they're large, they're fast,

31
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,206
and fucking you up's
their idea of tourism!

32
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,124
Go!

33
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,209
Eyes up! Come on!

34
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,171
I want the passenger. I want the pod.
If it's not from here...

35
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,422
-You want it.
-...I want it.

36
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,991
I need help.

37
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,326
And I have money.

38
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,582
All right.

39
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,394
I need you to mail this for me.

40
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,187
You send it to this address.

41
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,691
Mail what's in the pack,
not the backpack.

42
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,568
Ahora. Go!

43
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,410
Okay.

44
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,336
Back up!

45
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,046
It was so amazing!

46
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,381
Yeah, it was.

47
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,926
Bye, Mom!

48
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,290
-Do it, man.
-No, you do it.

49
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,208
Okay.

50
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,752
Do it.

51
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,686
Oh, shit.

52
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,773
Looky, looky, loo.

53
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,733
Hey, EJ, you hungry?

54
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,277
I'm hungry for an ass-burger.

55
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,946
Sounds delicious.

56
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,156
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

57
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,074
Oh, yeah.

58
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,411
The hell are you doing?

59
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,248
He's a goner.

60
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,165
All right.

61
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,786
Hi, there.

62
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,372
Does Quinn McKenna live here?

63
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,584
His post office box payments are past due.

64
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,462
Department of Defense.

65
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,964
He works for the government, does he?

66
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,051
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

67
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,929
Military designation.

68
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,598
He kills people...

69
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,476
so you can be a mailman.

70
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
Dr. Brackett?

71
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,292
I understand you enjoy... stargazing?

72
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,464
My men will take care of your dog.
Will you come with me, please?

73
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,602
What am I looking at?

74
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,147
It's exactly what you think it is. Yeah.

75
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,776
They've been here before.

76
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,737
'87. '97.

77
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,951
Lately, the visits are increasing
in frequency.

78
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,299
Rory, I'm home! Hey, I got you something.

79
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,551
Hey.

80
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,931
Did you do one of these after school?

81
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,933
I did all of them.

82
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh. Okay.

83
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,023
Well, I got you two options.

84
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,525
We have...

85
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,236
pirate, or...

86
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,781
Frankenstein.

87
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,036
Frankenstein, you know, green skin?

88
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,455
Threw a girl to see if she would float?

89
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,583
No. Okay.

90
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,960
Well, let's go with pirate.
Yeah?

91
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,670
This is dumb.

92
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,548
The guys will...

93
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,967
They will still be able to see.

94
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,678
See what?

95
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,555
That it's me.

96
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,018
You were once quoted as saying,

97
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,312
"I dropped from my mother's womb...

98
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,105
I hit the floor...

99
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,067
and I started crawling
through hostile territory

100
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,568
toward my grave."

101
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,780
About right, yeah.

102
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,865
-That's badass.
-It's pretty morbid.

103
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,116
It's pretty dark.

104
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,913
What's with the... polygraph?
I thought this was a psych eval.

105
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,082
We need to know if you pose a threat.

106
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm a sniper.

107
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,545
Isn't posing a threat
kind of the fucking point?

108
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,423
You spend most of your time now
in-country...

109
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,843
estranged from your wife and son?

110
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,058
Look, I get it.

111
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,979
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

112
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,021
Excuse me?

113
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,649
You're not here to find out if I'm crazy.

114
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,235
You wanna make sure the label sticks.

115
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,153
So, you feel you're being railroaded?

116
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,322
I can see the tracks on the floor!

117
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,159
I don't see tracks on the floor,
for the record.

118
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,413
You feel like you're a stranger
on your own planet, don't you, Captain?

119
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,292
Like an alien, you mean?

120
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,963
That's what you wanted.

121
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:06,842
Do I get a cookie now?

122
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,011
He saw something.

123
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,179
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

124
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,850
Wow!

125
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,022
You shove me again,
I'm gonna break your neck.

126
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,024
Did I say that out loud?

127
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,155
McKenna.

128
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,076
Last one.

129
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,744
Thanks for your kindness. Thank you.

130
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,471
Oh, yeah?

131
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,063
You all right over there?

132
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,940
No, don't worry about him.
He's just got Tourette's.

133
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,942
-He can't control it.
-Fuck you, Coyle.

134
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,319
You get used to it, bro.

135
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,367
Welcome to Group Two.

136
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,827
Oh, yeah? What's that?

137
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:39,995
Like a unit?

138
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,663
No, group. Group Two.

139
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,832
Group therapy, room two.

140
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,753
-McKenna.
-Nebraska Williams.

141
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,921
That's your real name?

142
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,130
Gaylord.

143
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,090
-That's a good call, then.
-Yeah, I thought so.

144
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,968
Where did you serve?

145
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,387
Operation Enduring Freedom, '03.

146
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,348
Went for the Taliban,

147
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,807
stayed for the opium.

148
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,272
That's Coyle. Friendly fire incident.

149
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,192
Got turned around,
fired at one of his own vehicles.

150
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,528
Now, he tells jokes.

151
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,864
That's Lynch.

152
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,659
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

153
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,079
Entropy. That's my game.

154
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,748
Things like to fall apart...

155
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,708
and I... make it happen.

156
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,670
Just... Just like that.

157
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,130
Ooh! Wow! Oh.

158
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,842
-Hey.
-Hey. Don't.

159
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,053
Don't.

160
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,638
That's Nettles.

161
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,765
Okay, I'm Nettles.

162
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,892
Did three tours flying Hueys.

163
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,061
He loves his Bible. Hey, Netty?

164
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,855
Is it end times yet?

165
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,523
Yeah, laugh all you want.

166
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,525
But when you're standing at attention
before your Maker...

167
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,443
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

168
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,738
God makes shitty people.

169
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,490
Yeah.

170
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,826
I mean,
why do you think people make war?

171
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,327
Why, Baxley? Why do we make war?

172
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,453
Come on, Baxley!

173
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,746
Because we fuck cock cock!

174
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,832
-Because fuck cock cock?
-Because we fuck cocks.

175
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,251
That's it, because we fuck cocks,
that's why. We get upset.

176
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,004
How'd you snag a ticket
on this shitmobile?

177
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,173
Put a bullet in a CO.

178
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,675
Any particular reason?

179
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,511
He was an asshole.

180
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,952
Keep your head down.

181
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,629
Here, throw this on.

182
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,764
Is it just your imagination?

183
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,392
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

184
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,187
Every fucking time?

185
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,149
Your attention, please.

186
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,111
The GRC meeting has been moved
to section 3, room A.

187
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,697
Aha! There you are!

188
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,866
Welcome.

189
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,368
I'm Sean Keyes.

190
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,413
Wow. I heard you basically wrote the book
on evolutionary biology.

191
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,332
I'm sorry, can I just...

192
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,375
Is that...?

193
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,587
Oh, my God!

194
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,842
Holy shit.

195
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,052
That's alien technology.

196
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,681
This is what you brought me here to see?

197
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,100
Well, yeah.

198
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,728
Can I... Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

199
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,729
Doc.

200
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,690
Let's go.

201
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,329
-Everything good?
-Yes, sir.

202
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,456
What is it?

203
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:14,751
Dr. Brackett.

204
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,171
Would you like to meet a Predator?

205
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,590
Come on.

206
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,893
Please observe decontamination protocol.

207
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,645
So, how'd they rope you into this?

208
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,148
I wrote a letter to the president
when I was six.

209
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,608
Told him how much I loved animals,

210
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,401
and that if NASA
ever found a space animal,

211
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,569
they should call me.

212
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,696
Couple years ago,

213
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,616
I was put on a short list
for a paper I wrote on hybrid strains.

214
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,494
Computer cross-referenced the letter,
and... here I am.

215
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,295
Dr. Brackett.

216
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,672
Thanks for coming.

217
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,174
I'm sure you have questions.

218
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,093
-Oh. Just two, actually.
-Okay.

219
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,095
Why do you call it "the Predator"?

220
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,264
It's a nickname.

221
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,559
You know,
the data suggests that it tracks its prey.

222
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,228
Exploits weakness.

223
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:15,729
Seems to...

224
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,648
well, enjoy it.

225
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,024
Like a game.

226
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,360
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.

227
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,319
Sorry?

228
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,613
A predator kills its prey to survive.

229
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:28,575
I mean, what you're describing
is more like a bass fisherman.

230
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,577
Well, we took a vote.
Predator's cooler, right?

231
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,578
Fuck yeah.

232
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,663
Fuck yeah.

233
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,581
Found his escape pod in Mexico.

234
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,333
Still looking for the ship he came in.

235
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,627
He's heavily sedated.

236
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,969
You are one beautiful motherfucker.

237
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,639
I'm gonna guess your second question is,
why are you here?

238
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,936
Our test results yielded something
a little... odd.

239
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,314
Is this a joke?

240
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,067
We ran the genome sequence ten times.

241
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,986
This specimen has...

242
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,779
-Human DNA?
-Yeah.

243
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:06,697
Yeah.

244
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,533
Look, we know
about spontaneous speciation.

245
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,451
Mostly plants and insects, but...

246
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,204
But some mammals, sheep, goats...

247
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,163
Yeah.

248
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,166
The red wolf is known to be a hybrid
between the coyote and the grey wolf...

249
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,544
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

250
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,921
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

251
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,424
You wanna know if someone fucked an alien?

252
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,677
Yeah.

253
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,766
Okay, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask, biohelmet, and...

254
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,102
What are these?
Like, some kind of wrist gauntlets?

255
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,270
Exactly.

256
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,064
So, where's the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

257
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,107
We've looked, believe me.

258
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,569
Who is this?

259
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,614
He made first contact with the Predator.

260
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,532
Great. I'd like to talk to him.

261
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,660
Well, he's being evaluated, so...

262
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,248
Okay.

263
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,043
Well, before you lobotomize him,
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

264
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,130
We have a request to reroute.

265
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,716
Read you five-by-five. Destination?

266
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,093
Starkweather Dam. Proceed at once.

267
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,803
You'll be met by military personnel. Over.

268
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,890
Hey, Baxley!

269
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,517
Question for ya.

270
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,935
All right, here we go.

271
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,103
How do you circumcise a homeless man?

272
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,188
Here it comes.

273
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,731
Kick your mom in the chin.

274
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,816
Fuck your mother...
Fuck your mother...

275
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,737
-Shut the fuck up!
-All right.

276
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,988
You shut the fuck up.

277
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,535
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Y'all going too fucking much.

278
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,703
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

279
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,913
Why are you here?

280
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,876
Come on, man, this is the loony bus.

281
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,169
-Look at this motherfucker.
-Loonies!

282
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,212
Loonies, yeah.

283
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,967
I had a run-in with a space alien.

284
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,344
Oh, shit!

285
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,597
-No, let me...
-Okay, that guy wins.

286
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,974
That's the best story I've ever heard.

287
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:57,975
Classic story...

288
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,143
That's the winner right there.
Fuckin' hell.

289
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,728
Would you shut the fuck up?

290
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,484
They want to put a lid on it,

291
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,862
so here I am.

292
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,113
Stuck in Group Two.

293
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,532
The sequel to Group One, only stupider.

294
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,122
Somebody give this man a fuckin' cigar.

295
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,290
Shut the fuck up.

296
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,166
"Would you shut the fuck up?"

297
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,005
It's a conspiracy.

298
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,340
The goddamn space aliens, huh?

299
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,093
What are you doing down there, Rory?

300
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,014
Just-- just playing games.

301
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,933
Well, dinner's getting cold.

302
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,521
Major?

303
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,689
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

304
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,151
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

305
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,237
Damn it.

306
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,489
We need something in the air.

307
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,615
Get me NORAD.

308
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,451
I feel like I'm missing something
in the research.

309
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,869
There's something I'm just not seeing.

310
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,997
Look, if this is the blood, okay,
I think...

311
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,291
can you just tell me what that is?

312
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,753
Because I was trying to get into this
earlier, but somebody stopped me.

313
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,588
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

314
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,048
-That guy actually.
-Hold that thought.

315
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,552
Sir, NORAD's reporting a 202 anomaly
possibly heading our direction.

316
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,095
Is it coming here?

317
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,263
God, I hope not.

318
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,398
Holy shit!

319
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,321
How far away are we talking about?

320
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,990
Unknown.
But it's definitely heading your way.

321
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,658
Level two alert.

322
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,785
-Level two alert.
-Shit!

323
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:23,161
Hey, what's happening?

324
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,080
Proximity alert. Bogey's inbound.
Range 200 miles.

325
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,164
Lock it down.

326
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,584
He's awake! He's awake! He's awake!

327
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,501
Hey!

328
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,964
Hey, hold him down! Keep him down!

329
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:34,923
Hold him down!

330
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,010
Oh, shit!

331
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,264
Doc, on me, now!

332
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,099
Move! Move!

333
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,018
Church, Thomas, J.

334
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,082
Move!

335
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,342
Please observe decontamination protocol.

336
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:21,970
Chamber secure.

337
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,597
Remove outer garments.

338
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,502
Church, Thomas, J.
Church, Thomas, J.

339
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,949
Please observe decontamination protocol.

340
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,083
All personnel, Code Orange.
Code Orange.

341
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,627
This is not a drill.

342
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,214
Sit tight. There's been a breach.

343
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,299
Do you have an estimate?

344
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,759
Not right now.

345
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:25,385
I'll give you cover fire.

346
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,428
Get him out!

347
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:28,722
Movement, twelve o'clock!

348
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,362
Hey. Hey.

349
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,830
Don't let him get away.

350
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,918
Not my space animal.

351
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,016
What the fuck?

352
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,356
Alien.

353
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,524
Your green boy?

354
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,109
Yep.

355
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,152
Goddamn space aliens.

356
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,612
What? What?

357
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,197
Did you not just fucking see that, man?

358
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,532
Am I going fucking mad?

359
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,533
-Hey.
-Shut up.

360
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,534
Take it easy, man.

361
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:31,535
I didn't fucking see it.

362
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,744
Nettles, be quiet.

363
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,872
-Where the fuck is it? I wanna see it.
-Hey!

364
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,544
That's the thing that killed my men.

365
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:41,753
Yeah, they'll do that.

366
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,423
We gotta get off this thing.
We gotta move.

367
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,717
Brother, it's a bus.

368
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,677
It moves.

369
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,266
Hey, Baxley!

370
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,937
If your mom's vagina were a video game,
it'd be rated "E" for "Everyone."

371
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,106
Hey!

372
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,150
Knock it off.

373
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,321
What's the difference between
five big black guys and a joke?

374
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,865
Baxley's mom can't take a joke.

375
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,367
What, motherfucker!

376
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,413
Come on, bitch!

377
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,460
Everyone, on the floor, face down!

378
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,921
Face down! Now!

379
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:24,963
Come on!

380
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,388
Keys!

381
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,851
Gun!

382
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,857
Hey! Nettles! Nettles! Wait, hey! Hey!

383
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,442
You got him, all right?
You got him, brother.

384
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,338
Hey, Nebraska, you mind making a detour?

385
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,756
What, for your green boy?

386
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,467
I'm a sniper, just get me close, baby.

387
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,387
-You wanna kill him?
-Oh, yeah!

388
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,848
-Why didn't you just say so, man?
-You're gonna kill a fucking alien?

389
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,806
Hey. Hold on.

390
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,353
Fuck!

391
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,908
Yo, what the fuck is that?

392
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,325
Easy, easy. Hey! Hey!

393
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,416
-Hey.
-Take cover!

394
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,918
Behind the fucking bus!

395
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,128
What are you doing up there? Come on.
Come on, I got you.

396
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,548
-Yep. I got you, lady.
-Okay.

397
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,550
Let's go! Hey.
Come on, come on.

398
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:15,759
Come on.

399
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,427
-Sorry.
-Move!

400
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,387
Damn.

401
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,139
Get to the choppers!

402
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,375
Stargazer, I got eyes on the woman.

403
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,751
Instructions?

404
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,461
-Eliminate her.
-Hey.

405
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,629
Retrieve any contraband.

406
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,256
Roger that, Stargazer.

407
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,351
That's it, that's it, girl.

408
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,145
Hey, Nebraska!

409
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,521
Got it.

410
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,040
Everything okay back there?

411
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,129
You fucking guys.

412
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,250
We found the one place to hide out
where we don't look crazy.

413
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,882
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

414
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,384
What's it feel like?

415
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,345
Like a gun.

416
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,932
Hey, you think she's safe
in there with them?

417
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:29,059
The girl?

418
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,144
They're soldiers, man.

419
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,815
Sleeping ladies? Nah, bro.

420
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,609
Sit down.

421
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:42,948
Here.

422
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,076
It's the end of times, huh?

423
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,414
Worst thing about the end times...

424
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,041
they never fucking are.

425
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,212
So...

426
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,048
did he live?

427
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,425
Say again?

428
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,927
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

429
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,139
Yeah. He did.

430
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,016
Yeah, and where is he at now?

431
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,730
You're shitting me.

432
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,814
I missed.

433
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,359
Why did you do that?

434
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,528
-Miss?
-No, shoot yourself.

435
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,655
Doctors asked me the same thing.

436
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,993
Walked to the hospital with a bullet
in my skull.

437
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,454
-Good times.
-Hey.

438
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:33,749
Should I be worried?

439
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,257
Probably.

440
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,135
-There we go.
-Did you get that?

441
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,762
-That's too close to her hand.
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

442
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,348
-But then she's gonna drop that there.
-Guys!

443
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,184
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

444
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,810
We're trying to make her feel comfortable.

445
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:54,895
Come on.

446
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,648
She's gonna wake up and see
a bunch of motherfuckers. Come on.

447
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,693
Nettles! Nettles!

448
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,903
Move!

449
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:03,946
Move!

450
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,364
Get out of there!

451
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,046
Morning, sunshine.

452
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,553
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

453
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,222
Chill, hey!

454
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,809
I told you she'd grab it. Ten bucks!

455
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:34,977
Pay up!

456
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,436
Fuck it, fuck it.

457
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,648
-Where's my phone?
-You're not gonna need that.

458
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,734
Oh, that's not cool.

459
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,069
It's okay.

460
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,904
I said it's okay.

461
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,490
Give me the gun.

462
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,284
-Give me the gun.
-No. No.

463
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,666
Oh, she pulled...

464
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,919
Shit, I told you she'd pull the trigger!

465
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,713
I should have bet you that time!

466
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,339
-I like her.
-I should have bet you that time!

467
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,382
-I like her.
-I like her.

468
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,092
I like her. I like her a lot.

469
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,594
Give me that, ding-dong.

470
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,430
Oh, shit! Attagirl.

471
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:15,017
What? You're a scientist, huh?
What they got you working on?

472
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,603
You're not gonna last a day out there!

473
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,690
What, you think you're special?

474
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,484
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

475
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,361
They were gonna shoot her?

476
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,362
Yes.

477
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:29,406
Oh, I'm sorry.

478
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,658
Get out of the way.
See you around.

479
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:35,621
Eat your pussy.

480
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,456
Wait, what?

481
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,624
How you doing?

482
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,292
No, you just said, "Eat your pussy."

483
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,251
Hey...

484
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,836
-How you doing?
-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

485
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:44,087
What the fuck is wrong with him?

486
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,881
-I said you're pushy.
-He said you're pushy.

487
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,216
No, you said, "Eat your pussy."

488
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,592
No. I said, "Sheesh! You're pushy!"

489
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,969
-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."
-No, that's what he said, I heard it.

490
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,096
-He said... pushy.
-What the fuck?

491
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:54,806
Which is also fucking rude.

492
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,517
He doesn't mean
your pussy in particular.

493
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,935
You're insane, right?

494
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,228
-Are you fucking insane?
-Probably.

495
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,521
Well, what's it gonna be?

496
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:01,980
-He's fucking crazy.
-Fuck you, Baxley.

497
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,106
I feel fine.

498
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:04,900
They were gonna shoot me?

499
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,693
Why?

500
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,572
Maybe 'cause of this?

501
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:16,870
Well, I guess I'm in.

502
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,915
Stay the fuck away from me.

503
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:24,711
What the fuck is this?

504
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:26,880
What is this?

505
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,591
-What is that? Like a unicorn?
-A unicorn.

506
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,968
-It's a unicorn.
-A unicorn.

507
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,761
I made a unicorn...

508
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,179
I'm sorry, it's a piece of shit.

509
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,391
So, what's the upside to me staying here
with you guys?

510
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,268
Maybe staying alive?

511
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,854
We are soldiers.
We're the good guys, okay?

512
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,355
Well, that's debatable.

513
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:47,401
I read your file.
The guys in Mexico it killed?

514
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:48,443
They yours?

515
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,279
They're gonna need a patsy for that.

516
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:51,905
You're looking at him.

517
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,115
Yeah, I figured.

518
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,201
Ex-sniper with PTSD?
That's actually kind of perfect.

519
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,954
How about you telling us
what you were doing in a secret base.

520
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:01,915
Surrounded by trained soldiers. Mercs.

521
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,129
I'm a biologist, and they have me on call
in case there's...

522
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,174
contact.

523
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,010
What did I tell you?

524
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,595
End days. End days.

525
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,305
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

526
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:17,556
I'm gonna set you on fire.

527
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:20,642
Guys, if we wanna keep breathing,
we need to find this thing.

528
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,102
Expose it.

529
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,104
It's called the Predator.

530
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,315
It hunts people for sport.

531
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,859
Technically, that's not a predator.
That's like...

532
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:29,860
Thank you.

533
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:30,819
It's a hunter.

534
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:32,905
-I said the same thing.
-A sportsman, or a hunter, or a fisherman.

535
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:33,906
Well, look at you...

536
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,116
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

537
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,577
Equipment. Weapons.

538
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,623
I took its gear.

539
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:45,751
-What?
-You took something from the thing?

540
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,836
-What?
-So I'd have evidence.

541
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:50,923
I think I know where it's going.

542
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:25,666
What?

543
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,149
Oh, hi, honey, you're home.

544
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,027
-I'm looking for a package.
-A package?

545
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:55,112
Rory!

546
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:57,030
Hey! This is not your house anymore!

547
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:57,948
Rory!

548
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,076
Hey, buddy. Where are ya?

549
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,578
He's not here.

550
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:04,580
What do you mean, he's not here?

551
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,249
Oh, shit!

552
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,168
What? So, we ordered some video games.

553
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,170
No! No! No!

554
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,422
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box

555
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:14,882
was so I didn't put you in danger.

556
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:16,717
Goddamn it, we need to find him.

557
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,302
Wait, Quinn, you're scaring me now.

558
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,730
I specifically said
no first-person shooter.

559
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,106
No combat games.

560
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:32,274
Did you ever think

561
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,109
that maybe he plays them
to connect with his father?

562
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,444
Oh, my God. We're doing this again.

563
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,154
Hey! Can you stop taking all my...

564
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,490
Who are these people in my house?

565
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:42,951
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

566
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,161
Good evening.

567
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:46,371
The brushstrokes on this
are really dynamic.

568
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,623
It's a wonderful piece.

569
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,291
Okay, you need to put that down.

570
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,126
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

571
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:52,586
They're my unit. They're soldiers.

572
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:54,046
Marines. There's his unit.

573
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,715
Hi. You seem like a really nice--

574
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,467
Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

575
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,719
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

576
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,346
What happened to Haines and Dupree?

577
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,098
They're dead.

578
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,184
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

579
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,602
What are you talking about?

580
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:09,645
There's something out there.

581
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:12,481
It tore my friends apart.
What is it?

582
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:13,941
It's like...

583
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,817
Like, it's a creature.
Seriously, it's not a person.

584
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,487
-Like from the Bible. Revelations.
-From the Bible?

585
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,197
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

586
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,490
It's a space alien.

587
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,408
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

588
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,244
It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

589
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,412
Oh, shit!

590
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,039
Shit.

591
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,207
I want a grid search.

592
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,291
Three teams.

593
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,086
Hey!

594
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,047
-No.
-No, no, I'm coming with you.

595
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,173
No, nix that.

596
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:44,054
Is there a problem?

597
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:47,099
Thing is, we're kind of moving targets.

598
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:49,560
Yeah, in case you haven't noticed,
we're-- we're fugitives.

599
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,520
Yeah. Plus, like where are we gonna get
our meds and stuff?

600
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:53,272
I get it. Fine, stay here and watch TV.

601
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:56,483
You know what? If you try to split?
Or draw the Feds?

602
00:46:56,525 --> 00:47:00,070
Or if you jeopardize my son
by your half-assed yardbird bullshit,

603
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:03,323
I will come back here, and I will happily
kill every single fucking one of you.

604
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:10,581
Come on, brothers. Let's go.

605
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:15,127
Seriously?

606
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:16,920
It's not our fight.

607
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,760
Is your husband the man I think he is?

608
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:25,971
Excuse me?

609
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:27,973
Tell me about your husband, please?

610
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,186
He's a security counter-sniper.

611
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:33,729
Army Rangers.

612
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,316
He supervised 23
close precision engagements

613
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:38,692
across five continents

614
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,611
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

615
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:44,740
And he is one of only 14 captains
in the armed forces

616
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,283
to ever receive
a Distinguished Service Medal

617
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:47,451
and the Silver Star.

618
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,663
So, he might be a lousy husband,
but he is a good soldier.

619
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,752
Well, sounds like
he can probably take care of himself.

620
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,337
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ.

621
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,296
That's what I thought.

622
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,465
Fuckin' pussies.

623
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:06,470
Where you going, Nettles?

624
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,807
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

625
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,643
But...

626
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,561
he called me a pussy

627
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:15,938
and nobody calls me a pussy, so...

628
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:17,856
-Fuck off, pussy.
-Okay...

629
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:24,238
Come on, Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

630
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,698
Before these army fuckers screw up
the whole thing.

631
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,329
Come on, what are you doing? Let's move.

632
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,330
Hey!

633
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:34,623
You too, lucky charms.

634
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:35,541
Coyle, you wanker.

635
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:40,462
-I'd like to watch TV with you sometime.
-Okay.

636
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:41,630
I liked your speech.

637
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:42,631
I liked the couch.

638
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,385
Whoa, what's happening? What?

639
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,137
Well, we're finding my son, that's what.

640
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,932
All right, when all this is over...

641
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:53,934
Fuck me in the face with an aardvark.

642
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:58,480
I just want to be famous.

643
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,816
Ostensibly, if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

644
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,776
it would tell him
exactly what he would get.

645
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:04,403
You're using "ostensibly" incorrectly.

646
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,529
Is this for me?

647
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:06,989
This is like the reverse of a clown car.

648
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,867
All right, Nebraska,
let's find some wheels, nothing flashy.

649
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:10,868
Copy.

650
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:11,827
All right.

651
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,412
Find my son.

652
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,205
Casey, you're with me.

653
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:16,915
Let's go.

654
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,209
Hey, ass-burger.

655
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,423
What are you supposed to be?

656
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:25,674
Leave me alone.

657
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,218
Or what? You'll wash our hands
five hundred times?

658
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:33,390
Trick or treat?

659
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:39,813
What's the matter, dude?

660
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,150
Here's a treat, you little shit.

661
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,399
I got a male juvenile.
10 to 12 years old.

662
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:25,692
Metal cast on his arm.

663
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,860
Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?

664
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:28,278
Ran right in front of my car.

665
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,157
Moving east on Woodruff.
Repeat, moving east on Woodruff.

666
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,751
Nebraska, you got wheels?

667
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,753
Yeah, I got wheels. Something flashy.

668
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,882
Listen, the kid's spooked,
he's rabbiting.

669
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,260
Where's he headed?
Where's some place he knows?

670
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:47,858
There he is.

671
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,157
Dad!

672
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:00,579
How you doing, buddy, huh?

673
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:01,788
I'm good.

674
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,218
Move! Move!

675
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,638
Doc, come get my kid.

676
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,270
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

677
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,606
Oh, shit!

678
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,200
McKenna!

679
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,080
Take cover! Take cover!

680
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,517
Williams! Get the fuck out of there!

681
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,896
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

682
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:09,398
Oh, shit!

683
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:15,153
Okay.

684
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,957
Doc, the dreads.
What's that all about?

685
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,543
I don't know.
Maybe, like, sensor receptors.

686
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:30,878
Kind of like cat whiskers.

687
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,797
What the--
I'm getting a sample.

688
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,132
It's a fucking space dog.

689
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:37,634
You okay? Huh?

690
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,139
What, is your mom cutting your hair now?

691
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,640
Are you kidding me?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment.

692
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:44,600
Shut up. Please shut up.

693
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:46,268
-All I wanted was a little sample.
-Please shut up.

694
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,686
All I wanted was a goddamn fucking sample.

695
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,770
Come here.

696
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:52,941
Sample.

697
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:54,067
-There you go.
-Thank you.

698
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,152
You're welcome.

699
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:56,403
Fucking space dog, man.

700
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,530
-My man, you need to--
-It's a fucking space-- I can't. I can't.

701
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,282
-Get it together.
-I can't do this.

702
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,075
Oh, my God!

703
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,203
Fucking hell!

704
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,708
Fuck!

705
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,794
Go now! Please!

706
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,254
Rory!

707
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,424
Shoot him! Shoot him!

708
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,718
Hey!
No! No! No!

709
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,638
No! No! No!

710
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,684
Oh, fuck, fuck. No, no, no!

711
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,188
Cock! Cock! Fuck! Dick!

712
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,398
Suck! Suck my cock!
Fuck! Goddamn it!

713
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:35,776
Go! Go! Go!

714
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:37,736
I got him! I got him!

715
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,404
Go, go, go!
On Williams! On Williams!

716
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:42,783
Rory!

717
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:48,914
-Take cover!
-Move!

718
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,252
Go! Go!

719
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,253
Come on!

720
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,337
Come on!

721
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,674
FYI, back at Stargazer,

722
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,051
I was naked and unarmed,
it walked right past me.

723
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:03,220
Can you tell your kid to tone down
the psychosis, please?

724
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,435
All right, let's do this.
Let's do this.

725
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,520
Wait, and do what?

726
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,523
You know, we could keep running,
or we give him back what he wants.

727
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,904
What, this is it?

728
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,409
Oh, my God. Shit.

729
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,082
Shit.

730
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,084
No, no, no! Move! Move! Move!

731
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:35,002
Hey, come on.

732
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:36,378
You good?

733
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,421
Fucked!

734
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,506
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-Netty, get the vehicle.

735
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:40,716
-The rest of you on me.
-Copy.

736
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,342
Move back.

737
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,108
No! No! No!

738
00:55:59,067 --> 00:55:59,985
No!

739
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,461
Incoming!

740
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:22,132
What the fuck?

741
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:53,288
Come here!

742
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,623
Roll out! Roll out, let's go!

743
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:56,083
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

744
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,043
-Move!
-Move out, move out!

745
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:01,922
Move! Move out!

746
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:04,299
-Let's go!
-Let's move!

747
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:07,928
Go, go, go! Let's go!

748
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:08,887
Let's go!

749
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,389
Move!

750
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,723
Come on!

751
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,684
Move! Come on, get in! Come on!

752
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,685
Sit down!

753
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,020
Good! Good! Good!

754
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:21,692
Go! Last man!

755
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:24,027
Go! Go! Go!

756
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:42,963
What's the big one?

757
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,132
What's the big one, Doc?
Is that like the male?

758
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:47,926
He didn't even give a shit about us.
Just wanted to kill that thing.

759
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:52,723
You-- You saw that, right?

760
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:54,892
Guys! Did you see that? He--

761
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,853
He grew an exoskeleton
under his fucking skin.

762
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,065
What, are they hunting each other now?

763
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,976
We're still sorting through it right now.

764
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,903
-Hey, it's me.
-Tell me he's okay.

765
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,821
He's fine. I'm going to bring him back.

766
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,198
It's okay, don't say anything,
just be safe.

767
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,741
Hey, no! Don't do that!

768
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:55,160
What? Hello?

769
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:01,208
Damn it.

770
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,168
You guys fucked with the wrong family.

771
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,590
-How tall?
-Witnesses say 11 feet.

772
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:09,716
That's pretty fucking tall.

773
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:11,385
Okay.

774
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,723
-Fucked that nigga up.
-Sir?

775
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:18,684
Nothing.

776
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:21,854
I'd be careful with that, sir.

777
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:25,399
You know what I think?

778
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,526
I think this one went rogue. A runner.

779
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:29,403
And the big one?

780
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,487
He's a tracker.

781
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:32,030
Sent to take that one out.

782
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,783
Some kind of interstellar
cops and robbers.

783
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,286
Now he's going after that missing ship.

784
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:39,371
And whatever's on board.

785
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,249
I want that fucking ship.

786
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,458
We're in the ballpark.

787
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:45,294
Captain McKenna's son?

788
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,881
Mother confirms.
He has the operating system.

789
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,924
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Thought it was a video game.

790
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:52,467
So, we find the kid, we find the ship.

791
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:54,261
What the fuck we still standing here for?

792
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,346
You don't want to know what that one is?

793
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,182
I know what it is.
Our big boy's a hunter.

794
00:59:58,223 --> 00:59:59,516
He brought his dogs with him.

795
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:07,441
No, it had to be like
a government experiment or some shit.

796
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:09,484
Like a robot, or whatever.

797
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:11,153
Nettles, are you fucking retarded, man?

798
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,113
Use another word, would ya?

799
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:15,115
Yeah, man. Show a little sensitivity.

800
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,408
His son's retarded.

801
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:17,910
Here you go.

802
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,244
Here you go.

803
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,371
He does this from time to time.

804
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:23,165
Just give him a minute.

805
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,250
Hey, Lynch.

806
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,086
What's the deal with these two?

807
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:29,838
Coyle lit up one of his own vehicles?

808
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,799
Back in '09, yeah.
It was bad business. Six dead.

809
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,092
What, no survivors?

810
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:35,719
Yeah, there was one.

811
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,017
It's fucking romantic.

812
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,394
Are you kidding me, they're friends?

813
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:47,439
Picture it. Military inquiries,
sitting outside courtrooms,

814
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,107
waiting to go in, side by side

815
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,984
-day after fucking day.
-After fucking day.

816
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:52,319
Unbelievable.

817
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:53,820
It's the loonies.

818
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,164
All right, kid.

819
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,166
I've talked to your mother.

820
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,918
She's doing fine.

821
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,254
Mom says you're a killer.

822
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,173
Well, I'm a soldier.

823
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:15,676
What's the difference?

824
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:20,430
Well, when you like it,

825
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,432
that's when you're a killer.

826
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:26,311
Are you good?

827
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,440
Sorry I never grew up.

828
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:34,278
You know,
the way you wanted.

829
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,618
Tell you a secret.

830
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:45,080
Truth is, kid,

831
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,166
I never grew up the way I wanted.

832
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:54,089
Are we gonna get killed?

833
01:01:58,218 --> 01:01:59,219
Nope.

834
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:02,556
Come on. Get up.

835
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,058
I'm single. I don't know if you knew that.

836
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,102
No, I could tell that you're single.

837
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,147
We got so much stuff in common,
you know...

838
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,358
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

839
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,443
Shit.

840
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:15,360
What?

841
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:17,905
This is more than spinal fluid.

842
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,239
What does that mean?

843
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,574
If I'm right,

844
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,660
it means they're trying
to upgrade themselves.

845
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:25,245
McKenna, I got something.

846
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:28,582
I think I know what they're up to
on Predator World these days.

847
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:31,585
You see this? They found this
in the Predator's plexus.

848
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:34,671
So, remember how I told you how they take
people's spines, right?

849
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:36,590
Yeah, for trophies.

850
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:39,259
Yes! Yes! From the strongest, smartest,

851
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:42,221
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

852
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:44,932
Collecting survival traits
from the most high-end specimens.

853
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:47,309
I think they're attempting hybridization.

854
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:50,604
You're just pulling this out of your ass.

855
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:52,481
Did you not see the new Predator?

856
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,526
It's evolving.

857
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:57,152
Or being upgraded.

858
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,288
That little boy managed
to figure out alien technology.

859
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:13,377
You know, a lot of experts say that being
on the spectrum isn't really a disorder.

860
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:16,088
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

861
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:19,424
Hey, yo! What the fuck?
Get the fuck away from me!

862
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,510
Yo! Casey!

863
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:23,929
Casey, get inside.

864
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,014
Casey!

865
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:28,433
Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

866
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:29,768
Casey! Look.

867
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,979
I think this thing's
been following us, all right?

868
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:33,814
Move, Netty!

869
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:34,815
Hey, hey, hey!

870
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,483
-Space dog!
-Move, Netty!

871
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:41,738
Fuck that.

872
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,240
Hey! You had your fucking chance.

873
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,202
Look, I'm just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

874
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,288
You know, maybe we can use it,
or something?

875
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:51,331
Okay, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

876
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:53,625
We're gonna study it.
That's what we're gonna do with it.

877
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:56,253
What's to learn? Except Williams sucks
at shooting shit in the head.

878
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,505
Williams, you lobotomized him.

879
01:03:58,547 --> 01:03:59,631
Okay, new rule.

880
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,592
No one shoots my fucking dog.

881
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,218
There it is. It's official.

882
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,803
You were right, we can use this.

883
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,058
Shit.

884
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,727
Netty, what is that?

885
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:15,564
Everybody, tighten up.

886
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:18,567
-Little man, come here.
-That's an EC-130. That's not civilian.

887
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,987
Hey, hey, hey! You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

888
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,197
There you go.

889
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,908
Do you wanna help?
Go get a helicopter and some pyro.

890
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,076
All right! On me!

891
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:29,203
Now go!

892
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:30,704
Casey! I'll be right back!

893
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:31,663
No, you won't.

894
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,457
Hold on. Hey. See this?

895
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:35,959
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

896
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,044
Fetch!

897
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,152
Where is it?

898
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:03,320
Where's what?

899
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:05,739
The device.

900
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,617
It goes... right in here.

901
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,333
Okay, so, the first Predator, Thing One.

902
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,502
Why'd he come here? To Earth?

903
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:23,131
The "Thing One", as you called him,
arrived in a hijacked spacecraft.

904
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,217
We think there's something on it.

905
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,302
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

906
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,054
Wait, enemies?

907
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:30,472
Other Predators.

908
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:31,807
Like that big one.

909
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:34,309
So, he brought some... what?
Gift for the human race?

910
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,103
I'll help you find it.
We can analyze it...

911
01:05:36,144 --> 01:05:37,396
Shut the fuck up!

912
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:42,442
Why are they here?

913
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:47,406
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

914
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:49,992
There was a run on Twinkies?

915
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,160
Snapped up from coast-to-coast.

916
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:53,662
Get 'em while they still last.

917
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,581
Remember?

918
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:59,877
How long before climate change renders
this planet unlivable?

919
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:02,629
Two generations?

920
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:04,673
One?

921
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,717
That's why their visits are increasing?

922
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:09,428
They're trying to snap up all
of our best DNA before we're gone.

923
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,931
Adapt themselves with it and then move in.

924
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:16,310
We're an endangered species,
and they know it.

925
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:17,936
They thrive in a hothouse environment.

926
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,189
Maybe they want to move into ours.

927
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,901
And that dead Predator was bringing us
a way to stop them.

928
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:29,072
You've hidden this thing before
in the mail.

929
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,992
So, where is it this time?

930
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:33,535
Your mother's ass.

931
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,537
Wait, did I say that out loud?

932
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,667
Hey! Hey! Hey!

933
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:42,586
No, no, no. That is not for you.

934
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,047
That is my son's, and you are violating
his privacy reading that.

935
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,381
You both need to leave right now.

936
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,675
Ma'am, I don't wanna restrain you.

937
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,677
Really? Well, why don't you try?

938
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,690
You haven't found the spacecraft?

939
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,400
Why are we trying to crack the entry code?

940
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:47,734
Because when we do find it,

941
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:49,653
wouldn't it be great
if we could get into the fucking thing?

942
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:50,571
What's that?

943
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:52,865
A map.

944
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:54,700
A map to what?

945
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,618
...give us a clue of where this place is,

946
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,495
maybe we can try to get into it.

947
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,581
But if you don't give us anything,
we can't get in!

948
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:14,720
Hey, Rory,

949
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:16,138
I'm Will.

950
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:17,639
How you doing?

951
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,100
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

952
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:35,157
Golf tomorrow?

953
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:36,575
Why not?

954
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,286
You two never read my file, did ya?

955
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:41,287
What makes you say that?

956
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,665
'Cause you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

957
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,335
The worst part is,

958
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,545
you're making me lie to my son.

959
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:51,548
What lie did you tell him?

960
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,218
That I won't enjoy this.

961
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:04,810
Hey, please, don't.

962
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,731
Look, I don't know what they told you...

963
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:09,524
Can you just wait for a second?
Just wait!

964
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:11,568
No, no, no!

965
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:13,111
No.

966
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,368
Jeez!

967
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:21,286
Oh, my God.

968
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,658
Nebraska!

969
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,535
-Yeah?
-You just kill somebody?

970
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:02,870
Well, he ain't well.

971
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,162
Untie my friend.

972
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:05,747
They got Rory. We gotta move.

973
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:07,457
Shit, they rough you up?

974
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,418
Did worse on myself, back in the day.

975
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:12,754
What do you want to do with this guy?

976
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:17,301
Sorry, buddy, that was a dumb question.

977
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:18,510
Yeah, that was a dumb question.

978
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:32,691
Casey!

979
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:37,821
Can I interest you
in getting the fuck out of here?

980
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,282
"Getting the fuck out of here"
is my middle name.

981
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,784
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

982
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:47,206
What? What's wrong?

983
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,045
All right.

984
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:55,047
Hey! Just let me unpack this.

985
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:57,716
You're saying my son's headed towards
a spaceship and so is a 10-foot alien.

986
01:10:58,133 --> 01:10:59,468
11, actually.

987
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,719
Used to be a contractor.

988
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:02,721
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

989
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:04,848
Meaning it's the Chinese menu of DNA.

990
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,892
Comprised of the deadliest species
in the entire...

991
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,185
In the entire universe, yeah?

992
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:09,853
-Galaxy.
-What?

993
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:11,939
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

994
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,190
Why go universe? Just saying.

995
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:29,498
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

996
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,582
That's what you asked for?

997
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:31,583
Yeah, that'll do.

998
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,419
Saddle up!

999
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:39,550
It's the best we could do, man.

1000
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:43,929
Go ahead. Go!

1001
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:45,305
That's it? Another one.

1002
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:46,223
The other one!

1003
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:48,058
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1004
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:53,772
Figured something out.
I think we're gonna die.

1005
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,650
We're gonna go hunt and fight the what,
the army?

1006
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:57,818
We're not gonna fight the army...

1007
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,653
And some fucking people from space!

1008
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,154
You wanna talk survival?

1009
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:02,781
Fine!

1010
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:06,201
You, yesterday, you were on a prison bus
barking to yourself,

1011
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:07,995
now you got a gun in your hand.

1012
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:09,288
Who's a survivor now?

1013
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:14,042
We put bullets in our head
and walk to the fucking hospital.

1014
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:15,752
We're soldiers!

1015
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:18,714
Nettles, what's our 20?

1016
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:22,092
I can follow your boy's chopper.
I locked into its frequency.

1017
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:37,900
Fence is hot!

1018
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:58,921
What do you say, buddy?

1019
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:01,423
You think you can get us in there?

1020
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:04,218
Because I'm not sure that you can.

1021
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,136
Nice reverse psychology.

1022
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:07,930
I can do that, too.

1023
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:09,640
Don't go fuck yourself.

1024
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,311
That's good. Come on.

1025
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:17,064
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1026
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:18,065
Right on.

1027
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,775
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1028
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:20,984
Been trying to figure out

1029
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:23,445
what these bird-chirping motherfuckers
been saying since '87.

1030
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:26,865
Gave the Harvard School of Linguistics
a billion-dollar grant.

1031
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:27,950
Voila.

1032
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,326
Watch your step, come on.

1033
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:43,966
Goddamn, kid,
I don't know where you get it from.

1034
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:14,746
Put the translator into the mainframe.
Download everything.

1035
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:22,671
What the hell's inside there?

1036
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:25,883
It's property of Project Stargazer.
That's what the fuck it is.

1037
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,930
Code three. Code three.
We have motion at the south fence line.

1038
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:33,849
Send a fireteam to check it out.

1039
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:36,185
That's my dad.
He's gonna come save me now.

1040
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:37,686
Oh, is he?

1041
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:40,105
Is that what he's gonna do?

1042
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,524
I'll tell you what, buddy...

1043
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:44,735
if it is your daddy,

1044
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,945
and I truly hope that it is,

1045
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:52,367
he's gotta be just about
the dumbest motherfucker I've ever met.

1046
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,915
I mean, a Ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1047
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,333
He's gotta be...

1048
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:02,419
creating a diversion.

1049
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:03,712
It's a fucking diversion.

1050
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:06,256
Oh, shit!

1051
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:08,050
Wow. Howdy.

1052
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,260
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1053
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,304
You took my boy, so yeah.

1054
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:14,264
Told you.

1055
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:16,350
Take this, son.

1056
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:19,353
You outta your mind?
We literally have you surrounded.

1057
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,855
That's why you're coming with me.
I just want the boy. Nobody's got to die.

1058
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,357
Dad?

1059
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:26,818
From here forward.

1060
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:28,403
Don't look at the dead guy.

1061
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:50,217
That was pretty good.

1062
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,677
You all right? Did I get you?

1063
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:52,719
No, I'm good.

1064
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:54,721
Welcome back.

1065
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,139
Fuck you. I never left.

1066
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:00,143
You open your mouth,

1067
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,979
I'm gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1068
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,397
Come on, just get behind me.

1069
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:06,024
All units. They got Traeger.
They got Traeger.

1070
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,111
Let's go. Let's go.

1071
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,363
Just tell them to put the guns down.

1072
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:22,124
Tell them!

1073
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,920
If Captain McKenna doesn't
lower his weapon in the next 10 seconds

1074
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,672
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1075
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:29,965
That's a really bad idea.

1076
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:32,676
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1077
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,595
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1078
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:35,512
Ten.

1079
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,723
Nine.

1080
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:39,641
Eight.

1081
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:41,810
Seven.

1082
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:43,395
Come on,

1083
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:45,439
-you just give the fucking word, man.
-Six. Five.

1084
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:02,372
Oh, shit!

1085
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:05,375
Come on, son!

1086
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,754
Take them down!

1087
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,011
Get down, sir.

1088
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:17,596
Let's go, son. Go!

1089
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:18,722
Come on.

1090
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:25,812
Okay, take this.

1091
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:30,400
You wanna vanish, you really vanish, son,
you understand?

1092
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:33,070
All right, we're going home.
I promise you.

1093
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:43,997
It's here.

1094
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:52,214
No! No! No!

1095
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,972
Come on, go around the end there!

1096
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:01,723
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1097
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,058
Move, move, move!

1098
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,476
-You got him?
-Yeah!

1099
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:17,364
Stay back.

1100
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:18,907
Get down! Get down!

1101
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:24,621
Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1102
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,859
All right.

1103
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,027
Hey, McKenna.

1104
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,988
Be reasonable.
There's six of you, seven of us.

1105
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:01,200
Fuck!

1106
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:02,534
Who taught you math?

1107
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,953
You ain't the only fucking sniper,
white boy.

1108
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:09,124
You can walk away from this, Captain.

1109
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,251
I just want the ship.

1110
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,503
Dad, he's lying.

1111
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:13,504
Yeah.

1112
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:15,839
McKenna! I don't like this.

1113
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:17,466
What's he doing in there?

1114
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,938
It's using the translator.

1115
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,693
Hello. I have enjoyed
watching you kill each other.

1116
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,613
I came here to destroy this vessel.

1117
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:41,532
You cannot have it.

1118
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:44,159
What you can do is run.

1119
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,704
I detect one among you
who is a true warrior.

1120
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:49,581
The one called McKenna.

1121
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,418
He will be your leader.

1122
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:55,337
He will be my prize.

1123
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,548
I offer time advantage.

1124
01:19:58,549 --> 01:19:59,424
Go.

1125
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:01,635
What the fuck is time advantage?

1126
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:02,845
Like a head start?

1127
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:07,599
I wanna wake up on a bus.

1128
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:10,060
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1129
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:14,064
Hey!

1130
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:15,399
I'm coming out!

1131
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:26,076
We're in.

1132
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:28,495
-Baxley!
-Shit!

1133
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:30,414
Watch where the fuck you're
throwing, dickhead.

1134
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:31,915
Will do.

1135
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,377
Okay, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1136
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:36,879
-McKenna's the one he wants.
-No, no, no!

1137
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:39,506
We stay together,
or it'll take us one by one.

1138
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,966
He's right. It's their MO.

1139
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,134
Grow a dick, will you?

1140
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:43,177
Nothing's starting!

1141
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:45,304
Son of a bitch.
He must have hacked the vehicles.

1142
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,681
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1143
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:48,724
-Got you.
-Hey?

1144
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:50,893
When this is over, you and me,
we're gonna dance.

1145
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,644
-I got my shoes all picked out.
-All right.

1146
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:02,905
-Fuck.
-No, no, no! Don't.

1147
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,699
Here, boy. Fetch.

1148
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:08,368
Here, boy.

1149
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,411
Here you go.

1150
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:13,707
That was a valuable weapon.

1151
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,503
Let's go. He'll be coming for us.

1152
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,709
Give me the goody bag.

1153
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:00,796
Hey.

1154
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:03,006
On Halloween, this blew up a whole house.
How do you shoot it?

1155
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:05,759
You don't. It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1156
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:07,386
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1157
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:17,104
I heard something.

1158
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,814
Hey, man. That's Predator technology.

1159
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:21,608
Fuck.

1160
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,277
That-- It's gonna come back.

1161
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,070
You got a catcher on the wrist.

1162
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:26,780
That's gonna come back.

1163
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:29,324
No!

1164
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:32,327
Quiet. Quiet.

1165
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,038
-Let me see. Let me see.
-My fucking hand.

1166
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,248
-Shit.
-My fucking hand.

1167
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:39,918
Gotta be quiet.

1168
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,897
Moving!

1169
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,123
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1170
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:20,709
There's a clearing up ahead.

1171
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:23,420
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1172
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,172
Let's find it
and trap the motherfucker.

1173
01:23:25,214 --> 01:23:26,131
You guys go set it up.

1174
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,674
We'll lure him in.

1175
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,676
-Who?
-You and me.

1176
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:30,594
Yeah? All right.

1177
01:23:30,928 --> 01:23:32,471
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1178
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:34,473
Come on.

1179
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:39,311
Can I talk to you for a second?
What's this "we" shit?

1180
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,271
What, are you gonna live forever, Coyle?
Just calm down.

1181
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:42,272
Calm down?

1182
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:45,108
Me, calm down?
Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.

1183
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,152
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1184
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:11,176
Shit!

1185
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:15,055
Okay, fuck this.

1186
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,808
Hey! Asshole!

1187
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:19,351
What the fuck was that?

1188
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:20,894
It's a chance for you to survive.

1189
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:23,146
Go! I got this.

1190
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:25,399
That's the stupidest fucking thing
I've ever heard.

1191
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,532
Come and get us, asshole!

1192
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:36,618
Contact!

1193
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,536
-Alien!
-Contact!

1194
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:41,707
-Contact!
-Alien!

1195
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:42,749
-Contact!
-He's coming!

1196
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:50,382
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1197
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,733
Light him up!

1198
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:05,999
Coyle!

1199
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:08,585
Bax, no!

1200
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:16,009
Traeger!

1201
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,560
Baxley!

1202
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:25,602
Die!

1203
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,707
Oh, shit.

1204
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:47,708
Fuck.

1205
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:11,523
Move, move!

1206
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,655
-Nettles!
-Let's go!

1207
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:26,663
McKenna.

1208
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,542
Rory.

1209
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:32,419
I love you.

1210
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:34,713
Hey! I'm the one you want.

1211
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:36,798
Right here!
Come on!

1212
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,843
Dad!

1213
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:40,886
No!

1214
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:45,974
Dad!

1215
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:58,028
-No! No! No!
-McKenna.

1216
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:00,531
No! No!

1217
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:02,616
I hate you, you stupid fucking...

1218
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:04,368
No! No!

1219
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:06,745
He said he wanted me.

1220
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,372
He said he wanted me!

1221
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:10,666
No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1222
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,335
The next step in the evolutionary chain.

1223
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:15,629
Not you. Your son.

1224
01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:34,189
Yo, he's taking off.

1225
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:42,281
No!

1226
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,076
Come on, man.

1227
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,828
Come on. Come on.

1228
01:28:58,505 --> 01:28:59,631
Let's take it down!

1229
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:01,091
Come on!

1230
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:20,277
Hang on!

1231
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,158
Fuck! Nebraska!

1232
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:44,843
I got you!

1233
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:55,437
Dad, there's a force field coming online.
Look out!

1234
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:01,527
Guys! Something's coming!

1235
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:04,988
Go!

1236
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:13,622
Netty!

1237
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:18,919
Fuck!

1238
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,463
Netty!

1239
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:32,349
Hey, hey, hey.

1240
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:33,892
No, no, no! Bro!

1241
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:35,894
Bro.

1242
01:30:44,403 --> 01:30:45,362
No.

1243
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:55,747
Fuck!

1244
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:53,699
Shit!

1245
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:01,623
Rory!

1246
01:33:58,931 --> 01:33:59,973
Toss it!

1247
01:34:54,152 --> 01:34:55,153
What are you?

1248
01:34:57,406 --> 01:34:58,490
Shut the fuck up.

1249
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:20,137
My unit.

1250
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:23,891
Nettles.

1251
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:27,352
Coyle.

1252
01:35:30,022 --> 01:35:31,607
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1253
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:36,195
Baxley had this the whole time.

1254
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:40,949
Nebraska's bad habit.

1255
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:43,535
Son...

1256
01:35:43,994 --> 01:35:45,954
these are the ones
that no one's gonna remember.

1257
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:48,457
Just us.

1258
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,959
What do you say
we put them to rest?

1259
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:36,171
Captain McKenna.

1260
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:40,384
Hiroshi Yamada.

1261
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:42,344
-Sir.
-First things first.

1262
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,763
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1263
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:45,889
He loves it here.

1264
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:47,975
Yeah, he's something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1265
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:50,018
Well, I assume that you know by now...

1266
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:53,105
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1267
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:55,232
-He brought something.
-Exactly.

1268
01:36:55,274 --> 01:36:56,567
Now, you want to hear the good news?

1269
01:36:58,026 --> 01:36:59,236
The cargo survived.

1270
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:01,822
With some sort of fail-safe.

1271
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,866
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1272
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:05,450
a pod escaped.

1273
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:06,952
Jettisoned. Saved itself.

1274
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:11,623
It seems that our boy
wasn't taking any chances.

1275
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,251
He wanted us to have this.

1276
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,975
What is it again you do here, exactly?

1277
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:33,270
He's the world's number one authority
on cybernetics.

1278
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:36,565
Hey, kiddo.

1279
01:37:39,276 --> 01:37:40,360
Pretty cool, huh?

1280
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:41,778
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1281
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,197
I'll make sure to tell Mom.

1282
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:48,118
So, this is his gift to humankind?

1283
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:06,094
-Get back!
-Look out!

1284
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:07,513
Everyone, stand back!

1285
01:38:07,554 --> 01:38:08,764
Everyone, stand back!
Clear the area!

1286
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:16,980
Dad, the pod sent me a message.

1287
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:21,735
-Rory, what's in that pod?
-Don't know!

1288
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:24,821
Wow... Oh, shit!

1289
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:26,573
-It's got a name!
-Name? What name?

1290
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:28,575
I guess you'd call it...

1291
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,285
the Predator Killer.

1292
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:32,621
-Get him out of here!
-Come with me. Let's go.

1293
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:36,041
Get back. Clear the area.

1294
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,084
Eyes on it.

1295
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:11,159
Whatever it is, it appears to be dormant.

1296
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:13,328
I assume it needs to be...

1297
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:16,790
Eyes on. Keep your weapons trained.

1298
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:18,125
Get it off!

1299
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:19,585
Get it off me!

1300
01:39:52,743 --> 01:39:54,036
What the hell is that?

1301
01:39:54,494 --> 01:39:56,121
That's my new suit, bubba.

1302
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:00,083
I hope they got it in a 42 long.
