1
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,947
<i>Fuck.</i>

2
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,121
<i>What is an adult?</i>

3
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,356
<i>Becomin' one</i>
<i>didn't suddenly transform me</i>

4
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,761
<i>into anything outstanding</i>
<i>or significant.</i>

5
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,596
<i>I am 18 and</i>
<i>entirely unremarkable.</i>

6
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

7
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,701
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

8
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:04,337
<i>In this tomb of a house</i>
<i>left to me</i>

9
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,739
<i>by my brilliant</i>
<i>and selfish parents.</i>

10
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,243
<i>They're not dead...</i>

11
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,911
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

12
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,613
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

13
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:17,985
<i>Literature is my solace</i>
<i>in the solitude.</i>

14
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,521
<i>And writing is my only means</i>
<i>of escape.</i>

15
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,524
<i>Because, you see...</i>

16
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,860
<i>I've never left the edges</i>
<i>of this town.</i>

17
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,930
<i>It's positively gothic,</i>
<i>really.</i>

18
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,503
<i>the interminable boredom</i>
<i>of her small village.</i>

20
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,840
<i>Lonely girl longs</i>
<i>to be meaningful.</i>

21
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:41,676
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

22
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:44,746
<i>Books make longing</i>
<i>seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

23
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:46,648
<i>It's greedy.</i>

24
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:49,318
<i>And I wear longing</i>
<i>like a fucking veil.</i>

25
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,472
<i>But today?</i>

26
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,707
<i>Today comes with</i>
<i>something new.</i>

27
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,509
<i>Something surprising.</i>

28
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,680
<i>Today I meet a writer,</i>
<i>like me.</i>

29
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,683
<i>A teacher.</i>

30
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,352
<i>One who somehow</i>
<i>found inspiration</i>

31
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,022
<i>in a place like this.</i>

32
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,257
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

33
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,731
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:36,567
<i>I suppose even graveyards</i>
<i>grow flowers.</i>

35
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:08,202
Good morning.

36
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,638
Morning.

37
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,110
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

38
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,279
I know. I don't like crowds.

39
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,612
Uh-uh...

40
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,017
- Do you live far?
- Close enough to walk.

41
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,119
- Oh, where's that?
- Lovell Hill?

42
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:25,822
You live in Lovell Hill?

43
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,723
- You know it?
- I just didn't think it was

44
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:30,259
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

45
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,660
Who says it is?

46
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,464
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

47
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:35,797
Wow.

48
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,468
It's enormous.

49
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:39,869
My parents are lawyers.

50
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:41,704
- Hmm, what kind?
- The expensive kind.

51
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:43,107
And you wanna be a lawyer?

52
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,275
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

53
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,509
What's your name?

54
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:47,845
Cairo Sweet.

55
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,980
- I'm Mr. Miller.
- I know.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,316
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

57
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,384
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:54,985
Uh...

59
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,821
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

60
00:04:58,356 --> 00:04:59,424
the holidays.

61
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:00,959
Got a chance to look it over?

62
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:01,893
I read it.

63
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,527
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

64
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,695
but I promise you
we'll get through it

65
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,331
as quickly as we can.

66
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,698
I read the whole list.

67
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,766
Wait, you read these?

68
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,406
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

69
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:14,540
I party hard.

70
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,710
- Winnie.
- Mm. Hmm, hmm.

71
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,479
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

72
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,613
Did you miss me?

73
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:23,149
I did not.

74
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,717
Well, that's too bad.

75
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,556
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

76
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,026
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

77
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,566
How boring.

78
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,868
Censorship is dead.

79
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,570
It can't exist
with the Internet.

80
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,704
And yet it does.

81
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,973
Do you know why?

82
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:47,308
Yeah.

83
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,177
Do you?

84
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:51,212
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

85
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:53,747
Not limitation.

86
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,316
Oh.
Excuse me,

87
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,716
but what's that you say?

88
00:05:56,816 --> 00:06:01,023
You want
a chicken biscuit

89
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,459
and a Coke?

90
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:06,061
Mm. Well, you heard the boss.

91
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:09,465
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

92
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,266
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

93
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,601
No, thank you, Cairo.

94
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,803
Sweet of you to ask.

95
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,673
I see
what you did there.

96
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,608
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

97
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,944
Not.

98
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:22,479
Good one.

99
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,914
Like we've never heard
that before.

100
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,262
Jesus.

101
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,905
My God.

102
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:56,982
What you reading?

103
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,185
- Uh, nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothin'.

104
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,253
It's a student's.

105
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,355
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

106
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,523
How do you know it's a girl?

107
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,258
Oh, boys are too lazy
to read porn.

108
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,425
How do you know it's porn?

109
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,763
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

110
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,898
"She leaps off the couch

111
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,965
- "and pushes herself..."
- Boris.

112
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,500
"between the girl and me.

113
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,638
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

114
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,972
- "that I can't move."
- Give me that.

115
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,407
- "Marcelle stretches..."
- Ok.

116
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,476
- "her tiny split fig."
- That's quite enough...

117
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,777
- All right.
- of your elocution...

118
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,512
- And test tomorrow, kids.
- I think.

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,980
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,548
- This coffee for me?
- Biscuit, too.

121
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,185
One of yours?

122
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,619
Oh, yeah,
that's one of yours.

123
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,687
One of mine. Exactly.

124
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,789
Christ!

125
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,124
I don't know what
you're doing,

126
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,392
- but it's some...
- Oh, you know. Come on, now.

127
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:38,993
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

128
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,061
- Man, that's good.
- "Oh, I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

129
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,162
- "I'm so smart."
- Can you not?

130
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:42,897
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

131
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:43,965
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>
<i>-</i> Boris. Boris. Come on.

132
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,099
"I'm better than most people."

133
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,034
- Stop, please.
- Is this her diary?

134
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:47,435
Oh, what do we have here?

135
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,238
Well, well, well.

136
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,474
<i>"Apostrophes</i>
<i>and Ampersands..."</i>

137
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,912
six abysmally
romantic short stories

138
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:59,814
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

139
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,185
- She has my book?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:04,720
It would appear so.
It would also appear

141
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,022
she's the only one
who checked it out.

142
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:08,491
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

143
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:09,725
Well, you know,

144
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:10,927
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

145
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,129
No, you really can't.

146
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,165
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

147
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:16,967
They cut
the theater program.

148
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,568
But they kept you?

149
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,404
Along with
the other props, yeah.

150
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,240
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,367
- Hello, wife.
- Hello, husband.

152
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,273
Beatrice.

153
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:56,275
- What?
- Look at me.

154
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:02,749
Huh.

155
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:04,250
Red-Letter Day.

156
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,786
What, your school
finally get computers?

157
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:07,888
Better.

158
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,323
Indoor bathrooms?

159
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,691
A writer.

160
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,959
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

161
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,327
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

162
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,062
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

163
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,197
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

164
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,400
And, uh, guess what else?

165
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,501
<i>- Naked Lunch.</i>
- Mm-mm.

166
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,771
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

167
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:23,872
She...

168
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:26,107
She checked it out
of the library.

169
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,343
They carry your book
at the library?

170
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,212
Aw. Fuck.

171
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,849
<i>-A Confederacy of Dunces.</i>
<i>-</i> Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,751
Well, deep breaths.

173
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,019
Happy place.

174
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,489
My happy place
has all their heads

175
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,858
impaled on Montblanc pens.

176
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,427
Share your riches.

177
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,766
Hello, Amy.

178
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,667
What? Are you fucking joking?

179
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,135
I've been back and forth all day

180
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,339
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

181
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:56,340
what it is they want

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,275
and somehow think
they can articulate

183
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,177
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

184
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:01,278
considering how they think

185
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,880
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

186
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,683
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

187
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,185
my teeth with a baby spoon.

188
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,720
- Mm.
- They can go

189
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,724
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

190
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,659
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

191
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,751
Here now.

192
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:42,689
Cheers.

193
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:44,757
Cheers.

194
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,028
Oh, that's so good.

195
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:53,266
Hey, you ever read, uh,

196
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,468
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

197
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,972
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

198
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:00,007
I had to throw it away.

199
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:02,042
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

200
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:03,744
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-...and the cum money?

201
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:05,279
That is choice.

202
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,817
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

203
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,685
"and wipe my cock on it."

204
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,358
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

205
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:18,260
"weighted with a coin."

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,797
- I love when you do magic.
- Mm.

207
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,097
You care to reenact?

208
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:24,266
I can papier-mache you...

209
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,369
with cum and money.

210
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,872
Oh, so you're expecting

211
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,107
- a heavy load, then, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,943
A full body of work.

213
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,478
Come here.

214
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,813
Dance with me.

215
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,535
You're so beautiful.

216
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,271
Shut up.

217
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,490
Oh, for fuck's sake.

218
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:20,426
Okay.

219
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,162
Will you take care
of those dishes?

220
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,230
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,398
I'll give you a handy later.

222
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,136
It's Pushkin, Amy.

223
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:32,806
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

224
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,276
What
a terrible weekend.

225
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,144
- Mm.
- Come on,

226
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,547
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

227
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:41,883
'Cause you're a puritan.

228
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:43,083
I feel like it's my duty

229
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,852
to punish the goodness
out of you.

230
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:46,152
God, you're a sadist.

231
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,488
I'm a public school teacher.

232
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,390
- Amen to that.
- Cheers.

233
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:52,860
Ooh, mama.

234
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:58,599
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

235
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:02,503
Why don't you go see?

236
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,974
Mm-mm.
I don't go in the kudzu.

237
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,042
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

238
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:08,543
That's why it grows so fast.

239
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:37,976
Good morning.

240
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,176
You always walk through
the woods alone?

241
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,311
That's a peculiar question

242
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,479
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

243
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,148
What, what are you,
uh, listening to?

244
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:46,051
- Celine Dion.
- Really?

245
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,651
Really.

246
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,752
But why?

247
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,322
- I'm sorry.
- Because she's great.

248
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:51,791
- Oh. Hmm.
- Ignore him. Ignore him.

249
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,625
- He wept aloud openly...
- Hmm.

250
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,360
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

251
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,494
-Hmm.
-...at my bachelor party.

252
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,330
- Remember that?
- I was drunk.

253
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,464
You were disconsolate.

254
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:00,765
You are a fucking traitor.

255
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,068
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

256
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,234
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

257
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:04,804
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:06,073
Uh, want a biscuit?

259
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:07,740
- Yeah, sure.
- There you go.

260
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:16,049
- It's good.
- Yeah?

261
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,149
- Do you make these?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,551
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

263
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,419
- Why not? I don't.
- Oh, you know.

264
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,789
- You'll figure it out.
- I won't.

265
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,357
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

266
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,258
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

267
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:28,161
On that...
Take my leave.

268
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,364
I shall bid you goodbye.

269
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,531
- Ok.
- Uh, you, bad bye.

270
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,699
- Well, goodbye.
- A bad bye?

271
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,102
- Mm-hmm.
- But I love you though.

272
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,435
No, you don't.

273
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:39,841
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

274
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,813
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

275
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,999
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

276
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,467
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

277
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:07,971
I dressed up just for you.

278
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:11,042
What you want?

279
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,109
I wanna get into

280
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,177
- your physics class.
- Why?

281
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:15,245
You'd be really behind.

282
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,814
Don't you tutor?

283
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,481
You don't need lessons.

284
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,683
Then what do I need?

285
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,486
Um...

286
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:27,959
See what I can do.

287
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,260
'Preciate ya!

288
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,694
Hope so.

289
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,564
You are insane.

290
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,703
Here.

291
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,406
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

292
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,242
But you're a lesbian.

293
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:46,578
I'm an equal opportunist.

294
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,081
Mm.

295
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,548
Are you jealous?

296
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,416
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

297
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,885
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

298
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,722
Okay, chickybikky?

299
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,392
Okay.

300
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,070
So, you're a smoker now?

301
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,706
I'm smoking now.

302
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,275
No plans for it
to define me yet.

303
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,911
Where are your parents
this time?

304
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:18,745
Mumbai.

305
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,915
For how long?

306
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,783
Who knows?

307
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,052
Let me dress you up.

308
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,054
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

309
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,589
I give a fuck
about being smart.

310
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,591
You can be both.

311
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,861
What are you doin'?

312
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:35,965
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

313
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,465
into my Yale essay.

314
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,001
You dry?

315
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,402
Unqualified.

316
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,807
What's the subject?

317
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,942
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

318
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,012
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

319
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,679
Surviving the crippling ennui

320
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,015
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

321
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,116
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,517
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

323
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,585
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

324
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,021
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

325
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:59,223
I've had no achievement.

326
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:01,424
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

327
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:02,492
Boring.

328
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:05,096
- You have a 4.6 GPA.
- Boring.

329
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:06,329
And you've successfully...

330
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,397
- What?
- Well...

331
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:10,400
You've successfully, um...

332
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:12,136
Well...

333
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:13,805
Shit.

334
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:16,108
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

335
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,508
generationally wealthy gal

336
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,812
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

337
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:20,946
Fuck.

338
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,481
So...

339
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:26,751
Experience something.

340
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:27,685
Like what?

341
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,453
Something worth writing about.

342
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,260
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

343
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,629
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

344
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,564
Easy.

345
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,532
It becomes a conversation

346
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,634
about achieving emancipation

347
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:46,406
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

348
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,242
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

349
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:50,643
Haven't decided yet.

350
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:52,213
What's it to you?

351
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:53,346
Like, he's, like,

352
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,582
- twenty years older than you.
- So?

353
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,450
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

354
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,153
since the dawn of time.

355
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,792
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

356
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:06,328
What?

357
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,761
Your virginity.

358
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,697
Does it mean something to you?

359
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,534
I haven't decided yet.

360
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,104
Come to Winnie.

361
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,480
We're, like,

362
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,583
the fucking
American wet dream.

363
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:31,686
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

364
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:35,391
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

365
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,693
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

366
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,495
whose sexual standards
are mandated

367
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,932
by the shit porn he downloads.

368
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:43,100
That's deli meat.

369
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:46,837
I want a dry-aged

370
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:49,539
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

371
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:51,508
to take me to pleasure town.

372
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:54,644
Like...

373
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,214
Wagyu beef.

374
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:00,885
Hungee.

375
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:02,719
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

376
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,057
Why not?

377
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:07,960
He's fine.

378
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:11,163
He's like,
really fucking smart.

379
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,463
And he's kind.

380
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,967
Which means, as my first time,

381
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,568
he'd take his time

382
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,737
to get me all good and juiced.

383
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:21,908
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

384
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:26,346
You know,
the first time you have sex,

385
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:27,981
it's not supposed to hurt.

386
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:29,848
Right?

387
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,685
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

388
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,957
You likely won't even bleed.

389
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,894
Didn't know that.

390
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,795
That's because a woman's pain

391
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,864
is valued more
than her pleasure.

392
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,100
But that's a conversation
for another day.

393
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,234
My point...

394
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,940
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

395
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,943
I know what I'm looking for.

396
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,182
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

397
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,316
What do you mean?

398
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:03,684
I've never seen him look
at a student

399
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:05,153
the way he looks at you.

400
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,057
He sees you

401
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:09,826
even though
you hide in plain sight.

402
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:11,928
- Shut up.
- What?

403
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:12,895
- Stop!
- No.

404
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:15,398
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

405
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,966
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

406
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,869
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

407
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,604
No, you're being... Shut up.

408
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,346
I'd fuck you.

409
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,381
I know.

410
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:41,826
<i>"I was nothing</i>

411
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:43,694
<i>"but a bleached bone monument</i>
<i>beneath her.</i>

412
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,032
<i>"Human ruins</i>
<i>of a madman's love."</i>

413
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,170
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

414
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,176
<i>God, I'd give anything</i>
<i>to feel that.</i>

415
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:03,781
<i>What muse could inspire</i>
<i>this deranged yearning?</i>

416
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,993
<i>To inspire.</i>

417
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,794
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

418
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,734
<i>Could we be that</i>
<i>to each other?</i>

419
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,907
<i>What was I saying?</i>

420
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,378
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

421
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,214
<i>Feels good.</i>

422
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:35,582
<i>It feels pink.</i>

423
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:36,918
Never forget.

424
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:39,686
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

425
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,024
It's very big, it's very bold.

426
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:45,127
To us,
it might seem a little...

427
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:46,694
much.

428
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,299
If we don't stick
to the brief,

429
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,267
it gets a little bit woolly.

430
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,870
Uh, can you see me
after school, please?

431
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,442
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

432
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,277
<i>It's like a sugar cube</i>
<i>under the tongue.</i>

433
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:02,345
...a little better.

434
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:05,048
But worth persevering.

435
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,583
Colby, what?

436
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:08,218
<i>I want your attention.</i>

437
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,424
Uh, how's Bea?

438
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:15,692
She's, uh, she's Bea.

439
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,161
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

440
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:18,628
It's not.

441
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:20,297
You mean you're not.

442
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:21,966
No, she's, uh, she's occupied.

443
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,334
All right,
what time is dinner?

444
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:24,502
Seven o'clock.

445
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:26,036
And please take a shower.

446
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,171
Are you worried?

447
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:30,442
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

448
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,809
Top three worst nightmares.

449
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,579
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

450
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,581
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

451
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:38,950
Aw, cutie.

452
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:40,952
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,454
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

454
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:43,821
Check it out now.

455
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,799
- It's close, right?
- To?

456
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,002
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

457
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:57,370
- All right, man.
- Bye, Professor.

458
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,704
Love you.

459
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:14,488
Ooh!

460
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:17,091
F... Hi. Uh...

461
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,829
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

462
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:23,932
- I won't tell.
- That's generous, thank you.

463
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,700
Uh, hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

464
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,037
I'm waiting for Winnie.

465
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:31,105
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

466
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,375
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

467
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,710
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

468
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,581
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

469
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,915
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

470
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,252
What's Winnie doing?

471
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:44,486
She's applying to Vandy.

472
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,222
You would be pleased to know.

473
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,756
And are you?

474
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:50,260
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

475
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,430
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

476
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,564
Maybe.

477
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,599
From afar.

478
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,501
As it burns.

479
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,304
Like Nero.

480
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:04,875
Well, that's...

481
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:07,378
So, uh,
how far are we talkin'?

482
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:08,613
Yale far.

483
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,081
Yale far? My God!

484
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,083
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

485
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,918
and read Joan Didion or what?

486
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:15,986
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

487
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,159
You ever been to

488
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,894
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

489
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,630
No. What's that?

490
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,466
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

491
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,634
Victorian Village.

492
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,469
- What is that?
- What's...

493
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,037
What's that? It's blank.

494
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,639
Ca... How can you disdain

495
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,575
of what Tennessee has to offer

496
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,746
without conducting a thorough,
uh, cultural investigation?

497
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,247
Educated judgment.

498
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,883
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

499
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,652
Because they're bad?

500
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,857
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

501
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,092
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

502
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:53,927
Yeah.

503
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:56,664
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

504
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,198
I think you might
be surprised.

505
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,569
You wanted to see me?

506
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,071
This week's story,

507
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:08,877
uh, you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

508
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,245
I enjoyed this one.

509
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:15,250
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

510
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,052
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

511
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:23,259
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

512
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:28,397
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

513
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:31,067
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

514
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,068
"like a hypergiant star

515
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:34,703
"burning to ash.

516
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:40,110
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

517
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,479
"We are what we are.

518
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:46,116
"And all creatures must eat."

519
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,556
- Um...
- Damn. That, I mean...

520
00:25:52,657 --> 00:25:54,292
I was not expecting that.

521
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:56,394
Um...

522
00:25:58,095 --> 00:25:59,397
She's not reluctant.

523
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:01,632
She's resigned.

524
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:02,835
- To her death?
- No.

525
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,235
To the order of things.

526
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:07,071
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

527
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:09,541
- Phew. It's dark.
- It's nature.

528
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:11,043
That's true.

529
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,215
You memorized it.

530
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:17,516
Uh...

531
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:19,685
Well, I'm eidetic.

532
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,587
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

533
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,059
You are...

534
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:30,563
You're exceptionally talented.

535
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,899
- Do I get an A?
- Well, how about a jumpstart

536
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,300
on the midterm?

537
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,503
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

538
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,005
I want you to write
a short story

539
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,275
in the style
of your favorite author.

540
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,978
I think it could be
the highlight

541
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,746
of your portfolio submission

542
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:47,114
- to Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

543
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,616
- Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

544
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:50,384
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

545
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,053
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

546
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,388
Thought you would.

547
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:56,124
Good.

548
00:26:57,994 --> 00:26:59,027
I read your book.

549
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,763
Oh, God. Well, uh...

550
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:08,069
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

551
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,071
found it, uh,

552
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,609
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

553
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,810
I would call it...

554
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,513
grand and tragic.

555
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,316
Okay.

556
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,152
Romantic horror.

557
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,391
That's, uh...

558
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,694
"She was an electric white

559
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,297
"noon-shadow moon

560
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,467
"casting cold light like water

561
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,502
"over the flat earth
of my face.

562
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,572
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

563
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:43,441
"But the moon,

564
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,677
"the moon...

565
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:48,279
"I stared until I was nothing

566
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:50,648
"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.

567
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:55,153
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

568
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:01,927
Well, you memorized that,
right?

569
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,004
That was too much.
That was weird.

570
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,172
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

571
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:15,675
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

572
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,644
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

573
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,414
which felt tangible.

574
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:24,184
Like I'd touched somethin'.

575
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,356
You know,
I haven't written anything

576
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,792
- in a very long time.
- Why not?

577
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:33,127
I don't know.

578
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:34,862
Do I know?

579
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,598
Mm?

580
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,868
Uh...

581
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,602
I guess I got married.

582
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,904
Started teaching.

583
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:49,244
I don't have anything else
to say.

584
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,114
You're uninspired.

585
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:54,383
- You judging me?
- I am challenging you.

586
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,284
That's my job.

587
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,229
- Hi, Winnie.
- Oh, no.

588
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,235
- Hungee.
- I think she's hungry.

589
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:13,670
She just doesn't use
real words

590
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,837
because she's a child.

591
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,311
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

592
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:21,712
- I knew it.
- Please don't start.

593
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,314
- Don't.
- Your hair looks good.

594
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:24,315
- I will not go...
- I'm more concerned...

595
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:25,783
...gently into the good night.

596
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:27,151
- No, I know. You look fine.
- Like you have.

597
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:28,385
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

598
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:29,253
that you got two damn phones
on the table

599
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,354
like you're a rapper.

600
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,755
This one
is my professional phone.

601
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,425
And the other one...

602
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:34,759
-The other one...
-...is for selling drugs.

603
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,227
- The other one is personal.
- Oh, yeah?

604
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:37,262
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

605
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:41,000
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

606
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,701
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

607
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,337
I'm getting angry now.

608
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:47,138
- Well...
- Well, hi.

609
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:49,108
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

610
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,676
So, what is the holdup?

611
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:52,244
- A fuck-up...
- Bea. Come on.

612
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:54,246
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

613
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:57,084
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

614
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:59,251
- On me.
- Another Maker's.

615
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:00,988
Okay, you got it.

616
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:02,788
- Coach?
- Blue Moon.

617
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,524
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

618
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:06,593
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

619
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:08,997
Oh, you think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

620
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:10,597
Gets me
a better grade.

621
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:12,432
Doesn't it?

622
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:14,401
-That might be true, yeah.
-Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

623
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,004
I'm good, Winnie.

624
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,105
Designated driver.

625
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:18,505
- Oh.
- Oh, really?

626
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:19,706
- Unless you wanna do it.
- First I'm hearing of this.

627
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:23,012
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

628
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,713
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

629
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:26,915
Boring?

630
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:28,182
What? And let
my students make their grades

631
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:29,484
with scholastic merit?

632
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,818
Do you really think
I'm boring?

633
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:32,220
In a good way.

634
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,455
Like a nice pastoral.

635
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:36,358
I'll get those drinks for you.

636
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,061
Yeah. "Pastoral."

637
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,395
She just called you a field.

638
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:40,596
At best.

639
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,698
- She's cute.
- Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

640
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:43,900
And she can paint.

641
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,367
She's in my morning class.

642
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,004
Oh, is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

643
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:49,772
That's Cairo.

644
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:50,806
- Cairo?
- Yeah.

645
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,308
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

646
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:54,210
He sure did.

647
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,180
- Is she pretty?
- Is she pretty?

648
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,016
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

649
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,417
Damn. Even worse.

650
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:02,318
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

651
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:05,122
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

652
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:07,758
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

653
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,326
And it's rare as well

654
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:10,862
- to be so engaged and so...
- Hmm. I bet is is. Yes.

655
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:12,463
- So worshipped.
- So worthy.

656
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,331
- Wanna be like me.
- She, in earnest

657
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:17,069
uses words
like "vituperation."

658
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,202
Please.

659
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:19,737
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

660
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,440
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

661
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,676
Bea, she's extraordinary.

662
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,545
- Ok?
- But enjoy it while you can.

663
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:28,380
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

664
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,248
Rural education
not as romantic

665
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,483
as you thought it'd be, huh?

666
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,818
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

667
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:34,586
<i>Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

668
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,155
- That's on you, man.
- Just cool stories

669
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:37,556
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

670
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:40,359
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

671
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,794
- Oh, he's judging you.
- Yes, he is. I feel it.

672
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,262
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

673
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,564
Are too.

674
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:46,265
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

675
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,700
"without inspiring the pupil

676
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,837
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

677
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:52,772
- Horace Mann.
- Ten points to Slytherin.

678
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:53,840
That's so rich.

679
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,375
I wanted to be a teacher.

680
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:56,443
You fell back on it.

681
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:58,278
And by the way,
I love teaching.

682
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,247
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

683
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:01,883
-Hey, than what?
-Writing.

684
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:04,119
- Goddamn, Beatrice.
- What does that mean?

685
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:05,519
You don't have kids.

686
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:06,386
- You don't have kids.
- You don't have

687
00:32:06,486 --> 00:32:07,989
brain damage, right?

688
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:09,791
So, um, you stopped writing

689
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,793
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

690
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:13,963
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

691
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:15,663
I'm a writer.

692
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,265
You haven't put pen to page

693
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:19,134
since your stories got panned.

694
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:20,936
You're not a writer.

695
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:22,071
Hmm.

696
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,639
Well, okay.

697
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,342
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

698
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:27,978
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

699
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,145
It's that you don't.

700
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:32,249
You chose to be a teacher.

701
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,450
Why would I see you
as anything else?

702
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:37,988
'Cause you married a writer.

703
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,488
I did.

704
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:40,890
Didn't I?

705
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:55,006
<i>Why am I here?</i>

706
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,710
<i>It's not for the poetry,</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

707
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,616
<i>It's for the thrill</i>
<i>of something</i>

708
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:08,153
<i>that I've managed to go</i>
<i>my whole life without knowing.</i>

709
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,559
<i>An ache of anticipation</i>
<i>that you'll be here.</i>

710
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,067
<i>And it will mean something</i>
<i>that you are.</i>

711
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,905
<i>Be here.</i>

712
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,673
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

713
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,445
"Stay, illusion.

714
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:35,115
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

715
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:39,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

716
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,055
- Can I sit?
- Of course.

717
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,328
What's that you got there?

718
00:33:46,428 --> 00:33:49,297
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

719
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,132
Said the barrister's daughter.

720
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,134
Do you know
all these people?

721
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:54,435
Uh, most of them.

722
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,670
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

723
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:59,074
Like group therapy?

724
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,011
Yeah, exactly that.

725
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:05,014
- Who's that fellow?
- That's Elliot.

726
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:06,748
Three-time Ostrander winner.

727
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,617
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

728
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:10,418
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

729
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:11,720
Hmm.

730
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,622
"It is my intention
to escape you

731
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:17,593
"and leave you far behind...

732
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:21,697
"...bereft of me and aching.

733
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:24,968
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

734
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,138
"Not quite heartache.

735
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,740
"Not quite homesick.

736
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,177
"Me-shaped and filled

737
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,246
"with the remnants of stars.

738
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:39,683
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

739
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:42,220
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

740
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:46,224
"The hideous pulse,

741
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,659
"the shouting blood,

742
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,164
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

743
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:53,332
"with wanting

744
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,702
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

745
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,708
"And yet
some part of me stays.

746
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:04,643
"Some bit,

747
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,645
"some parcel,

748
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,050
"some ash left behind.

749
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,820
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

750
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,993
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

751
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,697
"But they are not me.

752
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:28,868
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

753
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:35,277
"I will never fit there
again."

754
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:45,953
What?

755
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,923
I can see.

756
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:50,993
It was really something.

757
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:53,562
Hot dog.

758
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:55,797
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

759
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:57,866
Yes, I did.

760
00:35:58,568 --> 00:35:59,935
Have more faith.

761
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,313
<i>What is the word?</i>

762
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,649
<i>It's not falling.</i>
<i>That's too stale.</i>

763
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:17,920
<i>It's more deliberate</i>
<i>than that.</i>

764
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,860
<i>It's recognition</i>
<i>of what we really are.</i>

765
00:36:25,963 --> 00:36:27,132
<i>Ghosts.</i>

766
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,136
<i>You do see me.</i>

767
00:36:33,238 --> 00:36:34,973
<i>And I see you.</i>

768
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:46,751
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

769
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,753
-Go inside.
-And miss Godot?

770
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,356
Gifts for the wallflowers.

771
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:51,924
- Oh. Ok.
- Mm. Hmm.

772
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:53,792
- Thank you.
- What's this?

773
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,096
- Coffee.
- No, no.

774
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:58,664
What's this? What is...
What's with the, uh, new look?

775
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:01,234
Thank you for this. It's,
uh... It's very generous.

776
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,170
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

777
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,971
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

778
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,007
- What flavor?
- Split fig.

779
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,143
Mm.

780
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,411
Excuse me.

781
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:11,845
- It's good.
- Come on, man.

782
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:13,181
You got
a little split fig in you?

783
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,483
- Not right now. Really?
- Caught in your throat?

784
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,584
- You know what you should do?
- What should I do?

785
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:18,920
You should make a logo
and sell these

786
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,654
to raise money for the team.

787
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:22,557
Don't laugh.

788
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,623
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

789
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:24,859
- Oh, yeah.
- He doesn't count.

790
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,627
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

791
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:28,663
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

792
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:29,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:31,099
She's really good
at that stuff.

794
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,035
- Really?
- Coach.

795
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:35,670
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

796
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,272
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

797
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:38,739
What's in it for you?

798
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,676
- What's in it for me?
- Mm-hmm.

799
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:43,546
Oh, well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

800
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,415
Connection. 5%.

801
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,886
- I'm the Biscuit Batter.
- No. Once more with pride.

802
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:53,189
-I'm the Biscuit Batter!
-Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

803
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,224
I'm the...

804
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:55,758
I'm gonna work on that.

805
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:57,228
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

806
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,530
- Y'all coming inside?
- You go ahead.

807
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,298
All right, suit yourself.

808
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:03,334
I'll suit myself. See you now.

809
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:04,801
Mm.

810
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,345
Hi.

811
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,014
Hi.

812
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,818
You're sweet.

813
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:23,921
When it suits.

814
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:28,860
Please.

815
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,364
- Thank you.
- Mm.

816
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,522
What did he say
about the outfit?

817
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:57,391
He didn't have
to say anything.

818
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,261
Oh.

819
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,529
You ready? Can we go?

820
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,431
No. I need to stop
by his class.

821
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:05,866
Can I watch?

822
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:07,368
Oh, hi.

823
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:08,469
Hey.

824
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:09,803
How are you, kid?

825
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:13,541
Are you in a hurry?

826
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,311
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little, uh,

827
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:18,380
weekend vacation with my wife.

828
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:22,585
What do writers
do on vacation?

829
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:23,686
Uh, excuse me.

830
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:26,721
Um, well,
they pretend to write

831
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,390
someplace else, I guess.

832
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,760
Uh, can we talk about
the midterm?

833
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,129
Uh, sure, what's on your mind?

834
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,232
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

835
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,600
Okay. Who is it?

836
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,101
Henry Miller.

837
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,803
Provocative and,
uh...

838
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:43,273
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

839
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:45,910
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

840
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,178
You know, his decadence,

841
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:50,014
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

842
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:52,049
his, um,
destruction of convention.

843
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:54,418
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

844
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,991
- Do you not think I can do it?
- Look,

845
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:02,860
Miller is public enemy
number one

846
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,029
with the censors.

847
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:06,164
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

848
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:08,966
So?

849
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:13,605
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

850
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:19,312
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

851
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:22,315
Okay.

852
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:24,050
Okay, yes?

853
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,085
Okay, I trust you.

854
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,554
Write what you know,
little ghost.

855
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,529
Damn, I gotta go. Uh...

856
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:37,998
Do me a favor.

857
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:40,467
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

858
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,169
Take a recess.

859
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:44,705
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

860
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,740
Uh, listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

861
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,075
Bye, Winnie.

862
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,414
Don't do that.

863
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:55,150
Don't look at me like that.

864
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:00,054
Hmm...

865
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:02,157
"Oh..."

866
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,327
No, I never did that.

867
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,128
Stop.

868
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:09,365
Wait, Winnie, don't...

869
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,934
"Oh, Mr. Miller,

870
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:16,505
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

871
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:19,141
"and breakin' all the rules!"

872
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:20,444
Okay, enough, enough.

873
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,145
You need to get off his desk.

874
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,846
I did not say it like that.

875
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,282
Oh, but you meant it
like that.

876
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,417
-No, I didn't.
-You're seducin' him,

877
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,319
you floozy.

878
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:31,488
We make a good double team.

879
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,523
Hi.

880
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:34,991
Am I interruptin'?

881
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,028
- We were just leavin'.
- Where's Jon?

882
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,796
Uh, where's Mr. Miller?

883
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,931
He left.

884
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,367
Shoot.
Oh, while I have you. Cairo.

885
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,402
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

886
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,336
And, uh, Winnie...

887
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,538
- I'd like your help too.
- With what?

888
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,740
Well, can you keep the secret?

889
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,807
Sure can.

890
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:50,908
I bake biscuits.

891
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,144
He's gonna have
the baseball team

892
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,412

893
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,681
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

894
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:57,182
I think that's really cool.

895
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,418
- Really?
- I'd love to help.

896
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,919
Cool. All right.

897
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,187
I'll call you guys out
on your lunch period.

898
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:03,455
We can go over the specs.

899
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,390
Hey, um...

900
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,427
I think it'd be easier

901
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:09,763
if you just gave me
your phone.

902
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,432
I could text you the specs.

903
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,033
It'd be faster that way.

904
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,302
Okay.

905
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:17,670
Great.

906
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,174
Hey, can you call me?

907
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,878
Mm. Mm-hmm.

908
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,413
And now
you'll have Cairo's number.

909
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,048
Oh, good.

910
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,518
There is no reception
in here.

911
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:31,886
- Shit.
- Cairo, it's probably

912
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,454
just at the bottom
of your bag.

913
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,556
No, I just had it
a minute ago.

914
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,324
Well, it's Friday,

915
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,561

916
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:41,229

917
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:46,501
Oh, uh, Winnie?

918
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:48,403
Uh, Boris?

919
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:52,340
- My phone.
- My phone.

920
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,677
- Your phone.
- Your phone?

921
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:57,713
Your phone!

922
00:42:57,813 --> 00:43:00,850
-Right. Sorry. Okay.
-Oh, okay. Okay.

923
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,885
- Well, that was my...
- Ah.

924
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,125
Baby, I'm gonna need
a few more minutes, all right?

925
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:12,296
Okay. Well, we were supposed
to leave 40 minutes ago.

926
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:13,730
I know.

927
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,266
If Amy did her fucking job...

928
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:17,834
...we could've left yesterday.

929
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:25,877
It's just not enough, Amy.

930
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:27,211
What the f...?

931
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:30,782
Yes, I'll hold.

932
00:43:30,882 --> 00:43:32,650
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

933
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,785
You have my phone.

934
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,588
<i>And whose phone</i>
<i>do I have?</i>

935
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:37,722
Cairo Sweet's.

936
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,857
Cairo. It's, uh...

937
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:42,795
It's Jon... It's Mr. Miller.

938
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:47,833
- Sticky fingers, Miller.
<i>- Uh...</i>

939
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,702
Uh, how are you?

940
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:51,070
I'm tethered to a landline.

941
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,838
<i>- Are you already gone?</i>
- Uh, well, should be.

942
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:54,874
I don't give
a flying backwards fuck, Amy.

943
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:55,976
Just give 'em the first draft.

944
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:57,577
- Hang on.
- They'll think it's new.

945
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,246
Honey. Honey,
I've, I've gotta drop

946
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,447

at a student's house.

947
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:01,848
All right, take care of it.

948
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:03,250
Oh, get me some tampons
while you're out, all right?

949
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,484
- Yeah.
- Organic ones,

950
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:05,752
- if you can find 'em.
- Mm-hmm.

951
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,587
Not you obviously, Amy. Fuck.

952
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,455
Get me a better deal,

953
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:09,789

you can plug my pussy.

00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,598
I'm still here.

957
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:20,969
You at Lovell Hill right now?

958
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:22,303
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Ok.

959
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:24,472
Well, I'll drop it off
before we leave,

960
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:25,806

962

No.

00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:13,238
<i>- "that will never heal."</i>
<i>- "The serpent's apple."</i>

1065
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,973
<i>"Her cul was slick</i>
<i>against his fingers."</i>

1066
00:52:15,073 --> 00:52:16,408
<i>"Just as he imagined</i>

1067
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,608
<i>"Maybe in</i>

1068
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,943
<i>"Her own fingers</i>

1069
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:19,844
<i>"Trying to rub out</i>

1070
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:21,080

00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:27,086

1075
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,255
<i>"He would fill her up</i>

1076
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:20,908
Good morning.

1077
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,484
Are you okay?

1078
00:53:32,188 --> 00:53:33,223
What's wrong?

1079
00:53:37,493 --> 00:53:39,196
Your story.

1080
00:53:39,597 --> 00:53:41,265
Oh.

1081
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:43,234
You didn't like it?

1082
00:53:45,868 --> 00:53:47,971
You have to choose
another author.

1083
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:51,375
Why?

1084
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,011
This is inappropriate.

1085
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,747
"Inappropriate."

1086
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,083
What does that mean?

1087
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:00,751
Why did you write this?

1088
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:02,287
- You asked me to.
- Uh-huh.

1089
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:05,056
Okay.

1090
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:06,690
Why did you choose
that material?

1091
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,593
You said,
"Write what you know."

1092
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:10,529
And this is what you know?

1093
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,164
This is...

1094
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:15,067
us.

1095
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:16,569
No.

1096
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:18,371
This is... This is you.

1097
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:19,871
I don't...

1098
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:21,574
I don't understand this.

1099
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:23,376
Are you being serious?

1100
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:25,412
Okay. It's...

1101
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,448
It's about two like people
abnegating social convention.

1102
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:31,652
You know, it's commentary

1103
00:54:31,752 --> 00:54:33,053
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

1104
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,322
that's super saturated
with pornography.

1105
00:54:35,422 --> 00:54:38,525
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

1106
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,460
on young people's
expectations.

1107
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,964
It's about
inexorable attraction.

1108
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,468
It's layered.

1109
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:49,103
- This is pornography.
- Yes.

1110
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,005
So put it in your diary,
not on my fuckin' desk.

1111
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:55,143
Write a new story
with a new author.

1112
00:54:55,842 --> 00:55:00,082
I'm not gonna indulge this.

1113
00:55:00,182 --> 00:55:02,184
Are you talking about
the story or us?

1114
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:03,818
Both.

1115
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,291
You already have.
You inspired it.

1116
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:12,595
I can't accept it.

1117
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:16,199
But you can't or you won't?

1118
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:21,538
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

1119
00:55:21,638 --> 00:55:22,639
-Hey. Hey.
-...and it looks like

1120
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,107
you're measurin'.

1121
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:27,611
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

1122
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:29,380
- and say what you mean.
- Rewrite it.

1123
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,448
Why?

1124
00:55:30,548 --> 00:55:32,849
- You know why.
- Tell me.

1125
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:34,318
- Say it.
- If you don't rewrite this,

1126
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:35,752
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

1127
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:37,288
- Tell me why.
- I don't have to tell you

1128
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:38,422
a goddamn thing.

1129
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:44,463
It made you feel something
that scared you.

1130
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:46,931
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Then say them yourself.

1131
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,301
Tell me what it made you feel.

1132
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:51,970
Incredibly foolish

1133
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,173
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

1134
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,445
What was I before you read it?

1135
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:11,324
A student.

1136
00:56:13,793 --> 00:56:15,062
You built the world.

1137
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:19,600
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

1138
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,235
but in real life.

1139
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:25,172
You can't blur the lines

1140
00:56:25,272 --> 00:56:26,573
and then expect me to see
a boundary

1141
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:27,674
when I suddenly cross it.

1142
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:33,648
Let me be very, very clear...

1143
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:36,950
...with you.

1144
00:56:39,788 --> 00:56:41,021
You're my student.

1145
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:43,358
And I'm your teacher.

1146
00:56:45,427 --> 00:56:46,462
That's all.

1147
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:50,299
Any misconception of that
is something,

1148
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:52,967
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

1149
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:55,337
alone.

1150
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:30,974
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

1151
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:34,580
Yeah, I know what I said.

1152
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,415
You don't know anything
you say.

1153
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:44,989
- This is good.
- Mm-hmm.

1154
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:47,426
And you know it is.

1155
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:53,233
So, let's examine
the real issue.

1156
00:57:56,236 --> 00:57:57,570
It's not my writing.

1157
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,674
It's yours.

1158
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:05,479
Good try.

1159
00:58:06,714 --> 00:58:08,948
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

1160
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:10,217
What?

1161
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:12,553
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

1162
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,356
Right?

1163
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:21,496
"Overreaching
without ambition."

1164
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,637
Do you know what that means?

1165
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:35,377
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

1166
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,449
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

1167
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,156
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

1168
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,693
are mediocre.

1169
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,100
You wanna fail me?

1170
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:00,571
I fucking dare you.

1171
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,442
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

1172
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,213
And you better know
what it means.

1173
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,585
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

1174
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,856
And if you're not very,
very careful

1175
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:24,597
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

1176
00:59:27,032 --> 00:59:29,001
it will devour you
until you are as small

1177
00:59:29,101 --> 00:59:30,402
as you pretend to be.

1178
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,674
And you will disappear.

1179
00:59:39,846 --> 00:59:41,414
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

1180
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:43,483
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

1181
00:59:54,227 --> 00:59:56,230
How disappointin' you must be

1182
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,232
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

1183
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,808
No wonder you're here.

1184
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:26,896
<i>Heartbreak is</i>
<i>a slow-motion car crash</i>

1185
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:28,765
<i>set to Mozart.</i>

1186
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:31,601
<i>You know the one.</i> The Requiem.

1187
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,708
<i>It tastes like graveyard dirt.</i>

1188
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,849
<i>It smells</i>
<i>like burnin' flowers.</i>

1189
01:00:51,122 --> 01:00:52,756
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

1190
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:28,394
How you doin', Professor?

1191
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:30,731
Had a bad day.

1192
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:45,379
- Oh, you want a drink?
- Thank you.

1193
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:53,387
What?
So, he was offended?

1194
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:55,690
He was affected.

1195
01:01:57,925 --> 01:01:59,026
Are you still into him?

1196
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:06,468
He's a pretender.

1197
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:11,507
You know, at least what

1198
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:12,675
you see with Boris
is what you get.

1199
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:15,544
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

1200
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:20,283
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

1201
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:21,851
and gas station sushi.

1202
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:26,823
Aren't you in love with him?

1203
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,594
Mm.

1204
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:37,301
What happened?

1205
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:44,642
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

1206
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:46,677
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

1207
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:48,814
Was it with her?

1208
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:50,882
Your acolyte?

1209
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:55,821
She drafted something

1210
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:59,424
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

1211
01:02:59,524 --> 01:03:01,560
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

1212
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,328
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

1213
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:06,100
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

1214
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,700
not his subject matter.

1215
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,835
Oh.

1216
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:11,637
What's the subject matter?

1217
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:13,339
An English teacher
and a student

1218
01:03:13,439 --> 01:03:17,276
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

1219
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,578
- and "cherry popping."
- Oh.

1220
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:20,447
Those words exactly.

1221
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,382
Show me right now.

1222
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:24,485
Don't...

1223
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:28,355
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

1224
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,960
You fuck Fillmore yet?

1225
01:03:35,964 --> 01:03:37,532
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

1226
01:03:37,632 --> 01:03:39,434
I tell you everything.

1227
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:47,742
<i>"For Jonathan.</i>

1228
01:03:47,842 --> 01:03:49,644
"Love, Cairo."

1229
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:55,018
Baby, it's a love letter.

1230
01:03:55,118 --> 01:03:56,719
She's got it bad.

1231
01:03:56,819 --> 01:03:58,587
Tell me how she describes you.

1232
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:00,322
- You can read it right there.
- No.

1233
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:02,391
You tell me.

1234
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:06,028
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

1235
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,033
And I want you
to do the thing.

1236
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:10,167
No. No.

1237
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:13,837
Tell me.

1238
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,409
Uh...

1239
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:21,411
-"Mr. Murphy...
-Oh.

1240
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:25,983
"...clever
and carelessly attractive...

"kept his thoughts to himself,
and his eyes at half-mast."

1242
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:33,457
Distract me.

1243
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:36,661
What would the lady have?

1244
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:39,132
<i>"One might assume</i>

01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:46,039
<i>"vague institutional ennui."</i>

1247
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:47,439
Text Boris.

Are they?

1257
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:21,242
Are all cunts equal?

1258
01:05:21,942 --> 01:05:24,578
Or are some cunts...

1259
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:28,783
remarkable?

1260
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,453
Come on, you're, you're,
you're drunk.

1261
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,588
I'm indecent.

1262
01:05:39,794 --> 01:05:41,064
Yeah, tell him

1263
01:05:41,164 --> 01:05:42,199
you're drunk textin' him.

1264
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:44,700
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

1265
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,702
and what
you might be doin' drunkenly.

1266
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:48,238
Serious?

1267
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:50,606
Ask him what he's up to.

1268
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,814
Oh, we've got company.

1269
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,650
-They what?
-Hey, seriously.

1270
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,785
Stop leaving
this door unlocked.

1271
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:04,421
For your own safety, okay?

1272
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:05,722
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello.

1273
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,262
Get a room!

1274
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:12,597
What up, player?

1275
01:06:12,697 --> 01:06:14,532
- Slang? Get out.
- Fuck.

1276
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:16,567
Do you think he likes me?

1277
01:06:18,002 --> 01:06:20,738
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

1278
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,511
'Cause those are very
different things

1279
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:27,913
for girls who look like you.

1280
01:06:29,516 --> 01:06:31,117
I want both.

1281
01:06:41,827 --> 01:06:43,563
You should tell him
you're with me.

1282
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:48,269
And that we're doing
what all girls do

1283
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:49,403
when they're alone at night.

1284
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:52,173
Who is she?

1285
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:53,340
Not telling.

1286
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:02,616
"We are measuring
the depths of our sexuality

1287
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:05,953
"within the safe confines
of our friendship."

1288
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:08,622
Why are you so mean?

1289
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:09,824
- Goddamn.
- Can I help it

1290
01:07:09,924 --> 01:07:11,393
if every girl
you've ever dated

1291
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:13,295
owned a pair
of five-inch Lucite heels

1292
01:07:13,395 --> 01:07:14,528
and was named after
a character

1293
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:15,864
in <i>The Baby-Sitters Club?</i>

1294
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:17,100
- No, I can't.
- No. You can't.

1295
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,302
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

1296
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:20,702
Yeah, you bein' a snob.

1297
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:22,738
You and I know
Kristy was great.

1298
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,574
He hasn't said anything?

1299
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,515
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."

1300
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,016
So...

1301
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,925
Take off your shirt.

1302
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,299
What?

1303
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:50,701
- Why?
- We are gonna make out.

1304
01:07:51,503 --> 01:07:53,003
For him, not for you.

1305
01:07:56,006 --> 01:07:58,075
Well, it can be
a little for me.

1306
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,654
How is this?

1307
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:13,425
Yeah, good.

1308
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:19,332
Your turn.

1309
01:08:29,775 --> 01:08:31,010
Here ya go.

1310
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:38,084
Be a little closer
when I take this photo.

1311
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,289
Not like that. What, are you
a fucking Dutch clock?

1312
01:08:41,389 --> 01:08:42,423
I meant like this.

1313
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:45,759
Close.

1314
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:00,175
Ready?

1315
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:36,448
Send it.

1316
01:09:51,963 --> 01:09:54,267
Are you gonna text Mr. Miller?

1317
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:57,270
<i>"All warfare is based</i>

1318
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,005

1321
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:34,875
Mm-mm.

1322
01:10:39,548 --> 01:10:40,882
You got a title yet?

01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:43,218
<i>Lesser Expectations</i>

1324
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:49,991
I mean, I don't know.

1325
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:52,461
Hi, Joyce.

1326
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:53,761
- Another beer?
- Mm.

1327
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:55,298
No, I should go.

1328
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:56,566
- I should get outta here.
- Oh, come on.

1329
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,900
- Don't be boring.
- No. No.

1330
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,571
I got 45 pop quizzes
on thermodynamics

1331
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:03,240
to fail.

1332
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,108
And we haven't even gotten
to fractals yet.

1333
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,775
Goddamn hopeless youth
of America.

1334
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,511
Well, you're the one
who wanted

1335
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:09,912
to make a difference,
remember?

1336
01:11:10,012 --> 01:11:11,815
Hey, fools rush in.

1337
01:11:11,915 --> 01:11:13,484
- Where's Jonathan?
- Tithing.

1338
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:15,219
All right, well, look,
tell him I had to run.

1339
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:16,454
Bye, kiddo.

1340
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:17,588
Bye.

1341
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:25,262
Joyce got the story.

1342
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:28,899
What?

1343
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:32,903
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."

1344
01:11:34,004 --> 01:11:36,575
...written at
the top, so, you know...

1345
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:38,644
there's no mistakin'.

1346
01:11:38,744 --> 01:11:40,479
And she'd like to speak
to me formally

1347
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:42,981
about the necessary paperwork.

1348
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,884
Paperwork for what?

1349
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,388
An incident report.

1350
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:49,522
Uh...

1351
01:11:50,523 --> 01:11:51,624
I think she did it.

1352
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,993
Who did what, huh?

1353
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,165
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

1354
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,670
It's a short story, Jonathan.

1355
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:08,309
It's not
<i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>

1356
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,610
Mm-hmm. I know.

1357
01:12:13,848 --> 01:12:15,450
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...

1358
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:17,719
it's the implication.

1359
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:20,821
Why if she can convince them

1360
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,124
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...

1361
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,694
Well, I could lose my job.

1362
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:33,034
That's not all you could lose.

1363
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:47,417
Did somethin' happen
between you?

1364
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:50,687
Nothin' I invited.

1365
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:56,460
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

1366
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,629
They're full
of emotional violence

1367
01:12:59,729 --> 01:13:02,266
- and vituperation.
- Mm-hmm.

1368
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:06,437
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1369
01:13:54,855 --> 01:13:56,290
Have you seen Cairo?

1370
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,528
- I haven't.
- I haven't seen her.

1371
01:14:00,628 --> 01:14:02,095
And I just thought...

1372
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:06,234
- maybe you had.
- I haven't. No.

1373
01:14:10,972 --> 01:14:13,275
- You don't text?
- She tell you we do?

1374
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:16,244
Well, you know...

1375
01:14:18,045 --> 01:14:22,151
Cairo says everything...

1376
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:26,589
And nothing.

1377
01:14:33,129 --> 01:14:35,632
I don't understand
what's happening.

1378
01:14:39,937 --> 01:14:41,204
Don't you, Winnie?

1379
01:15:05,263 --> 01:15:08,100
How did it start?
In your own words.

1380
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,001
We recognized each other.

1381
01:15:10,101 --> 01:15:12,471
She's exceptionally talented.

1382
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:15,941
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.

1383
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:17,543
Did you exhibit favoritism?

1384
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,945
- Give special mentorship?
- Of course.

1385
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:21,080
He was excited to give me

1386
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,649
the midterm assignment
in advance.

1387
01:15:22,749 --> 01:15:24,951
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

1388
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:26,152
It's 25%.

1389
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:28,355
Enough to destroy my GPA.

1390
01:15:28,455 --> 01:15:29,856
<i>You do know</i>
<i>that Henry Miller</i>

1391
01:15:29,956 --> 01:15:30,957
<i>is not an approved author</i>

1392
01:15:31,057 --> 01:15:32,192
<i>for public school study,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1393
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:34,661
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.

1394
01:15:34,761 --> 01:15:35,829
You know that.

1395
01:15:35,929 --> 01:15:37,430
I wanted to help her
stand out.

1396
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:40,234
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

1397
01:15:41,869 --> 01:15:43,371
Have you read his work?

1398
01:15:43,471 --> 01:15:45,006
How often have you
been together

1399
01:15:45,106 --> 01:15:47,074
beyond the classroom?

1400
01:15:47,174 --> 01:15:48,576
We would see each other
before school,

1401
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:52,580
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

1402
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,017
And what would you do?

1403
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,485
We would talk about literature

1404
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:59,187
and things that
we cared about.

1405
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:01,890
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

1406
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,994
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

1407
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,062
And that, well, that...

1408
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,764
That's how it started,
I guess.

1409
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,133
Not...

1410
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:13,069
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

1411
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,773
Do you see each other
socially?

1412
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,174
Absolutely not.

1413
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:20,510
We went to
a poetry reading together.

1414
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,278
Would you consider
yourself friends?

1415
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:23,713
Without question.

1416
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,584
We are as close,

1417
01:16:26,684 --> 01:16:30,554
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

1418
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:32,122
Have you ever been
alone together

1419
01:16:32,222 --> 01:16:33,390
outside of school?

1420
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,125
Only a couple of times.

1421
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:37,194
Y... Yes, sort of.

1422
01:16:37,294 --> 01:16:40,865
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone

1423
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:44,102
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,

1424
01:16:44,202 --> 01:16:48,607
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

1425
01:16:48,707 --> 01:16:49,708
to Nashville.

1426
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:51,109
We didn't actually go,

1427
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:54,646
but, you know,
we were going to go.

1428
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:57,583
He came to my house.

1429
01:16:58,384 --> 01:16:59,618
Were you alone?

1430
01:17:03,022 --> 01:17:04,256
Yes.

1431
01:17:05,024 --> 01:17:06,559
My parents were out of town.

1432
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:07,960
What happened?

1433
01:17:10,062 --> 01:17:11,430
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

1434
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,237
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

1435
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:20,074
I returned her phone.

1436
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:21,775
Did you go inside the house?

1437
01:17:25,213 --> 01:17:27,648
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

1438
01:17:28,549 --> 01:17:29,784
When she sent the story,

1439
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:32,353
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

1440
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:43,432
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

1441
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:45,400
uh,

1442
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:47,970
to defend my position here.

1443
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:51,640
'Cause there isn't.

1444
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:02,886
Jonathan...

1445
01:18:04,654 --> 01:18:06,322
are you in love with her?

1446
01:18:10,093 --> 01:18:11,828
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

1447
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:13,963
It's not about my feelings.

1448
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:17,802
It's what she implies.

1449
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:19,603
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

1450
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:22,040
- Oh, fuck me.
- while you're sittin' there

1451
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,441
swiping through pictures

1452
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:25,009
- of naked students.
- Oh, he's so smart, everybody.

1453
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:26,144
That's why I deleted it.

1454
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,211
You deleted it.

1455
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:28,646
- Oh, good.
- No. No.

1456
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,415
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

1457
01:18:30,515 --> 01:18:32,551
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

1458
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:34,252
- Come on. Jesus.
- Oh, I'm shakin'

1459
01:18:34,352 --> 01:18:35,554
in my fuckin' boots.

1460
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:37,022
You know the difference
between you and me?

1461
01:18:38,157 --> 01:18:40,792
You cannot identify the line.

1462
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,061
So, you cross it.

1463
01:18:43,728 --> 01:18:44,730
Right.

1464
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,732
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

1465
01:18:47,867 --> 01:18:49,302
defensive.

1466
01:18:49,402 --> 01:18:51,437
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

1467
01:18:51,537 --> 01:18:52,505
You can't be serious.

1468
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:54,407
- Like you?
- Yes.

1469
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:56,242
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

1470
01:18:56,342 --> 01:18:57,744
- Mm.
- I don't cross it.

1471
01:18:57,844 --> 01:18:59,979
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

1472
01:19:01,781 --> 01:19:04,618
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

1473
01:19:04,718 --> 01:19:06,154
You don't know... Oh, man,

1474
01:19:06,254 --> 01:19:07,955
you think
you're my collateral damage?

1475
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:12,760
- All right, man. Just go, man.
- All right. No, no.

1476
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,928
- Yeah, all right. I will.
- All right, yeah.

1477
01:19:15,028 --> 01:19:16,997
- Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for your help.

1478
01:19:17,464 --> 01:19:18,466
Appreciate that.

1479
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:34,416
I've been suspended.

1480
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:40,257
Did you fuck her?

1481
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:42,225
No.

1482
01:19:42,325 --> 01:19:44,160
Then what happened?

1483
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:47,630
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

1484
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:50,500
She handed in the story,

1485
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,502
which I obviously
could not accept.

1486
01:19:52,602 --> 01:19:54,504
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

1487
01:19:54,604 --> 01:19:56,406
- That's how I understand it.
- Hm.

1488
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:57,674
So you flirted with her,

1489
01:19:57,774 --> 01:19:58,875
- and then, you rejected her.
- No,

1490
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,144
- it wasn't flirting.
- What was it then?

1491
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:01,745
It was affection!

1492
01:20:02,846 --> 01:20:05,883
Well, are you
attracted to her?

1493
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:11,555
I'll tell you.

1494
01:20:12,657 --> 01:20:16,195
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

1495
01:20:16,295 --> 01:20:17,728
who read your little book,

1496
01:20:17,828 --> 01:20:20,232
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

1497
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:23,001
You fucking fell for it.

1498
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:25,037
Finally. Finally!

1499
01:20:25,137 --> 01:20:28,407
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

1500
01:20:28,507 --> 01:20:30,310
And you can't help
but get hard for it

1501
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,643
because, what, now suddenly

1502
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,345
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

1503
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:34,446
Yes!

1504
01:20:34,546 --> 01:20:37,584
She made me feel
worth something.

1505
01:20:37,684 --> 01:20:38,985
What does that tell you?

1506
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:44,624
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

1507
01:20:44,724 --> 01:20:47,161
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

1508
01:20:47,261 --> 01:20:48,995
- Fuck you.
- Oh, be my guest.

1509
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:51,198
Stop.

1510
01:20:51,298 --> 01:20:53,033
- Did you?
- No, I didn't fuck her.

1511
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:54,202
Why do you look so guilty?

1512
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:55,337
I haven't done anything wrong.

1513
01:20:55,437 --> 01:20:58,739
Oh, didn't you?

1514
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,712
God, I'm in hell.

1515
01:21:04,812 --> 01:21:07,381
Well, make yourself at home.

1516
01:21:07,482 --> 01:21:09,185
Why are you so punishing?

1517
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:10,785
You wanted her.

1518
01:21:10,885 --> 01:21:12,754
I can read it all
in your face.

1519
01:21:12,854 --> 01:21:14,257
How can you see anything
in this state,

1520
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:15,991
you fuckin' alcoholic?

1521
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:20,196
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

1522
01:21:21,997 --> 01:21:23,099
You are a cunt.

1523
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,800
And you're a liar.

1524
01:21:25,235 --> 01:21:26,702
Liar!

1525
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,640
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

1526
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,243
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

1527
01:21:33,343 --> 01:21:36,412
like some middling
American hero.

1528
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,781
But, Jon, baby...

1529
01:21:39,783 --> 01:21:41,952
you're the villain.

1530
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:48,959
But you can't even see that,
can you?

1531
01:22:03,808 --> 01:22:05,610
Don't you worry for me at all?

1532
01:22:07,078 --> 01:22:08,780
What would I possibly
worry about

1533
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,149
other than dying of boredom

1534
01:22:10,249 --> 01:22:12,951
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

1535
01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:16,789
You...

1536
01:22:17,524 --> 01:22:18,757
are...

1537
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,261
vile.

1538
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,669
Why don't you write about it?

1539
01:22:56,664 --> 01:22:58,033
Spit it out, Winnie.

1540
01:22:59,469 --> 01:23:00,836
What are you doing?

1541
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:04,207
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

1542
01:23:06,342 --> 01:23:07,709
Is that all?

1543
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:09,278
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

1544
01:23:10,645 --> 01:23:12,647
if you wish to be
very literal.

1545
01:23:12,747 --> 01:23:15,017
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

1546
01:23:25,195 --> 01:23:27,830
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

1547
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:30,235
- Why?
- He underestimated me.

1548
01:23:31,236 --> 01:23:32,769
I overestimated him.

1549
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:34,705
Are you okay?

1550
01:23:34,805 --> 01:23:36,140
I'm inspired.

1551
01:23:38,276 --> 01:23:40,043
- That's not funny.
- It is.

1552
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:41,979
A little.

1553
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,083
- Please don't do this.
- Why?

1554
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:49,020
You're gonna ruin his life.

1555
01:23:49,555 --> 01:23:50,822
And for what?

1556
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:56,694
To avenge your rejection?

1557
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:00,400
To punish him?

1558
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:04,703
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

1559
01:24:04,803 --> 01:24:06,672
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

1560
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:08,741
Yes.

1561
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:13,746
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

1562
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:18,985
I'll testify against you.

1563
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:20,120
No, you won't.

1564
01:24:21,688 --> 01:24:23,124
Excuse me?

1565
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,892
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

1566
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,097
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

1567
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:30,964
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

1568
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:36,103
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.

1569
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,742
Oh, hey,
maybe we can double team.

1570
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:43,978
You played me.

1571
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,813
You knew what we were doing.

1572
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,517
This is not what I meant.

1573
01:24:47,617 --> 01:24:48,884
Isn't it, though?

1574
01:24:54,224 --> 01:24:56,859
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?

1575
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:59,495
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.

1576
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,365
You're right.

1577
01:25:06,403 --> 01:25:09,072
This is, to date,

1578
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:13,109
my greatest achievement.

1579
01:25:29,427 --> 01:25:30,462
"In the end,

1580
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,933
