<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b></font>

2
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,060
- I'm starting a new life.

3
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,380
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

4
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,220
And almost no one knows me.

5
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,670
Poor Jerry.

6
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,180
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

7
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,770
They say I'm cured now.

8
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,650
But I still have intrusive
thoughts.

9
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,700
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

10
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,750
People are abused all over the
world

11
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,790
every day

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,540
much worse than me

13
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,040
and they do fine.

14
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,840
- Your tail light's out, Miss.

15
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,850
- Oh, thank you for letting me
know.

16
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,430
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

17
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,600
- I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

18
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,730
- Thank you, Officer.

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,820
- You drive safely.

20
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,300
- When Jerry left me,
I devoured everything

21
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,560
I could about how to get your
man back.

22
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,020
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

23
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,650
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

24
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,950
You have to be very tricky.

25
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,790
- Elaine?

26
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,960
Hi, I'm Trish.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,790
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet
you.

28
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,710
- Oh, you're so pretty.

29
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,750
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

30
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,340
I'm married and everything.

31
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,800
- No, I didn't think anything.

32
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,050
- Well, let me help you with
your bags.

33
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Is this all you've got?

34
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
- For now.

35
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,810
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

36
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,020
- So you're an artist?

37
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
- Yes, I am.

38
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,230
- I'm an interior decorator.

39
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,310
- Oh, really?

40
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
- Yes.

41
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,950
That's how I met Barbara.

42
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,200
I decorated this apartment.

43
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,490
It was lucky I still had the
keys.

44
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,410
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

45
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,550
How do you know Barbara?

46
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,810
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

47
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,890
- Oh, really?

48
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,270
Well, I hope you like the
apartment.

49
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,240
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

50
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,280
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth Tarot deck

51
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,620
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

52
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,870
for me to hang.

53
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,910
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

54
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,790
Well, this is it.

55
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,970
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

56
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,010
It's just beautiful.

57
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,050
- Really?

58
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,640
Oh, I'm so glad.

59
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,060
I thought I may have overdone
it.

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,640
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

61
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,390
- You must be exhausted.

62
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm sure you want to lie down.

63
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,400
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,480
Do you know of a place around
here?

65
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,070
- There's the Victorian Tea
Room.

66
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,700
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

67
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,370
- Oh, how fantastic.

68
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,410
Where can I freshen up?

69
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,200
- The bedroom is through there.

70
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,200
- I'll only be a moment.

71
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,070
- What a lovely room.

72
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,870
- Yes, isn't it?

73
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,580
I love Victoriana.

74
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,750
- Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

75
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,500
- Do you have fairy
princess fantasies, Elaine?

76
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
- Of course.

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,670
We may be grown women, but
underneath

78
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,840
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

79
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,260
by a prince on a white horse.

80
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,550
- Yes, I suppose so.

81
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,720
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

82
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,440
- I don't think I've found
my Prince Charming yet,

83
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,730
but I think I found the formula.

84
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,210
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

85
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,360
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

86
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,910
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

87
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,040
Then Jerry would have never left
me.

88
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,210
- Who's Jerry?

89
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,000
- My ex-husband.

90
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,130
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

91
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,310
But then I was reborn as a
witch.

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,190
Barbara and Gahan brought me
back to life.

93
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,360
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

94
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,440
Men are like children.

95
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,070
They're very easy to please

96
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,780
as long as we give them what
they want.

97
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,780
♫ Tra la la la

98
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,120
♫ Tra la la la la di da

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,290
♫ I dreamed of a fairy
lady in a strange land

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,010
♫ She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men

101
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,520
♫ She wore a gown

102
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,600
♫ Of pink and purple roses

103
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,610
♫ It was so tra la la and so la
di da ♫

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,240
- Where were we?

105
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,490
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

106
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,410
Well, what do men want?

107
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,920
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

108
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,710
and to make them feel like a man

109
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,900
and to give them total freedom

110
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,550
in whatever they wanna do or be.

111
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,260
- But what about what we want?

112
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,890
How are we going to be equals
with men

113
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,430
if we keep catering to all of
their needs?

114
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,810
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

115
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,980
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

116
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,610
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

117
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,780
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

118
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,950
I'll admit, I used sex to get
this,

119
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,540
but I'm not proud of it.

120
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,580
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

121
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,840
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

122
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,090
I'd be a wreck.

123
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,670
- Poor Richard.

124
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,760
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

125
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,180
You have to give a man his
fantasy.

126
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,020
- His fantasy?

127
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,600
- Yes, his fantasy.

128
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,940
But what I'm really interested
in

129
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
is love.

130
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,200
You might say I'm addicted to
love.

131
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,490
I wonder if all women feel that
way?

132
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,040
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

133
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,910
A husband isn't a prince,
Elaine,

134
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,290
and life isn't a fairy tale.

135
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,340
We have to face that fact.

136
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
- Why?

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,190
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

138
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,300
if you pleased your husband
more.

139
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,050
- I don't
need to please Richard.

140
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,180
Richard loves me for myself.

141
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
- Of course.

142
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,390
Perhaps you did find your Prince
Charming.

143
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,730
- Perhaps I did.

144
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,990
- Guess who.

145
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,580
- Richard, what are you doing
here?

146
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,080
This tea room is for ladies
only.

147
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,370
- Oh, I went to visit you at
work

148
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,630
and Julie said you were here.

149
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,210
I thought we could have lunch
together.

150
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,420
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

151
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,340
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

152
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,300
Elaine, this is my husband,
Richard.

153
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,140
- I've heard so much about you,
Richard.

154
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,770
- Nothing too horrible, I hope.

155
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,060
- On the contrary.

156
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,820
- Goddess, please,

157
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,040
send me a beautiful, sweet man

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
to love me as I love him.

159
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,420
To love me, love me,

160
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
love me,

161
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,430
love me,

162
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
love me,

163
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,270
love me,

164
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
love me,

165
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
love me.

166
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,760
Hi, are you Wendy?

167
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,680
- Yes, what can I do for you?

168
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,760
- I'm Elaine.

169
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,760
We spoke on the phone.

170
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,600
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

171
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,020
- Elaine, right.

172
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,770
Thanks for coming by.

173
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,480
Mind if I have a look?

174
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
- Please do.

175
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,400
- These are nice.

176
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,410
Really nice.

177
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,160
I think these will do well in
the store.

178
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,750
- Then you'll take them?

179
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,500
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

180
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,970
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

181
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,010
Sound good?

182
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,640
- Yes, fantastic.

183
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,430
Thank you, Wendy.

184
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,680
- Sure, Elaine.

185
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,350
Bright blessings.

186
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,850
- People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

187
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,980
I tell them it's because I
want to have magical powers.

188
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,070
But it's not like it sounds.

189
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,240
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

190
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
- Hi.

191
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
- Hi.

192
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,610
- It's a beautiful day.

193
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,700
- Yes, it is.

194
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,490
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

195
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,330
- Oh, you like nature?

196
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
- Very much.

197
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,370
You seem like a nature type too.

198
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,300
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

199
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,630
- That's right.

200
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,090
How'd you know?

201
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,630
- I can just tell.

202
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,340
Nature is where your heart is.

203
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,350
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

204
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,520
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

205
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,310
- I'm talented that way.

206
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
- Well, you're right about the
city.

207
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,150
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods

208
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
about an hour from here.

209
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,740
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

210
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,370
just think and read.

211
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,120
- Do you take your wife up
there?

212
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,880
- No.

213
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm not married.

214
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,440
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

215
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,800
once in a while.

216
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,550
- I do.

217
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,390
I do, once in a while.

218
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,390
- You wanna take a girl up there
now?

219
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,060
What do you mean?

220
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,520
- Well, I'm new in town

221
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,110
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

222
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,450
I'll make you a nice dinner.

223
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,160
- Yes, okay, sure.

224
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,040
Uh, my car is right over there.

225
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
- Okay.

226
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Let's go.

227
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,430
You know what I'd like to do
right now?

228
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,600
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

229
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,520
just like we were kids.

230
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,820
- Wait, wait.

231
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,240
You want some?

232
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
- What is it?

233
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,530
- Something I made.

234
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
- Mm.

235
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,170
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

236
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
- Finish it.

237
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,900
- Oh.

238
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,070
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

239
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,030
Not here.

240
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,780
Let's go inside.

241
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,090
This is beautiful.

242
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,100
I'll start the dinner.

243
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
- Wow.

244
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,400
This looks delicious.

245
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
- To nature.

246
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,050
- This is really nice, isn't it?

247
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,590
I like to come up here a lot

248
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,220
at the end of the semester to
unwind.

249
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,600
- Are you a teacher?

250
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,310
- Yeah, I teach at the
university.

251
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,310
- Oh, what do you teach?

252
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,980
- English and French literature

253
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,730
with a focus on the 18th
century.

254
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,900
- So, you must be quite a
libertine.

255
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,070
- A libertine?

256
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,860
Why would you say that?

257
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,240
- Oh, you know.

258
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,790
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.

259
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,160
Not to mention Casanova.

260
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,790
- Well, there
were a lot of books written

261
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,460
in the 18th century.

262
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,040
- Well, is it true?

263
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,170
Are you a libertine?

264
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
- Yes I am.

265
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,510
I love women.

266
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,010
Does that bother you?

267
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,510
- On the contrary.

268
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,430
Oh, hmm,

269
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,480
I feel strange, dizzy.

270
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,990
What was in that drink you gave
me?

271
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,910
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

272
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,330
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

273
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,710
Oh, baby.

274
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,790
You are really wild.

275
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,350
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

276
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,430
- Not at all.

277
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,580
♫ La ♫

278
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,620
- What the hell?

279
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Your coat.

280
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,880
It's so bright.

281
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,210
♫ La ♫

282
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,970
- I always line my clothing.

283
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,430
- You have two selves.

284
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,060
Dark and quiet that you show the
world.

285
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,270
Who do you give that to?

286
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
The rainbow?

287
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,940
- I give the rainbow to you.

288
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,530
Right now.

289
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,870
♫ La ♫

290
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,260
♫ La la la ♫

291
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,010
- Oh.

292
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,980
- Oh.

293
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,230
♫ La la ♫

294
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
- Huh!

295
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Oh God.

296
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Oh, Elaine.

297
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,370
Look at you.

298
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,460
- You can make love to me now.

299
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,630
♫ La la la la ♫

300
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,650
- Aw, okay.

301
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,070
- What is it, Wayne?

302
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,110
What is it, baby?

303
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,450
- Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.

304
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,330
- It's all right, you're with
me, shhh.

305
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,210
- Elaine.

306
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,720
No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

307
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,550
- Life has been tough, huh?

308
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,310
- Yeah, in a way.

309
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,650
You're not like any other woman
I've met.

310
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,400
No games, no agendas.

311
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,740
You just seem to take life as it
is.

312
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,200
- Is there any other way to take
life?

313
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,950
- Well, the women I've been
with,

314
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,390
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

315
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,880
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

316
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,920
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

317
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
It's crazy.

318
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,920
- I know, baby.

319
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
I know.

320
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,060
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

321
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,560
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

322
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,940
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

323
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,530
they're never bright enough.

324
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,160
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

325
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,990
- That seems like quite a
problem.

326
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,620
- It is.

327
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,040
I feel my whole life as a loner,

328
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,000
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

329
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,970
But now I'm not so sure.

330
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,930
Oh, Elaine,

331
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,350
I have never felt real
love like this before.

332
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,190
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

333
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,770
- Oh.

334
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,860
Elaine, I'm scared.

335
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,490
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

336
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,080
I can't take it, I can't take
it.

337
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,620
Oh.

338
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,500
Elaine, I'm sick.

339
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
I'm sick.

340
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,670
- Hey, it's all right.

341
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,340
I've got you.

342
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,090
I love you.

343
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,310
And I'll always be here for you.

344
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,270
Try to get some sleep.

345
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,450
- Elaine.

346
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,910
Elaine, where are you?

347
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,410
Elaine, where are you?

348
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,710
- What a pussy.

349
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,590
What a baby.

350
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I thought I'd found a real man,

351
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,890
but he's just like a little
girl.

352
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,640
- Elaine!

353
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,950
- No one was ever there for me

354
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,140
when I was crying my heart out.

355
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,730
No one ever comforted me.

356
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
No one.

357
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,310
- Good morning, Wayne.

358
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,270
- Hi, Elaine.

359
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,400
- Here, drink this.

360
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,370
- I had such horrible dreams
last night.

361
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,420
- What did you dream about,
baby.

362
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,090
- I dreamt that I was calling
your name

363
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,000
and you didn't answer.

364
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,170
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

365
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,220
Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't
you?

366
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,850
- Of course, I love you.

367
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,020
- Oh God, oh God, Elaine.

368
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,860
- Are you hungry?

369
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,950
- I don't know what I am.

370
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,790
- Well, try to get some sleep.

371
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
- Elaine.

372
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,290
Don't leave me.

373
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,540
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

374
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,130
I'll be right here.

375
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,530
Wayne, wake up.

376
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,070
It's late.

377
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Wayne.

378
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,330
Wayne, baby, wake up.

379
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Wake up.

380
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Wayne.

381
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,540
- Tampons aren't gross.

382
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,960
Women bleed and that's a
beautiful thing.

383
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,170
Do you know that most men have
never even seen a used tampon?

384
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,310
Part of me can be with Wayne
now.

385
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Always.

386
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,110
I don't really mind death.

387
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,280
I've buried people before.

388
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,280
People I really cared about.

389
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,080
In the end we're all just
compost anyway.

390
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,580
Everything regenerates.

391
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,670
I'd like to come back as a cat.

392
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,050
I've been so depressed since my
cat died.

393
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,470
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

394
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,560
He was my best friend.

395
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,960
- I give the rainbow to you.

396
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Right now.

397
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,640
Just a minute.

398
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Oh hi Trish.

399
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Come on in.

400
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,200
- Hey, Elaine.

401
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,780
You look gorgeous.

402
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,490
I love what you've done with
your hair.

403
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,530
- Thank you.

404
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,660
What's up, honey?

405
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,010
- Well, I haven't been able to
reach you,

406
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,000
so I thought I'd come over

407
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,120
to see if everything was all
right.

408
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,170
- I'm fine.

409
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,670
Really.

410
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,710
Can I offer you something?

411
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,300
I just made some tea and cake.

412
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,130
- Just tea, thank you.

413
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,270
- Cream and sugar?

414
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,440
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

415
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,090
So, what have you been so busy
with?

416
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,250
A man, I hope.

417
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,300
- Yes, it was a man.

418
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,680
But, it didn't work out.

419
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,220
- I'm Sorry.

420
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,810
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

421
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,350
I thought that he was the one.

422
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,350
- Well, maybe next time.

423
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,360
- Are you sure you won't have
some cake?

424
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,030
- Oh, no, thank you.

425
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,780
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

426
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
- Good bye?

427
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,830
Why, where are you going?

428
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,830
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

429
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,420
- Is Richard going with you?

430
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,130
- No, it's just a business trip.

431
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,210
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

432
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,290
- Sam, give me two whiskeys on
the rocks.

433
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,840
- Sure thing, Jane.

434
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,130
Did you see the papers today?

435
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,170
- No, why?

436
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,180
- They found a body in the Eel
River.

437
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,220
- A murder?

438
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,850
- Maybe.

439
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,140
They found a symbol carved in
his chest.

440
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,730
Here.

441
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,690
- It's a pentagram.

442
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,860
- It's them witches again.

443
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,490
- That's what I was thinking
too, Lyle.

444
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,660
- So yeah, Barbara, that's
everything.

445
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,670
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

446
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,830
They couldn't prove anything.

447
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,800
They actually thought that I
killed him.

448
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,380
Can you believe it?

449
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,550
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

450
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,800
after you left.

451
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,140
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

452
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,140
- Well, it was perfect timing.

453
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,520
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to
greet you.

454
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,730
That's all right.

455
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,570
Trish has been lovely.

456
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,610
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

457
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,950
But I had this experience last
weekend

458
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,950
that really shook me up.

459
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,780
- Why, what happened?

460
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,870
- Well, I met this great-looking
guy.

461
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,250
And I used love magic on him.

462
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,830
Then he got really weird on me.

463
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,630
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

464
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,930
Then he got really

465
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
sick.

466
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,560
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

467
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,430
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

468
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,640
It was probably just too much
for him.

469
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,570
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

470
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,980
- I guess that's what it was.

471
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,070
But, I don't know.

472
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,360
- Honey, you have to be more
careful.

473
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,840
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

474
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,240
in the first place, you know.

475
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,120
- Merry Meet, Elaine.

476
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,250
- Bright blessings Gahan.

477
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,020
- I heard you discussing love
spells.

478
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,940
You do have to be careful,
Elaine.

479
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,780
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

480
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,320
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

481
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,620
What's it been now, a year?

482
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,500
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

483
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,830
Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,

484
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,460
for the blessings that we share.

485
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,710
- Blessed be, Hurrahya!

486
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,680
- Go home, witches.

487
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Go home.

488
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,680
- Just ignore them.

489
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,390
They're always giving us
trouble.

490
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,140
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

491
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,440
- Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

492
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,900
But it's not bad for a small
town.

493
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,690
Not all of them embrace our
methods

494
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,570
of practicing witchcraft.

495
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,410
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

496
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,740
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

497
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,000
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

498
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,540
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

499
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,460
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

500
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,630
And it was fun.

501
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,800
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

502
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,730
- What have you been teaching?

503
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,060
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on sigil magic

504
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,610
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

505
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,940
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

506
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,780
energy grounding,
Earth-based spirituality,

507
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,610
pagan arts and crafts,

508
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,780
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

509
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,710
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

510
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,170
- Oh, are you still teaching
that?

511
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,380
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

512
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,380
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

513
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,220
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

514
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,560
- Are you still dancing?

515
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,480
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on Amateur Night.

516
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,810
You should come.

517
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,310
- Hi, Barbara.

518
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,360
Hi, Gahan.

519
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,860
Sorry we're late.

520
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,990
- Hello lovely ladies, please
have a seat.

521
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,280
Elaine, this is Star and her
sister Moon.

522
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,330
They're our students for
tonight.

523
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,830
Girls, this is our dear friend
Elaine.

524
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:06,870
- Hi.

525
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
- Hi.

526
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,790
- I was just pointing out that
dancing

527
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,710
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

528
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,260
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

529
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,760
so you could learn about that.

530
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,930
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

531
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,140
These men would do anything for
her.

532
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,150
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

533
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,400
Then let us begin.

534
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,110
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

535
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,160
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

536
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,990
lies in her sexuality.

537
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,960
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

538
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,630
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

539
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,130
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

540
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,180
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

541
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,010
with the fear of female
sexuality.

542
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,230
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

543
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,520
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

544
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,860
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

545
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,030
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

546
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,030
never asking us what we wanted.

547
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,540
- They teach us that a
normative human being

548
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,370
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

549
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,330
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

550
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,170
that need to be cured.

551
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,800
And we believe that men
and women are different

552
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,890
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

553
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,890
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

554
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,680
our primal power as goddesses.

555
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,560
We need to teach men how to love
us

556
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,360
using ways they can understand.

557
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,480
So goddesses, use perfume,

558
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,740
wear high heels and makeup,

559
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,030
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

560
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,120
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

561
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,080
Be a mother and a lover.

562
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,380
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

563
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,470
- Use sex magic to destroy his
fear of you

564
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,050
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

565
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,770
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

566
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,310
with all of your inner beauty.

567
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,730
Then, when his heart is open to
love,

568
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,730
you may do with him what you
will.

569
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,380
- I love you, Elaine.

570
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,760
You know that, don't you?

571
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,850
I love you very much.

572
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,770
But you need to be more careful.

573
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,480
Dinner was late three times this
week.

574
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,740
And that house is a total
pigsty.

575
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,990
Do you know that I found an old
hot dog

576
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,280
under the bed this morning?

577
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,870
And why don't you ever brush
your hair?

578
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,040
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

579
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,170
I'm embarrassed to have people
over.

580
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,840
I've been really patient up
until now,

581
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,680
but you need to step up your
game.

582
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,100
- I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

583
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,850
What?

584
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,520
You're not crazy?

585
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,570
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

586
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,400
Which is it?

587
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,950
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

588
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,200
And you could lose a few pounds.

589
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,700
You're looking a little fatty.

590
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,830
- Oh my God, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

591
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,500
You have such a hot body now.

592
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,800
Do you like it when I touch you
like this?

593
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,880
Or like this?

594
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,890
I wanna make you come.

595
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,390
- Don't be frightened, Elaine.

596
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,310
I would never hurt you.

597
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,900
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

598
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,570
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

599
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,780
- Hast thou the courage to make
the essay?

600
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,950
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

601
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,850
- Assist me to erect the ancient
altar

602
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,180
at which in days past all
worshiped.

603
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,650
For in the old times, a woman
was the altar.

604
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,110
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

605
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,440
of the circle, the origin of all
things.

606
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,370
Therefore, should we adore it.

607
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,110
- Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

608
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,240
Congratulations on your
promotion.

609
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,650
- Thanks, Connie.

610
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,950
Is there any coffee.

611
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,620
- Yeah, I just made some.

612
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,540
I made it just the way you like
it.

613
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,790
- Is there anything you don't do
well?

614
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,540
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

615
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,590
- How's the coffee, Steve?

616
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,010
- Uh, too strong.

617
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,890
- Well, I like it strong.

618
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,730
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

619
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:27,150
- Why, have you been keeping
late nights?

620
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,190
- Maybe so.

621
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,030
- But, now that you've been
promoted,

622
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,070
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

623
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,570
- Me, you kidding?

624
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,750
- Sergeant Meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

625
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,500
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

626
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,670
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

627
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,430
- Yes, of course.

628
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,970
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

629
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,640
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

630
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,020
- Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

631
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,820
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

632
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,820
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

633
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,280
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

634
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,290
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

635
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,700
- Wayne used to spend weekends

636
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,540
up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

637
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,170
He used to take dates there.

638
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,040
- Oh, Jesus.

639
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,840
♫ La ♫

640
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,770
- Hey Griff, look.

641
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,190
- Good lord.

642
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,520
♫ La ♫

643
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,950
- What the hell is this?

644
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,910
♫ La ♫

645
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,160
- I don't know.

646
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,580
We're going to have to dig,
Steve.

647
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,630
- I know.

648
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,760
♫ La ♫

649
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,140
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

650
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,400
♫ La ♫

651
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,540
- Mmm, mmm,

652
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,250
this cake is absolutely
fantastic.

653
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,300
And what a great dinner.

654
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,340
- Thank you.

655
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,300
I enjoy cooking.

656
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,430
Hope you don't mind my calling
you.

657
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,430
Sometimes it's so hard to be
alone.

658
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,520
- Not at all.

659
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,190
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trish is out of town.

660
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,370
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

661
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,580
- 10 years this September.

662
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,620
- 10 years!

663
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,120
It's really amazing.

664
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,300
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

665
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,680
- What about your husband?

666
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,310
- My husband never loved me.

667
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:34,390
He couldn't wait to get away
from me.

668
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,230
- I'm sorry.

669
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,950
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

670
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,830
- Poor baby.

671
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,580
Poor, poor baby.

672
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,700
So, tell me, what turns you on?

673
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:33,410
- What turns me on?

674
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,910
Wow, no one's ever asked me that
before.

675
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,000
Let me think.

676
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,090
You know what really turns me
on?

677
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,380
Flying.

678
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,090
- Flying?

679
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,260
- Yeah, flying a plane.

680
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,220
You don't know what kinda high
it is.

681
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,180
You're soarin' up there above
everything.

682
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,890
You're in control.

683
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,560
- Oh, how fantastic.

684
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,150
- It really is.

685
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,360
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

686
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,530
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

687
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,790
I feel like my life is slipping
away

688
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,250
and there's so many things I
haven't done.

689
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,290
- Like what?

690
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,130
- I've never had any sordid love
affairs

691
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,460
or gotten into any mischief.

692
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,130
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

693
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,380
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

694
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,030
and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those

695
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,180
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

696
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,400
Or those Westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

697
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,940
and then go visit the local
prostitutes.

698
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,980
It's sounds stupid, I know.

699
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,360
- No, it doesn't.

700
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,860
It's very sweet.

701
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:54,910
- Really?

702
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,790
Trish doesn't think so.

703
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,670
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

704
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:06,340
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

705
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,880
I understand you perfectly.

706
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,970
- You do?

707
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,130
- Of course.

708
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,930
You wanna have a sordid love
affair.

709
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,560
You wanna get into some
mischief.

710
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,160
- Uh.

711
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,970
- Ho!

712
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,460
Who are you?

713
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,420
What are you doing to me?

714
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,670
- I'm the love witch.

715
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,630
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

716
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,090
- That's right.

717
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,300
That's right.

718
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,480
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

719
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,520
- Who?

720
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,980
- Professor King.

721
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,740
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

722
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,570
He might be able to help me

723
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,400
identify some of the items we
found.

724
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,660
- It's great.

725
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,370
Did you get the lab report?

726
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:44,040
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like
heart failure.

727
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,290
But the toxicology report
showed traces of Jimson weed

728
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:51,460
also known as Devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

729
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,710
- It's unbelievable.

730
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,670
You want me to come with you?

731
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,380
- No, this will only take a few
minutes.

732
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:01,010
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

733
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,350
- Mustard, mayo?

734
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,640
- Yeah and cole slaw.

735
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,060
Thanks.

736
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,100
- Done.

737
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,200
- Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

738
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,700
- Glad to meet you, Professor.

739
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,410
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

740
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,580
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

741
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,170
- Interesting, yes.

742
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,550
Just as I thought.

743
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,470
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

744
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,680
- A witch bottle?

745
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,860
- Yes, witches used to make them

746
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:44,510
for protection against curses.

747
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,020
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

748
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,890
along with herbs and something
sharp

749
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,110
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

750
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,170
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearths

751
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,820
of very old houses.

752
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,530
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

753
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,570
was a witch?

754
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,570
- It's very likely.

755
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,870
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

756
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,290
has taken root again in cities.

757
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,290
There have several rituals per
year.

758
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:14,540
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

759
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,380
Other rituals celebrate
Summer Solstice, Litha,

760
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,220
or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

761
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:28,270
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

762
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,100
in a mockery of Christian
rituals.

763
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,270
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices
a child.

764
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,150
- Does this stuff really go on
today?

765
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,320
- Yes, indeed.

766
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,240
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

767
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,240
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

768
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,620
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

769
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,960
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

770
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,080
but they've been unsuccessful.

771
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,250
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

772
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,710
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

773
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,880
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

774
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,090
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

775
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,600
of both black and white witches

776
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,180
who practice the ancient rites.

777
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,300
- I invoke and call upon
thee, Mighty Mother of us all.

778
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:50,140
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

779
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,810
and priestess.

780
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,350
- Of the Mother Darksome and
Divine

781
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,940
here I charge you in this sign.

782
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,110
- Listen to the words of the
Great Mother.

783
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,790
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

784
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,540
Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
Isis,

785
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,460
and by many other names.

786
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,510
- Whenever ye have need of
anything,

787
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,680
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

788
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,970
who am Queen of all witches.

789
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,690
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

790
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,730
all sorcery.

791
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:44,360
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

792
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,280
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

793
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,450
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

794
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,210
Bagabi lacha bachabe.

795
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,670
Lamac cahi achababe.

796
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,930
Hurrahya! Hurrahya!

797
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,180
- Arise.

798
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:24,020
Eko, Eko, Azarak

799
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,360
Eko, Eko, Zomelak

800
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:29,070
Eko, Eko, Cernunnos

801
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,740
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

802
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,770
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

803
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,270
What's the matter?

804
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,650
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

805
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,070
- Well, have a drink and relax.

806
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,570
Nothing's that dire, at least
not for you.

807
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,950
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

808
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,830
- What victims?

809
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,580
- There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

810
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:25,630
- Please, don't touch me.

811
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,970
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

812
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,390
- Merry meet, Elaine.

813
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,600
How's it going?

814
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,600
- I'm back in the dating pool
again.

815
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,930
- What happened?

816
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,950
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

817
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,270
the married man.

818
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,360
- No, I broke it off.

819
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:49,070
He just became really obsessive,
morose,

820
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,820
and his aura became really
murky.

821
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,990
He didn't even wanna make love
anymore.

822
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,160
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

823
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,540
There was no polarity.

824
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,080
But, I should have known.

825
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,250
He's a Pisces.

826
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,700
- Richard?

827
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,100
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

828
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,500
when I'm working.

829
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,750
What do you want?

830
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,980
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

831
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,760
and I'm taking a pill.

832
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,150
Are you coming to bed?

833
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,440
- No.

834
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,660
I have some more work to do.

835
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,710
- All right, see you tomorrow,
then.

836
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,840
♫ La ♫

837
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:31,150
♫ La ♫

838
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:43,160
♫ La la la la ♫

839
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,810
- Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

840
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,850
I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

841
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:08,890
- Okay.

842
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,570
- Does this look familiar to
you?

843
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,450
- It's a witch bottle.

844
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,750
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

845
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,160
- No, no I don't.

846
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,300
- Ever seen any of these in here
before?

847
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,420
- Yeah, we have some witch
bottles.

848
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,920
I'll show you one.

849
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,140
Here's one.

850
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,730
- How common are these bottles?

851
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,120
- I've never seen 'em in here
before until

852
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:59,030
a girl started supplying 'em to
us.

853
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,860
- Who is this girl?

854
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,120
- Her name is Elaine, Elaine
Parks.

855
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,310
- Who is it?

856
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,110
- Sergeant Meadows, Police
Department.

857
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,510
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

858
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,580
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

859
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,660
- About what?

860
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,870
- Well, it's a potential
homicide case.

861
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,620
Just a routine check.

862
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,130
I thought you might be able to
help us.

863
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,590
- Of course.

864
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,720
Please come in, Sergeant.

865
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,390
So you say there was a homicide.

866
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,850
How horrible.

867
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,480
Who was killed?

868
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,730
- A man named Wayne Peters.

869
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,030
Did you know Wayne Peters?

870
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,070
- No.

871
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,740
- Here's a picture of him.

872
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,280
Ever seen him before?

873
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,330
- No.

874
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,910
I guess I can't help you,
Sergeant.

875
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:34,790
Good bye.

876
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,290
- Ms. Parks, wait.

877
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:46,840
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

878
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,050
- It's a Magic Bottle.

879
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,470
I made it myself.

880
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,600
- Have you ever seen one
containing urine?

881
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,640
- Urine?

882
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,850
No.

883
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:12,620
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

884
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,250
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

885
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,210
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, Sergeant?

886
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,090
- Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

887
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,470
- Yes, I am.

888
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,140
Is there a law against that?

889
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,980
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

890
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,270
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

891
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,190
capable of murder even?

892
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,780
- No, I wasn't trying to
imply...

893
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,990
- Sergeant Meadows, do
you know what it's like

894
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,410
to really suffer?

895
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,410
You have to fight and fight

896
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:56,540
until you're too exhausted to go
on.

897
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,540
Witchcraft is my religion,
Sergeant.

898
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,340
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

899
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,500
saved my life.

900
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:23,860
- Ms. Parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

901
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,610
I didn't realize.

902
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,160
- That's all right, Sergeant
Meadows.

903
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,580
- You can call me Griff.

904
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,920
- Griff?

905
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,380
I know I've seen you before.

906
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,090
I just don't know where.

907
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,430
- I have that same feeling.

908
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,140
- I know.

909
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,690
You're the man in the cards.

910
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,270
You're my fate.

911
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:11,400
- What do you mean, I'm your
fate?

912
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,490
- I did a Celtic Cross reading.

913
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:17,910
For my future card I got Knight
of Wands.

914
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,250
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

915
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:27,790
I would soon meet the man
that I'm going to marry.

916
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,630
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

917
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,880
Do you like animals, Griff?

918
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,510
- Why yes, I love animals.

919
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,470
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

920
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,100
I'm very fond of.

921
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,770
You know, tomorrow is my day off

922
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,440
and it's supposed to be quite
nice out.

923
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,480
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

924
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,820
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

925
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,390
Whoa.

926
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,790
- Oh Patchouli, you're such a
sweetheart.

927
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,770
- How's my girl?

928
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,980
- Am I your girl?

929
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,190
- For today you are.

930
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,910
You're my girl and there's
nobody around

931
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,650
to tell me otherwise.

932
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:15,570
- Except me.

933
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,490
- And what's that supposed to
mean?

934
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,740
- Nothing.

935
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,540
Kiss me.

936
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,800
- What's that sound?

937
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,550
- I don't know.

938
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,180
Let's go see.

939
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:06,930
- Now is the time of the Summer
Solstice.

940
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:10,060
The strength of the Oak King is
waning.

941
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,230
And the Holly King stands
ready to challenge him

942
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,980
for the hand of the Green
Maiden.

943
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,820
- Let the battle begin.

944
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,820
- Your season is over old man.

945
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,700
- Oh never.

946
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,210
- I will have her.

947
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,310
- Never have her.

948
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,170
- Never.

949
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,930
- Holly King, I name you the
victor.

950
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,970
The Green Maiden is yours.

951
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,010
- M'lady.

952
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,560
Come on.

953
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,980
- Elaine.

954
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,320
- You know these people?

955
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,110
- Well yes, in a way.

956
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,360
- All hail, fair Lord and Lady.

957
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,370
Welcome to our little gathering.

958
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:09,410
- All hail.

959
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,180
- We are the good people
of the Renaissance

960
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,330
and Medieval players and we
are celebrating the Midsummer.

961
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:17,830
Won't you join us?

962
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:20,420
- To be sure, fair consorts.

963
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,800
- They are charming, are they
not?

964
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,640
- Yes, quite charming.

965
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,600
- I see two people in love.

966
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,850
This calls for a wedding.

967
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:37,850
- A wedding?

968
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,110
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you
will.

969
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,270
To honor the gods of love.

970
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:53,830
♫ Love is a magical thing

971
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:58,460
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

972
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,050
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

973
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:07,220
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

974
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,850
♫ Love is a magical thing

975
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:18,440
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

976
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,690
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

977
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:26,690
♫ But pretending is also real

978
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,950
♫ There's a lady in a castle

979
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:36,290
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

980
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:40,170
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

981
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,380
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

982
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:46,260
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

983
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,880
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

984
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:53,180
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

985
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:56,770
♫ Just to have you near me

986
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:01,900
♫ Love is a magical thing

987
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:07,070
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

988
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,570
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

989
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:15,740
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫

990
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,770
- Okay.

991
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,150
- Now, ye are wed.

992
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,620
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

993
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,320
- I'm not in love.

994
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,200
It's not that I don't have
sentiment,

995
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,110
it's just that love is soft.

996
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,200
You need guts in this business.

997
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,510
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

998
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,160
and got soft inside.

999
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,460
I want an heir some day

1000
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,080
and then I would need to have a
wife,

1001
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,290
but love is something else.

1002
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:13,130
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

1003
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:15,710
It's like he's not even a man
anymore.

1004
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,970
I never wanna get like that.

1005
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,760
- When you really love him,

1006
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,470
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

1007
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,390
You love all the little quirks
about him.

1008
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,810
The way he slurps his cereal.

1009
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:34,150
The way his mouth is a little
crooked.

1010
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:38,280
Those details about him
become your whole life.

1011
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,870
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

1012
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:45,910
and you realize that you
have more love to give

1013
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,830
than you ever thought was
possible.

1014
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,960
'Cause the more you know him,

1015
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:55,000
the more you love him.

1016
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,980
- The more
you get to know a woman,

1017
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:00,590
the less you can feel about her.

1018
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:03,180
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

1019
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:06,520
who fulfills all you're wildest
fantasies.

1020
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,560
Then she starts to reveal little
flaws

1021
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,480
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

1022
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,070
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

1023
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,950
No woman could ever fulfill it.

1024
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:24,120
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

1025
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:28,120
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

1026
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,170
drowning in estrogen.

1027
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,460
The most awful feeling.

1028
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,930
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

1029
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,260
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

1030
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,520
Some other time.

1031
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:57,880
- Hey Griff, I got more
information

1032
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,490
on that Elaine Parks girl.

1033
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,780
- You leave it on my desk.

1034
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,030
- Don't you wanna hear it?

1035
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:06,450
- Steve, Captain wants
us to lay off the case.

1036
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:07,870
- Are you serious?

1037
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:11,540
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1038
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,960
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1039
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,790
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

1040
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,630
- Even if they murder?

1041
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,320
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

1042
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:21,880
was a heart attack.

1043
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:23,680
I think so too.

1044
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,970
- Has everyone gone crazy around
here?

1045
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,140
Let me at least tell you what I
found.

1046
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,860
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1047
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,860
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1048
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,610
Two years later they were
divorced

1049
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,200
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1050
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,370
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1051
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,830
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1052
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,460
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1053
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,130
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1054
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,300
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1055
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,680
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1056
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,270
The police questioned Elaine

1057
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:17,060
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1058
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,860
- Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1059
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,820
what happened there is
none of our business.

1060
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,530
- Are you serious?

1061
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:25,990
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1062
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,070
and you better watch her.

1063
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,740
- You mean because she's a
witch?

1064
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,620
That doesn't mean anything.

1065
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,670
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1066
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,100
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters

1067
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,840
got the Devil's weed?

1068
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:43,130
- I questioned Ms. Curtis about
that.

1069
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:46,090
There was Devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1070
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:48,800
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1071
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,930
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1072
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,310
We have a possible murder here

1073
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:54,980
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1074
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,350
- I told you, we're laying off
her.

1075
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:00,110
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1076
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,520
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1077
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,900
Get the hell off my back.

1078
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,990
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1079
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,990
- Richard.

1080
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:51,530
Richard!

1081
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,080
Richard!

1082
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,490
Richard!

1083
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,750
- Thank you for meeting me,
Elaine.

1084
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:47,670
It's not good for me to be alone
too much.

1085
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,260
I know you're busy.

1086
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,300
- Of course.

1087
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,260
I wanted to come.

1088
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:58,220
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1089
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,480
- You can't blame yourself.

1090
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:03,480
You were a good wife to Richard.

1091
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:06,400
- I tried to be.

1092
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,070
I tried so hard to please him,

1093
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,410
but I should have tried harder.

1094
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:18,580
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1095
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,910
Maybe you were right.

1096
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,790
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1097
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,340
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1098
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,800
Maybe I was being naive,

1099
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:38,640
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1100
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,890
But now, now I wish...

1101
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,780
- You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1102
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:51,650
You have to let go.

1103
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:56,320
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1104
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,830
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1105
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,830
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1106
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:06,580
I hated him so much for that.

1107
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,750
I wanted to kill them both.

1108
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,590
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1109
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,640
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1110
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:23,350
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1111
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:25,890
- Hey,

1112
01:35:26,850 --> 01:35:27,850
hey.

1113
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,570
- Enough about me.

1114
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,360
What's going on with you?

1115
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,110
- Trish, I'm in love.

1116
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:41,740
- Who is he?

1117
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,210
- He's a detective and he's
everything

1118
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,420
a woman could ever want.

1119
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,920
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1120
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:57,050
I just know that he's the one.

1121
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,260
He even gave me this ring.

1122
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:02,510
I call it my magic ring.

1123
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,520
It's not an engagement ring

1124
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,690
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1125
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,370
- When we first came here

1126
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:28,870
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1127
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,790
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1128
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,210
It's too painful.

1129
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,590
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1130
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:43,050
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1131
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,810
The first day we met,

1132
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,980
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1133
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,900
and you were all alone.

1134
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,570
Now it's the reverse.

1135
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,360
Life is funny, isn't it?

1136
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:02,820
- Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta
go.

1137
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,740
Would you like to walk out with
me?

1138
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,500
- No, I'd like to stay and
finish my tea.

1139
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,540
- All right.

1140
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,840
Take care, love.

1141
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,050
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1142
01:37:57,670 --> 01:37:59,550
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1143
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:03,010
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1144
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:04,680
See you in a minute.

1145
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,470
♫ La

1146
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,810
♫ la la la la la

1147
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:43,320
♫ La la la la la ♫

1148
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:29,210
- You bitch.

1149
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:32,880
You killed my husband.

1150
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:38,550
Bitch, skank, whore.

1151
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,990
You'll burn for this.

1152
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:07,120
- Crash, crash, crash.

1153
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:12,880
Die, die, die.

1154
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:16,800
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1155
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:20,680
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1156
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,390
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

1157
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:28,480
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1158
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,480
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1159
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,720
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1160
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,980
with a heady lovers' brew.

1161
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,480
Even should they strive to flee

1162
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,060
they'll cling for all eternity.

1163
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:25,910
- Scotch.

1164
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:44,640
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1165
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,440
Who are those new girls?

1166
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:56,070
They can't dance at all.

1167
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:57,570
And they're weird.

1168
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:06,740
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1169
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:08,870
- They're friends of the
witches.

1170
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,120
I seen them come in together
before.

1171
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,790
- Yeah, the witches.

1172
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:15,790
They're everywhere.

1173
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,960
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1174
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,130
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1175
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,760
- Did you read about the teacher

1176
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,300
buried in the back yard of his
cabin?

1177
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,600
They said it was done by the
witches.

1178
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,100
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1179
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,270
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1180
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,560
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1181
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,600
Creepy.

1182
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,000
- Sit down, Elaine.

1183
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:04,800
Elaine, the DNA came back from
the lab.

1184
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,930
It connects you with Wayne
Peters.

1185
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,230
Patricia Manning came by the
station.

1186
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:16,980
With some things of yours.

1187
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,070
Including this.

1188
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:25,740
She said you drove her husband
to suicide.

1189
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,080
- So, I was a bad girl.

1190
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:34,000
Are you going to punish me?

1191
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,920
- What sort of person are you,
Elaine?

1192
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,590
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1193
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:45,130
- Why are you so negative?

1194
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:46,880
I didn't kill anyone.

1195
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:49,800
Wayne died of heart failure

1196
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:53,430
after a beautiful night of
lovemaking.

1197
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:57,980
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1198
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,690
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1199
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:03,070
that they were experiencing with
me.

1200
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:05,700
- Are you saying these men died
of love?

1201
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:06,860
That's insane.

1202
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:10,740
What about the spells and the
drugs?

1203
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:13,290
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1204
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:17,250
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1205
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:20,290
It can only work with
what's already there.

1206
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:23,960
I just use sex magic to create
love magic.

1207
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:27,590
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1208
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:30,720
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1209
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:31,760
- Love?

1210
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,270
What do you know about love?

1211
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,770
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1212
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:41,690
or worse.

1213
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,070
- Don't diagnose me.

1214
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:48,360
Maybe you're a narcissist who
can't love.

1215
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:51,200
You think that I'm sick

1216
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:54,410
because you've never loved like
I have.

1217
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,750
Well, I would do anything for
love.

1218
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:03,540
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1219
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:07,720
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1220
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,630
it's not enough for you.

1221
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,720
You're like a bottomless hole.

1222
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,890
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford Wife thing

1223
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:20,020
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1224
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:24,150
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1225
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,190
I don't love you.

1226
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,450
- How can you stand there and
boast

1227
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,700
about being immune to love?

1228
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:43,460
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1229
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,420
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1230
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:50,380
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1231
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:54,050
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1232
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:59,180
If you would just love us for
ourselves,

1233
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:03,020
but you won't.

1234
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,690
My ex-husband was just like you.

1235
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:12,740
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1236
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,740
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1237
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:20,870
except when men wanted to use my
body.

1238
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:25,330
So, I decided to find my own
power.

1239
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:29,670
And I found that power through
witchcraft.

1240
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,510
That means that I take
what I need from men

1241
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,930
and not the other way around.

1242
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:40,470
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1243
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,060
It won't work this time.

1244
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:49,030
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1245
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,070
- What for?

1246
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:54,910
Marrying a lover according to my
religion?

1247
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:56,820
Seducing a married man?

1248
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:59,830
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned

1249
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:02,910
for a thing like that, but not
today.

1250
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,630
- No, not burned,

1251
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:14,630
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1252
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:17,510
and we'll find out more.

1253
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:22,770
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1254
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:27,310
- Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live.

1255
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:34,360
- Burn the witch.

1256
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,570
- Burn the witch.

1257
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:37,740
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1258
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:44,540
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1259
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:51,170
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1260
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:55,930
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1261
01:51:56,010 --> 01:52:01,220
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1262
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:07,140
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1263
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:13,530
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1264
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:15,820
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1265
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:19,120
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1266
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:22,120
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1267
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:26,040
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1268
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:27,960
- Burn!

1269
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,790
- Burn her.

1270
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:29,630
- Burn.

1271
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:30,670
Burn.

1272
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:57,150
- Poor baby.

1273
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,530
Poor, poor baby.

1274
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:08,540
Don't worry, everything will be
okay

1275
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,040
because I love you so much.

1276
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:03,720
♫ La

1277
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:08,560
♫ la la la la la

1278
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:18,650
♫ La la la la la ♫

1279

- I love you, Elaine.

1281

- I love you, Elaine.

1282
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:05,130
- I love you, Elaine.

1283
01:56:06,590 --> 01:56:09,220
I've never loved anyone but you.

1284
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:11,680
I want to marry you.

1285

♫ Love is a magical thing

1286
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:09,230
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

1287
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:13,820
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

1288

♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

1289

♫ Love is a magical thing

1290
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:29,210
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

1291
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:33,420
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

1292
01:59:33,470 --> 01:59:37,390
♫ But pretending is also real

1293
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:43,730
♫ There's a lady in a castle

1294
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:46,900
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

1295
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:50,690
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

1296
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:54,070
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

1297
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:56,990
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

1298

♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

1299
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:03,910
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

1300
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:07,500
♫ Just to have you near me

1301
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:12,550
♫ Love is a magical thing

1302
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:17,800
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

1303
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:21,970
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

1304
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:26,350
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫
