When will you realize that in this world
isolationism is not a practical policy?

172
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,914
RICK: Ferrari wants you to work
for him at the Blue Parrot.

173
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,332
I like it fine here.

174
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:41,378
- He'll double what I pay you.
- But I ain't got time to spend money.

175
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,004
Sorry.

176
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,428
The boss's private stock.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

177
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:51,596
Shut up.

178
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:56,434
All right. For you, I shut up.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

179
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,188
Monsieur Rick.

180
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,733
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right'?

181
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,572
Where were you last night?

182
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,283
RICK: That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

183
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:16,246
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

184
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,456
Give me another.

185
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:21,292
RICK: She's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

186
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:23,711
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

187
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:26,464
- I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.

188
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,716
- We'll get your coat.
- Take your hands off!

189
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,636
You're going home.
You've had too much to drink.

190
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,849
Hey, taxi!

191
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:38,726
Who do you think you are,
pushing me?

192
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,687
What a fool I was
to fall for you.

193
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,148
- Go with her. Be sure she gets home.
- Yes, boss.

194
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,315
Come right back.

195
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,067
Yes, boss.

196
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,456
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

197
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:01,749
How extravagant,
throwing away women like that.

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,835
Some day, they may be scarce.

199
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,006
I think I shall pay a call on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.

200
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,592
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

201
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,594
(CASSELLE IN FRENCH)

202
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:24,022
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

203
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,694
The plane to Lisbon.

204
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:36,075
You would like to be on it?

205
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,911
Why? What's in Lisbon?

206
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,121
The clipper to America.

207
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,082
I've speculated on why
you don't return to America.

208
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,420
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Run off with a senator's wife?

209
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:50,340
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

210
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,217
It's a combination of all three.

211
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,135
What brought you to Casablanca?

212
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,555
My health. I came
to Casablanca for the waters.

213
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:01,309
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

214
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:03,353
I was misinformed.

215
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:06,981
EMIL:
Excuse me, Rick.

216
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,401
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

217
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:13,029
...and the cashier
would like some money.

218
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:17,283
<i>- I'll</i> get it from the safe.
EMIL: I'm so upset. You know--

219
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,078
Forget it, Emil.
Mistakes happen all the time.

220
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,996
EMIL:
I'm awfully sorry.

221
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,922
There'll be some excitement tonight.
An arrest in your cafÃ©.

222
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,132
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

223
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:34,759
A murderer, no less.

224
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:38,972
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't. He cannot escape.

225
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:43,268
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

226
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:45,520
(IN FRENCH)

227
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,940
We could've arrested him
at the Blue Parrot.

228
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,442
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

229
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,111
It will amuse your customers.

230
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,822
RICK:
Our entertainment's enough.

231
00:17:56,406 --> 00:18:01,411
We'll have an important guest tonight.
Maj. Strasser, of the Third Reich.

232
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:06,040
We want him to see the arrest as a
demonstration of our efficiency.

233
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,293
RICK: I see.
What's Strasser doing here?

234
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:12,297
He didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

235
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:13,715
- Perhaps not.
- Here you are.

236
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:16,009
- It won't happen again.
RICK: That's all right.

237
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:19,095
Louis, there's something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it?

238
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:20,722
How observant you are.

239
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,641
I wanted to give you
a word of advice.

240
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,059
Yeah?

241
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,562
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

242
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,942
There are exit visas sold in this cafÃ©,
but we know you've never sold one.

243
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,278
That's why we let you remain open.

244
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,530
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

245
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,365
That is another reason.

246
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,285
There's a man arrived here
on his way to America.

247
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:45,371
He'll offer a fortune to anyone
who'll get him a visa.

248
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,124
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

249
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:49,751
Victor Laszlo?

250
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,295
That's the first time
I've seen you impressed.

251
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,672
He's succeeded
in impressing half the world.

252
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,258
It's my duty to see
he doesn't impress the other half.

253
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:01,638
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

254
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,806
RICK: It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

255
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,184
- Manages what?
RICK: His escape.

256
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,186
- But I just told you--
- Stop it.

257
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:11,939
He escaped the concentration camp.
Nazis have chased him through Europe.

258
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,608
LOUIS:
This is the end of the chase.

259
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:17,737
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
- Is that a serious offer?

260
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,448
I just paid 20.
I'd like to get it back.

261
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:23,409
Make it ten.
I'm only a poor, corrupt official.

262
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,453
- Okay.
- Done.

263
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:29,707
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs a visa. Or, I should say, two.

264
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,126
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

265
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:35,004
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen her.

266
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,174
If he did not leave her
in Marseilles or in Oran...

267
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,510
...he won't leave her in Casablanca.

268
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,845
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you.

269
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:46,265
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

270
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:50,603
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

271
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,898
Because I suspect
that under that cynical shell...

272
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,900
...you're at heart
a sentimentalist.

273
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:59,570
Laugh if you will.
I'm familiar with your record.

274
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,989
Let me point out just two items.

275
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,910
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

276
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:10,248
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the loyalist side.

277
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:12,792
And got well paid on both occasions.

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,253
The winning side
would've paid much better.

279
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:17,004
Maybe.

280
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:19,924
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

281
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,968
I have my orders.

282
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,554
RICK:
I see. Gestapo spank.

283
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,557
You overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

284
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:31,144
I don't interfere with them
and they don't interfere with me.

285
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,354
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

286
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,773
- I am--
- Maj. Strasser is here, sir.

287
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,359
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

288
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,330
Carl, see that the major gets
a good table, close to the ladies.

289
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:56,210
I've already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

290
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:01,549
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

291
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,514
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

292
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:16,063
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

293
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,483
HEINZ: Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

294
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,277
LOUIS:
It's a pleasure to have you here.

295
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,112
Champagne and a tin of caviar.

296
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:26,866
May I recommend <i>Veuve Clicquot, </i> '26?
A good French wine.

297
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,701
WAITER:
Very well, sir.

298
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:32,497
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight.

299
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:36,042
You'll see the arrest of the man
who murdered your couriers.

300
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,960
I expected no less, captain.

301
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,796
Monsieur Ugarte.

302
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:42,673
Yes?

303
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,010
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

304
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,346
May I first cash my chips?

305
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,599
(EMIL IN FRENCH)

306
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:58,231
UGARTE: Very lucky.
Two thousand, please.

307
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,650
CASHIER:
Two thousand.

308
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:06,864
Thank you.

309
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:22,046
Rick! Rick, help me!

310
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:26,592
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- Rick, hide me! You must help me!

311
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:27,927
Do something!

312
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,428
Rick!

313
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:35,309
Excellent, captain.

314
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,020
When they come to get me,
I hope you'll be more help.

315
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:40,481
I stick my neck out for nobody.

316
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:44,485
I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
folks, but it's all over now.

317
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,447
Sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

318
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:55,580
LOUIS:
Rick?

319
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:59,458
This is Maj. Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

320
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,502
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

321
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:03,838
You know Herr Heinz
of the Third Reich.

322
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,090
STRASSER:
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

323
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,637
We are very honoured tonight.

324
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:15,766
Maj. Strasser is one reason
the Third Reich enjoys its reputation.

325
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:18,978
You say "Third Reich" as though
you expect there to be others.

326
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:22,148
Personally, major,
I will take what comes.

327
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:25,151
Do you mind if I ask
a few questions?

328
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,737
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

329
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:30,615
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

330
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,285
That makes Rick
a citizen of the world.

331
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,121
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you.

332
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:40,750
I understand you came here from Paris
during the occupation.

333
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:42,835
There seems to be no secret about that.

334
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:47,131
Are you one of those who can't imagine
Germans in their beloved Paris?

335
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,550
It's not particularly
my beloved Paris.

336
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,552
Can you imagine us in London?

337
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,263
When you get there, ask me.

338
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,224
- Diplomatist!
- How about New York?

339
00:23:57,475 --> 00:24:02,355
There are sections of New York that
I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

340
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,650
- Who will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

341
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,778
Rick is neutral about everything.
And that takes in...

342
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:10,529
...the field of women too.

343
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,865
You weren't always
so carefully neutral.

344
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,743
We have a complete dossier on you.

345
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:21,624
"Richard Blaine, American. Age, 37.
Cannot return to his country."

346
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,543
The reason is vague.
We know what you did in Paris...

347
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:28,631
...and why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we won't broadcast it.

348
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,216
Are my eyes really brown?

349
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,218
You will forgive my curiosity.

350
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:35,596
The point is, an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

351
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:39,058
...and we are checking up on anyone
who can be of any help.

352
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,312
My interest in whether Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

353
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:47,233
In this case, you have
no sympathy for the fox?

354
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:50,861
Not particularly. I understand
the hound's point of view too.

355
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:55,825
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the
Prague newspapers till we marched in.

356
00:24:56,033 --> 00:25:00,413
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in a cellar.

357
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:03,374
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

358
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,460
He's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

359
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:10,715
In Paris, he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

360
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:14,343
Excuse me. Your business is
politics, mine is running a saloon.

361
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,429
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

362
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:19,974
You see, major? You have
nothing to worry about Rick.

363
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,142
Perhaps.

364
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,272
HOST:
Yes, monsieur?

365
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:31,027
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, monsieur. Right this way.

366
00:25:57,678 --> 00:25:59,346
<i>Two Cointreaux, please.</i>

367
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:03,893
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

368
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:07,188
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

369
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,274
If we'd walk out so soon
it'd only call attention to us.

370
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:12,443
Perhaps he's in some
other part of the cafÃ©.

371
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:18,282
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

372
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:22,828
You'll find a market for this ring.
I must sell it at a great sacrifice.

373
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,498
- Thank you, but I don't--
- Perhaps for the lady.

374
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:27,083
BERGER:
The ring is quite unique.

375
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:31,462
Yes, I'm very interested.

376
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:32,922
Good.

377
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:34,548
Your name?

378
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,009
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service.

379
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,427
Victor...

380
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,805
I'll meet you at the bar later.

381
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:43,474
We don't want the ring,
but thank you for showing it to us.

382
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:46,811
BERGER: That is your decision?
LAZLO: It is.

383
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,774
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes.

384
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,026
Captain Renault, prefect of police.

385
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:55,277
What do you want?

386
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:58,572
To welcome you to Casablanca
and to wish you a pleasant stay.

387
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:01,534
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

388
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:04,120
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

389
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,873
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

390
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:10,000
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?

391
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,547
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman to visit Casablanca.

392
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:16,590
That was a gross understatement.

393
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,092
You're very kind.

394
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:20,970
- Won't you join us?
- If you'll permit me.

395
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:24,932
Emil, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. Put it on my bill.

396
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:30,479
It's a game we play. They put it on the
bill, I tear it up. Very convenient.

397
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:34,191
Captain, the boy
who's playing the piano...

398
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,277
Somewhere I've seen him.

399
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:37,903
LOUIS: Sam?
ILSA: Yes.

400
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,114
He came from Paris with Rick.

401
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,407
Rick? Who's he?

402
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:45,119
- You are in Rick's. Rick is...
-ls what?

403
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:48,581
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man--
If I were a woman...

404
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:51,500
...and I weren't around,
I'd be in love with Rick.

405
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:55,796
But what a fool I am talking to
a beautiful woman about another man.

406
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,631
Excuse me.

407
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,300
LOUIS:
Major.

408
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:04,263
Mademoiselle and monsieur,
may I present Maj. Strasser?

409
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:05,681
How do you do?

410
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,808
This is a pleasure
I've looked forward to.

411
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:10,561
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

412
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,855
But you see,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

413
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:17,651
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you're a subject of the German Reich.

414
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:21,697
I've never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

415
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:25,618
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

416
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,536
This is hardly the time or the place.

417
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:32,166
Then we'll state another time and place.
Tomorrow at ten in the prefect's office.

418
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,500
With mademoiselle.

419
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,214
Capt. Renault,
I am under your authority.

420
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:40,424
Is it your order
we come to your office?

421
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:44,553
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

422
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,639
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

423
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,432
Mademoiselle.

424
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,354
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

425
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:57,608
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

426
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,819
We've been in difficult
places before, haven't we?

427
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:07,159
(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

428
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,938
I must find out what Berger knows.

429
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:39,400
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

430
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:59,920
Mr. Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

431
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:02,089
Champagne cocktail, please.

432
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:05,467
I recognize you
from the news photographs.

433
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:09,013
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

434
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,932
I read five times
that you were killed in five places.

435
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:14,935
As you see, it was true
every single time.

436
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,520
Thank heaven I found you.

437
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:20,482
I'm looking for a man named Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

438
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:23,235
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

439
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:25,738
He's under arrest for murder.

440
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:27,823
He was arrested here tonight.

441
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:29,491
I see.

442
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,871
But we, who are still free, will do
all we can. We are organized.

443
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,415
Underground, like everywhere else.

444
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,460
Tomorrow night, there is a meeting
at the CafÃ© du Roi.

445
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,462
If you'll come--

446
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:57,394
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

447
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:59,271
WAITER:
Very well, mademoiselle.

448
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:05,069
- How's the jewelry business?
- Not so good. Check, please.

449
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:09,531
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
We had quite a bit of excitement, right?

450
00:31:09,782 --> 00:31:10,949
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

451
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,286
- My bill.
- No. Two champagnes. Please.

452
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:15,788
SASCHA:
Yes, sir.

453
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,794
ILSA: Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

454
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:24,505
I never expected to see you again.

455
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:26,840
It's been a long time.

456
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,552
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

457
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:34,848
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

458
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:45,859
Where is Rick?

459
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:48,946
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

460
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,031
When will he be back?

461
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:53,409
Not tonight no more.
He ain't coming--

462
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,077
He went home.

463
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,372
Does he always leave so early?

464
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,209
Oh, he never--
He's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot.

465
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:04,586
Goes up there all the time.

466
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:08,882
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

467
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:13,011
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

468
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:18,725
Play it once, Sam.
For old time's sake.

469
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,520
SAM:
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.

470
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:23,689
Play it, Sam.

471
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:26,608
Play "As Time Goes By."

472
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:29,987
I can't remember it.
I'm a little rusty on it.

473
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,948
I'll hum it for you.

476
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:45,836

Sam, I thought I told you
never to play--

00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:48,482
You were asking about Rick
and here he is. May I present--

480
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:51,026
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

481
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:54,696
You've already met Rick?
Then perhaps you also--

482
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,281
ILSA:
This is Mr. Laszlo.

483
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:57,783
LASZLO: How do you do?
RICK: How do you do?

484
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,327
One hears a great deal
about Rick in Casablanca.

485
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,454
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

486
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:04,498
- Join us for a drink?
- Rick never--

487
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:05,666
Thanks, I will.

488
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:09,586
Well! A precedent
is being broken. Emil?

489
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,839

I congratulate you.

490

491
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:15,842
Your work.

492
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,719
Thank you. I try.

493
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,556
We all try. You succeed.

494
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:23,183
She was asking about you earlier...

495
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,228
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

496
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:27,980
I wasn't sure you were the same.

- Was La Belle Aurore.

00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:35,153
How nice. You remembered.

499
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:38,073
That was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

500
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,450
Not an easy day to forget.

501

00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,503
Yes, that's very pretty.

670
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:11,964
I heard a story once.
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

671
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:15,134
They went along with
the sound of a tinny piano...

672
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,553
...playing in the parlour downstairs.

673
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:23,059
"Mister, I met a man once when
I was a kid," they'd always begin.

674
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:29,106
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

675
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:30,399
Tell me...

676
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:33,653
...who was it you left me for?

677
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:36,447
Was it Laszlo, or were there
others in between...

678
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:39,534
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

679
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,312
STRASSER: I suspect Ugarte left
the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

680
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:11,065
I suggest you search
the cafÃ© immediately.

681
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:14,235
If Rick has them, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

682
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:16,320
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

683
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:19,365
My impression was that he's just
another blundering American.

684
00:51:19,574 --> 00:51:21,701
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

685
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:25,204
I was with them when they
blundered into Berlin in 1918.

686
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:28,583
As to Laszlo, we want him watched
24 hours a day.

687
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:32,628
LOUIS: It may interest you to know that
at this moment he's on his way here.

688
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:40,344
OFFICER:
There's nothing we can do.

689
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:44,015
I'm delighted to see you both.
Did you rest well?

690
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:45,182
I slept well.

691
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:48,978
That's strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

692
00:51:49,312 --> 00:51:52,732
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Sit down.

693
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:58,654
We won't mince words. You're
an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

694
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:01,532
So far you've been
fortunate enough in eluding us.

695
00:52:01,782 --> 00:52:03,326
You have reached Casablanca.

696
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:06,245
It is my duty to see
that you stay here.

697
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:08,456
Whether or not you'll
succeed is problematic.

698
00:52:08,664 --> 00:52:11,417
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

699
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:14,253
Is it possible Herr Laszlo
will receive a visa?

700
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:16,756
I'm afraid not.
My regrets, monsieur.

701
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:19,467
Well, perhaps
I shall like it in Casablanca.

702
00:52:19,675 --> 00:52:21,218
STRASSER:
And mademoiselle?

703
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:25,056
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

704
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:28,142
Don't be in a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

705
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:30,895
You may be in
Casablanca indefinitely.

706
00:52:31,354 --> 00:52:34,273
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.
On one condition.

707
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,441
And that is?

708
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:39,070
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

709
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,948
...in Brussels, in Amsterdam,
in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens...

710
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,701
- Even Berlin.
STRASSER: Yes, even in Berlin.

711
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:50,414
If you'll furnish me with their names
and whereabouts, you'll have your visa.

712
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:53,876
LOUIS: And the honour of having
served the Third Reich.

713
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:56,587
I was in a German
concentration camp for a year.

714
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,297
That's honour enough for a lifetime.

715
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,216
You'll give us the names?

716
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:04,303
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

717
00:53:04,553 --> 00:53:07,515
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

718
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:10,309
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

719
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,104
What if you track them down
and kill them?

720
00:53:13,354 --> 00:53:14,897
What if you murdered us all?

721
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:19,318
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

722
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:21,821
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

723
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:25,574
You have a reputation for eloquence,
which I can now understand.

724
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:27,243
But you're mistaken.

725
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:30,079
You said enemies of the Reich
could be replaced.

726
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:31,789
There is one exception.

727
00:53:31,997 --> 00:53:34,417
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

728
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:37,586
...should occur to you
while you're trying to escape.

729
00:53:38,087 --> 00:53:40,172
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

730
00:53:40,423 --> 00:53:42,091
This is still unoccupied France.

731
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:45,136
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on the captain.

732
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:48,097
-Insofar as it is in my power...
- Thank you.

733
00:53:48,347 --> 00:53:52,643
By the way, last night you evinced
an interest in Senor Ugarte.

734
00:53:53,102 --> 00:53:54,103
Yes.

735
00:53:54,353 --> 00:53:55,896
You have a message for him.

736
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,483
Nothing important.
May I speak to him now?

737
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:02,987
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

738
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:05,030
Senor Ugarte is dead.

739
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:13,080
I'm making the report.

740
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:16,459
We haven't quite decided whether
he committed suicide...

741
00:54:16,709 --> 00:54:18,419
...or died trying to escape.

742
00:54:20,212 --> 00:54:22,923
- Are you finished with us?
STRASSER: For the time being.

743
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,341
Good day.

744
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:31,557
Their next step
will be to the black market.

745
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:32,892
OFFICER:
Excuse me, captain.

746
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,603
Another visa
problem has come up.

747
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,105
Show her in.

748
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:51,035
Sorry, we wouldn't be able
to handle the police.

749
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:53,788
- This is a job for Senor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

750
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:56,373
It can be most helpful
to know Ferrari.

751
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:59,210
He has a monopoly
on the black market here.

752
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,378
You'll find him at the Blue Parrot.

753
00:55:02,046 --> 00:55:03,547
MAN: Thanks.

754
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:17,186
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

755
00:55:17,436 --> 00:55:20,231
Perhaps you can come to terms
with Capt. Renault.

756
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:23,192
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
FERRARI: Good morning, Rick.

757
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:25,861
I see the bus is in.
I'll take my shipment.

758
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,781
- No hurry. Have a drink.
- I never drink in the morning.

759
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:32,368
Every time you send my shipment,
it's always a bit short.

760
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:34,620
Carrying charges, my boy.

761
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,163
Here, sit down.

762
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:38,916
There's something
I want to talk over with you.

763
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,795
FERRARI:
The news about Ugarte upsets me.

764
00:55:43,045 --> 00:55:46,006
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier than I do.

765
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:47,174
Of course not.

766
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:51,470
What upsets me is that he's dead and
no one knows where those letters are.

767
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:52,805
Practically no one.

768
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:55,516
FERRARI: If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

769
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,810
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

770
00:55:58,018 --> 00:56:00,062
I've a proposition
for whoever has them.

771
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:01,730
I'll handle the transaction.

772
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:04,859
Get rid of the letters, take
all the risk, for a small fee.

773
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:06,569
And the carrying charges?

774
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:09,655
Naturally, there will be
a few incidental expenses.

775
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:12,575
That's my proposition
for whoever has the letters.

776
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:14,285
RICK:
I'll tell him when he comes in.

777
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:17,288
I'll put my cards out.
I think you know where they are.

778
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:21,250
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

779
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:29,466
I came over here to give them
a chance to ransack my place.

780
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:32,970
Don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

781
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:35,431
Excuse me,
I'll be getting back.

782
00:56:38,684 --> 00:56:42,605
LASZLO: Good morning.
- Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

783
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:49,737
DEALER: You won't find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

784
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:51,238
Only 700 francs.

785
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,240
You're being cheated.

786
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:54,742
It doesn't matter, thank you.

787
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,912
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

788
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,789
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

789
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,209
I'm sorry I was in no condition
to receive you last night.

790
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:05,419
It doesn't matter.

791
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:08,172
Special friends of Rick's
get a special discount.

792
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,506
One hundred francs.

793
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,885
Your story had me confused,
or maybe it was the bourbon.

794
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,428
I have some tablecloths--

795
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,431
ILSA: I'm really not interested.
DEALER: Please, one minute.

796
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,435
Did you come back to tell me
why you ran out on me at the station?

797
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:22,603
Yes.

798
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:25,230
You can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

799
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:26,815
I don't think I Will.

800
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:31,195
Why not'? I got stuck with the
railway ticket. I'm entitled to know.

801
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:33,864
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

802
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:37,701
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him. He'd understand.

803
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,537
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

804
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:44,917
I'll be leaving soon and
we'll never see each other again.

805
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:49,755
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

806
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:54,760
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days, and not Casablanca.

807
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:56,971
Not last night.

808
00:57:57,471 --> 00:58:00,641
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it'd be like?

809
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:03,769
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

810
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:05,646
Believe that if you want to.

811
00:58:05,854 --> 00:58:08,565
I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

812
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:10,651
Above a saloon, it's true, but...

813
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,946
Walk up a flight.
I'll be expecting you.

814
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,951
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

815
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,619
You'll be there.

816
00:58:22,496 --> 00:58:23,956
No, Rick.

817
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:27,710
No. You see,
Victor Laszlo is my husband.

818
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,463
And was, even when
I knew you in Paris.

819
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:40,639
I was just telling Laszlo that,
unfortunately, I'm not able to help him.

820
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,933
The word has gone around.

821
00:58:43,183 --> 00:58:47,521
As leader of all illegal activities,
I'm an influential and respected man.

822
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:51,316
But it'd not be worth my life
to do anything for Laszlo.

823
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,402
You, however, are a different matter.

824
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:58,157
Senor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

825
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:01,702
- You mean for me to go on alone?
FERRARI: And only alone.

826
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,997
I'll stay and keep trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

827
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:06,915
Might as well be frank.

828
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:10,753
It'd take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

829
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:13,047
We're only interested in two visas.

830
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:15,632
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

831
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:18,052
You two will want to discuss this.

832
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,679
Excuse me.
I'll be at the bar.

833
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,893
No, I won't let you stay here.

834
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:29,396
You must get to America.
Somehow I'll get out and join you.

835
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:31,482
If the situation were different...

836
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,234
...if I had to stay and there was
only one visa...

837
00:59:34,443 --> 00:59:35,611
...would you take it?

838
00:59:36,904 --> 00:59:37,905
Yes, I would.

839
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:40,908
Yes, I see.

840
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,577
When I had trouble
getting out of Lille...

841
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:45,287
...why didn't you leave me?

842
00:59:45,537 --> 00:59:49,833
When I was sick in Marseilles
for two weeks and you were in danger...

843
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:51,627
...why didn't you leave me?

844
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:55,422
I meant to.
Something always held me up.

845
00:59:58,008 --> 00:59:59,384
I love you very much.

846
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:03,013
Your secret will be safe with me.

847
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:05,849
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

848
01:00:06,183 --> 01:00:08,227
FERRARI:
Not more than 50 francs.

849
01:00:13,065 --> 01:00:14,817
We've decided, Senor Ferrari.

850
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:18,654
For the present we're looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

851
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,572
Good luck, but be careful.

852
01:00:20,823 --> 01:00:23,575
- You know you're being shadowed?
- It becomes instinct.

853
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:26,954
I observe that you, in one respect,
are very fortunate.

854
01:00:27,287 --> 01:00:29,832
I'll make one suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

855
01:00:30,082 --> 01:00:32,084
It cannot possibly profit me.

856
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,586
Have you heard
about the letters of transit?

857
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,421
Yes, something.

858
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:39,508
They were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

859
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,010
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

860
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:45,305
But my guess is Ugarte left
those letters with Rick.

861
01:00:47,307 --> 01:00:50,310
He's a difficult man.
One never knows what he'll do, or why.

862
01:00:50,602 --> 01:00:52,271
But it is worth a chance.

863
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:55,357
Thank you very much.
Good day.

864
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:57,609
Bye. Thank you for your coffee.

865
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,570
I shall miss that when we leave.

866
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,489
It was gracious of you
to share it with me.

867
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,950
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

868
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:14,084
(SAM PLAYS PIANO)

869
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:16,420
- Here's to you, sir.
MAN: Good luck.

870
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:18,505
- I'd better be going.
MAN: Check, please.

871
01:01:18,714 --> 01:01:22,467
I have to warn you. This is
a dangerous place, full of vultures.

872
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:25,429
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

873
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,724
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry.

874
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:49,161
You are getting to be
your best customer.

875
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:53,123
LOUIS: Well, drinking!
I'm very pleased with you.

876
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:55,125
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

877
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,544
That's some going-over
your men gave my place.

878
01:01:57,753 --> 01:01:59,838
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

879
01:02:00,088 --> 01:02:02,049
I told Strasser
he wouldn't find the letters.

880
01:02:02,257 --> 01:02:04,384
But I told my men to be
especially destructive.

881
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:07,512
You know how that impresses Germans.

882
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:10,474
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

883
01:02:10,724 --> 01:02:13,185
Louis, are you pro-Vichy
or Free French?

884
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:17,522
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

885
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,816
It looks like you're a little late.

886
01:02:27,866 --> 01:02:29,576
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

887
01:02:29,785 --> 01:02:33,789
Who knows? In her own way, she may
constitute an entire second front.

888
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:37,542
It's time for me to flatter Strasser.
I'll see you later.

889
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,628
Sascha!

890
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:40,796
GERMAN SOLDIER:
French '75.

891
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:42,589
Put up the whole row of those.

892
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:44,883
Starting here and ending here.

893
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,386
We will begin with two.

894
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:49,638
(IN FRENCH)

895
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,646
What did you say?
Would you repeat it?

896
01:02:57,896 --> 01:02:59,481
What I said is
not your business.

897
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,149
I'll make it my business.

898
01:03:07,447 --> 01:03:11,118
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Lay off politics or get out.

899
01:03:15,497 --> 01:03:17,040
You see, captain?

900
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:19,293
The situation is not under control.

901
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:21,753
LOUIS: We're trying to cooperate
with your government.

902
01:03:21,962 --> 01:03:23,922
We can't regulate
our people's feelings.

903
01:03:24,172 --> 01:03:26,591
Are you certain which side you're on?

904
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:28,927
I have no conviction.

905
01:03:29,136 --> 01:03:30,387
I blow With the Wind...

906
01:03:30,637 --> 01:03:32,889
...and the prevailing wind
is from Vichy.

907
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,933
And if it should change?

908
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:37,311
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

909
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,521
We're concerned about more
than Casablanca.

910
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:43,483
Every French province in Africa
is honeycombed with traitors...

911
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:46,486
...waiting for their chance,
waiting perhaps for a leader.

912
01:03:46,695 --> 01:03:48,822
A leader? Like Laszlo?

913
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:50,449
I have been thinking.

914
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:53,744
It is too dangerous if you
let him go or let him stay.

915
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:54,995
I see what you mean.

916
01:03:55,662 --> 01:03:57,539
(IN GERMAN)

917
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:02,461
Thank you, Carl.

918
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:04,755
Thank you, Carl.

919
01:04:05,464 --> 01:04:07,299
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

920
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:10,010
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

921
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:11,386
Thank you very much.

922
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:14,389
I thought you'd ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

923
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,141
...and the dress glass.

924
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:18,143
At last the day's came!

925
01:04:18,393 --> 01:04:21,480
We are speaking nothing
but English now.

926
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,483
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

927
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:26,485
A very nice idea.

928
01:04:26,777 --> 01:04:28,236
To America.

929
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:29,696
To America.

930
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:32,074
To America.

931
01:04:34,826 --> 01:04:36,828
(IN GERMAN)

932
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,955
What watch?

933
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:42,501
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

934
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:46,338
You'll get along
beautifully in America.

935
01:04:47,506 --> 01:04:49,216
LOUIS:
How is lady luck treating you?

936
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,051
Oh, too bad.

937
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:53,553
You'll find him over there.

938
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:01,311
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

939
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,439
- Could I speak to you?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

940
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:07,275
- I came with Capt. Renault.
- I should've known.

941
01:05:07,484 --> 01:05:08,777
My husband is with me too.

942
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:11,571
He is? Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

943
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:12,739
Have a drink?

944
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:15,242
Of course not.
You mind if I do?

945
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:19,663
Monsieur Rick, what kind of a man
is Capt. Renault?

946
01:05:19,913 --> 01:05:21,540
Like any other man,
only more so.

947
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,960
No, I mean...
Is he trustworthy? ls his word--

948
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,129
Who told you to ask me that?

949
01:05:27,379 --> 01:05:29,005
He did. Capt. Renault.

950
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:31,425
I thought so.
Where's your husband?

951
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:35,929
At the roulette table, trying
to win enough for our exit visas.

952
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,889
Of course he's losing.

953
01:05:38,098 --> 01:05:39,808
How long have you been married?

954
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:41,059
Eight weeks.

955
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:44,020
We come from Bulgaria.

956
01:05:44,438 --> 01:05:46,440
Things are very bad there.

957
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:49,067
The devil has the people
by the throat.

958
01:05:49,317 --> 01:05:51,903
So Jan and I, we...

959
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:54,698
We don't want our children
to grow up there.

960
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:57,200
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

961
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:59,661
But we have not much money...

962
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,581
...and traveling is
so expensive and difficult.

963
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,083
It was more than
we thought to get here.

964
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:07,419
Then Capt. Renault sees us.

965
01:06:07,627 --> 01:06:09,504
He's so kind.
He wants to help us.

966
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:10,672
Yes, I'll bet.

967
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:13,425
He tells me he can give us
an exit visa.

968
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,844
But we have no money.

969
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:17,637
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

970
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:19,848
And he's still willing
to give you a visa?

971
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:21,391
You want to know...

972
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,268
Will he keep his word?

973
01:06:24,478 --> 01:06:25,479
He always has.

974
01:06:29,149 --> 01:06:30,525
Monsieur...

975
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,402
You are a man.

976
01:06:32,986 --> 01:06:35,489
If someone loved you very much...

977
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:39,701
...so that your happiness was the only
thing she wanted in the world...

978
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:43,455
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

979
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,332
...could you forgive her?

980
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,958
Nobody ever loved me that much.

981
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:51,338
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

982
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:52,964
...that would be all right?

983
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:55,592
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

984
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:56,968
Go back to Bulgaria.

985
01:06:57,427 --> 01:07:01,515
But if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America.

986
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:04,935
But if Jan should find out...

987
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:06,811
He is such a boy.

988
01:07:07,145 --> 01:07:10,273
In many ways,
I am so much older than he is.

989
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:12,901
Yes, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

990
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:15,570
Yours may work out.
You'll excuse me.

991
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:26,122
Good evening.

992
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:27,374
See? Here we are again.

993
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:29,876
I'll take that as a compliment to Sam.

994
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:33,296
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

995
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:36,967
He does. Could we have
a table close to him?

996
01:07:37,217 --> 01:07:39,719
And as far away
from Strasser as possible.

997
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:42,514
The geography may be
difficult to arrange.

998
01:07:42,764 --> 01:07:44,391
Paul, table 30.

999
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:46,393
WAITER:
Right this way, if you please.

1000
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:50,313
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favourite.

1001
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:51,940
Thank you.

1002
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:59,406
(PLAYS "AS TIME GOES BY")

1003
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:02,909
Two cognac, please.

01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:29,436
Do you wish to place
another bet, sir?

1006
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,730
No, I guess not.

1007
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:33,898
Have you tried <i>22</i> tonight?

1008
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,860
I said "22."

1009
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:54,836
Leave it there.

1010
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,936
Cash it in and don't come back.

1011
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:16,524
Are you sure this place is honest?

1012
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:20,278
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1013
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:24,783
How are we doing tonight?

1014
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,994
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1015
01:09:31,456 --> 01:09:32,832
Monsieur Rick...

1016
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:40,715
He's just a lucky guy.

1017
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:45,720
Monsieur Rick, may I get you
a cup of coffee?

1018
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:47,389
No thanks, Carl.

1019
01:09:51,518 --> 01:09:54,646
- Capt. Renault, may I--
- Not here, please.

1020
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:56,981
Come to my office.
We'll be businesslike.

1021
01:09:57,232 --> 01:10:00,110
- We'll be there at six.
<i>- I'll</i> be there at ten.

1022
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:01,986
I'm very happy for both of you.

1023
01:10:02,195 --> 01:10:04,447
Still, it's very strange
that you won.

1024
01:10:04,656 --> 01:10:06,741
Well, maybe not so strange.

1025
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,452
<i>- I'll</i> see you in the morning.
- Thank you so much.

1026
01:10:17,502 --> 01:10:20,130
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1027
01:10:21,172 --> 01:10:23,174
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1028
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:34,894
As I suspected.

1029
01:10:35,103 --> 01:10:37,272
- You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Why?

1030
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,524
Why interfere
with my little romances?

1031
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:41,609
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1032
01:10:41,818 --> 01:10:43,319
I forgive you this time.

1033
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:46,406
But I'll be in tomorrow
with a breathtaking blonde.

1034
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:49,325
And it'll make me
very happy if she loses.

1035
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:54,831
I wonder if I could talk to you?

1036
01:10:54,998 --> 01:10:55,999
Go ahead.

1037
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:57,876
Isn't there some other place?

1038
01:10:58,126 --> 01:11:00,628
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1039
01:11:02,547 --> 01:11:04,382
- In my office.
- Right.

1040
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,553
You know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1041
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:11,639
I'm privileged to be one
of the leaders of a great movement.

1042
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:13,558
You know what I've been doing.

1043
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:17,854
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1044
01:11:18,062 --> 01:11:20,023
...that I continue my work.

1045
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:21,608
I'm not interested in politics.

1046
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:25,653
The problems of the world are not
in my department. I'm a saloonkeeper.

1047
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:29,532
My friends in the underground tell me
that you've quite a record.

1048
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:31,242
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1049
01:11:31,451 --> 01:11:34,287
- You fought the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

1050
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:37,665
Isn't it strange you always
seem to fight with the underdog?

1051
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:39,793
I found that an expensive hobby.

1052
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:42,670
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1053
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:45,799
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate 100,000 francs?

1054
01:11:46,007 --> 01:11:47,425
I appreciate it,
but I don't accept it.

1055
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:48,843
I'll raise it to 200,000.

1056
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:53,681
Make it a million francs or three.
My answer would still be the same.

1057
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:56,059
There's a reason
you won't let me have them.

1058
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:57,435
There is.

1059
01:11:57,894 --> 01:12:00,021
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1060
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:02,941
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1061
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:05,652
- My wife?
- Yes.

(PATRONS CHEER)

1066
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:08,191
See? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe
can inspire this demonstration...

1067
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:10,777
...what more will his
presence here bring on?

1068
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:13,154
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1069
01:14:13,363 --> 01:14:16,115
- Everybody's having a good time.
- Much too good a time.

1070
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:17,533
The place is to be closed.

1071
01:14:17,742 --> 01:14:20,578
- But I've no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1072

LOUIS:
Everyone is to leave immediately.

1073
01:14:27,627 --> 01:14:29,837
This cafÃ© is closed
until further notice.

1074
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:32,048
Clear the room at once!

1075
01:14:35,134 --> 01:14:36,260
On what grounds?

1076
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:39,931
I'm shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1077
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,100
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1078
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,601
Everybody out at once!

1079
01:14:48,106 --> 01:14:52,110
After this disturbance, it's not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1080
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,904
This morning it wasn't safe
for him to leave.

1081
01:14:55,154 --> 01:14:58,157
That's also true,
except to return to occupied France.

1082
01:14:58,408 --> 01:15:01,202
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1083
01:15:01,411 --> 01:15:02,453
Of what value is that?

1084
01:15:02,704 --> 01:15:05,540
Remember what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1085
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:09,002
- There are only two other alternatives.
- What are they?

1086
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:13,464
French authorities may find a reason to
put him in the concentration camp here.

1087
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:14,716
ILSA:
The other alternative?

1088
01:15:14,966 --> 01:15:19,679
Perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca, human life is cheap.

1089
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:21,681
Good night, mademoiselle.

1090
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:35,028
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1091
01:15:58,468 --> 01:16:00,887
Our faithful friend is still there.

1092
01:16:01,095 --> 01:16:03,598
Please don't go
to the underground meeting.

1093
01:16:03,765 --> 01:16:04,766
I must.

1094
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:08,227
It isn't often that a man gets to
display heroics before his wife.

1095
01:16:08,436 --> 01:16:11,939
Don't joke. After Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1096
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,858
I'm frightened too.

1097
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:16,569
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1098
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:18,488
Or carry on the best I can?

1099
01:16:19,072 --> 01:16:21,532
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1100
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,328
Why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1101
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:27,747
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1102
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,415
But he won't sell them.

1103
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:32,126
I'd think if sentiment won't
persuade him, money would.

1104
01:16:33,586 --> 01:16:35,129
Did he give you any reason?

1105
01:16:35,379 --> 01:16:37,423
He suggested I ask you.

1106
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:38,674
Ask me?

1107
01:16:38,925 --> 01:16:41,469
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife."

1108
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:44,055
I don't know why he said that.

1109
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:59,278
Our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1110
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:02,615
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1111
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:06,786
-Ilsa, I--
- Yes?

1112
01:17:08,204 --> 01:17:10,665
When I was in the concentration camp...

1113
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:13,042
...were you lonely in Paris?

1114
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:17,213
Yes, Victor. I was.

1115
01:17:17,922 --> 01:17:20,341
I know how it is to be lonely.

1116
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:24,303
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1117
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:28,683
No, Victor. There isn't.

1118
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,272
I love you very much.

1119
01:17:36,983 --> 01:17:38,234
Yes.

1120
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,570
Yes, I know.

1121
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:44,157
Whatever I do,
will you believe that I--

1122
01:17:44,407 --> 01:17:46,826
You don't even have to say it.

1123
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:48,703
I'll believe.

1124
01:17:50,997 --> 01:17:52,456
Good night, dear.

1125
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:55,668
Good night.

1126
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:03,551
Victor?

1127
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:05,386
Yes, dear?

1128
01:18:10,683 --> 01:18:12,143
Be careful.

1129
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:15,396
Of course I'll be careful.

1130
01:18:58,648 --> 01:19:01,651
Well, you are in pretty good shape,
Herr Rick.

1131
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:03,986
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1132
01:19:04,195 --> 01:19:05,655
Two weeks, maybe three.

1133
01:19:05,905 --> 01:19:07,990
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe worked before.

1134
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:10,701
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1135
01:19:10,952 --> 01:19:12,036
Thank you.

1136
01:19:12,286 --> 01:19:14,038
Sascha will be happy to hear it.

1137
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:15,915
I owe him money.

1138
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:19,001
- You finish locking up, will you?
- I will.

1139
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:22,296
- Then I'm going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me.

1140
01:19:22,505 --> 01:19:23,756
I won't.

1141
01:19:24,882 --> 01:19:26,050
Good night.

1142
01:19:27,176 --> 01:19:28,719
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1143
01:19:45,403 --> 01:19:48,614
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1144
01:19:48,823 --> 01:19:52,201
I told you you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1145
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:53,661
Won't you sit down'?

1146
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:57,415
- Richard, I had to see you.
-"Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1147
01:19:57,623 --> 01:20:01,252
Your visit isn't connected by any chance
with the letters of transit?

1148
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:04,005
As long as I have them,
I'll never be lonely.

1149
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:06,799
Ask any price,
but give me those letters.

1150
01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:09,593
I went through that with
your husband. It's no deal.

1151
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:11,804
I know how you feel about me...

1152
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,724
...but please put that aside
for something important.

1153
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:17,184
Do I have to hear again
how great your husband is...

1154
01:20:17,435 --> 01:20:19,478
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1155
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:21,188
It was your cause too.

1156
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:23,858
In your way you were fighting
for the same thing.

1157
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,028
I'm not fighting for anything anymore,
except myself.

1158
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:29,322
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1159
01:20:34,452 --> 01:20:35,536
Richard...

1160
01:20:35,745 --> 01:20:39,332
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all--

1161
01:20:39,582 --> 01:20:42,209
I wouldn't bring up Paris.
It's poor salesmanship.

1162
01:20:42,418 --> 01:20:45,963
Listen. If you knew what really
happened, if you knew the truth--

1163
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:48,090
I wouldn't believe you no matter what.

1164
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:50,760
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1165
01:20:55,598 --> 01:20:57,516
You want to feel sorry for yourself?

1166
01:20:58,642 --> 01:21:01,854
With so much at stake, all you can
think of is your own feeling.

1167
01:21:02,063 --> 01:21:05,399
One woman has hurt you, and you
take revenge on the rest of world.

1168
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:08,694
You're a coward and a weakling!

1169
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:13,324
No.

1170
01:21:13,574 --> 01:21:15,159
Richard, I'm sorry.

1171
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:18,954
I'm sorry, but you--
You are our last hope.

1172
01:21:19,163 --> 01:21:22,041
If you don't help us,
Victor will die in Casablanca.

1173
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,209
What of it'?

1174
01:21:23,417 --> 01:21:26,045
I'm gonna die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1175
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:34,345
Now, if you'll--

1176
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:38,516
All right.

1177
01:21:38,724 --> 01:21:40,684
I tried to reason with you.

1178
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:42,978
I tried everything.
I want those letters.

1179
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:44,438
Get them for me.

1180
01:21:44,647 --> 01:21:46,524
I don't have to.
I got them right here.

1181
01:21:48,401 --> 01:21:50,111
Put them on the table.

1182
01:21:51,904 --> 01:21:52,905
No.

1183
01:21:53,906 --> 01:21:56,075
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1184
01:21:57,576 --> 01:22:01,372
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1185
01:22:02,873 --> 01:22:05,418
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1186
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:10,256
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favour.

1187
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:17,638
Richard...

1188
01:22:17,888 --> 01:22:20,015
I tried to stay away.

1189
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:23,144
I thought I would never see you again.

1190
01:22:24,603 --> 01:22:26,689
That you were out of my life.

1191
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:49,628
The day you left Paris...

1192
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:53,174
...if you knew what I went through.

1193
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:57,261
If you knew how much I loved you.

1194
01:22:58,262 --> 01:23:00,681
How much I still love you.

1195
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,821
And then?

1196
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:22,286
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1197
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:26,040
They needed him in Prague.
But the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1198
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:27,583
Just <i>2</i> lines in the paper:

1199
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:30,628
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1200
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:34,423
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1201
01:23:34,632 --> 01:23:35,925
Then it came.

1202
01:23:36,133 --> 01:23:38,636
He was dead.
Shot, trying to escape.

1203
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:42,598
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1204
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:44,642
Then I met you.

1205
01:23:45,226 --> 01:23:48,229
Why weren't you honest?
Why keep your marriage a secret?

1206
01:23:48,437 --> 01:23:51,774
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1207
01:23:52,024 --> 01:23:54,318
Not even our closest friends
knew about it.

1208
01:23:55,069 --> 01:23:57,613
He was protecting me.
I knew about his work.

1209
01:23:57,863 --> 01:24:01,200
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife,
it'd be dangerous for me...

1210
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,910
...and for those working with us.

1211
01:24:03,702 --> 01:24:05,871
When did you first find out
he was alive?

1212
01:24:07,164 --> 01:24:09,500
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris.

1213
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:12,253
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1214
01:24:12,503 --> 01:24:15,798
They hid him in a freight car
in the outskirts of Paris.

1215
01:24:16,006 --> 01:24:18,050
He was sick. He needed me.

1216
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:21,637
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1217
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:26,600
I knew you wouldn't have left and the
Gestapo would have caught you, so l...

1218
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,564
Well, you know the rest.

1219
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:36,610
It's still a story without an ending.

1220
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:38,153
What about now?

1221
01:24:39,613 --> 01:24:40,698
Now?

1222
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:43,075
I don't know.

1223
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:46,412
I know I'll never have
the strength to leave you again.

1224
01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:48,706
And Laszlo?

1225
01:24:49,081 --> 01:24:52,293
You'll help him now, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1226
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:55,796
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1227
01:24:56,046 --> 01:24:57,881
All except one.

1228
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,593
He won't have you.

1229
01:25:02,511 --> 01:25:04,763
I can't fight it anymore.

1230
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:09,143
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1231
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:14,523
I don't know what's right any longer.

1232
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:17,276
You have to think for both of us.

1233
01:25:17,776 --> 01:25:19,236
For all of us.

1234
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:23,866
All right.

1235
01:25:24,116 --> 01:25:25,492
I Will.

1236
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,457
Here's looking at you, kid.

1237
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:36,045
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1238
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,684
CARL: I think we lost them.
LASZLO: Yes.

1239
01:25:50,893 --> 01:25:52,436
LASZLO:
They caught some of the others.

1240
01:25:52,686 --> 01:25:54,021
CARL:
Come inside.

1241
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:02,738
Come, Mr. Laszlo.
I will help you immediately.

1242
01:26:06,992 --> 01:26:09,203
CARL:
I'll give you some water.

1243
01:26:22,633 --> 01:26:24,426
RICK:
Carl, what happened?

1244
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:28,639
The police break up our meeting.
We escaped in the last moment.

1245
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:31,141
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1246
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:34,687
RICK: Turn out the light at the rear.
It may attract police.

1247
01:26:34,895 --> 01:26:37,439
- Sascha always puts it out.
- Tonight he forgot.

1248
01:26:38,148 --> 01:26:40,275
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1249
01:26:48,075 --> 01:26:49,785
Take Miss Lund home.

1250
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:51,328
Yes, sir.

1251
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:05,342
Just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1252
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:07,553
This might come in handy.

1253
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:08,971
Thank you.

1254
01:27:09,221 --> 01:27:10,347
RICK:
Had a close one?

1255
01:27:10,556 --> 01:27:11,807
Yes, rather.

1256
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:16,520
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1257
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:18,856
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1258
01:27:19,523 --> 01:27:21,775
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1259
01:27:21,984 --> 01:27:23,277
We stop breathing, we'll die.

1260
01:27:23,485 --> 01:27:25,529
We stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1261
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:28,490
What of it'?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1262
01:27:28,699 --> 01:27:30,743
You know how you sound?

1263
01:27:31,034 --> 01:27:35,164
Like a man who's convincing himself
of something he doesn't believe.

1264
01:27:35,372 --> 01:27:36,498
Each of us has a destiny.

1265
01:27:37,374 --> 01:27:39,168
For good or for evil.

1266
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:40,335
I get the point.

1267
01:27:40,627 --> 01:27:42,129
I wonder if you do.

1268
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:45,507
I wonder if you know you're trying
to escape from yourself.

1269
01:27:45,716 --> 01:27:47,092
You'll never succeed.

1270
01:27:47,468 --> 01:27:50,345
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1271
01:27:51,388 --> 01:27:54,141
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1272
01:27:54,349 --> 01:27:56,560
I know that you're
in love with a woman.

1273
01:27:56,769 --> 01:27:58,729
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1274
01:27:58,937 --> 01:28:01,023
...that we're in love
with the same woman.

1275
01:28:01,565 --> 01:28:03,942
The first evening
I came into this cafÃ©...

1276
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:07,070
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1277
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:09,156
Since no one is to blame...

1278
01:28:09,406 --> 01:28:11,408
...I demand no explanation.

1279
01:28:11,617 --> 01:28:14,870
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters...

1280
01:28:15,037 --> 01:28:16,079
...all right.

1281
01:28:16,789 --> 01:28:18,791
But I want my wife to be safe.

1282
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:20,292
I ask you as a favour...

1283
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:23,504
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1284
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:24,671
You love her that much?

1285
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:28,300
Apparently, you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1286
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:31,553
I'm also a human being.

1287
01:28:31,887 --> 01:28:33,222
Yes, I love her that much.

1288
01:28:41,063 --> 01:28:42,356
- Mr. Laszlo?
- Yes?

1289
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:44,942
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1290
01:28:45,108 --> 01:28:46,109
On what charge?

1291
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:48,487
The captain will discuss
that with you later.

1292
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:51,406
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1293
01:29:03,377 --> 01:29:07,464
You haven't any proof.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1294
01:29:07,673 --> 01:29:11,510
You can fine him and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go.

1295
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,847
I advise you not to be interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1296
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:16,640
If you help him to escape--

1297
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:18,976
Why do you think I'd stick
my neck out for him?

1298
01:29:19,184 --> 01:29:21,728
Because, one, you bet
10,000 francs he'd escape.

1299
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:25,107
Two, you've got the letters.
Don't bother to deny it.

1300
01:29:25,315 --> 01:29:28,151
You might do it because
you don't like Strasser's looks.

1301
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,028
I don't like them either.

1302
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:31,822
RICK:
They're all excellent reasons.

1303
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,991
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1304
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:35,659
In this matter, I'm powerless.

1305
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:37,619
Besides, I might lose 10,000 francs.

1306
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:42,541
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1307
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:44,209
Yes, I have the letters.

1308
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,420
I intend using them myself.

1309
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:50,090
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1310
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:53,385
I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1311
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:55,512
- What friend?
-llsa Lund.

1312
01:29:55,762 --> 01:29:59,266
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1313
01:29:59,516 --> 01:30:01,476
The last man I want to see in America.

1314
01:30:01,727 --> 01:30:03,353
You didn't come here to say this.

1315
01:30:03,562 --> 01:30:04,813
You have the letters.

1316
01:30:05,022 --> 01:30:08,233
Fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1317
01:30:08,442 --> 01:30:11,069
Why do you still care
what happens to Laszlo?

1318
01:30:11,278 --> 01:30:15,407
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1319
01:30:15,657 --> 01:30:19,161
We have a legal right to go,
but people have been held here...

1320
01:30:19,369 --> 01:30:21,371
...in spite of their legal rights.

1321
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,248
Why do you think
we want to hold you?

1322
01:30:23,498 --> 01:30:24,833
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1323
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:27,961
She probably knows things
Strasser would like to know.

1324
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:29,630
I'll make a deal with you.

1325
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:33,675
Instead of this petty charge,
you could get something really big...

1326
01:30:33,884 --> 01:30:36,553
...that would chuck him
in a camp for years.

1327
01:30:36,762 --> 01:30:38,180
That'd be a feather in your cap.

1328
01:30:38,388 --> 01:30:41,600
It certainly would. Germany--
Vichy would be grateful.

1329
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,851
RICK:
Then release him.

1330
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,687
Be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1331
01:30:45,896 --> 01:30:48,398
Laszlo will come there
to pick up the letters.

1332
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:51,193
That'll give you the grounds
to make the arrest.

1333
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:53,779
You get him, and we get away.

1334
01:30:53,987 --> 01:30:56,865
To the Germans, that last
will be just a minor annoyance.

1335
01:30:57,074 --> 01:30:59,868
There's still something
I don't understand.

1336
01:31:00,202 --> 01:31:02,829
Miss Lund,
she is very beautiful, yes...

1337
01:31:03,038 --> 01:31:05,290
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1338
01:31:05,499 --> 01:31:06,959
She isn't just any woman.

1339
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:08,460
I see.

1340
01:31:08,669 --> 01:31:10,796
How do I know you'll keep
your bargain?

1341
01:31:11,004 --> 01:31:13,757
I'll make the arrangements
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1342
01:31:13,966 --> 01:31:18,720
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
here who has even less scruples than I.

1343
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:20,430
Thanks.

1344
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:21,932
Go ahead, Ricky.

1345
01:31:22,182 --> 01:31:26,645
Call off your watchdogs when you let
him go. I don't want them around today.

1346
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:29,189
I'm taking no chances,
not even with you.

1347
01:31:36,738 --> 01:31:39,116
FERRARI: Should We draw it up,
or is a handshake good enough?

1348
01:31:39,366 --> 01:31:42,828
Certainly not good enough. But since
I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1349
01:31:43,036 --> 01:31:46,498
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and
go to America! You're a lucky man.

1350
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:50,210
My agreement with Sam is
that he gets 25% of the profits.

1351
01:31:50,419 --> 01:31:52,087
That still goes.

1352
01:31:52,295 --> 01:31:54,881
I happen to know he gets 10%.
But he's worth 25.

1353
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:58,051
Abdul, Carl and Sascha stay
with the place or I don't sell.

1354
01:31:58,301 --> 01:32:01,013
Of course. Rick's
wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1355
01:32:01,179 --> 01:32:02,180
So long.

1356
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:05,225
Remember you owe Rick's
100 carton of cigarettes.

1357
01:32:05,475 --> 01:32:07,894
FERRARI: I shall remember
to pay it to myself.

1358
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:45,891
RICK: You're late.
- I was informed as he left the hotel.

1359
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:47,267
So I'm on time.

1360
01:32:47,476 --> 01:32:50,479
- I said to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed.

1361
01:32:50,687 --> 01:32:52,773
This place won't
be the same without you.

1362
01:32:53,023 --> 01:32:56,234
I've already spoken to Ferrari.
You'll still win at roulette.

1363
01:32:56,485 --> 01:32:57,569
LOUIS:
ls everything ready?

1364
01:32:57,819 --> 01:32:59,154
I have the letters here.

1365
01:32:59,488 --> 01:33:01,573
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1366
01:33:01,823 --> 01:33:03,158
Sam's piano.

1367
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:05,786
Serves me right
for not being musical.

1368
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:07,037
Here they are.

1369
01:33:07,537 --> 01:33:09,414
You better wait in my office.

1370
01:33:18,924 --> 01:33:21,593
Victor thinks I'm going with him.
Haven't you told him?

1371
01:33:21,802 --> 01:33:24,012
- Not yet.
- But it's all right, isn't it?

1372
01:33:24,221 --> 01:33:25,680
Everything's quite all right.

1373
01:33:25,931 --> 01:33:29,976
We'll tell him at the airport. The less
time to think, the easier. Trust me.

1374
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:34,272
Yes, I will.

1375
01:33:39,152 --> 01:33:43,448
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We still have a lot to do.

1376
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,620
LASZLO: I brought the money.
RICK: Keep it, you'll need.

1377
01:33:48,829 --> 01:33:50,705
LASZLO: We made a deal.
RICK: Never mind that.

1378
01:33:50,914 --> 01:33:52,457
You won't have
trouble in Lisbon?

1379
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:54,084
No. It's all arranged.

1380
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:56,378
Good. The letters are
made out in blank.

1381
01:33:56,628 --> 01:33:59,047
All you have to do is
fill in the signatures.

1382
01:33:59,548 --> 01:34:00,799
LOUIS:
Victor Laszlo...

1383
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:02,968
...you're under arrest.

1384
01:34:06,847 --> 01:34:10,684
For accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom these were stolen.

1385
01:34:11,434 --> 01:34:14,729
You're surprised about Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1386
01:34:14,938 --> 01:34:17,691
Love, it seems, has triumphed
over virtue. Thank--

1387
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:22,946
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's gonna
be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1388
01:34:23,155 --> 01:34:26,199
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- I have. Sit down.

1389
01:34:26,408 --> 01:34:29,452
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will if you take one more step.

1390
01:34:30,203 --> 01:34:33,039
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1391
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:36,209
Keep your hands down.

1392
01:34:36,418 --> 01:34:39,087
I wonder if you realize
what this means?

1393
01:34:39,337 --> 01:34:41,423
I do. We'll discuss that later.

1394
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:43,175
Call off the watchdogs, you said.

1395
01:34:43,383 --> 01:34:45,635
Call the airport.
You tell them.

1396
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:48,513
Remember, this gun is pointed
right at your heart.

1397
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:51,391
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1398
01:34:58,523 --> 01:35:00,442
Hello? Is that the airport?

1399
01:35:01,818 --> 01:35:03,320
Capt. Renault speaking.

1400
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:06,198
There'll be two
letters of transit for Lisbon.

1401
01:35:06,406 --> 01:35:08,366
There's to be no trouble about them.

1402
01:35:08,575 --> 01:35:09,576
Good.

1403
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,412
Hello? Hello?

1404
01:35:16,374 --> 01:35:17,834
My Car, quickly.

1405
01:35:19,502 --> 01:35:20,587
This is Strasser.

1406
01:35:20,795 --> 01:35:23,006
Have police meet me
at the airport at once.

1407
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:24,966
At once, do you hear?

1408
01:35:31,806 --> 01:35:33,767
OFFICER:
Hello, radio tower?

1409
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:37,020
Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes,
east runway.

1410
01:35:37,354 --> 01:35:39,814
Visibility one and one-half miles.

1411
01:35:40,065 --> 01:35:41,274
Light ground fog.

1412
01:35:41,524 --> 01:35:43,860
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1413
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:46,446
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1414
01:35:59,209 --> 01:36:01,836
Have him go with Laszlo
to take care of his luggage.

1415
01:36:02,045 --> 01:36:04,089
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1416
01:36:04,339 --> 01:36:07,300
Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.

1417
01:36:07,717 --> 01:36:08,718
OFFICER:
This way, please.

1418
01:36:10,637 --> 01:36:13,598
RICK: Fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.

1419
01:36:13,848 --> 01:36:16,059
You think of everything, don't you?

1420
01:36:16,309 --> 01:36:18,603
The names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1421
01:36:18,853 --> 01:36:20,897
But why my name?

1422
01:36:21,106 --> 01:36:22,565
You're getting on that plane.

1423
01:36:22,774 --> 01:36:23,942
But what about you?

1424
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:26,236
I'm staying here
till the plane gets away.

1425
01:36:26,444 --> 01:36:28,196
What's happened to you?
Last night--

1426
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:30,657
Last night we said
a great many things.

1427
01:36:30,865 --> 01:36:32,575
You said I was to do the thinking
for us.

1428
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:35,078
I've done a lot.
It all adds up to one thing:

1429
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,206
You're getting on that plane with Victor
where you belong.

1430
01:36:38,415 --> 01:36:40,375
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1431
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:43,211
Do you know what you'd have
to look forward to here?

1432
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:47,173
We'd both wind up in a
concentration camp. Isn't that true?

1433
01:36:47,424 --> 01:36:49,175
Maj. Strasser would insist.

1434
01:36:49,384 --> 01:36:52,846
- You're saying this to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1435
01:36:53,054 --> 01:36:55,181
Inside we both know
you belong with Victor.

1436
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,726
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1437
01:36:57,934 --> 01:37:00,812
If that plane leaves and you're not
with him, you'll regret it.

1438
01:37:01,062 --> 01:37:04,441
Maybe not today, not tomorrow,
but soon. For the rest of your life.

1439
01:37:05,483 --> 01:37:06,526
But what about us?

1440
01:37:07,652 --> 01:37:09,070
We'll always have Paris.

1441
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:12,324
We didn't have. We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1442
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:14,659
We got it back last night.

1443
01:37:15,452 --> 01:37:18,997
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1444
01:37:19,622 --> 01:37:21,166
I've got a job to do too.

1445
01:37:21,374 --> 01:37:24,878
Where I go, you can't follow.
What I do, you can't be any part of.

1446
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:27,172
I'm no good at being noble.

1447
01:37:27,422 --> 01:37:30,508
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three people...

1448
01:37:30,717 --> 01:37:33,595
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1449
01:37:33,803 --> 01:37:35,930
Someday you'll understand that.

1450
01:37:41,019 --> 01:37:43,104
Here's looking at you, kid.

1451
01:37:58,453 --> 01:38:00,830
- Everything is in order.
RICK: All except one thing.

1452
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:03,166
There's something you should know.

1453
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,126
I don't ask you
to explain anything.

1454
01:38:05,335 --> 01:38:07,962
It may make a difference
to you later on.

1455
01:38:08,254 --> 01:38:10,423
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1456
01:38:10,757 --> 01:38:13,301
She was at my place
last night when you were.

1457
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:16,179
She came there for the letters.
Isn't that true?

1458
01:38:17,347 --> 01:38:18,348
Yes.

1459
01:38:19,099 --> 01:38:21,017
She tried everything.
Nothing worked.

1460
01:38:21,309 --> 01:38:24,979
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1461
01:38:25,188 --> 01:38:27,649
But that was all over long ago.

1462
01:38:27,857 --> 01:38:30,819
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't.
I let her pretend.

1463
01:38:31,903 --> 01:38:32,946
I understand.

1464
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:35,448
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1465
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:37,826
I appreciate it.

1466
01:38:38,952 --> 01:38:40,620
Welcome back to the fight.

1467
01:38:40,829 --> 01:38:43,206
This time I know our side will win.

1468
01:38:57,137 --> 01:38:58,179
Are you ready?

1469
01:39:01,182 --> 01:39:02,350
Yes, I'm ready.

1470
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:06,813
Goodbye, Rick.

1471
01:39:07,856 --> 01:39:09,357
God bless you.

1472
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:13,611
Better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1473
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:33,465
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1474
01:39:33,715 --> 01:39:35,258
RICK:
Stay where you are.

1475
01:39:35,508 --> 01:39:38,303
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you did for Laszlo.

1476
01:39:38,511 --> 01:39:40,680
And that fairy tale
to send Ilsa away with him.

1477
01:39:40,889 --> 01:39:44,809
I know a little about women. She went,
but she knew you were lying.

1478
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:47,562
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1479
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:50,273
This isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us.

1480
01:39:50,523 --> 01:39:52,108
Especially for you.

1481
01:39:52,358 --> 01:39:53,651
I'll have to arrest you.

1482
01:39:53,943 --> 01:39:55,737
As soon as the plane goes.

1483
01:40:03,036 --> 01:40:05,079
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1484
01:40:05,288 --> 01:40:07,081
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1485
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:11,711
Why do you stand here?
Why not stop him?

1486
01:40:12,003 --> 01:40:13,922
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1487
01:40:16,424 --> 01:40:17,634
Get away from that phone.

1488
01:40:17,842 --> 01:40:19,093
Do not interfere.

1489
01:40:19,302 --> 01:40:21,429
I was willing to shoot Renault.
I'll shoot you.

1490
01:40:25,016 --> 01:40:26,059
Put that phone down.

1491
01:40:26,267 --> 01:40:28,186
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1492
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:44,702
LOUIS:
Maj. Strasser has been shot.

1493
01:40:49,707 --> 01:40:51,960
Round up the usual suspects.

1494
01:41:15,984 --> 01:41:19,487
You're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1495
01:41:19,696 --> 01:41:21,781
Maybe. It seemed like
a good time to start.

1496
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:24,075
I think perhaps you're right.

1497
01:41:49,183 --> 01:41:52,854
It might be good for you to disappear
from Casablanca for a while.

1498
01:41:53,062 --> 01:41:55,315
There's a Free French garrison
at Brazzaville.

1499
01:41:55,565 --> 01:41:57,191
I could arrange passage.

1500
01:41:57,859 --> 01:41:59,444
My letter of transit?

1501
01:41:59,694 --> 01:42:00,862
I could use a trip.

1502
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:04,240
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1503
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:07,493
And that 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1504
01:42:07,702 --> 01:42:09,537
RICK:
"Our" expenses?

1505
01:42:09,787 --> 01:42:10,830
Louis...

1506
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,751
...I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
