1
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:19,025
I think I see him!

2
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:34,878
This way!

3
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,072
- Five.
- Great.

4
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,910
You got an arrow right in your chest.

5
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:25,904
Don't worry. I got resurrection.

6
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,539
I'm already one of the undead.

7
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,497
I can still throw death spells.

8
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,375
Just trying to help you out, man.

9
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,750
How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?

10
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:35,831
Where's our pizza, man?

11
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm ready as of now to play.

12
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,758
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

13
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,966
We're in the middle, Elliott.
You can't join in the middle.

14
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,433
I got him!

15
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,721
What am I asking for?

16
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,097
Papa-oom-mow-mow.
Papa-oom-mow-mow.

17
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,014
Mike?

18
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,101
It's not for us, it's for his mother.

19
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,358
Mike?

20
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:02,362
Ask Steve. He's game master.
He has absolute power.

21
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:03,401
Steve?

22
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:05,452
Steve, can I play now?

23
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,497
Go wait for the pizza first.

24
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,242
Then I'm in?
You're in.

25
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,419
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

26
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:16,289
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

27
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,709
Everything but the little fishies.

28
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,506
Harvey?

29
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,417
Harvey, is that you, boy?

30
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,052
Over here, you guys.

31
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:06,887
Stop it.
Sorry.

32
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,228
Harvey?

33
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,241
All's you get is those 40-year-olds.
How do you win this game?

34
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,405
It's like life. You don't win at life.
Money helps.

35
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,575
Mom! There's something out...

36
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,211
Where's the pizza?

37
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,166
There's something out there!
In the toolshed.

38
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,546
It threw the ball at me.

39
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,832
Quiet!

40
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,801
Nobody go out there.

41
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,843
Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.

42
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,143
You stay here, Mom. We'll check it out.

43
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,473
And put those knives back!

44
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,188
It's okay, Elliott.

45
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,438
Let's go get the flashlight.

46
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,193
Hold it. Wait a minute.

47
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:43,493
Creeps. Creepy.

48
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,704
What exactly did you see?

49
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,162
In there.

50
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,421
It's scary.

51
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,338
There's nothing in here.

52
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:58,887
The gate's open.

53
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:00,758
Look at these.

54
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,681
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

55
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:11,395
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

56
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,860
Get out. Hurry up.

57
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,225
Quick. Hurry up.

58
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,447
Tyler, give me that knife.

59
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,782
Great. Nice one, Elliott.

60
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,364
It was an accident.

61
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:26,118
Who said you guys could order a pizza?

62
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,620
Him.

63
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,744
In the house.
You geek, man.

64
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,417
Mom, it was real.

65
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,170
Douche bag.

66
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,094
No douche-bag talk in my house.

67
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:42,788
Elliott, you're crazy.

68
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,342
Hello.

69
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:05,769
Hello?

70
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,994
What are you going as for Halloween?

71
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:03,581
- I'm not going to stupid Halloween.
- Go as a goblin.

72
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,164
Shut up.

73
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:07,412
It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

74
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,463
Well, it was real. I swear.

75
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,217
What are you going as, Gert?

76
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:16,677
I'm going as a cowgirl.

77
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,180
So what else is new?

78
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:23,020
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

79
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,565
Maybe a...

80
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,021
You know how they say
there are alligators in the sewers?

81
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,069
Alligators in the sewers.

82
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,649
All we're trying to say is,
maybe you imagined it.

83
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,367
I couldn't have.

84
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:39,581
- Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid.
- A deformed kid.

85
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:42,283
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

86
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,369
It was nothing like that, penis breath!

87
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,122
Elliott!

88
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,291
Sit down.

89
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:53,338
Dad would believe me.

90
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,894
Maybe you ought to call your father
and tell him about it.

91
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:05,275
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

92
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,488
Where's Mexico?

93
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,330
Excuse me.

94
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,334
I'm going to kill you.

95
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:35,014
If you see it again, whatever it is,
don't touch it.

96
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,183
Just call me.
We'll have somebody take it away.

97
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,767
Like the dogcatcher?

98
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,764
They'll give it a lobotomy...

99
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:45,858
...or do experiments on it or something.

100
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,895
Your turn to do the dishes.

101
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:51,361
- I set and cleared.
- I did.

102
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:54,450
I did breakfast.
I did breakfast.

103
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,331
What's the matter, Mom?

104
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,293
He hates Mexico.

105
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,456
Damn it! Why don't you grow up?

106
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,634
Think how other people feel for a change.

107
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:23,708
Ma...

108
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:24,828
Mom.

109
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,002
Mom.

110
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,289
Michael.

111
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,136
Michael.

112
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,423
Mom.

113
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,606
Wow!

114
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,095
Okay, you're hot.

115
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:56,314
I'll be back.

116
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,608
Mary, can I back the car out?
Not one foot past the driveway.

117
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:05,548
You were outside last night
waiting for that thing, weren't you?

118
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,761
Are you going to live if I go to work?

119
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:14,136
Okay.

120
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,815
No TV.

121
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,654
Come on.

122
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,535
Mommy, look what Michael did.

123
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:29,617
This and...

124
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:33,121
I see them, Gert,
and when I catch him, I'll catch him.

125
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,955
Come on. Don't be afraid.

126
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,964
It's all right. Come on.

127
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,591
Come on.

128
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:50,804
Come on.

129
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,563
Come on.

130
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,102
Come on.

131
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,395
Come on.

132
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,404
Do you talk?

133
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:09,747
You know, talk?

134
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,209
Me, human.

135
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,041
Boy.

136
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,041
Elliott.

137
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,708
Elliott.

138
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,553
Elliott.

139
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,521
Coke. See, we drink it.

140
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,520
It's a drink.

141
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,689
You know, food?

142
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,030
These are toys. Little men.

143
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:47,408
This is Greedo.

144
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:50,616
And then this is Hammerhead.

145
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,496
You see, this is Walrus Man.

146
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:56,836
And then this is Snaggletooth.

147
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,913
And this is Lando Calrissian.

148
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,464
See?

149
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:04,337
And this is Boba Fett.

150
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,183
Look. They can even have wars.

151
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,228
And look. Fish.

152
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,473
The fish eat the fish food...

153
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:20,192
...and the shark eats the fish...

154
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,779
...but nobody eats a shark.

155
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,535
See, this is Pez. Candy.

156
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,498
You see, you eat it.

157
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,454
You put the candy in here...

158
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,704
...and when you lift the head,
the candy comes out and you can eat it.

159
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,258
You want some?

160
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:43,922
This is a peanut.

161
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:45,431
You eat it.

162
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:49,216
But you can't eat this one because this is fake.

163
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:51,768
This is money. You see?

164
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,978
We put the money in the peanut.

165
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,018
You see? Bank.

166
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,524
And then...

167
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:02,067
...this is a car.

168
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:05,195
This is what we get around in.

169
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,321
See? A car.

170
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:13,628
Wait a second.

171
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:16,626
No. You don't eat them.

172
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,627
Are you hungry?

173
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,546
I'm hungry.

174
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:26,387
Stay.

175
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:31,434
Stay.

176
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,515
I'll be right here.

177
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:37,852
Okay? I'll be right here.

178
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:38,942
Harv!

179
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,404
Come on, Harvey.

180
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,665
He'll like this.

181
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:03,211
This.

182
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,389
This.

183
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,464
Are you okay?

184
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:40,671
Too much excitement?

185
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:42,967
Want a Coke?

186
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,143
35 pounds.

187
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,183
35 pounds!

188
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:53,977
But you're so fat.

189
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,697
I wonder how tall you are.

190
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:05,615
I'm 4'6", you must be around...

191
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:07,784
...3'...

192
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,972
This is where the water comes from. See?

193
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:27,143
This is hot and this is cold.

194
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:30,348
Now, it all comes from a big water tower.

195
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,813
It goes through pipes and sometimes...

196
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,602
...dead bugs come through the pipes
and land in the bath.

197
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:39,616
It's real sick. Anyway, look.

198
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,737
Are you thirsty?

199
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,166
I'll get it.

200
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:59,678
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:33:00,263 --> 00:33:02,801
Sure. Yeah, I still got a fever.

202
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:06,351
Yeah. No, get back.

203
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:09,813
I'm fine, Mom. Yeah.

204
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,395
Yeah.

205
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:16,403
No. Mom, I have to get in bed now.

206
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:18,197
Okay. Goodbye.

207
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,776
Mom, I'm sick.

208
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:25,619
Mom, I don't need to go to the doctor!

209
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:30,367
Mom, I only had a fever of 99 today.

210
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,248
Okay, and a half.

211
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,049
Okay, Mom. Okay, 'bye.

212
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:41,679
I've got to throw up. Mom, please.

213
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:46,347
I'm gonna throw up on the phone
if you don't let me go.

214
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:50,557
'Bye. Mom, I've got to throw up now.

215
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:51,848
Yeah...

216
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,411
You could drown in stuff like this.

217
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:19,420
Is this your idea of a good time?

218
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,098
"There are so many people to see

219
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:35,482
"So many people you can check upon
and add to your collection

220
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,407
"But they keep you hanging on

221
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:40,319
"Nothing but health shit

222
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:46,206
"Add to your collection
but they keep you hanging on"

223
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,335
Mike, come in.

224
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,998
How you feeling, faker?
I'm feeling fine.

225
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,636
I got something really important...

226
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,887
Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids yesterday...

227
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,809
...but he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

228
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,388
You're so lame, Elliott.

229
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,602
Come on, Michael. He came back.

230
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,732
He came back?

231
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,060
He came back?

232
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,730
My God!

233
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:14,983
One thing.

234
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,239
I have absolute power.

235
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,613
Say it.

236
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,902
- Say it!
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

237
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,204
No. Look...

238
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,794
Okay. Now, swear it.

239
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,750
The most excellent promise you can make.

240
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,961
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

241
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,460
Don't get so heavy. I swear.

242
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,093
Okay. Stand over there.

243
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:44,426
You'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

244
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,800
You might scare him.

245
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,521
And close your eyes.

246
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,025
Don't push it, Elliott.

247
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:53,146
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

248
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:55,355
Okay. They're closed.

249
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:58,315
Mom is going to kill you.

250
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,786
Okay. Swear it one more time.

251
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:07,332
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power.

252
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:21,674
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

253
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:32,105
Stop!

254
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,529
Kids, I'm home!

255
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:40,824
Guys?

256
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:42,288
In the closet, fast.

257
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:44,615
Anybody up there, kids?

258
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:48,284
Anybody home?

259
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:50,621
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

260
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:53,422
What happened in here?

261
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,678
You mean my room.

262
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,717
This is no room.

263
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,303
This is an accident.

264
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,553
I was reorganizing.

265
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,307
I can see that.

266
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,062
Put those shelves back on the wall.

267
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,144
Get the toys off the floor.

268
00:37:11,237 --> 00:37:13,479
Make your bed since you are not using it.

269
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,656
You're feeling better, I see.

270
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:20,028
Will you guys watch Gertie for me
while I take a shower?

271
00:37:20,413 --> 00:37:21,576
Absolutely.

272
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,573
'Bye, Mom.

273
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:36,710
Elliott...

274
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:39,340
I'm keeping him.

275
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,304
What is it?

276
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,810
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

277
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,689
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

278
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,027
We're not going to hurt you.

279
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:55,279
Is he a boy or a girl?

280
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:56,939
He's a boy.

281
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:03,035
Was he wearing any clothes?

282
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,406
No.

283
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:08,253
But, look, you can't tell.

284
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,963
Not even Mom.

285
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,294
Why not?

286
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:14,510
Because grownups can't see him.

287
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:18,342
Only little kids can see him.

288
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,224
Give me a break.

289
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:25,178
Well, do you know what's going
to happen if you do tell?

290
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:30,270
Do it, Mike. We have to.

291
00:38:30,362 --> 00:38:31,773
No, please!

292
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:34,737
I'll do anything, please!

293
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,233
Help me! No, please!

294
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,401
Give it!

295
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:40,829
- Promise?
- Yes.

296
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:42,916
Do you promise?

297
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,699
What are you doing, Gert?

298
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,781
I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

299
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:01,037
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

300
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:02,916
I won't, Mary.

301
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:10,671
Hello?

302
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:13,553
Jerry!

303
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,933
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

304
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:24,560
Don't be pushy, pushy.

305
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:29,820
A plant for you.

306
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,235
Maybe he's some animal
that wasn't supposed to live.

307
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:35,033
Like those rabbits we saw that time.

308
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,195
Don't be lame.
Green, orange...

309
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:39,280
Could be a monkey or an orangutan.

310
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,784
A bald monkey?

311
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,876
Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.

312
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,164
You could make faces.

313
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:49,757
And make them mean and happy...

314
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:51,752
...and make them get sharp teeth.

315
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:53,636
We are here.

316
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,761
We're here.
Use this.

317
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,890
You could make all sorts of things.

318
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:01,391
Okay. We're here.

319
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:03,137
We are here.

320
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,975
Where are you from?

321
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:19,823
I don't like his feet.

322
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:22,241
They're only feet, you little twerp.

323
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:25,087
He's trying to tell us something.

324
00:41:34,348 --> 00:41:35,511
Earth.

325
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,476
Home.

326
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:40,343
Home.

327
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:42,387
Home.

328
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,015
What's he doing?

329
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,934
What's happening?

330
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,320
Elliott.

331
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:42,534
Oh, no.

332
00:42:55,726 --> 00:42:57,101
Elliott, what is it?

333
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:59,225
I don't know. Something scary.

334
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:20,706
Got a pulse?

335
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:21,956
No, boss.

336
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:28,049
Hold it. We got it right here.

337
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:31,425
Follow him.

338
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:32,427
Okay.

339
00:43:34,308 --> 00:43:35,968
You think it's this house?

340
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:08,045
Did you explain school to him?

341
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:10,508
How do you explain it
to higher intelligence?

342
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:13,170
Maybe he's not so smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee...

343
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,424
Who pushes buttons.
He's smart.

344
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,558
I hope we don't wake up on Mars...

345
00:44:17,812 --> 00:44:20,648
...surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.

346
00:44:27,656 --> 00:44:28,819
Hi, Elliott.

347
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:31,233
- Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

348
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:32,737
Did he come back?

349
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:34,324
Did he?

350
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:36,698
Yeah, he came back.

351
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:39,372
But he's not a goblin. He's a spaceman.

352
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:42,621
As in extraterrestrial.

353
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:45,881
Where's he from? Uranus? Get it? Your anus?

354
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:49,129
- He doesn't get it.
- Get it? Your anus?

355
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:51,260
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

356
00:44:51,348 --> 00:44:53,008
And you're a sine supremus.

357
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,843
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

358
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:56,180
Zero charisma.

359
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:57,516
Shut up, Greg!

360
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,681
Sine supremus.
Zero charisma!

361
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,019
You wimp.

362
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:13,025
Let's go.

363
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:19,080
Come on. Get in the car. We'll be late.

364
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,956
Okay, boys and girls...

365
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,300
...today we will be doing
the actual frog dissection...

366
00:46:07,386 --> 00:46:09,545
...for which we've been preparing.

367
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:12,549
And you will find...

368
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,803
...many similarities.

369
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:23,482
As you get into the dissection...

370
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,943
...you will discover that the anatomy...

371
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,146
The scalpel is very sharp.

372
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,069
Use discretion when you are cutting.

373
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,898
There will be very little blood.

374
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,944
There may be a few body fluids.

375
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:04,415
As we get started with the dissection...

376
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:09,554
...remember that the things
you are writing down...

377
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,524
Some of the things that you should
look for during the dissection...

378
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:28,364
...is to locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

379
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:35,119
I'm going to once more emphasize
the similarities...

380
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:37,582
...of those things which we see...

381
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:45,041
Similarities with human anatomy.

382
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:48,889
First of all, here's the heart.

383
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:59,897
The intestines will be going
through their peristaltic action.

384
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:04,399
X- W-V-U...

385
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:07,107
...A- F-P.

386
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:08,565
That is incorrect.

387
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:10,868
The correct spelling of nuisance...

388
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,959
...is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.

389
00:49:23,802 --> 00:49:25,427
They're pulling us up.

390
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:34,934
Class, these are the cotton balls
with the chloroform.

391
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:39,693
As soon as I get them all in,
put the lid on right away.

392
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,733
That's it.

393
00:49:42,697 --> 00:49:45,367
That will start them going to sleep.

394
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:52,198
They won't feel anything. They won't be hurt.

395
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:56,376
It'll take a little while.

396
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:59,880
If you don't want to watch them,
you don't have to.

397
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:20,683
Say hi.

398
00:50:21,822 --> 00:50:23,364
Can you talk?

399
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:25,402
Can you say hi?

400
00:50:50,644 --> 00:50:51,759
Hello.

401
00:50:51,895 --> 00:50:53,271
Uncle Ralph!

402
00:50:53,439 --> 00:50:56,144
It's Uncle Ralph, long distance from California!

403
00:50:56,525 --> 00:50:58,933
I'll talk fast. This call must be expensive.

404
00:50:59,278 --> 00:51:02,232
No. If I call anytime on Saturday
without an operator...

405
00:51:02,323 --> 00:51:04,779
...it's five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.

406
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:07,490
If I talk less, I pay less.

407
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:09,370
Let me talk to that little fella.

408
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:11,781
Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.

409
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,832
Hello, Uncle Ralph.

410
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:35,768
Save him.

411
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,116
Run for your life! Back to the river!
Back to the forest!

412
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,738
Run! I want to save you!

413
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:52,033
Let's get out of here!

414
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:55,493
Get out!

415
00:51:55,963 --> 00:51:57,956
I got to let him go!

416
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,013
You've got to save him!

417
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,751
Let me handle this!

418
00:52:34,712 --> 00:52:37,286
Let me handle this! I can handle this.

419
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:38,757
Let me get this.

420
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,767
Sanford, what's wrong?

421
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,396
I'm afraid Betsy Sue
isn't going to run tomorrow.

422
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:40,855
No. Is it anything serious?

423
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,069
Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.

424
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:56,584
Here he is.

425
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:57,996
Here's who?

426
00:53:58,092 --> 00:54:01,592
The man from the moon,
but I think you've killed him already.

427
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,680
As soon as I unload the stuff, okay?

428
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:12,315
Bugs.

429
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:16,101
I want you to meet somebody.

430
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:18,520
This stuff has gone up so much in one week.

431
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:20,488
I want you to meet somebody.

432
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:23,694
When I finish putting this stuff away, okay?

433
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:37,872
Stupid rag�. I knew it wouldn't come out.

434
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:41,511
"B."
"B."

435
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:43,423
What's with this?

436
00:54:46,602 --> 00:54:47,847
Hello.

437
00:54:49,188 --> 00:54:50,599
Yeah, this is she.

438
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:52,638
"Basket.

439
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:53,938
"Bandit.

440
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:55,224
"Ball.

441
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,727
"Basket. Bandit. Ball.

442
00:54:58,656 --> 00:54:59,688
"Bugs.

443
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:01,320
"Bananas. "

444
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:04,362
Intoxicated?

445
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:11,660
You sure you have the right Elliott?

446
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:12,709
"B."

447
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,828
"B."

448
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:16,956
- "Biscuits. "
- "B."

449
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:19,130
But "B" is for boy...

450
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,251
"B."

451
00:55:20,346 --> 00:55:22,255
...with a baseball and bat.

452
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,724
You said "B."

453
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:27,262
"B."

454
00:55:27,645 --> 00:55:28,974
You said "B."

455
00:55:29,063 --> 00:55:30,226
Good.

456
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:32,649
"B."

457
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,235
"Good. "

458
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,693
I'll be right down. Thank you.

459
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:42,782
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

460
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,705
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

461
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:49,367
Of course he can. I'll be back. Stay there.

462
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,084
Ladies and gentlemen...

463
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,579
...little Grover here will demonstrate...

464
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:58,209
...by chinning himself two times.

465
00:55:58,303 --> 00:55:59,927
Two times?
Two times.

466
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,673
Can I start?
Go ahead.

467
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,260
Okay. Here we go.

468
00:56:03,516 --> 00:56:04,631
Phone.

469
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:06,597
Phone.

470
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:07,725
Phone.

471
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:11,565
Phone.

472
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:17,359
You want to call somebody?

473
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,905
I am not paying for frogs.

474
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:23,491
Be good. Be good.

475
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:26,580
Stay here. Stay.

476
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,584
Don't tell anybody.

477
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:30,577
Nobody.

478
00:56:31,337 --> 00:56:33,330
Be good. Be good.

479
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,624
Move.

480
00:56:43,142 --> 00:56:44,091
God!

481
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:46,058
- Elliott.
- What?

482
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:47,593
Elliott.

483
00:56:48,063 --> 00:56:49,178
Elliott.

484
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:53,189
I taught him how to talk. He can talk now.

485
00:56:54,153 --> 00:56:57,107
Look what he brought up here all by himself.

486
00:56:57,657 --> 00:56:59,780
What's he need this stuff for?

487
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:00,982
Elliott.

488
00:57:02,037 --> 00:57:03,412
E.T. Can you say that?

489
00:57:03,496 --> 00:57:05,205
Can you say E.T?

490
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:07,076
E.T.

491
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:08,746
E.T.

492
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:11,789
E.T.

493
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:13,085
Be good.

494
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:15,380
I taught him that, too.

495
00:57:15,718 --> 00:57:17,461
You should give him his dignity.

496
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:20,803
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!

497
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,754
Phone.

498
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:25,554
Phone?

499
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,181
He said "phone"?

500
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:28,935
He said "phone"?

501
00:57:29,023 --> 00:57:30,897
Can't you understand English?

502
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:32,526
He said "phone. "

503
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,818
Home.

504
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:40,904
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

505
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:51,375
E. T...

506
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:54,253
...home, phone.

507
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:01,546
E.T. Phone home.

508
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:04,802
E.T. Phone home.

509
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:09,097
He wants to call somebody.

510
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:18,574
What's all this shit?
E.T. Phone home.

511
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,990
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

512
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:23,240
Home.

513
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,950
E.T. Phone home?

514
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:29,708
E.T. Phone home.

515
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:34,794
And they'll come?

516
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:36,593
Come.

517
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,088
Home.

518
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:41,508
Home.

519
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:45,301
Come on. I promise, Mom.
What book?

520
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,559
Any one you want.

521
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:47,845
Spiderman...

522
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:50,059
We'll just smile...

523
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:53,602
...and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.

524
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:58,033
We can't ask Cathy to trick-or-treat
in the same sheet she wore last year.

525
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,488
Now I wish I would've listened in science.

526
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,361
Think, Michael.

527
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,914
We should just grab anything
he could make a machine out of.

528
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,460
What would make a radar?

529
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,585
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

530
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,130
You have absolute power, remember?

531
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:18,263
"I found him. He belongs to me. "

532
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,777
You know, Elliott...

533
00:59:33,864 --> 00:59:38,027
...he doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

534
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,452
What's all this "we" stuff?

535
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:43,030
You say "we" all the time.

536
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:45,739
Really, I think he's getting sick.
He's fine.

537
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:48,789
Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.

538
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:51,125
Grab that Fuzzbuster.

539
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,803
Dad's shirt.

540
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:09,190
Remember when he used to take us
out to the ball games...

541
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:12,728
...and take us to the movies,
and we had popcorn fights?

542
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:16,609
We'll do that again, Elliott.
Sure.

543
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:26,787
Old Spice.

544
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:28,337
Sea Breeze.

545
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:37,552
"Peter says, 'The Redskins were defeated?

546
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:40,338
"'Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?

547
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:43,056
"'I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her. '

548
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:45,348
"He leaps, first at his dagger...

549
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,598
"... then at his grindstone to sharpen it.

550
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:50,812
"But Tink rings out a warning cry.

551
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:54,532
"'Oh, that is just my medicine. '

552
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:56,739
"She says, 'Poisoned?

553
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,988
"'Who could've poisoned it? '

554
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:03,540
"'I promised Wendy to take it and I will,
as soon as I have sharpened my dagger. '

555
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,708
"Tinkerbell sees its red color...

556
01:01:05,878 --> 01:01:08,665
"... and remembers the red in the pirate's eye...

557
01:01:08,756 --> 01:01:10,464
"... nobly swallows the draft...

558
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:12,957
"... as Peter's hand is reaching for it.

559
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:17,128
"'Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine. '

560
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,011
"She flutters strangely about the room...

561
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:22,639
"... answering him with a very faint tinkle. "

562
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:25,564
Ouch!

563
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,729
Ouch.

564
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:46,081
"She says she thinks
she could get well again...

565
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,246
"... if children believed in fairies.

566
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,628
"Do you believe? Say quick that you believe. "

567
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:51,831
I do!

568
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:54,299
"If you believe, clap your hands.

569
01:01:54,804 --> 01:01:57,426
"Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.

570
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:08,567
"But Tink is saved. 'Thank you.

571
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:12,571
"'Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

572
01:02:13,115 --> 01:02:15,523
"'And now to rescue Wendy. "'

573
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:18,282
Can you read it to me again?

574
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,035
"Peter says... "

575
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,890
He's putting it together now.

576
01:02:45,316 --> 01:02:48,151
I told you he was smart.
I'm worried, Elliott.

577
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:51,522
He could blow up the house.
He knows what he's doing.

578
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:53,987
Listen to how he's breathing.

579
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,782
It's going to work.

580
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,946
What's he feeling now?

581
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:01,282
He's feeling everything.

582
01:03:24,774 --> 01:03:27,479
You're going as a ghost. You promised.

583
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:31,146
I'm only pretending I'm going as a cowgirl.

584
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:35,200
Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,
don't you?

585
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:37,071
Meet you at the lookout.

586
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:39,701
At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.

587
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:43,456
You won't get four blocks
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

588
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:46,380
I mean it. You are not going as a hippy!

589
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:47,662
All the guys are!

590
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,666
I'm not stupid, you know.
