1
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,255
I told you not to look for me.

2
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,523
Please, Father.

3
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,571
That's all I have.

4
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,708
The only proof
of what they've done.

5
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,342
But she looks so...

6
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,481
Human.

7
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,487
But don't let
yourself be fooled.

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,328
She wasn't conceived naturally.

9
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,405
<i>They found a volunteer.</i>

10
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,574
<i>Someone devoted.</i>

11
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,442
<i>But how did they...</i>

12
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,712
<i>No, please.</i>

13
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,252
<i>I can't, uh...</i>

14
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,119
<i>I can't talk about that.</i>

15
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:51,478
What I can tell you...

16
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:55,953
is that the pregnancy
happened quickly.

17
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,162
She'll be in her teens now.

18
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,660
They're just waiting
until she's old enough.

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Old enough for what?

20
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,804
Old enough for what?

21
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,701
Now, please.

22
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,351
I can't do this anymore.

23
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:29,687
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

24
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>I can't.</i>

25
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:35,326
But please
don't let it touch me again.

26
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,311
Father?

27
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,823
Father Harris?

28
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:03,956
Father?

29
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,826
Hiding won't absolve your sins.

30
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,898
You think I want to be forgiven?

31
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,481
I don't want to be forgiven,
Father Brennan.

32
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,353
I just want it all to be over.

33
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,522
You'll understand...

34
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:37,723
soon enough.

35
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,312
Father, are you all right?

36
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,384
I'm fine.

37
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:48,930
Father.

38
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,325
<i>Il volo sette quattro due,</i>

39
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,715
<i>in arrivo da Milano Linate,</i>

40
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,943
<i>arrivera con quindici minuti
di ritardo.</i>

41
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,250
- Margaret Daino?
- Yes.

42
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,422
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:12,964
- I'm Father Gabriel.
- Hello.

44
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,658
Cardinal Lawrence sent me
to fetch you.

45
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,884
- Oh, sure. Thank you.
- Let me help you with that.

46
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,990
He's in the car outside.

47
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,661
I have heard so much about you.

48
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,565
I feel like I already know you.

49
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,761
Oh.

50
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:26,066
Maggie!

51
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,839
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Oh, me too.

52
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,311
Oh, it's so beautiful here.
It's like a dream.

53
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,378
Well, wait till you see
the actual city.

54
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:36,013
Look at you.

55
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,269
It hasn't been a year,
and somehow, you've found a way

56
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,118
to grow up even more.

57
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:41,255
Is that all you've got?

58
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:42,319
That's it.

59
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,323
Well, my word. Come on.

60
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,151
I'll show you to your new home.

61
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,893
So, what do you think?

62
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,188
It's wild.

63
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,655
Everything's so different.

64
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,606
Every street that we pass,
there's something to look at.

65
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,401
I just wanna explore.

66
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:27,735
Isn't it beautiful?

67
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,901
What better place
for you to be taking the veil?

68
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,968
It's wonderful
to see you, Maggie.

69
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,269
Even when you were little,

70
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:39,174
I knew you were destined
for great things.

71
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:44,982
See if you can get
around them, Damiano.

72
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,461
These protests
have picked up recently, I'm afraid.

73
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,359
What are they protesting?

74
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:52,540
For the workers,

75
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,022
it's about conditions and wages.

76
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,628
But for the students, well,

77
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,265
it's a rejection of authority,

78
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,935
even the church.

79
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:05,500
The world is changing,
Maggie, very fast.

80
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:07,369
The younger generation
no longer turn to us

81
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,505
- for guidance, I'm afraid.
- Ooh!

82
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,315
But it's
a challenge we've embraced.

83
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,615
Perhaps you'll play your part

84
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,784
and help earn back their trust.

85
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:18,721
I'll try.

86
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,250
<i>Come la treccia!</i>

87
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:48,652
<i>Tu devi essere
la nostra Bella Americana.</i>

88
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,154
This is Sister Silva,

89
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,290
the Abbess.

90
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,284
And she'll take
good care of you.

91
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,425
- Hello.
<i>- Bellissima.</i>

92
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,295
Welcome to our family.

93
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,494
Oh. Thank you.

94
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,831
Ooh.

95
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,199
Come. Come with me.

96
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,905
Let me give you a tour.

97
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,238
We're so happy to have you here.

98
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,717
This way.

99
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,581
We take care of girls.

100
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:21,286
Girls only.

101
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,323
A total of 62.

102
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,555
Babies to 18 years of age.

103
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,124
Come this way.

104
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,356
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

105
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:32,698
<i>Buongiorno.</i> Hello.

106
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,927
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

107
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,836
The state has contracted with us

108
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,704
to take in many unmarried women

109
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,410
who are about to give birth.

110
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,169
We have our birthing facilities

111
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,977
here in the hospital wing.

112
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,919
Come, come.

113
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:53,785
Our doctor will likely deliver
this baby within the week.

114
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,525
<i>- Ciao, Lanoma.
- Salve.</i>

115
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,091
<i>- Come stai?
- Bene.</i>

116
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,026
<i>Tranquilla.
Tutto va bene.</i>

117
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:05,196
<i>Pazienza, hmm?</i>

118
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:10,201
<i>Andiamo.</i>

119
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,948
Sister Anjelica.

120
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,285
This is Margaret Daino
from America.

121
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,393
<i>She grew up here.</i>

122
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,436
<i>Abandoned on our front steps,</i>

123
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,572
<i>and very ill.</i>

124
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,469
But she's very devoted

125
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,078
and she keeps
all the children smiling.

126
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,175
And they all seem very happy.

127
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,477
<i>Scusi.</i>

128
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,154
I should see
what the trouble is.

129
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,291
Of course.

130
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:00,885
<i>Via dal can cello faccello.</i>

131
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:03,894

Hail Mary.

139
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:06,386
Um...

140
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,392
<i>Ave Maria</i> is my favorite, too.

141
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,802
<i>Il mio preferito.</i>

142
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,435
What's your name?

143
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,174
<i>Come ti chiami?</i>

144
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,917
I'm Margaret.

145
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,251
<i>Mi chiami Margaret.</i>

146
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,295
Hi.

147
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:06,788
Um...

148
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:08,294
What are you doing?

149
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,755
Get off of me!

150
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,464
Oh, there you are.

151
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:23,074
Have you been
behaving yourself, Carlita?

152
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,045
Carlita.

153
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,511
Did you do that drawing
outside, Carlita?

154
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,411
The one where
the girl's floating

155
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,922
above the other girls?

156
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,025
I thought it was very nice.

157
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,367
Thank you.

158
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:53,409
Come.

159
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:01,586
Why is she kept alone like that

160
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,780
in the middle of the day?

161
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:03,952
It's safer.

162
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:07,088
She hurt another child
just yesterday.

163
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,123
Luca will be your driver.

164
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,221
Rome has become a bit dangerous

165
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:14,590
with the protests.

166
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:46,360
Hello?

167
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:45,259
By Your divine mercy,
rein in the power of evil.

168
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,996
Build us into living stones
of a culture of life,

169
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,057
who demonstrates
in both deed and word,

170
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,234
the truth that every life,
no matter its conditions,

171
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,905
is precious and unrepeatable.

172
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,036
Lord, speak to every human heart

173
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:57,452
and fill it with the conviction:

174
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,706
I am wanted.

175
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,270
I have a task in history.

176
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,309
I am accepted, and I am loved.

177
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,574
It is good that I exist.

178
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,186
Margaret's one of

179
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,324
our worst-behaved children...

180
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,958
What if she has another episode?

181
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,101
Then you must
tie her to the bed.

182
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,105
Here. Let me show you.

183
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:09,481
Hi.

184
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:10,849
<i>Mierda.</i>

185
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,183
Ah, you must be Margaretta.

186
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,384
Yes.

187
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,556
- I'm Luz.
- Oh.

188
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:18,692
Did I wake you?

189
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,961
No, no. Um...

190
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:22,790
- I was having a nightmare.
- Oh.

191
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:24,627
First night nerves?

192
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,530
Don't worry,
same thing happened for me.

193
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,433
If we can't admit
how we are feeling,

194
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:32,535
our dreams do it for us, right?

195
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:35,905
You're a novitiate?

196
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,144
Oh, yeah.

197
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,240
I just figured a little
exploration is healthy

198
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,214
before the big day.

199
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:44,315
I mean, I will be hiding
this body

200
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,220
under a habit
for the rest of my life.

201
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:49,388
So, why not let it breathe
a little now?

202
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:54,459
Coffee?

203
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,499
So how does a girl from...

204
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,239
Uh, Pittsfield.
Massachusetts.

205
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:08,506
So how does a girl
from Pissfield

206
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:11,378
end up in Italy
about to take the veil?

207
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:15,008
Well, Cardinal Lawrence
was, um, a priest

208
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:16,459
at the orphanage
that I grew up in.

209
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,620
- Mm-hmm.
- And we got pretty close

210
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,117
because, uh,

211
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,558
well, I was somewhat
of a problem child.

212
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,694
Wait.

213
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:24,755
Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,794
You were a problem child?

215
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:27,930
Like how?

216
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,366
I don't know.
I guess, uh...

217
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,599
I mean,
I used to get punished a lot.

218
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,936
And how did they punish you?

219
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,633
And where did you get these?

220
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,713
Hey.

221
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,076
And you are a nosy girl.
Do you know that?

222
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:48,648
Well, would they beat you?

223
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,453
Would they beat me?

224
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,654
No, not really.

225
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,429
I used to have
a pretty active imagination.

226
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,378
I'd get so convinced sometimes

227
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,512
that what I was seeing was real

228
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,470
that the sisters
would need to, um...

229
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:09,802
subdue me.

230
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,644
But then Cardinal Lawrence
came to the orphanage,

231
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,378
and, uh,
he was really great, you know.

232
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:19,583
He really helped me to see

233
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,551
that all that stuff
was just in my head.

234
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,884
Things got a lot better
for me after that.

235
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,427
For me,

236
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:31,793
it was a voice.

237
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:36,500
I was 16.

238
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,002
Just kicked out of the house.

239
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,574
It was so cold that night,
and I didn't know what to do.

240
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,951
And then...

241
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,915
this warm wind came...

242
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,490
out of nowhere.

243
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:04,198
And suddenly it was as if
His voice was all around me.

244
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,830
Inside me even.

245
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,065
So clearly.

246
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,205
And He told me it didn't matter

247
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,342
if I had no earthly home

248
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,973
because my true home
was with Him.

249
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:21,977
And for the first time
in my life,

250
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:25,783
I felt like I belonged
on this Earth.

251
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,221
Yes, but

252
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:36,926
even with the most handsome
milkman in town,

253
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,860
we still had a whole group of us

254
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,402
who took the veil together.

255
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:43,803
Yes. Now, instead,
girls go off to college

256
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,739
and poor Luz
is taking the veil alone. Hmm.

257
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,238
- Hmm. And Margaret...
- Mm.

258
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,680
Margaret will be alone
in the chapel, too.

259
00:21:51,815 --> 00:21:55,148
Don't worry.
I'll warm it up for you.

260
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,424
Warm up?
What is this "warm it up"?

261
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,325
As if Mr. Milkman
didn't teach you.

262
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:06,496
I'm sorry!

263
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,664
It's true!

264
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,829
Practice it again.

265
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,638
<i>Sono una far fall a.</i>

266
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,603
<i>E devo volare.</i>

267
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,973
No, no, no. Shy American.

268
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,549
Say it with <i>passione.</i>

269
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,210
With <i>passione?</i>

270
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,648
Okay. All right.

271
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,281
<i>Sono una...</i>

272
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,320
- <i>Farfalla.
- Farfalla.</i>

273
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:35,087
<i>E devo volare.</i>

274
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,261
Good?

275
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,407
Good.

276
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:39,432
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

277
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:40,532
What does it mean?

278
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:43,162
"I am a teacher
and I love to teach."

279
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,837
Oh.

280
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,734
Hmm.

281
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,108
<i>Silenzio.</i>

282
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,243
<i>Silenzio, ragazze.</i>

283
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:03,755
<i>Padre nostro, che sei nei cieli,</i>

284
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,695
<i>sia santificato il tuo nome,</i>

285
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,464
<i>venga il tuo regno,</i>

286
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,469
<i>sia fatta la tua volonta,</i>

287
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,707
<i>come in cielo cosi in terra.</i>

288
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:21,564
<i>Dacci oggi</i>

289
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:24,711
<i>il nostro pane quotidiano,</i>

290
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:26,977
<i>e rimetti...</i>

291
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,514
<i>No! No!</i>

292
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,404
Margaret.

293
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:43,430
There you are.

294
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:45,356
I'm sorry I scared you.
Come on.

295
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:48,402
I have something
to show you for tonight.

296
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,537
You're gonna love it.

297
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:08,556
Ah-ha!

298
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,686
There she is.

299
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:13,254
Oh, my God, you look hot.

300
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,595
- I look naked.
- Yes.

301
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:18,228
What do you mean, naked?
You look gorgeous.

302
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:19,365
Come on.

303
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:20,767
Up with your foot.

304
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:23,963
- The other one.
- Oh!

305
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,905
Mother Mary.

306
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,571
Don't be nervous.
Can you stand?

307
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,177
No.

308
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,445
Yes, you can.

309
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,582
Hmm? Whoop.

310
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:35,651
Perfect.

311
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,031
Luz?

312
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,763
Yeah?

313
00:25:50,663 --> 00:25:52,031
I can't do this.

314
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,230
Tell me.

315
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:57,998
Have you ever been to a bar?

316
00:25:58,134 --> 00:25:59,341
No.

317
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:01,143
- A disco?
- No.

318
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,679
Anything at all?

319
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:05,859
Because your whole life,
you've wanted

320
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:08,114
to give yourself
only to Him, right?

321
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:11,581
Look, I know.

322
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,025
I know it's scary coming out
from under the habit,

323
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,024
but look at you!

324
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,831
You're a very beautiful girl,
Margaretta.

325
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:23,428
And you have to understand
that about yourself.

326
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:26,265
If only to know
what it means to give it up.

327
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:31,171
So, let yourself feel it.
Okay?

328
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:33,180
Be brave.

329
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,684
So...

330
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:12,447
To the bravest girl I know.

331
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:13,787
Go.

332
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,570
Do you still feel your feet?

333
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:22,260
Oh, my.

334
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:23,397
Hmm?

335
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,794
Do you still feel your feet?

336
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,432
Yes.

337
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:27,663
Okay. Another, then.

338
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,329
Hello.

339
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:31,703
<i>- Parlate italiano?</i>
- What?

340
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:33,467
<i>Parlate italiano?</i>

341
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,309
Ah, no.
Not when I'm drinking.

342
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:36,745
Too hard.

343
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,781
<i>Inglese, per favore, no?</i>

344
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,949
If you can.

345
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:44,812
I'm Alfonzo, and this is Paolo.

346
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:45,953
Hi.

347
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:49,385
Uh, we can buy you a drink
if you want.

348
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:18,584
Excuse me.

349
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,720
Um...

350
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,188
Can I have a sip of that?

351
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,092
Ah, yeah, eat it.

352
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,765
Eh...

353
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:30,299
- Eat it?
- Yes. Eat it.

354
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:34,472
I was watching this movie
with my mother yesterday.

355
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:35,640
- Yeah?
- And, um...

356
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:37,636
And was with Barbara Streisand,

357
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,772
and I just... I don't know.
I love her and...

358
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:41,512
- You do?
- I do.

359
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,982
- Barbra?
- I love Barbara.

360
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:44,761
- Yes, Barbara Streisand.
- Barbara?

361
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:46,052
Barbra, yeah.

362
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:49,448
I mean, it was the part
with the "Hello, gorgeous."

363
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,114
Hello, gorgeous.

364
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:52,251
Gorgeous.

365
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,457
Gorgeous.

366
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:57,063
Uh, what? Gorgeous.

367
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:58,871
- Gor... Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

368
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:01,702
You know, it's... Sorry
if I'm not a "professional..."

369

what do you do?

371
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:10,576
Um...

372
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:16,180

373
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:27,489

376
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,343

413

Good morning.

422
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,001
Good morning.

423
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:15,735
Did you have fun last night?

424
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,205
Yeah.

425
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,272
I'm guessing you've never
drunk like that before.

426
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:26,579
I didn't, like,

427
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,814
embarrass myself
or anything last night, did I?

428
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,279
No. No.

429
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:31,623
Okay.

430
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:34,025
You were well-behaved.

431
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,787
Mostly.

432
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,399
Okay. I found you before
anything got out of control.

433
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:44,527
And for the record,
I was a very nice friend.

434
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,368
You came home with me.

435
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:49,835
Thanks.

436
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,474
But it wasn't easy
pulling you away from him.

437
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,084
What do you mean?
I didn't...

438
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,718
Uh...

439
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,788
Let's just say
you took my advice to heart.

440
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:10,096
You were a very brave girl,
Margaretta.

441
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:15,868
But, hey, don't worry.

442
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:17,698
It's our little secret. Okay?

443
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,172
I am loved. I am accepted.

444
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,040
It is good to be a human being.

445
00:33:56,177 --> 00:33:57,806
It is good to be alive.

446
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:30,977
Excuse me.

447
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,315
May I sit?

448
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,153
No, please, please stay.

449
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:37,184
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

450
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,785
My name is Father Brennan.

451
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:41,819
I apologize for startling you.
Please sit with me.

452
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,895
This will only take
a few minutes.

453
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,655
Your name is Margaret Daino.

454
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,491
You work at the orphanage.

455
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,631
You're new there.

456
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:51,794
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

457
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,700
It's about the girl. Scianna.

458
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:55,537
Carlita?

459
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:57,200
You must be very careful,
Margaret.

460
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,502
Bad things will start
to happen around her.

461
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:00,978
Evil things.

462
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:02,115
No, I have to go now.

463
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,676
No, no. Please, please.
Come see me tonight.

464
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,050
Saint Rita cloister, room 42.

465
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:08,419
I'll tell you everything.

466
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,797
Good morning, <i>far fall a.</i>

467
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,131
Good morning.

468
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,734
What's wrong?

469
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,865
Nothing.
Just a little tired, that's all.

470
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:33,782
Where's Carlita?

471
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:37,383
She's in the bad room.

472
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,220
The bad room?

473
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,653
Dirty.

474
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:44,622
Dirty.

475
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:46,585
Dirty.

476
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,829
Dirty.

477
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:49,990
Sister.

478
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:52,326
Sister, I need your help.

479
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,466
Uh...

480
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:59,072
Carlita, she's locked in a room.

481
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,408
That's right.

482
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:03,475
She bit Sister Romano
just this morning,

483
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,008
so she had to go
to the bad room.

484
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:11,948
Sister, why is there a bad room?

485
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:19,494
Because some girls are bad.

486
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:42,716
This room is suffocating.

487
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:46,554
It's not meant to be pleasant.

488
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,623
The things we do
aren't always pleasant,

489
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:52,363
but they are in the name of God.

490
00:36:56,534 --> 00:36:57,577
Do you wanna talk about

491
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,063
why they put you in that room?

492
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,572
<i>Sono cattiva.</i>

493
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,208
I'm bad.

494
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:07,503
Oh. You're bad.

495
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,383
Well, guess who else was bad.

496
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:13,953
Who?

497
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:17,082
You?

498
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,051
Mm-hmm.

499
00:37:19,993 --> 00:37:20,994
Oh, yeah.

500
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,891
But you know what?

501
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,896
I realized that I'm not bad.

502
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:31,777
They just tell you that you are

503
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,606
because you're not doing
what they want you to do.

504
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:39,839
Back then, I used to think
that there was something

505
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,778
really, really wrong with me.

506
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:44,847
What did you do?

507
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,494
Well, I guess at first,
I tried to run away.

508
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,090
But, uh,

509
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,961
it didn't fix the feeling.

510
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,438
That's what I like
about you, actually.

511
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,073
What?

512
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:09,808
What do you like about me?

513
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,714
I think that you feel
the same way that I felt.

514
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,850
But you're not scared,
you don't run away.

515
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,688
You just...

516
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:23,690
You raise your little claws,
and you fight.

517
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:31,325
Carlita, go to your room, okay?

518
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:33,596
I'll be right there.

519
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:50,414
<i>- Infermiera, la regga.

520
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,464

521
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,689
<i>Forcipe.</i>

522
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:07,968
<i>Stia ferma.</i>

523
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,712
No!

524
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:17,379
<i>Stia buona!</i>

525
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:00,856
Everything looks all right.

526
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:05,187
You did say you didn't
eat much in the morning.

527
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:07,430
- Mm.
- May be low blood sugar.

528
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,567
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

529
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,734
Sorry? Margaret, what for?

530
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,604
You wouldn't be
the first to faint

531
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,171
witnessing the birth of a child.

532
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,841
Frankly, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

533
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,108

Oh, no.

No, no, no, don't. Don't!

575
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:56,137
Don't!

576
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,791
<i>Psst. Psst, psst.</i>

577
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,096
Margaret. Come in.

578
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:48,453
Something happened, didn't it?

579
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:52,061
Yes. Um...

580
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:55,064
One of the sisters
took her own life.

581
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,630
You mentioned
the name "Scianna."

582
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:02,402
That's right.

583
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,345
I assume you know these people.

584
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:14,616
The priest is named Spiletto.

585
00:47:14,752 --> 00:47:16,119
He's a radical.

586
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:18,181
Yes, I've seen him.

587
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:19,320
Turn it over.

588
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:26,389
The baby
in this photo is Carlita?

589
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:28,001
I believe so.

590
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,002
And this is why she's in danger?

591
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:34,573
I know these sisters.

592
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,037
They're women of God.

593
00:47:36,173 --> 00:47:37,675
They belong to the Church.

594
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,812
Listen to me, Margaret.

595
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:43,214
The truth is
there are two Churches.

596
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:45,215
The one that follows
the teachings of Christ,

597
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:47,053
the one that you and I
are part of.

598
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:49,155
And the other.

599
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:52,053
The Church
that will turn a blind eye

600
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:54,688
to torture, to rape.

601
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:56,325
To commit murder
in the name of God.

602
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:59,058
All in the name
of supreme power.

603
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:02,002
What do you think that Church
is most frightened of?

604
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,533
The Devil?

605
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:06,965
Secularism.

606
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,105
We are living
in unprecedented times.

607
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,345
Look at what's been occurring
in your very own generation.

608
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:17,013
A culture that is outspoken, rebelling.

609
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:19,144
Sometimes violently.

610
00:48:19,281 --> 00:48:22,716
People are turning away
from the church in droves.

611
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:25,551
And, Margaret,
you know as well as I do

612
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:28,528
that belief is power.

613
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:31,363
Now, how do you control people
who no longer believe

614
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:34,161
in your stories
of fire and brimstone?

615
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:37,105
People who do not seem to fear?

616
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:41,341
You create something to fear.

617
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:46,110
This Church has maintained
power for generations.

618
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,712
Thousands of years.

619
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:50,411
And they will stop at nothing
to keep it that way.

620
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:53,056
So,

621
00:48:54,256 --> 00:48:57,792
a small, but very powerful group

622
00:48:57,928 --> 00:48:59,492
of priests and bishops,

623
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:01,593
even higher,

624
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,793
they decided

625
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,137
something drastic
had to be done.

626
00:49:08,337 --> 00:49:10,504
These priests...

627
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,974
believe they can birth
the Antichrist

628
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,508
and then control him.

629
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:18,115
Allow him to bring
his dark forces

630
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:19,942
to bear on the world just enough

631
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:22,144
to drive people
back to the Church.

632
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,820
That's insane.

633
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,584
Yes. Don't you see?

634
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,827
If no one believes
such a thing can exist,

635
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:31,162
who will stand in their way?

636
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:34,132
Uh...

637
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,933
What does any of this
have to do with Carlita?

638
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:38,964
I was excommunicated.

639
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,303
My contacts within the Church
are very limited.

640
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:43,969
That photo is all I have
to go on.

641
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:48,478
But I believe the baby girl
in the picture

642
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:50,749
is to be the mother.

643
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,647
The mother of what?

644
00:49:58,618 --> 00:50:00,325
Of the Antichrist?

645
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:01,755
Yes.

646
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,266
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

647
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:08,060
Look, if I am right,
Carlita would have been born

648
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:10,635
on the sixth day
of the sixth month at 6 a.m.

649
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:11,838
666.

650
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,015
It's the mark of the Devil

651
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,507
which she will have on her body.

652
00:50:14,642 --> 00:50:17,037
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

653
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:18,854
They're keeping her files
at the orphanage.

654
00:50:18,913 --> 00:50:20,244
Locked away.

655
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,380
I need you to get them to me.

656
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,946
I need to know how she was born.

657
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:27,854
What do you mean,
how she was born?

658
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,089
Listen to me, Margaret.

659
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:30,886
There is a beast they're mating.

660
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,360
A jackal. That's the father.

661
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:35,998
- I have to go now.
- No, no, Margaret.

662
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,326
If Carlita is, in fact,
the mother,

663
00:50:38,461 --> 00:50:41,896
the evil inside her will do
whatever it takes to stop us.

664
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:44,204
We must destroy it at all costs.

665
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,105
- Do you understand?
- No.

666
00:50:46,241 --> 00:50:48,635
Carlita is a little girl.

667
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,972
And she is not pregnant.

668
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,842
But we're not talking
about a human child!

669
00:50:53,743 --> 00:50:55,013
It's almost June 6th.

670
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:57,579
Look, we haven't a lot of time
and I need your help.

671
00:50:57,714 --> 00:50:59,056
No, you need a doctor.

672
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,257
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

673
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:03,590
Will you let go of my arm?

674
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:34,588
Oh. Margaret.

675
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,394
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

676
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:39,429
Um, I need to talk to you
about Carlita.

677
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:44,962
Do you know anything
about her history,

678
00:51:45,098 --> 00:51:48,307
or how she came
to the orphanage?

679
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:52,545
Um, not off the top
of my head. Why?

680
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:56,645
Do you know where I could find
that kind of information?

681
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:02,718
I'm afraid this is not really
my area, you know?

682
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,084
What?

683
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:06,120
Why do you keep staring at me?

684
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:08,826
I'm not.

685
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:18,963
Will you come with me?

686
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:21,972
Come on.

687
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:28,346
I need to talk to you
about something.

688
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:30,374
But before I do, I...

689
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:33,682
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

690
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:36,388
Okay.

691
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:38,049
Um...

692
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,056
Has anyone ever
done anything to you

693
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,800
that might have scared you

694
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,500
or upset you?

695
00:53:54,336 --> 00:53:55,540
Uh...

696
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,102
I don't know.

697
00:53:58,872 --> 00:54:00,105
What don't you know?

698
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:05,914
Sometimes I get this...

699
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:08,719
bad feelings.

700
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:12,922
I see...

701
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:15,693
I see things.

702
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:21,567
And I can't tell
if they're real or not.

703
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:24,934
Listen to me.

704
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:28,366
When I was younger,

705
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:30,907
I... I used to have these

706
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:34,413
horrible visions.

707
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:37,386
They were so terrible that I

708
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:40,488
convinced myself
that they were real.

709
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:46,022
But I learned
that those thoughts,

710
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,455
they were just lies.

711
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:52,331
Just tricks that my brain
was playing on me

712
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:54,833
because I was so unhappy.

713
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:56,768
This isn't a lie.

714
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,804
How can you know that
for certain?

715
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:03,673
Carlita.

716
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:05,075
I'm sorry.

717
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:10,784
Carlita.

718
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:18,324
Carlita. I'm sorry.

719
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,416
There you are.

720
00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:44,054
A riot's broken out.

721
00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:45,422
We must go.

722
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:47,625
<i>Deve an dare adesso!</i>

723
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:50,958
<i>Deve an dare adesso!</i>

724
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,163
Listen.
It's all right, girls.

725
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:00,971
It's okay.
Stay close to me, okay?

726
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,108
Oh.

727
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,950
Stay close to me, okay?

728
00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:23,696
Carlita!

729
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:31,539
Carlita!

730
00:57:37,442 --> 00:57:39,006
<i>Silenzio.</i>

731
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:42,614
<i>Silenzio.</i>

732
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:48,678
<i>Silenzio, ragazze.</i>

733
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:52,218
<i>Padre nostro, che sei nei cieli,</i>

734
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:57,730
<i>sia santificato il tuo nome,</i>

735
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:00,124
<i>venga il tuo regno...</i>

736
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:01,634
Margaretta.

737
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,138
Sister Silva would like
to see you in her office.

738
00:58:17,518 --> 00:58:19,048
Please take a seat.

739
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,156
Margaret...

740
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:32,259
Part of my job here
is to look out

741
00:58:32,394 --> 00:58:34,235
for the well-being of all those

742
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,868
who are under my care.

743
00:58:37,004 --> 00:58:40,539
I'm sure this will come
as no surprise,

744
00:58:40,675 --> 00:58:43,338
but I've become concerned.

745
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:46,979
I'm fine.

746
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:53,414
Perhaps I should have
put it this way.

747
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:56,252
We are concerned.

748
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,058
Myself and Cardinal Lawrence.

749
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:04,964
We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

750
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,268
And perhaps
we postpone your vows.

751
00:59:07,404 --> 00:59:09,434
What? No. Why?

752
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,437
We're also concerned about
your attachment to Carlita.

753
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:14,909
Carlita?

754
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,581
- But...
- Cardinal Lawrence told me

755
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:19,777
about your troubles growing up.

756
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:22,018
Your hallucinations.

757
00:59:22,155 --> 00:59:27,181
Perhaps being around Carlita
is not what's right for you.

758
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,025
Carlita is disturbed.

759
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:35,156
And her illness
must not infect us

760
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:37,163
as her caretakers.

761
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:40,195
And clearly, it has.

762
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:43,500
Wait.

763
00:59:47,445 --> 00:59:48,943
I'm not ill.

764
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,316
I understand
how hard you had to work

765
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:54,149
to get to where you are.

766
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:56,986
It would be a shame
to give it all up now.

767
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:59,754
I am the only one
who cares about her.

768
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:00,958
You don't let her play

769
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,436
- with the other girls.
- I've told you...

770
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,903
- You keep her in the bad room.
- We're only doing

771
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:04,928
what's right for her.

772
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:06,491
The girl is sick in the head.

773
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:09,494
Because of you!

774
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:20,008
If there was any doubt
in our decision,

775
01:00:20,143 --> 01:00:22,141
you've all but confirmed it.

776
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:23,949
You're clearly unwell.

777
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,547
And, Margaret,

778
01:00:27,683 --> 01:00:30,815
you will keep your distance
from Carlita.

779
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,519
Or there will be consequences.

780
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:49,008
Stop the car, Luca.

781
01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:53,889
I can just walk home
from here, okay?

782
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:55,378
You don't have to wait.

783
01:00:57,046 --> 01:00:58,051
Paolo.

784
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,421
Paolo!

785
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,357
Paolo!

786
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,862
No, no, no.

787
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:07,490
<i>Lasciami stare,
ti pego, ti prego.</i>

788
01:01:09,597 --> 01:01:10,764
Paolo?

789
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:12,497
Just leave me alone, please.

790
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:13,660
Hey!

791
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,235
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

792
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,407
- Really, I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

793
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:20,338
Just stop following me!

794
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:27,544
Paolo, talk to me.

795
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,282
Just look for the mark.

796
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:59,776
Oh, okay.

797
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:02,548
All right. Oh, God. Okay.

798
01:02:02,683 --> 01:02:04,516
All right. Um...

799
01:02:04,652 --> 01:02:06,658
Hey, call an...
call an ambulance.

800
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:08,226
Call an ambulance.

801
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:10,321
- Help me.
- I'm gonna help you.

802
01:02:10,456 --> 01:02:12,656
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

803
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:13,912
I'm gonna help you.

804
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,836
- I can't move.
- I know.

805
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,261
- I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
- I know. Okay.

806
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,744
- I'm scared.
- Paolo,

807
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:22,014
you're gonna be fine, I promise.

808
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:23,174
I don't wanna die.

809
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,652
No, no, no.
You're not gonna die,

810
01:02:24,676 --> 01:02:26,758
you're gonna be okay.

811
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:30,048
You ready?

812
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,998
Oh, no, no.

813
01:02:46,336 --> 01:02:47,595
Oh, God.

814
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,801
Oh, God.

815
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,500
Oh, no, God.

816
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:12,517
Shh.

817
01:05:48,254 --> 01:05:53,828
<i>In no mine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

818
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,134
Amen.

819
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:37,639
<i>Deus,</i>

820
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:40,477
<i>benedice hunc anulum.</i>

821
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:45,246
<i>Da ut soror
quae induat altam fidem</i>

822
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:50,422
<i>in te ha beat et remaneat

823
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:53,894
<i>Accipe hunc anulum,</i>

824
01:06:54,031 --> 01:06:57,327
<i>nam aeterno Regi spondes.</i>

825
01:06:57,463 --> 01:06:59,664
<i>Serva fidem cum sponso tuo</i>

01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,536
<i>ut ad cenam nuptialem

827
01:07:05,103 --> 01:07:06,732
Amen.

828
01:07:06,867 --> 01:07:08,408
Amen.

829
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:58,779
Oh, god.

830
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:06,657
Come on.

831
01:12:07,394 --> 01:12:09,357
<i>Farfalla! Farfalla!</i>

832
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:10,759
Oh, God.

833
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,499
Carlita.

834
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,198
Come with me, Carlita.

835
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:32,980
Okay, you go to the bed.

836
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:44,361
I am so sorry
that I didn't believe you.

837
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:45,530
But I believe you now.

838
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,198
Okay?

839
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:48,499
I'm gonna keep you safe.

840
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:49,746
I'm gonna get you out of here.

841
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,302
Margaret.

842
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:53,098
Go, go, go. Over there.

843
01:12:58,914 --> 01:13:02,073
- Margaret.
- You stay away.

844
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:03,377
I know what you're doing.

845
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:05,315
We don't want to hurt you.
Just put that down.

846
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,287
I know what you've done
with the babies.

847
01:13:08,422 --> 01:13:10,455
You stay away! No!

848
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,453
You stay away from me!

849
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:17,567
- Remain calm!
- No, no, no!

850
01:13:36,344 --> 01:13:38,314
Please, please, I'm sorry.

851
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:40,614
No, no, no!

852
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,384
Not in there! Not in there!
Not in there!

853
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,628
No! No! No!

854
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:51,225
Let me out!

855
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,904
Please let me out!

856
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,041
Please!

857
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,896
Breathe. Breathe.

858
01:15:17,824 --> 01:15:20,657
<i>Crucifxus mortuu.</i>

859
01:15:20,793 --> 01:15:22,696
<i>Sede da divinum.</i>

860
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:23,976
Conviction:

861
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,300
I am wanted.
I have a task in history.

862
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:30,903
I am accepted.
It is good that I exist.

863
01:15:31,038 --> 01:15:32,473
It is good to be a human being.

864
01:15:35,442 --> 01:15:38,209
Let every human heart
experience your love.

865
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:31,301
It's not real.

866
01:16:31,438 --> 01:16:34,870
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

867
01:16:35,005 --> 01:16:36,287
What's not real?

868
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,737
Who said that?

869
01:17:44,514 --> 01:17:49,378
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

870
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:05,535
No!

871
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,804
Margaret. We have to go.

872
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,664
We have to go.
I found the files.

873
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,770
We have to go now.
It's just me.

874
01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:13,240
It's just me.

875
01:18:15,912 --> 01:18:17,080
Get me out of here.

876
01:18:17,616 --> 01:18:19,609
Yes. I know. I know.

877
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,854
All right, all right.

878
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:29,158
Father Gabriel. Margaret.

879
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:37,034
I don't understand.

880
01:18:39,637 --> 01:18:40,638
How?

881
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:45,108
Oh, well done, Margaret.
Well done.

882
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:47,512
Were you followed?

883
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:48,649
What? No.

884
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,913
I don't think so.

885
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:52,481
Luca, Margaret's driver,
brought us.

886
01:18:52,616 --> 01:18:55,350
We can trust him.
He's keeping watch outside.

887
01:18:55,954 --> 01:18:57,019
You two know each other?

888
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:58,482
- Yes.
- No.

889
01:18:58,618 --> 01:19:01,351
Uh, he tried approaching me.

890
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:03,028
I thought he was crazy.

891
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:06,130
It is crazy.

892
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:08,931
Carlita.

893
01:19:09,067 --> 01:19:10,068
We have to go get her.

894
01:19:10,135 --> 01:19:11,404
No, it's not safe.

895
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:12,733
Not safe?

896
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:14,250
She's the one who's not safe
right now, Gabriel.

897
01:19:14,274 --> 01:19:15,635
Margaret,
after what just happened,

898
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,006
they're not gonna let us
anywhere near that orphanage.

899
01:19:18,142 --> 01:19:19,344
Especially Carlita.

900
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,708
He's right.
It's only a matter of time

901
01:19:21,843 --> 01:19:23,711
before they realize
we've got these.

902
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:26,014
And when they do,
they will come for us.

903
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:27,347
We have to help her.

904
01:19:27,482 --> 01:19:28,920
The only path forward

905
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:31,016
is to prove what they've done.

906
01:19:31,152 --> 01:19:33,258
Otherwise, no one will believe
a word we say.

907
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:43,128
There's so many of them.

908
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:44,270
Yes.

909
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:46,107
Too many.

910
01:19:47,343 --> 01:19:50,243
I had no idea
they'd gone to such lengths.

911
01:19:56,612 --> 01:19:58,153
I don't understand.

912
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:00,154
They need a male.

913
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:03,818
They've only birthed females.

914
01:20:03,953 --> 01:20:05,920
They've all died
except for Carlita.

915
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:08,625
After all these years,
so many failures...

916
01:20:11,695 --> 01:20:12,763
They believe the only way

917
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:15,567
is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

918
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:36,954
What is this?

919
01:20:37,089 --> 01:20:39,221
I told you, it's the photo
from Carlita's birth.

920
01:20:39,357 --> 01:20:40,362
No.

921
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:42,166
This.

922
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:49,141
It's the mark.

923
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:51,472
Carlita doesn't have the mark
on her head.

924
01:20:53,945 --> 01:20:54,971
Hers is here.

925
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,647
What are you talking about?

926
01:20:56,783 --> 01:20:57,809
I've seen it.

927
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:02,453
You see? Carlita.

928
01:21:02,589 --> 01:21:03,948
No mark.

929
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:06,488
The baby in this photo
is not Carlita.

930
01:21:11,724 --> 01:21:13,099
What does that mean?

931
01:21:14,866 --> 01:21:15,867
Brennan?

932
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:17,632
I don't know.

933
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,216
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for,

934
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,342
then all we have to do

935
01:21:23,477 --> 01:21:25,276
is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

936
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:26,843
We must have missed something.

937
01:21:26,978 --> 01:21:28,015
Right?

938
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:52,875
Where is it?

939
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:55,210
Why do they all look like this?

940
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:58,312
The father.
He's not human.

941
01:22:32,609 --> 01:22:33,910
It's her.

942
01:22:37,991 --> 01:22:39,718
There was another survivor.

943
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,459
A sister?

944
01:22:43,996 --> 01:22:45,628
Did you know about this?

945
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:46,824
No.

946
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,431
They must have kept it
hidden away.

947
01:23:15,822 --> 01:23:20,663
Look for the mark.

948
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:24,733
How did he know?

949
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:28,935
He knew where it was.

950
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,378
Margaret, Margaret. Hush.

951
01:26:49,513 --> 01:26:51,814
Margaret. Margaret.

952
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,420
Margaret.

953
01:26:53,556 --> 01:26:55,020
Just let me have a look.

954
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:56,989
Let me look.

955
01:27:06,864 --> 01:27:07,902
Uh...

956
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:26,492
Somebody say something.

957
01:27:28,421 --> 01:27:30,498
How is that possible?

958
01:27:30,633 --> 01:27:31,966
She's been a ward of the Church

959
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,994
her entire life.

960
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:35,246
They must have moved her around

961
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:36,271
to cover their tracks.

962
01:27:37,372 --> 01:27:38,496
Carlita must be too young,

963
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:41,404
so they brought Margaret back
to Rome to...

964
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,741
To what?

965
01:27:45,442 --> 01:27:46,646
To what?

966
01:27:52,787 --> 01:27:54,313
I have to get out of here.

967
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:55,850
- You can't leave.
- Don't touch me.

968
01:27:55,955 --> 01:27:57,203
- Margaret...
- Don't you touch me!

969
01:27:57,227 --> 01:27:58,252
You can't just leave.

970
01:27:58,388 --> 01:28:00,859
Touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you!

971
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:13,971
I'm so sorry.

972
01:28:16,606 --> 01:28:19,946
I'm so sorry this is happening
to you, my child.

973
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:22,816
But nothing will change
if you decide to leave.

974
01:28:25,652 --> 01:28:26,847
It's June 6th.

975
01:28:26,982 --> 01:28:27,919
Midnight.

976
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,724
They will be coming for you.

977
01:28:34,829 --> 01:28:36,599
If this is true...

978
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:41,836
If I am pregnant...

979
01:28:44,267 --> 01:28:46,104
then I need it out of me.

980
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:50,145
I need it out of me now.

981
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:00,889
Margaret,

982
01:29:01,524 --> 01:29:03,154
you all right?

983
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:05,729
This doctor knows
what he's doing?

984
01:29:06,531 --> 01:29:08,359
He's experienced, yes.

985
01:29:36,194 --> 01:29:37,773
Wait. Stop.
What are you doing?

986
01:29:37,797 --> 01:29:39,027
Don't stop.

987
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:41,293
Make like you're heading
for the main road

988
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,826
and then turn off
before the arch.

989
01:29:55,382 --> 01:29:56,576
Margaret.

990
01:30:01,655 --> 01:30:03,257
What's happening to me?

991
01:33:47,387 --> 01:33:48,621
Hello?

992
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:50,623
Hello?

993
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:54,062
Can anyone hear me?

994
01:33:54,198 --> 01:33:55,859
Yes.

995
01:33:56,395 --> 01:33:57,465
I can hear.

996
01:34:01,372 --> 01:34:04,876
I can't tell
if this is real or not.

997
01:34:05,011 --> 01:34:09,180
This is very real, Margaret.

998
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,952
Can you untie me?

999
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,681
Soon.

1000
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:17,552
Soon it will be all over,
I promise.

1001
01:34:21,795 --> 01:34:22,796
No.

1002
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:25,062
- No, no.
- Oh. Oh...

1003
01:34:25,197 --> 01:34:27,299
You don't have to be afraid.

1004
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:30,939
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

1005
01:34:34,645 --> 01:34:36,308
I've watched over you

1006
01:34:37,145 --> 01:34:39,014
since you were a little girl.

1007
01:34:41,744 --> 01:34:43,745
The very first moment we met,

1008
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,417
do you remember
what I said to you?

1009
01:34:46,823 --> 01:34:47,957
That you, Margaret,

1010
01:34:48,093 --> 01:34:51,258
were the bravest girl
I'd ever known.

1011
01:34:52,162 --> 01:34:55,628
Now you know how special
you are to me.

1012
01:34:55,764 --> 01:34:56,765
To us.

1013
01:34:59,131 --> 01:35:03,699
The baby you're about to bear
will redeem the Church.

1014
01:35:03,835 --> 01:35:07,209
Will bring the people
back to God.

1015
01:35:08,978 --> 01:35:10,574
All because of you.

1016
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,676
Don't you understand, Margaret?

1017
01:35:14,286 --> 01:35:16,379
Your whole life,
you've been searching,

1018
01:35:16,514 --> 01:35:18,518
waiting for His voice.

1019
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,687
But the truth is...

1020
01:35:24,997 --> 01:35:28,429
He was always there with you.

1021
01:35:32,036 --> 01:35:35,007
He brought you here.

1022
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:39,011
He chose you.

1023
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,643
I... No.

1024
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:01,898
There.

1025
01:36:02,033 --> 01:36:03,997
You're ready now.

1026
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:07,470
Please know that I love you.

1027
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:12,475
I'll be right here.

1028
01:37:23,884 --> 01:37:25,130
Stay down.

1029
01:37:51,481 --> 01:37:54,253
No, no.

1030
01:37:54,722 --> 01:37:56,519
No, no. Please.

1031
01:38:08,332 --> 01:38:10,170
Please, please, please.

1032
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:11,766
No.

1033
01:38:13,808 --> 01:38:15,242
No, no, no.

1034
01:38:16,537 --> 01:38:17,541
No, please.

1035
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:22,542
Please.

1036
01:38:22,618 --> 01:38:23,713
Please.

1037
01:38:56,084 --> 01:38:57,649
Help me, please.

1038
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:00,822
Please help me. Please.

1039
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:02,456
Please untie me.

1040
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:05,620
Please untie me, I'm in pain.

1041
01:39:09,099 --> 01:39:11,598
I'm in pain. Please.

1042
01:39:13,897 --> 01:39:15,900
Help.

1043
01:39:16,841 --> 01:39:18,242
Help me, please.

1044
01:39:18,377 --> 01:39:20,508
Please help me.

1045
01:39:21,714 --> 01:39:22,715
Help me.

1046
01:39:23,344 --> 01:39:25,483
Help. I'm in pain.

1047
01:40:27,645 --> 01:40:29,977
What is it? A boy or girl?

1048
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:48,502
And the other?

1049
01:40:50,141 --> 01:40:51,539
A boy!

1050
01:40:55,475 --> 01:40:56,874
We have him.

1051
01:41:51,103 --> 01:41:54,534
<i>In no mine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

1052
01:42:00,014 --> 01:42:01,346
Help.

1053
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:03,949
- Help. Help.
- Of course.

1054
01:42:04,086 --> 01:42:05,144
Of course, my dear.

1055
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:07,018
- I'm in pain.
- Of course.

1056
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:13,790
Can I hold him?

1057
01:42:18,164 --> 01:42:19,333
You're sure?

1058
01:42:22,196 --> 01:42:24,702
I'm his mother.
I'm his mother.

1059
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:27,833
Bring him here.

1060
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:32,109
She's right.

1061
01:42:32,244 --> 01:42:37,183
It is important for a child
to bond with its mother.

1062
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:46,060
We all need the comfort
of our mothers

1063
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:47,495
in the beginning.

1064
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,464
Don't we?

1065
01:42:54,238 --> 01:42:56,604
You did so well, my child.

1066
01:43:03,415 --> 01:43:06,149
You are doing God's work.

1067
01:43:06,284 --> 01:43:08,748
He would be so proud of you.

1068
01:43:08,883 --> 01:43:11,252
Can't you hear Him telling you?

1069
01:43:11,388 --> 01:43:13,721
Don't you hear His voice?

1070
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:19,859
No.

1071
01:43:23,301 --> 01:43:25,228
No, I only hear my own.

1072
01:43:29,238 --> 01:43:30,640
No!

1073
01:43:58,337 --> 01:43:59,637
Margaret.

1074
01:44:01,273 --> 01:44:02,740
Stop this.

1075
01:44:05,212 --> 01:44:06,645
Margaret,

1076
01:44:07,446 --> 01:44:08,944
give me the baby.

1077
01:44:10,384 --> 01:44:12,311
Just give me the baby.

1078
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:24,360
No!

1079
01:44:48,124 --> 01:44:49,454
Burn everything.

1080
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:51,319
Leave them both to die.

1081
01:46:18,277 --> 01:46:19,279
It's okay.

1082
01:48:09,697 --> 01:48:11,668
The man you are looking for.

1083
01:48:11,804 --> 01:48:14,070
The US Ambassador to Rome.

1084
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,809
He will be the new father.

1085
01:48:18,444 --> 01:48:21,641
<i>He and his wife will suffer
a tragic loss,</i>

1086
01:48:21,776 --> 01:48:23,575
<i>and be in need of a child.</i>

1087
01:48:27,188 --> 01:48:29,718
<i>The boy will inherit
their privilege</i>

1088
01:48:29,854 --> 01:48:31,121
<i>and power.</i>

1089
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,589
<i>Soon, his darkness will spread</i>

1090
01:48:37,865 --> 01:48:40,901
<i>and the world shall be saved.</i>

1091
01:49:17,074 --> 01:49:19,107
Baby, you're supposed
to eat them.

1092
01:49:19,243 --> 01:49:21,244
You're supposed to
eat them like...

1093
01:49:21,379 --> 01:49:22,380
Like that.

1094
01:49:25,749 --> 01:49:27,180
What are you doing?

1095
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:30,316
Come here.

1096
01:49:34,922 --> 01:49:36,454
No, no, no. Here.

1097
01:49:37,527 --> 01:49:38,528
This.

1098
01:49:38,596 --> 01:49:39,659
No, not this.

1099
01:49:39,796 --> 01:49:40,926
You want one?

1100
01:49:42,525 --> 01:49:43,526
You want it?

1101
01:49:45,101 --> 01:49:46,469
Give it to Mama.
Give it to Mama.

1102
01:49:46,604 --> 01:49:47,605
Give it to Mama.

1103
01:50:09,424 --> 01:50:11,260
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

1104
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,935
I tried just to leave you be.

1105
01:50:19,638 --> 01:50:21,138
You need to go.

1106
01:50:21,808 --> 01:50:24,339
Now.

1107
01:50:25,141 --> 01:50:26,639
I came to warn you.

1108
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:29,477
They know you're alive.

1109
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:31,880
You weren't supposed to survive.

1110
01:50:32,016 --> 01:50:33,486
None of you were.

1111
01:50:33,622 --> 01:50:35,186
Especially the girl.

1112
01:50:38,193 --> 01:50:39,960
She'll be important, Margaret.

1113
01:50:42,591 --> 01:50:44,261
I just want to be left alone.

1114
01:50:45,896 --> 01:50:47,132
I know.

1115
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:50,664
But they will come for you.

1116
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:10,487
They've even given it a name.

1117
01:51:12,354 --> 01:51:13,626
Your son.

1118
01:51:15,996 --> 01:51:17,099
Damien.
