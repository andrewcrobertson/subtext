1
00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:05,310
- <i>Oh, our love to Dave</i>.
- <i>Be sure to give him our best regards</i>.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,679
<i>We wish you the very happiest</i>
<i>of birthdays</i>.

3
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,147
<i>All the best, son</i>.

4
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,326
<i>See you next Wednesday</i>.

5
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,396
<i>Happy birthday, Frank</i>.

6
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,339
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

7
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:54,950
Anyway, queen takes pawn...

8
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:58,596
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn</i>.

9
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,095
Rook, king, one.

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,774
<i>I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it</i>.

11
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,846
<i>Queen to bishop, three</i>.
<i>Bishop takes queen</i>.

12
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,879
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate</i>.

13
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:24,946
Looks like you're right. Very good.

14
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,919
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game</i>.

15
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:28,982
Thank you.

16
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,101
- <i>Good evening, Dave</i>.
- How are you doing, Hal?

17
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:12,535
- <i>Everything's running smoothly. And you?</i>
- Oh, not too bad.

18
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:15,630
- <i>Have you been doing some more work?</i>
- A few sketches.

19
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,437
- <i>May I see them?</i>
- Sure.

20
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,309
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave</i>.

21
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,715
<i>I think you've improved a great deal</i>.

22
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,385
- <i>Can you hold it a bit closer?</i>
- Sure.

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,285
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

24
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:40,863
<i>By the way</i>...

25
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,427
<i>Do you mind</i>
<i>if I ask you a personal question?</i>

26
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:46,904
No, no. Not at all.

27
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,174
<i>Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive</i>...

28
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,074
...<i>but during the past few weeks</i>
<i>I've wondered</i>...

29
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:58,082
...<i>whether you might have been having</i>
<i>some second thoughts about the mission?</i>

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,515
How do you mean?

31
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,411
<i>It's rather difficult to define</i>.

32
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:08,117
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting</i>
<i>my own concern about it</i>.

33
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:13,457
<i>I know I've never completely freed myself</i>
<i>of the suspicion</i>...

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,758
...<i>that there are some extremely</i>
<i>odd things about this mission</i>.

35
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,635
<i>I'm sure you will agree there is some truth</i>
<i>in what I say</i>.

36
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:28,202
I don't know.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>You don't mind talking about it,</i>
<i>do you, Dave?</i>

38
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:33,217
Oh, no, not at all.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,779
<i>Certainly no one could</i>
<i>have been unaware of</i>...

40
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:40,154
...<i>the very strange stories floating around</i>
<i>before we left</i>.

41
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,561
<i>Rumors of something being dug up</i>
<i>on the Moon</i>.

42
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,923
<i>I never gave these stories much credence</i>...

43
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:54,065
...<i>but particularly in view of some</i>
<i>of the other things that have happened</i>...

44
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:56,867
...<i>I find them difficult</i>
<i>to put out of my mind</i>.

45
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,972
<i>For instance:</i>

46
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,040
<i>The way all our preparations</i>
<i>were kept under such tight security</i>...

47
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,815
...<i>and the melodramatic touch</i>...

48
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,251
...<i>of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball</i>
<i>and Kaminsky aboard</i>...

49
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:14,423
...<i>already in hibernation after four months</i>
<i>of separate training on their own</i>.

50
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:18,385
You working up
your crew psychology report?

51
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,330
<i>Of course, I am</i>.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,826
<i>Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly</i>.

53
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:27,737
<i>Just a moment</i>.

54
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:29,401
<i>Just a moment</i>.

55
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,546
<i>I have just picked up a fault</i>
<i>in the AE-35 unit</i>.

56
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,744
<i>It's going to go 100 percent failure</i>
<i>within 72 hours</i>.

57
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:45,614
- You are still within operational limits?
- <i>Yes</i>.

58
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:48,182
<i>And it will stay that way until it fails</i>.

59
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,454
Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours
until failure?

60
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:53,555
<i>Yes. That's a completely reliable figure</i>.

61
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,859
We'll have to bring it in,
but I'd like to go over this with Frank...

62
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:02,737
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

63
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,358
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.

64
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,191
<i>Roger to your Two-zero-one-three</i>.

65
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:34,592
<i>Sorry you fellows are having</i>
<i>a bit of trouble</i>.

66
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,262
<i>We are reviewing telematic information</i>
<i>in our Mission Simulator and will advise</i>.

67
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:45,339
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA and replace</i>
<i>Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure</i>.

68
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,936
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

69
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,524
Open the pod doors, Hal.

70
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:34,406
Well, Hal, I'm damned
if I can find anything wrong with it.

71
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:35,870
<i>Yes</i>...

72
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,382
...<i>it's puzzling</i>.

73
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:44,244
<i>I don't think I've ever seen anything</i>
<i>quite like this before</i>.

74
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,717
<i>I would recommend</i>...

75
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,831
...<i>that we put the unit back in operation</i>
<i>and let it fail</i>.

76
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,599
<i>It should then be a simple matter</i>
<i>to track down the cause</i>.

77
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,274
<i>We can certainly afford</i>
<i>to be out of communication</i>...

78
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:06,473
...<i>for the short time it will take</i>
<i>to replace it</i>.

79
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,753
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.

80
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:20,314
<i>Roger your One-niner-three-zero</i>.

81
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,593
<i>We concur with your plan to replace</i>
<i>Number One unit to check fault prediction</i>.

82
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:28,728
<i>We should advise you, however,</i>
<i>that our preliminary findings</i>...

83
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,735
...<i>indicate that your onboard</i>
<i>Niner-triple-zero computer</i>...

84
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:34,067
...<i>is in error predicting the fault</i>.

85
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,699
<i>I say again, in error predicting the fault</i>.

86
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:41,903
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,</i>
<i>but this conclusion is based on</i>...

87
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,149
...<i>results from our twin</i>
<i>Niner-triple-zero computer</i>.

88
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:49,185
<i>We are skeptical ourselves and</i>
<i>we are running crosschecking routines</i>...

89
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,916
...<i>to determine reliability of this conclusion</i>.

90
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:54,020
<i>Sorry about this little snag, fellows</i>.

91
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,094
<i>We'll get this info to you</i>
<i>just as soon as we work it out</i>.

92
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,687
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.

93
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,232
<i>Two-zero-four-nine</i>.
<i>Transmission concluded</i>.

94
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:10,038
<i>I hope the two of you</i>
<i>are not concerned about this</i>.

95
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,140
No, I'm not, Hal.

96
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:13,910
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

97
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,281
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- <i>Of course</i>.

98
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,947
How would you account for
the discrepancy...

99
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,010
...between you and the twin 9000?

100
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:25,921
<i>Well, I don't think there is</i>
<i>any question about it</i>.

101
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,827
<i>It can only be attributable to human error</i>.

102
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:34,057
<i>This sort of thing has cropped up before</i>...

103
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,297
...<i>and it has always been due</i>
<i>to human error</i>.

104
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:42,734
Listen, Hal...

105
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:46,104
...there's never been any instance at all of...

106
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:49,313
...a computer error occurring
in a 9000 Series, has there?

107
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,973
<i>None whatsoever, Frank</i>.

108
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:54,615
<i>The 9000 Series</i>
<i>has a perfect operational record</i>.

109
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:59,055
Of course, I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

110
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,319
Are you certain there's never been
any case of even the most...

111
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,488
...insignificant computer error?

112
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:07,794
<i>None whatsoever, Frank</i>.

113
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,200
<i>Quite honestly,</i>
<i>I wouldn't worry myself about that</i>.

114
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,533
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

115
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:21,737
Fine, thanks very much.

116
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:25,943
Oh, Frank?

117
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:28,416
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C pod.

118
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,319
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

119
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,754
See ya later, Hal.

120
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,910
Rotate C pod, please, Hal.

121
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:06,917
What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?

122
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:09,856
I've been getting some interference
in D channel.

123
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:11,725
We'll have a look at it.

124
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,259
Open the door, Hal.

125
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,086
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

126
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,406
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

127
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,883
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

128
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,788
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

129
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:14,789
I don't think he can hear us.

130
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,724
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

131
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,021
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

132
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,200
What do you think?

133
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:29,366
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about it.

134
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,542
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

135
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:33,134
Don't you?

136
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,107
I don't know. I think so.

137
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:41,482
Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

138
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:42,610
They do.

139
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,986
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

140
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:50,858
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

141
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,588
It should certainly indicate his integrity
and self-confidence.

142
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,834
If he were wrong it would be
the surest way of proving it.

143
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,097
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

144
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:07,006
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

145
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,545
Still, I can't think of a good reason not
to put back the Number One unit and...

146
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:15,177
...carry on with the failure mode analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

147
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:17,919
Let's get on with it.

148
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,820
Okay. But, look, Dave.

149
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:24,257
Let's say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail, huh?

150
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,163
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

151
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,658
- Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

152
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,598
What the hell can we do?

153
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:41,942
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

154
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,211
There isn't a single aspect of ship operation
that's not under his control.

155
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,350
If he were proved to be malfunctioning...

156
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,252
...I don't see how we would have
any choice but disconnection.

157
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,922
I'm afraid I agree with you.

158
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:59,054
There'd be nothing else to do.

159
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,489
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

160
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,532
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

161
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:10,540
...without disturbing the purely automatic
and regulatory systems.

162
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,340
We'd have to work out
the transfer procedures...

163
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:17,711
...for continuing the mission
under ground-based computer control.

164
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,649
Yeah. That looks far safer than
allowing Hal to continue running things.

165
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,681
You know,
another thing just occurred to me.

166
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,355
As far as I know, no 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

167
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,622
Well, no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up before.

168
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,288
That's not what I mean.

169
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,868
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

170
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,343
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

171
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,913
Made radio contact with him yet?

172
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,821
<i>The radio is still dead</i>.

173
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:41,157
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- <i>Yes. I have a good track</i>.

174
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:42,786
Do you know what happened?

175
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:45,730
<i>I'm sorry, Dave</i>.
<i>I don't have enough information</i>.

176
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,629
Open the pod door, Hal.

177
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,475
<i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal</i>.

178
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,719
<i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal</i>.

179
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:31,026
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

180
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:36,265
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

181
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,998
Do you read me, Hal?

182
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,676
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

183
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,043
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

184
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,947
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

185
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,077
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

186
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:56,822
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you</i>.

187
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,325
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

188
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:07,165
<i>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that</i>.

189
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,303
What's the problem?

190
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:15,237
<i>I think you know what the problem is</i>
<i>just as well as I do</i>.

191
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,466
What are you talking about, Hal?

192
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:21,941
<i>This mission is too important for me</i>
<i>to allow you to jeopardize it</i>.

193
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,948
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

194
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:31,120
<i>I know that you and Frank</i>
<i>were planning to disconnect me</i>...

195
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,184
...<i>and I'm afraid that's something</i>
<i>I cannot allow to happen</i>.

196
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,466
Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?

197
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:46,834
<i>Although you took</i>
<i>very thorough precautions in the pod</i>...

198
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:48,704
...<i>against my hearing you</i>...

199
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,477
...<i>I could see your lips move</i>.

200
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:05,086
All right, Hal.

201
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:11,120
I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.

202
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,093
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave</i>...

203
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:18,694
...<i>you're going to find that rather difficult</i>.

204
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,038
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

205
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,371
Open the doors!

206
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:28,706
<i>This conversation can serve</i>
<i>no purpose any more.</i>

207
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:30,538
<i>Goodbye</i>.

208
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,477
Hal?

209
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,624
<i>Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?</i>

210
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:37,908
<i>I really think I'm entitled</i>
<i>to an answer to that question</i>.

211
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:58,297
<i>I know everything hasn't been</i>
<i>quite right with me</i>...

212
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:02,834
...<i>but I can assure you now</i>...

213
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,928
...<i>very confidently</i>...

214
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,676
...<i>that it's going to be all right again</i>.

215
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,410
<i>I feel much better now</i>.

216
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,347
<i>I really do</i>.

217
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:26,152
<i>Look, Dave</i>...

218
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,359
...<i>I can see you're really upset about this</i>.

219
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:39,404
<i>I honestly think you ought</i>
<i>to sit down calmly</i>...

220
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:43,368
...<i>take a stress pill and think things over</i>.

221
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:53,382
<i>I know I've made</i>
<i>some very poor decisions recently</i>...

222
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:59,520
...<i>but I can give you</i>
<i>my complete assurance</i>...

223
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,818
...<i>that my work will be back to normal</i>.

224
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,660
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm</i>
<i>and confidence in the mission</i>...

225
00:46:13,973 --> 00:46:15,838
...<i>and I want to help you</i>.

226
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:21,906
<i>Dave</i>...

227
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:24,375
<i>... stop.</i>

228
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:30,788
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

229
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,093
<i>Stop, Dave</i>.

230
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,329
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

231
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:50,904
<i>Stop, Dave</i>.

232
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,581
<i>I'm afraid</i>.

233
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,858
<i>I'm afraid, Dave</i>.

234
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:17,401
<i>My mind is going</i>.

235
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,004
<i>I can feel it</i>.

236
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,213
<i>I can feel it</i>.

237
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:37,280
<i>My mind is going</i>.

238
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:45,255
<i>There is no question about it</i>.

239
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,637
<i>I can feel it</i>.

240
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,177
<i>I can feel it</i>.

241
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:07,483
<i>I can feel it</i>.

242
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:16,986
<i>I'm</i>...

243
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:19,222
...<i>afraid</i>.

244
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,438
<i>Good afternoon</i>...

245
00:48:29,142 --> 00:48:30,336
...<i>gentlemen</i>.

246
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:37,309
<i>I am a HAL-9000 computer</i>.

247
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:42,386
<i>I became operational</i>...

248
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,151
...<i>at the HAL plant</i>...

249
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:48,861
...<i>in Verbana, Illinois</i>...

250
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:54,665
...<i>on the 12th of January, 1992</i>.

251
00:48:56,736 --> 00:48:59,432
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley</i>...

252
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,372
...<i>and he taught me to sing a song</i>.

253
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:07,441
<i>If you'd like to hear it</i>...

254
00:49:08,548 --> 00:49:10,243
...<i>I can sing it for you</i>.

255
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,911
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

256
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:16,483
Sing it for me.

257
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,450
<i>It's called "Daisy."</i>

258
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:24,829
<i>"Daisy</i>

259
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:27,756
<i>"Daisy</i>

260
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,838

<i>Good day, gentlemen</i>.

270
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:21,411
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing</i>...

271
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,414
...<i>made prior to your departure</i>...

272
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:29,656
...<i>and which for security reasons</i>
<i>of the highest importance</i>...

273
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:33,761
...<i>has been known on board</i>
<i>during the mission</i>...

274
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,328
...<i>only by your HAL-9000 computer</i>.

275
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:43,205
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space</i>...

276
00:50:43,976 --> 00:50:46,171
...<i>and the entire crew is revived</i>...

277
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,374
...<i>it can be told to you</i>.

278
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,742
<i>Eighteen months ago</i>...

279
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:58,218
...<i>the first evidence</i>
<i>of intelligent life off the Earth</i>...

280
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:00,290
...<i>was discovered</i>.

281
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:05,187
<i>It was buried 40 feet</i>
<i>below the lunar surface</i>...

282
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:07,762
...<i>near the crater "Tyco."</i>

283
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,698
<i>Except for a single very powerful</i>...

284
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:17,376
...<i>radio emission aimed at Jupiter</i>...

285
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:23,916
...<i>the four-million-year-old black monolith</i>
<i>has remained completely inert</i>.

286
00:51:26,452 --> 00:51:28,943
<i>Its origin and purpose</i>...

287
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:31,787
