1
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:54,472
Simon Magus was a
magician and a sorcerer in...

2
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,935
- Hmm...
- In Sumeria.

3
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,605
And what happened to
Simon Magus, Bartolo?

4
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:08,236
Jesus' disciples performed miracles.
When Simon Magus saw the miracles

5
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,280
he offered Peter gold for God's powers.

6
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,200
And how did Peter respond?

7
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,078
John Rossi?

8
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,373
Stand up.

9
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,714
Answer my question, John Rossi.

10
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,176
That's not my name.

11
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:36,806
You and all the other bastards
lucky enough to be here,

12
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:43,396
children of sin, spawn of the
damned, are all named for saints!

13
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,899
Saints who were disciplined.

14
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,901
Saints who were chaste.

15
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,989
You were named for John Baptist Rossi,

16
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,826
a Capuchin priest who gave
away all his possessions.

17
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,872
A man who had nothing, like you.

18
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:07,586
Now what is your
name, you ungrateful cur?

19
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,351
Your name, boy!

20
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:29,066
Have you lost your
tongue? What is your name?

21
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:41,662
All the girls will remain
locked in their dormitory

22
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,623
and no food will be served to any boy

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,087
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

24
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,904
Food, food, food!

25
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,842
Wow.

26
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:07,748
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

27
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,710
No. Simon Templar.

28
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,682
Agnes!

29
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,977
Agnes!

30
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,360
Agnes!

31
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,746
- What are you doing?
- Agnes!

32
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,173
When they catch you, they'll cane you.

33
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,556
It won't happen, because
we're leaving tonight,

34
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,219
this hardy brotherhood, on a crusade.

35
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,432
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love, to bid you farewell.

36
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,727
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss, can I?

37
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,896
Hey, watch this.

38
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,832
We've lost some girls!
The girls are missing!

39
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,336
There are girls missing!
Come on, boys, hurry up.

40
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,005
Hurry up! Come on, hurry!

41
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,181
Wait, John Rossi, my kiss.

42
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,689
There he is! Get him!

43
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,212
<i>October 3rd, entering
foyer of Tretiak Industries.</i>

44
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,967
<i>Heavy security in the
elevators. Guards in uniform.</i>

45
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,762
<i>Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate pass key.</i>

46
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,392
<i>Maybe use stairs. No traffic there.</i>

47
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,480
<i>October 4th. Personal tidbits.</i>

48
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,234
<i>Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.</i>

49
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,196
<i>It left Tretiak the sole
owner of gas and oil empire.</i>

50
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,493
<i>Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.</i>

51
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,329
Who are you?

52
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,958
<i>Vehicle was driven by
younger son, Ilya, now 27.</i>

53
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,087
<i>Wife now lives in Geneva following
an assassination attempt in 1996.</i>

54
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,299
- I'm Ivan Ivanovich.
<i>- No other children.</i>

55
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:08,262
<i>October 5th. Ilya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado with Bandido buddies.</i>

56
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,557
<i>Gangster rap coffee
flirting with teenage girls.</i>

57
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>Small firearms in coats,
machine pistols in cars.</i>

58
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,439
<i>...compulsory military service.</i>

59
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,235
<i>Family company employs
all four as fix-it guys...</i>

60
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:39,311
<i>There were three great
empires that dominated the world,</i>

61
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,439
<i>both culturally and militarily:</i>

62
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:47,528
<i>Rome, Constantinople and Russia.</i>

63
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:52,991
<i>All three have fallen.
Only one can be restored.</i>

64
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,704
<i>And only one man can restore it:</i>

65
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,374
<i>Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!</i>

66
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:28,485
<i>Friends. Countrymen. Russians!</i>

67
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,913
<i>You people here in this room...</i>

68
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,167
<i>are the cream of Russia.</i>

69
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:48,380
<i>And the whole nation
is listening with us.</i>

70
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,050
<i>But why do you all listen to me rave?</i>

71
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,764
<i>Set aside my oil company,
forget about my best-selling book,</i>

72
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,771
<i>And all I am is a lunatic
haunted by the fantasy</i>

73
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:10,152
<i>of an empire that reclaims her
former might, her former size.</i>

74
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:20,204
<i>All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of Russia</i>

75
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,292
<i>not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth!</i>

76
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,924
<i>Not ridiculed, but revered!</i>

77
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:38,430
<i>No, more than revered. Feared!</i>

78
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:53,153
<i>But who am I to dazzle you
with this dream? All I've done...</i>

79
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,408
How does it look for the leader's son
to walk out when the leader speaks?

80
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,539
You'd prefer the leader's son to
piss his pants on live TV, hmm?

81
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,545
<i>And still the people freeze to death!</i>

82
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,398
I love this country.

83
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,325
I don't speak Russian.

84
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:50,747
In that case, stand up, put
your hands behind your head

85
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,667
and turn around slowly.

86
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,383
Wrong place for a condom. Take it off.

87
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:13,145
Listen, if I give this to you,
you're gonna give it to your daddy.

88
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,232
And what's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

89
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,399
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me a million dollars.

90
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,821
If we partner, we'll split 50-50,

91
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,854
that's half a million in hard currency.

92
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,576
Think of the drugs you
could buy with that much cake.

93
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,579
You'll be discoing for a
decade in Moscow, mate.

94
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:35,292
I don't need your small
change. That's your first problem.

95
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,794
Here is your second.

96
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,590
Microchip, please.

97
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,304
- Freeze!
- Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

98
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,807
Suck me sideways.

99
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,928
My eyes!

100
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,033
Give it up!

101
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,916
You've got no place to go!

102
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,765
A goddamn button!

103
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,485
Back of the building! Come on!

104
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,252
- Where's the body?
- No body. Just some guy in rags.

105
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,779
<i>As the bitter chill of winter
descends on Moscow,</i>

106
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,365
<i>Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric</i>

107
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,909
<i>of former communist boss Ivan Tretiak.</i>

108
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,703
<i>Now, a billionaire oil magnate</i>

109
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>and leader of his own political party,</i>

110
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,251
<i>Tretiak predicted that the
civil unrest engulfing Russia</i>

111
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,434
<i>will only worsen unless reformist
President Karpov can overcome</i>

112
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,385
<i>the heating oil shortage that has
already killed scores of Russians.</i>

113
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,889
<i>In his speech today, Tretiak called
on elements of the Russian army</i>

114
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,810
<i>who are opposed to the elected
government, to seize control</i>

115
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,104
<i>and end the heating oil crisis...</i>

116
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,647
What beautiful work.

117
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,818
<i>...angry siege at the American embassy.</i>

118
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:34,155
<i>Fired by Tretiak's attacks on U.
S. Foreign policy, the protesters...</i>

119
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,535
Huh. Cloisonné. It is old.

120
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,496
Yes. It belonged to my grandmother.

121
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,251
Please.

122
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:55,010
Tonight I feel like the
oldest person on this plane.

123
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,972
My husband, he's sending me to England

124
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,641
to live until things change.

125
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,103
You are married not even a year

126
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,648
and already this
bastard has a girlfriend!

127
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,193
I'm sorry, it's not my business.

128
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,450
How come you know so much about me?

129
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,618
It is a gift.

130
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,373
I am Martin de Porres.

131
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,543
I'm from Spain, but I'm
named for a Peruvian saint

132
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:33,214
who could cure the sick or the
injured by the laying of hands.

133
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,482
He's the same build as the
description the Russians gave us,

134
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,650
but he doesn't sound like an Aussie.

135
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,448
He could be faking it.

136
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:10,210
<i>X-rays are clear, he hasn't
swallowed the microchip. Anything?</i>

137
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,172
<i>You English with your fish and
chips. On the plane I have chicken.</i>

138
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,843
Van Gogh theft, Netherlands,
last year. Same eyes.

139
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,387
Different chin.

140
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,224
Halcyon Hotel, sir.

141
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,570
<i>Stand up! What is your name?</i>

142
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,572
<i>Answer the question!</i>

143
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,368
<i>What is your name... Name... Name...</i>

144
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,542
<i>Hey, Lou. The microchip arrived.</i>

145
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,377
<i>I put the dough in your Swiss account.</i>

146
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,296
Sorry I didn't get back to
you about the diamonds.

147
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,047
But Moscow's like Dodge City now.

148
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,383
All them greedy commies
have turned into capitalists.

149
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,417
It's disgusting. It's made them sloppy.

150
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,347
One or two more easy score, I
top 50 mill, I'm out of the game.

151
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,600
<i>- Yeah, I heard that before.</i>
- Not from me.

152
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,519
I don't know nothing. If you
don't believe me, try and find me.

153
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,521
<i>- Fuck you, Lou!</i>
- Cheers.

154
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,904
I can't seem to break 50.

155
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,875
"One million U.S.
dollars, non-refundable..."

156
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:00,838
"Reserves you a quiet table at
a romantic little spot in Berlin"

157
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,760
"called Templehof, which
has a cozy transit lounge."

158
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,013
<i>"To get inside, you walk
through the metal detectors,"</i>

159
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,147
<i>"and I walk through the metal detectors."</i>

160
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:15,270
<i>"And since you know I'm not
armed and I know you're not armed,"</i>

161
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,481
<i>"we can both fall in love
and nobody gets hurt."</i>

162
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,373
- I can't see him.
- Then look for him.

163
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,002
You have a long, beautiful cane.

164
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,546
Along with your beautiful eyes.

165
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,843
That photograph doesn't do you justice.

166
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,887
- Who are you?
- My name is Bruno Hautenfaust.

167
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,224
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

168
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,853
Had the wine, the women, the
songs, and then, inexplicably,

169
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,397
took a vow of poverty and became a hermit

170
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,483
went off to live in
the forest, in the nude.

171
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,193
Please leave.

172
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,323
I represent the professional you hired.

173
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,868
I'm his business
manager. I speak for him.

174
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:16,122
We don't deal with underlings.
Come on, Father, let's go.

175
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,918
Wait, sit down. Listen and learn.

176
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,503
Ah, youth.

177
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:32,263
Who runs this thief? CIA? MI-6? Libya?

178
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,892
He's not a race car, nobody runs
him. He's an independent contractor.

179
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,437
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

180
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:45,485
Oh, yes, I can have a man
killed and stroll away like that.

181
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,906
Even with metal detectors.
Even in this transit lounge.

182
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,038
It's so early. You guys want to
get some coffee or something?

183
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,957
Sure.

184
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,421
Be quiet.

185
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,132
What is it you request of my employer?

186
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,053
- Do you know what cold fusion is?
- Of course.

187
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,808
It's the theory of nuclear
fusion at room temperature.

188
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,727
- Free energy forever.
- Yes.

189
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,193
As far as science goes, it
ranks just above astrology.

190
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,320
Those who claim to have achieved it,

191
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,572
have never been able to duplicate it.

192
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,241
Until now.

193
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,454
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

194
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,085
We believe that this good lady
made a breakthrough in cold fusion.

195
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,339
Your employer will
obtain the formula for me.

196
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,718
He's very busy. And you're very boring.

197
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,053
Your offer must inspire him.

198
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,931
This woman has repeatedly avoided

199
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,309
my agents' attempts to find the formula.

200
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,062
She's cagey, difficult.

201
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,899
Maybe your agents are stupid.

202
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:15,116
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

203
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,369
- Ridiculous.
- Why?

204
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,622
You'll have the world market in energy.

205
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,376
Cost you a nickel for every million
you make. His deposit should go...

206
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,298
Hey, it is not for me.
It is for Mother Russia.

207
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,302
But you want Mother
Russia too, Mr. Tretiak.

208
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,848
Three million on deposit in a
bank account in Zurich. Agreed?

209
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,726
Yes.

210
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:47,398
And, uh, how long to get
your employer's agreement?

211
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,775
I'll ask.

212
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,793
Your offer has inspired her. I'll do it.

213
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,297
Bank account number in Zurich.

214
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,510
- Bye, sonny.
- Bye-bye.

215
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,973
I really love this guy.

216
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:28,231
- Too bad we have to kill him.
- Yeah, too bad.

217
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,459
<i>When the electro-chemists Hans
and Fleischman announced in 1989</i>

218
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,504
<i>that they had discovered cold fusion,</i>

219
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,466
<i>a revolutionary process
of generating energy,</i>

220
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,720
They were at first acclaimed as geniuses,

221
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,431
and then condemned as charlatans.

222
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,644
The protocols of cold fusion...

223
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,855
What are those? Drugs?

224
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,484
Can I have one? My head is
pounding. She's boring the life out of me.

225
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,154
- They're for my heart.
- Oh.

226
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:22,535
You have very pretty eyes. Pretty lady.

227
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,328
- Who are you?
- Me?

228
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,945
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

229
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,625
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

230
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,296
You don't put any stock in this
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

231
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,881
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

232
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,675
Dr. Emma Russell!

233
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,517
Oops.

234
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:56,611
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

235
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,529
Um, I'm more interested

236
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:02,366
in what questions you
all have about cold fusion.

237
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,120
So I thought we would start
with those. Any questions?

238
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,168
- Please?
- Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.

239
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:17,381
Can you explain the actual process
of fusion? You know, the theory?

240
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,301
Yes. There it is.

241
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,721
This is the apparatus.

242
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,893
And very simply, when
positively charged deuterons

243
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,479
are attracted to the palladium cathode,

244
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,522
they cram together.

245
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,110
There are millions and millions
of them getting closer and closer,

246
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:43,115
and then they fuse. And they
create energy in the form of helium.

247
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:47,286
But I read that the experiment
couldn't be replicated. So...

248
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,374
- How do we know it works?
- Well, we don't.

249
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,709
Not yet.

250
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,548
But if you remember, Einstein, he
knew the theory of relativity to be true

251
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,219
long before he could
prove it. He felt the truth.

252
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:08,307
And some of us feel the
same way about cold fusion.

253
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,726
Because it's there, it's in nature,

254
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:15,272
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

255
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:20,111
And when we ignite that cold fusion fire,

256
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,697
I mean, just imagine...

257
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,159
There's more energy in
one cubic mile of sea water

258
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,329
than in all the known
oil reserves on Earth.

259
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:37,086
You could drive your car 55 million
miles on a gallon of heavy water.

260
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:42,800
It would be the end of pollution.
Warmth for the whole world.

261
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,555
So why don't I, uh, demonstrate for you

262
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:51,892
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

263
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,979
They use very complex...

264
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,191
<i>November 17th, 11.30 a.m.</i>

265
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:03,779
<i>Entering flat of Dr. Emma
Russell, High Street, Oxford.</i>

266
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,241
<i>No alarms on outer doors. Strange.</i>

267
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,326
<i>No messages.</i>

268
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,042
<i>Shelley monument.</i>

269
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,129
<i>Entering bathroom.</i>

270
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,214
<i>Books.</i>

271
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,427
<i>More books.</i>

272
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,767
<i>Walls covered with reminder notes.</i>

273
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,145
<i>Poetry.</i>

274
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:49,950
Aw...

275
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,203
Dad.

276
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,365
"Stop and talk to Shelley every day.
How can I love a man named Percy?"

277
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:37,248
"Isn't there someone in the world
who can consume me like that?"

278
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,709
"Magic. Romantic."

279
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,887
No recent applications.
Cold fusion notes.

280
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,567
"Although I pass the
Shelley monument every day,"

281
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,028
"its sadness strikes me every time."

282
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,313
"For some reason, I feel a very
personal loss when I look at it."

283
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,743
"So much pain and so much passion."

284
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,585
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness,"

285
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,212
"and in the shadow of death."

286
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,674
"Luke 1, Verse 79."

287
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,094
Tretiak's wrong, she's not cagey.

288
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:37,183
She's not difficult,
she's just eccentric.

289
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,685
She's innocent.

290
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,402
Maybe it's in her head.

291
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,572
She needs a poet.

292
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,532
An artist.

293
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,413
Someone who understands truth.

294
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,547
She needs Thomas Moore.

295
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,388
Do you like it?

296
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,727
- What?
- The sculpture. Do you like it?

297
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,438
Oh...

298
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,482
Yes.

299
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,985
What do you love about it?

300
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,873
The way it... glows.

301
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:32,047
And how the light holds him in silence,

302
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,551
taking care of him.

303
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,596
Yeah, that's what I like about it.

304
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,811
- Are you an artist?
- No.

305
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:50,482
Just a traveler searching for purity.

306
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,194
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

307
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,571
Yes.

308
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,744
Have you ever been on a long journey?

309
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,496
No, not really.

310
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,336
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home in Africa.

311
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:16,508
You should experience the
energy of where all life began.

312
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,975
Sorry, I'm not very good with people.

313
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,898
Me neither.

314
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,388
"I see my angel for the first time."

315
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,849
"Know my purpose, feel my birth."

316
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,145
"Hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly,"

317
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,732
"The sweet strains of our union,"

318
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,486
"Our love heats up the cold universe"

319
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,656
"And gives my tired, desperate heart..."

320
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,161
...are eternally healed.

321
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,708
- Do you like it?
- Who did you write it for?

322
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,794
You.

323
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,631
You're following me or it's destiny.

324
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:42,136
- Either way, it's weird.
- Very weird.

325
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,973
Destiny, then.

326
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,944
This must look strange.

327
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:04,408
It's, uh, something that I'm working on.

328
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:09,705
A formula for creating energy.

329
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,916
That you carry around in your underwear?

330
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,671
Yeah. I do.

331
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,728
How did you do that?

332
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,564
Magic.

333
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,858
Give it back.

334
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,778
- It looks like Sanskrit.
- Give it back.

335
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,367
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

336
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,999
- What else do you keep in there?
- Nothing.

337
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,918
That's not true.

338
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,796
Can I get you anything else?

339
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,425
Drink your wine.

340
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,470
Uh, Latour '57.

341
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,850
The Latour, sir, is 400 pounds a bottle.

342
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,190
Then we'll have two bottles.

343
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,403
There, you count it.

344
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,038
All these little tubes and microbes.

345
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,374
- And molecules.
- Those too.

346
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:41,964
- Can I tell you something?
- What? You must. Everything.

347
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,342
- It's a secret.
- What?

348
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm done.

349
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,060
My energy research, I'm finished.

350
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,896
I still have some sequencing to work out

351
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,109
to make sure that
it's safe, but I did it.

352
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,529
It's been you against
the whole world, hasn't it?

353
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,657
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

354
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,076
The gift of faith.

355
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,955
To see...

356
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,670
Well, to believe in
something that's all around us

357
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,090
but hidden from our sight.

358
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,385
It's a beautiful thought.

359
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,762
I can't believe I'm telling you all this.

360
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,765
I don't even know your name.

361
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,768
My name is...

362
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:41,398
I don't want to tell you my
name. No, I don't want to do that.

363
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,403
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

364
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,867
- What's your name?
- Emma.

365
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,787
Emma. Now I know everything about you.

366
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:00,000
You're a genius.

367
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,421
You have a weak heart.

368
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,926
You have beautiful dreams.

369
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,928
Great courage.

370
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,140
Unafraid in this world.

371
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,351
You get that from your father.

372
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,272
You can't cook to save your life.

373
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,900
And you love fish.

374
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,112
I do love fish.

375
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,573
That's weird.

376
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,743
- I want to try that.
- No.

377
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,038
- Yes.
- I don't want you to. Drink your wine.

378
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,044
Yes, I do. What's your name?

379
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,756
My name is Thomas Moore.

380
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:51,551
I was named after a saint...

381
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,473
who died for his faith.

382
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,060
Okay.

383
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,855
Your work...

384
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,568
is very dangerous and alive.

385
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,699
And I love your poems. They move me.

386
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,161
But that's not who you really are.

387
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:24,501
You're running away from
your past and your pain

388
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:29,256
and yet you keep it so close to you.

389
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,846
You don't have to be
afraid of who you are...

390
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,808
because you're beautiful.

391
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,743
What are you doing?

392
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:02,265
Oh, my God, you're... You're
bleeding! Wha... What happened?

393
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:07,521
I don't know, I was
weeping and I slipped.

394
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,190
I was thinking of you, I don't know...

395
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,402
Well, I live right down the
street, I could clean you up.

396
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,655
Why do you cover your
mouth when you laugh?

397
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,282
- I don't know.
- Wait.

398
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:28,667
I'm glad that it stopped
bleeding. You don't need stitches.

399
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,217
We have to disinfect it, though.

400
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,845
You really are an angel.

401
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,597
You are.

402
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,269
This is gonna hurt.

403
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,937
Ahhh!

404
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,106
I'm sorry.

405
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:57,028
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

406
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,657
I'm sorry, I was just joking.

407
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,495
- I... I should go.
- No.

408
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,081
Yes, you... I...

409
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:12,252
- Take off your pants.
- Pardon?

410
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,212
I mean, your sweater.

411
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,510
There's blood on it. I'll wash it.

412
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,850
You're very domestic.

413
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,105
There's blood on your blouse as well.

414
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,109
I'll wash it.

415
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,125
Do you have any wine?

416
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:09,142
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

417
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,270
How could I not?

418
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,232
You make me feel so good.

419
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,943
I wish...

420
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,029
I wish you could understand.

421
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,866
I want you to know who I am.

422
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:41,925
Oh...

423
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,260
Oh, my heart.

424
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,098
Don't disappear, I'll be right back.

425
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,174
Ugh, you can't do this. She's so great.

426
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,220
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.

427
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,540
Hi.

428
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:17,479
"To Spider. Must fly. Have better offer."

429
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,523
Greedy Westerner. Wants more money.

430
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,569
Who cares? Can't spend
hard currency in hell.

431
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:32,077
Send this message: "Fly. Don't buzz off."

432
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,622
"I'll double your fee."

433
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:41,544
<i>"Or send my own boys to
take care of the woman."</i>

434
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,887
Are you okay?

435
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:57,477
It's... I just want to lie here.

436
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,857
Can we just be like this tonight?

437
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,861
Is that what you want?

438
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,405
It's so magic.

439
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,413
It just feels so perfect.

440
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,613
<i>It's 7:00 a.m. and here
are the news headlines...</i>

441
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,291
Thomas?

442
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:22,038
- Lev Naumovitch! It's here.
- It's revolutionary, sir.

443
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:25,166
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas.

444
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,878
But I think the formula is
incomplete. It will take months...

445
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:30,380
But that won't do.

446
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,258
Now that the people
are beginning to freeze,

447
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:37,136
Tretiak must swoop in from the
wings with a miracle to save them.

448
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,305
How high do you want it?

449
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:40,473
To the top.

450
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:43,101
- Good morning, Yuri.
- Good morning.

451
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,897
Perhaps I can confirm the
validity of this formula more quickly

452
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,567
if I dispense with
certain protocols. But...

453
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,947
How long, Dr. Botvin, since you
received your last salary check

454
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,700
from Moscow University?

455
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:01,869
Ukrainian Independence Day.

456
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,289
Last August.

457
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:08,960
Ivan, he's online.

458
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,422
Do it.

459
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:20,680
"To Spider. You've got the recipe..."

460
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,392
- "Where's my dough?"
- "To Human Fly.

461
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:31,149
"Recipe incomplete. The cake won't rise."

462
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,818
"Hence, no dough."

463
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,577
"I'm not the baker."

464
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,620
"Don't make me the butcher."

465
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,417
I like this guy.

466
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,549
"No play, no pay."

467
00:52:56,716 --> 00:53:00,178
<i>"I'm certain you kept the cookbook."</i>

468
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:09,979
Holland Park.

469
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,082
I'll check that for you. Yes, that
seems to be fine. One moment.

470
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,552
He's keeping me online.

471
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,064
You wait here.

472
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,318
You! Beside the car!

473
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,781
Now turn around! Step
away from the vehicle!

474
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,283
He's armed!

475
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:09,974
Come on, drive!

476
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,652
Go the other way! Go! Go! Go!

477
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:35,958
What about him?

478
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,010
What about this one?

479
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,600
Yeah, that...

480
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,062
You see, we believe
they're all the same villain.

481
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,360
Oh, my God.

482
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:08,199
- They're all him?
- We believe so.

483
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,953
He eluded a hit squad this
morning in Holland Park.

484
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,915
Then he fled the UK out of Heathrow.

485
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,626
We've got a handful of
false identities used on

486
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,379
visas, passports, leases...

487
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,633
Nicholas Owen. Louis Guanella.

488
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,593
Peter Damian.

489
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,471
Charles Borromeo.

490
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,307
Of course.

491
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:38,646
Thomas Moore. All the
names of Catholic saints.

492
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:47,780
Can you access Heathrow's passenger
lists for the last, uh, eight hours?

493
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,242
- I think it might be possible.
- Good.

494
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,355
Yes!

495
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,200
Yes!

496
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,627
Oh!

497
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:50,009
See, my friends, you
back the biggest rat.

498
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:20,331
Out! Out! Freeloaders, out!

499
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,293
I want to drink alone. Close the curtain!

500
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,110
- What?
- What?

501
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,613
Don't look down.

502
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:57,118
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

503
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,621
I'm the thief you tried to cheat.

504
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,916
And this is your accountant.

505
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,878
Talk to him.

506
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,509
The phone goes the other way, you moron.

507
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,099
Hello? Tretiak speaking.

508
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,187
That money to Zurich, send it now.

509
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,314
I said now.

510
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,900
Yeah.

511
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:33,946
Thank you.

512
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:38,200
Do you know what the
hardest part about being you is?

513
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,537
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

514
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,541
You son of a bitch!

515
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,753
There is an impostor
in there! Get him out!

516
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,338
Hey, hey. Hey.

517
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,176
Take your hands off me, you idiots!

518
00:59:55,342 --> 01:00:00,139
Are you crazy? It's me!
Go! Go! Get him! Go!

519
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,558
Ilya, get the bastard!

520
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:27,374
Fifty million. I'm out.

521
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:34,089
Mr. Ferrer, checking out.

522
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,101
I'll have one too.

523
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,064
- Emma.
- Hi.

524
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,735
I am... I'm overwhelmed.

525
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,198
- You found me.
- It wasn't very hard.

526
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,661
Two men with saints' names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

527
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:08,332
Isadore Bakanja is a short, bald African.

528
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,501
Whereas Vincent Ferrer...

529
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,044
Named after a saint who
betrayed his best friend.

530
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,922
How could you do it?

531
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:20,261
Emma, I, I had to.

532
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:24,723
- I'm a thief.
- I want my cards back.

533
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,601
You flew all this way
because you want your cards?

534
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,938
- Yes, I did.
- No. It's because you're in love.

535
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,736
- I rest my case.
- Who are you?

536
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,239
No one has a clue, least of all me.

537
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,078
And why would you
steal cold fusion? It's free.

538
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,206
Why would you do that?

539
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,920
- Eight million reasons.
- Oh, eight million? Wow, is that all?

540
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:01,969
I would have given them
to you if you'd only asked.

541
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,852
You've got to get away from me.

542
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,230
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me why you lied to me.

543
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,941
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

544
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:18,694
You almost got me killed. The
guy I stole it for says it doesn't work.

545
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,448
- Well, screw him!
- I don't think you'd enjoy that.

546
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,451
Yeah, you're right,
I don't think I would.

547
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,836
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

548
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,018
- They took my pills.
- No, I palmed them from your purse.

549
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:56,690
I need one or two, I need...
I have a bad heart and...

550
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,652
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

551
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,154
It's okay, I've got your pills.

552
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,990
I've got two in my hand.

553
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:08,285
- I'm gonna pass out.
- Sit down on the floor.

554
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:13,165
Just get down on the floor. That's right.

555
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:16,710
That's right, eat two out
of my hand. That's right.

556
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:18,671
Okay?

557
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,298
While you're down there...

558
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:26,387
Get the pocketknife out of my boot.

559
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:32,351
This formula makes certain assumptions

560
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:36,647
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes.

561
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:41,318
Testing at any level becomes
futile without any further information.

562
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,778
Mr. Tretiak.

563
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:47,491
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin. Help is here.

564
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,005
The two came very quietly.

565
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,516
And they left even more quietly.

566
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:17,187
Close the city. Kill him.

567
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,607
And bring her alive.

568
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,791
Why? Why are they after me?

569
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:42,046
Tretiak, the guy I worked for,
owns this city. Cops and all.

570
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:45,841
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

571
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,594
What do you want from me?

572
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,145
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

573
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:02,107
- So the formula works?
- Kiss me again.

574
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:07,488
- No.
- Make up your mind.

575
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:12,493
I... I have to figure out the
order before the formula works.

576
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,788
- I'm not gonna give it to him.
- Tretiak will find you.

577
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,083
- No.
- He found me, and that's very hard.

578
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,711
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

579
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,547
What do you need?

580
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,513
I need some time, and I need...

581
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,850
I need a place to work.

582
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,274
- Where's everyone going?
- To their country relatives.

583
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,070
To cut firewood. There's
no heat in this city.

584
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,472
How long will it take
you to finish the formula?

585
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,875
I don't know.

586
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,296
- Uh, two hours maybe. I don't know.
- It should be enough time...

587
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:10,259
to get our passports together
and for us to get married.

588
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,011
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

589
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:18,016
I want you to be Mrs. Martin de Porres.

590
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,398
- You're not Martin.
- No.

591
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,442
Who are you?

592
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,072
I don't have a name.

593
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,117
Sad.

594
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:39,371
- Will you have one when we get home?
- I don't have a home.

595
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:43,333
When we get back, you do
the science, I'll do the math.

596
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:47,379
We'll market your formula around
the world, we'll make a fortune.

597
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,466
And then... we'll see.

598
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,428
Okay?

599
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,063
Emma!

600
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,708
No trouble, okay?

601
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:31,089
If you want to live, never leave my side.

602
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,593
I've got you.

603
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:46,850
Come on.

604
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,023
Here we go.

605
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,653
Now we've got to get you warm.

606
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,039
Come on, almost there.

607
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,817
Come on, come on.

608
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,243
You'll wait till Christ comes to Moscow.

609
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:51,289
Elevator was made of mahogany.
Tenants used it for firewood.

610
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:56,378
We need your help. He
fell in the river. He's freezing.

611
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:59,506
- We're just people who...
- You're not people.

612
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,884
- You're Americans.
- Yes.

613
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,720
But we ran into trouble with your Mafia.

614
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:41,506
She disapproves of what I
do, but eats the bread it buys.

615
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:48,180
No heat for sale, but these
clothes will make you warm.

616
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:58,565
I said "Mashenka, go back to
bed." She's always puttering around.

617
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,905
It's here. Built to escape...

618
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,241
the Secret Police. In you go.

619
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,466
You've got hypothermia.

620
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,719
We've have to get
these wet clothes off...

621
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,180
and keep you warm.

622
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,266
They must be in one of these buildings.

623
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,018
Check every apartment.

624
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:40,273
How are you doing? Talk to me.

625
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,734
Snug as a bug in a rug.

626
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:59,042
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature falls

627
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,378
below 95 degrees.

628
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:17,269
Two kids talking about foreigners.

629
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,572
Listen to me, tenants!

630
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:34,369
Show me where the Americans
are. You'll be paid in American dollars.

631
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,248
Five hundred bucks reward.

632
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,420
Have you seen by chance two Americans?

633
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:49,384
Just one American and
one polar bear. Do I get 250?

634
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,406
We'll check upstairs.

635
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,670
What's your name?

636
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,216
Who are you really?

637
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,763
- Simon.
- Simon?

638
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:40,352
- So you were named for a saint.
- No, Simon the magician.

639
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:44,689
I did tricks. Tricks for Agnes.

640
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:49,027
That's how I got things.
Priests took everything.

641
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:54,157
Took Agnes. Dog's too big... Teeth...

642
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,704
She fell. I escaped.

643
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:02,749
I always escape.

644
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,044
I don't believe in magic anymore.

645
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,255
I do.

646
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:14,344
I've never felt like this before.

647
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,138
How?

648
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,683
I'm freezing.

649
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:28,650
These are here! These Americans are here!

650
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,821
These are here!

651
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:37,242
We've got to get out of here.
Are you okay? They're coming.

652
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,038
The Americans are here!

653
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,541
Hurry, put this on.

654
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,965
Here they are!

655
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,521
Upstairs!

656
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,541
Maybe we can jump.

657
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,710
Let's jump.

658
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:34,591
Run!

659
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,512
We need her alive, idiot!

660
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,183
The embassy's east of here.

661
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:46,913
You're late. Where have you been?

662
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,498
I've been waiting two hours.

663
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:53,837
I've got some beautiful paintings
for you to buy. In here, come on.

664
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,803
Don't fret, it's just my curator, Toli.

665
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,555
I'm Alexa Frankievitch.

666
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:06,724
But being you're Americans,
you can call me Frankie.

667
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:10,353
- Okay, I've got money. We want...
- I know.

668
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:13,022
The icon of the Virgin of the Don.

669
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,400
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

670
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,383
We're not here to buy art. Take
us to the American embassy.

671
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,865
Right. I need 10,000 dollars up front.

672
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:22,949
No.

673
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:27,370
Okay, 7,000, and not a penny less.

674
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,705
Shh!

675
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,091
- Police?
- No. Tretiak's goons.

676
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,396
- Wait!
- Sasha, go east, to the embassy.

677
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,607
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

678
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:58,776
You're in Russia.
Everything's complicated.

679
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,238
- But you know the way?
- Like the face of a...

680
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,365
Bulgari chronograph.

681
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,748
Mmm...

682
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,877
I remember. This way.

683
01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:26,137
At last, water main. They shut
it down each afternoon in winter.

684
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,930
What time do they turn it back on?

685
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,433
You have five minutes.

686
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,477
- Plus or minus.
- Plus or minus?

687
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:35,229
It means several
minutes earlier or later.

688
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:38,650
Don't worry. Third opening
is under your embassy.

689
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,252
Quick, someone's coming.

690
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,928
Come on, come on.

691
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,815
Here's the second one. Embassy's next.

692
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,738
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah, unless it's minus.

693
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,662
Damn! It's sealed.

694
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,874
- We'll have to go back.
- Come on.

695
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:02,942
Hurry!

696
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,619
Up you go!

697
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,653
The embassy's only about
a hundred yards away.

698
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:49,229
There's a car right above us.

699
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,866
Watch your head.

700
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:29,779
I'll create a diversion. Should take
you ten seconds to run to the gates.

701
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:32,046
They'll open them when
they see you coming.

702
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:35,827
- Okay, I can do that.
- You can do it.

703
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,581
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

704
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:43,417
I'll find you. You found me.

705
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,044
Yeah, I did.

706
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:51,652
I'm an American! Open
the gate! Open the gate.

707
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,116
Back off from the gate! Back off!

708
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,619
I said back off!

709
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,414
Stand back from the gate.

710
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,585
I said back off!

711
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,226
She out-ran you? How humiliating.

712
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,816
One shot left.

713
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:36,155
Can't come all the way to Russia
and not play Russian roulette.

714
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:41,131
Before you shoot me, don't you want
to know where all the money's hidden?

715
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,497
- Whose money?
- Tretiak's, yours.

716
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,208
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

717
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:51,045
- What are you saying?
- Your father's stashed billions.

718
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:54,006
And I know where it's
hidden. Let's make a deal.

719
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,969
Where are all those hidden billions?

720
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,179
I know.

721
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,182
But I don't think I'm gonna tell you.

722
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:39,385
You're worse than all the others.
However, the burns will heal.

723
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:45,808
Maybe a little chance of scarring.
But I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

724
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:51,063
Lucky? Look at me, I'm a damn devil.

725
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:01,324
I have run every test on
this cold fusion formula,

726
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:08,080
and must conclude that it is not
merely incomplete, but impossible.

727
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:12,376
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.

728
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,338
I invest millions,

729
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:19,884
and you can't make it work!

730
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,307
What are you doing with my money?

731
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:34,273
Do you think it comes so easy? No!

732
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:40,154
Sir, I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

733
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:45,451
At first blush, the theorem appears
quite impressive. Convincing.

734
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,036
It does?

735
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,795
Yes, it does.

736
01:26:56,629 --> 01:27:00,549
Good man. We can use
it to destroy our enemies.

737
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:05,805
<i>Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.</i>

738
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,808
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press.

739
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:14,105
From here to the airport are three
army checkpoints, all loyal to us.

740
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:19,652
Make sure they all get the message.
She doesn't leave Moscow alive.

741
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:26,534
Mr. President, as former Vice
Minister of Energy and Power,

742
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:31,705
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

743
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,917
And as our countrymen freeze to death,

744
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,004
I've become aware of a
marvelous new technology,

745
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:44,635
about which I'm hopelessly out of
my league from a scientific viewpoint.

746
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:47,847
That's why I brought our
eminent physicist here,

747
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,350
Dr. Lev Botvin from the
University of Moscow.

748
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:56,730
Before we are dazzled by the good
news, let's dispense with the bad.

749
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:58,983
What is the price of this marvel?

750
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,486
The cost of research and
development are there,

751
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,947
which is all you are asked to defray.

752
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:14,039
Ten billion in hard currency?

753
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:18,294
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

754
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,887
Where are you heading?

755
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:31,599
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

756
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:42,193
Like the miracle of socialism,
our miracle of cold fusion failed.

757
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:47,781
But no matter. We have sold
cold fusion to President Karpov.

758
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:51,410
We will use the scandal
of his failure to destroy him.

759
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:54,246
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

760
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:58,000
You're in a hurry, Ivan
Petrovich. That's one day.

761
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,461
Not now, old witch, we're working.

762
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,255
Yes, think of it.

763
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:08,052
In one day you can be proud
again to be a Russian general.

764
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:12,765
With a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

765
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,976
You have to fill out a form
before we put you on a flight.

766
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,910
Medical problems, that sort of thing.

767
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,982
- Oh, I have a heart condition.
- Do you need any medication?

768
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:27,196
Well, I haven't needed
a pill. That's strange.

769
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,533
Get a form from down the
corridor. I'll be back in ten.

770
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,203
- I'll be by your side to the airport.
- Thank you.

771
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,499
<i>...where overnight a mob attacked</i>

772
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:41,377
<i>several companies with ties to America.</i>

773
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:45,381
<i>Apparently, four U. S. citizens
were badly injured in the attack.</i>

774
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:49,927
<i>I'm told that American citizens are
asked to report to the U. S. embassy</i>

775
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:52,680
<i>for immediate evacuation...</i>

776
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:55,349
Excuse me, lady, you look lost.

777
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:56,632
No, I'm, uh... I'm fine.

778
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:02,439
May I help you? Allow me to introduce
myself. My name is August Christopher,

779
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:06,068
I was named after Saint Augustin,
who coined my favorite phrase:

780
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:10,322
"Give me chastity and
constancy, but do not give it yet."

781
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:18,622
Simon, I'm on... I'm on
the next flight out of here.

782
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,624
Are you coming with me?

783
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,502
No. But they are.

784
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,721
I need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

785
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:38,809
Find a quiet room, finish the
formula and fax it back to me.

786
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,436
My number's on the back.

787
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:44,481
I don't understand. Why
are you keeping my cards?

788
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,098
We've got to do a deal with the
Russians or you'll never be safe.

789
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,903
Be good at school.

790
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:52,364
Wait!

791
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,952
- Don't you trust me, darling?
- Trust who?

792
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:01,081
- That hurts, Emma.
- I'm serious.

793
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:05,127
- What's your name?
- My name is August Christopher.

794
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,172
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

795
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:10,424
I mean, Vincent Ferrer.

796
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,801
I mean, Martin de Porres.

797
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,804
Thomas Moore.

798
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:19,850
After all, you are my personal saint.

799
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:26,023
You have to be very good and
usually very dead to become a saint.

800
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,193
And more importantly, you
have to work three miracles.

801
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,947
Now get to work. Who's that man?

802
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,201
You're leaving on the
transport at 9 o'clock, ma'am?

803
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:41,497
Probably your last chance
out of here. Hurry, it's leaving.

804
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:46,627
<i>The troops will depose the President</i>

805
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,005
<i>and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.</i>

806
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:54,343
<i>Moscow must be ringed
with tanks by early evening.</i>

807
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:59,807
<i>Don't worry, the people will follow
me. They'll be crying for revolution.</i>

808
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,725
<i>Still no one's guessed</i>

809
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:04,937
the simple truth of
where the heating oil went.

810
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:11,610
<i>Who would believe the sea of oil...</i>

811
01:32:11,694 --> 01:32:14,571
<i>...was hidden under this very building?</i>

812
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:19,118
<i>Yuri, I understand your Natalia is...</i>

813
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,662
<i>Francis, you devil.</i>

814
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:24,279
<i>I heard you came down
here and you didn't call me.</i>

815
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,459
<i>Give me a ring, Charles...</i>

816
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:30,504
<i>Lou, I've heard on the grapevine</i>

817
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,716
<i>that you're brokering a
revolutionary new energy source.</i>

818
01:32:34,842 --> 01:32:37,094
<i>If it's as good as it's cracked up to be,</i>

819
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,055
<i>I have friends who can
double your best offer.</i>

820
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:45,352
<i>On deposit, in Zurich, within one
hour of delivery and confirmation.</i>

821
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:47,730
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

822
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:12,463
The work could be here. This
machine could work, couldn't it?

823
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,842
Who are you?

824
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:20,345
- A friend of Dr. Russell's.
- Dr. Russell...

825
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:25,976
What's this equation?
It's so simple, it's...

826
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:31,023
- The key to Dr. Russell's formula.
- Yes.

827
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:35,152
The alarm! You had better go.

828
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:39,198
I need a miracle. You've got 12 hours.

829
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:47,372
- But Mr. Tretiak's rally is tonight.
- Can you make it work? Make it work.

830
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:54,922
- What is wrong here?
- It's the alarm.

831
01:33:58,133 --> 01:33:59,510
Uh...

832
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:01,887
I tripped.

833
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,397
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

834
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:17,653
You are Nikolai Protrovich... Petrovich.

835
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,582
Tunnel built by KGB.

836
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,878
Leads to machine room in Kremlin.

837
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:38,465
Great. Do you happen to know
where the President's quarters are?

838
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:43,178
President Karpov is... there.

839
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:46,265
But there are many guards.

840
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:49,351
- So I suggest...
- An alternate route?

841
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,354
Money. Now.

842
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:56,233
Oh, ye of little faith.

843
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:04,408
<i>Russia stands tonight on the
brink of a second revolution</i>

844
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:07,119
<i>as the number of deaths
from freezing mounts,</i>

845
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:10,747
<i>hundreds of thousands of
protestors have taken to the streets.</i>

846
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:14,877
<i>Even as Russian President Karpov
is promising a mysterious solution</i>

847
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,045
<i>to the crippling heating oil shortage,</i>

848
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:21,550
<i>troops opposed to the elected
government led by General Leo Sklarov,</i>

849
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:24,428
<i>have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.</i>

850
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,555
- Tretiak! Tretiak!
- Angry, frightened citizens

851
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,308
are gathering outside
the Kremlin in Red Square.

852
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:33,353
But they're not braving the cold
for yet another a political rally.

853
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,607
They've been drawn here
by the promise of a revelation,

854
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,191
whatever that may be,

855
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:40,569
in what's become a
life and death struggle

856
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:43,822
for the future of democracy in Russia.

857
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:01,984
Mr. President, I'm your friend.

858
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,151
What do you want?

859
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:08,490
I want to help you to destroy Tretiak.

860
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:10,909
I need you to listen for 30 seconds.

861
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:15,539
I'm all right! Stay outside.

862
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:17,791
Please, continue.

863
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:21,086
Tonight you're going to stand trial
on Red Square before the world.

864
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:24,506
Whatever Tretiak accuses
you of, I need you to admit to it.

865
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:29,594
- Agree with this criminal?
- If you want to destroy Tretiak, yes.

866
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:48,530
Gruschev, take Mr. Karpov downstairs.

867
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,449
The wife stays here.

868
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:55,537
Hands off! What you are doing is illegal.

869
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:59,166
- The people won't stand for it!
- They are too cold to stop it.

870
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:00,834
Who are you?

871
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:18,643
Tretiak! Tretiak! Tretiak! Tretiak!

872
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:38,997
Friends! Countrymen! Russians!

873
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:53,428
You heard about this
morning's sensational event.

874
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:58,934
Shocking documents were recovered
from the president's secret files,

875
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:01,645
locked within his private safe.

876
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:06,608
The documents, which will
be published in today's papers,

877
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:13,198
prove that the traitor
Karpov was about to steal

878
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:17,619
over 40 trillion of our
precious Russian rubles

879
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:21,414
in a reckless scheme to save his hide!

880
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:27,963
To add insult, millions
of dollars were to be paid

881
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,423
to this international criminal!

882
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:43,854
And for what was your president
hoping to bankrupt our national treasury?

883
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:49,234
<i>What you see is the fairy
tale called cold fusion.</i>

884
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:54,322
You pass electric
current into the machine,

885
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:58,451
and there is supposed
to be a chemical reaction!

886
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:03,748
Watch! It can't even
light up a tiny light-bulb!

887
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,543
Do you dare deny this, Mr. Karpov?

888
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:10,881
Absolutely not. I proudly admit it!

889
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:16,887
But enough puny failure!
Failure is in the past!

890
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:19,890
Begging is behind us!

891
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:23,768
The balance of power is about to shift!

892
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,012
Miracle one.

893
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:08,313
Karpov! Karpov! Karpov!

894
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:34,923
- Ilya! Ilya!
- Go! Go, go, go!

895
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:41,805
I order all troops loyal to Mother Russia

896
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:45,267
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

897
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:52,649
A thousand apologies, Mr. President.

898
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:55,986
There was a miscommunication
somewhere in the chain of command.

899
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,535
Miracle two.

900
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,246
<i>The billionaire industrialist</i>

901
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:09,582
<i>and his son Ilya were
taken to Lubyanka prison</i>

902
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:14,254
<i>where they await trial along with
fellow conspirator General Sklarov.</i>

903
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:17,757
<i>Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth,</i>

904
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:19,843
<i>as millions of gallons of heating oil</i>

905
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:24,014
<i>flowed from a storage depot discovered
beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.</i>

906
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,100
<i>He made no threat to contact you?</i>

907
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:28,393
<i>He never had the chance.</i>

908
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,146
- You'll tell us if he does?
- Oh, yes.

909
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:35,358
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue, you see.

910
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:39,446
He charms women, this so-called saint.

911
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,407
It seems it's his
stock-in-trade. No offense.

912
01:42:42,574 --> 01:42:48,538
I am offended. All I got from this
saint was near-death experiences.

913
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:50,582
Count yourself lucky.

914
01:42:50,749 --> 01:42:54,085
I have an important
conference to prepare for.

915
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,254
We understand. You have a life.

916
01:42:57,297 --> 01:43:00,300
- We appreciate you taking the time.
- Ah, no problem.

917
01:43:07,015 --> 01:43:08,767
She's in love with him.

918
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,297
I wanted to call and tell you everything.

919
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:25,593
- It just hasn't been safe.
- I couldn't stop thinking about you.

920
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:32,517
So, have you, uh, been busy?

921
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:37,230
Yeah, I've been working real hard.
Thank God I have my cards back.

922
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:41,526
You don't believe in that cold
fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

923
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:44,362
You're a very pretty lady.

924
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:48,324
Oh, my God! That was you?

925
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:51,786
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

926
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:55,373
I thought you were an old biddy,

927
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:58,126
not a gorgeous soon-to-be trillionaire.

928
01:44:58,585 --> 01:45:01,629
You know you're gonna be
the richest woman in the world?

929
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:05,216
- I am?
- Why do you think I'm hanging around?

930
01:45:12,682 --> 01:45:13,683
- Emma?
- Yeah?

931
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,727
My life is very strange.

932
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:17,770
I just...

933
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:25,028
I don't do anything
normal. I... I can't...

934
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:26,946
I know.

935
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:29,324
I know you.

936
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:31,868
I know your life.

937
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:35,538
- What do you want?
- I want you.

938
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:39,250
- For how long?
- It doesn't matter.

939
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:47,884
Tell me you love me.

940
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:51,638
I love you.

941
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:54,224
Simon...

942
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:57,352
I love you, Simon.

943
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,355
Miracle three.

944
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:29,676
<i>Dear Simon, the pin is something
I've kept for years, God knows why.</i>

945
01:46:30,176 --> 01:46:32,845
<i>A graduation gift from Catholic school.</i>

946
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:35,348
<i>But don't worry, you
don't have to wear it.</i>

947
01:46:35,682 --> 01:46:39,852
<i>I just wanted you to
have something I loved.</i>

948
01:46:40,353 --> 01:46:43,273
<i>Simon, a sainthood
requires three miracles,</i>

949
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:45,817
<i>then I'd say, you've made it, my love.</i>

950
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:48,486
<i>And so I hope you'll understand.</i>

951
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:52,365
<i>Last night, it became clear to
me what I have to do this morning.</i>

952
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:55,577
<i>You see, I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.</i>

953
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,454
<i>It's the only way, if
we're ever together again,</i>

954
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:01,708
<i>that I'll know it's for you
and you'll know it's for me.</i>

955
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:06,838
<i>If cold fusion is free, then you
and I, Simon, will be free too.</i>

956
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:10,550
Listen. If you think giving away
everything in front of the world,

957
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:14,679
preventing us from making a
fortune, will accomplish anything,

958
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:17,765
you're absolutely right.

959
01:47:19,684 --> 01:47:21,644
Simon, what are you doing here?

960
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:27,317
- There are police everywhere.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

961
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:31,029
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

962
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:36,909
You'd better go.

963
01:47:50,048 --> 01:47:52,091
How am I gonna find you?

964
01:47:53,635 --> 01:47:56,137
I'll find you. You found me.

965
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:27,085
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction

966
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:30,588
after last week's Moscow fireworks,

967
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:35,677
uh, please let me
welcome Dr. E.J. Russell...

968
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:38,429
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

969
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:41,641
No.

970
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,560
Dr. Russell.

971
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:57,365
You don't believe in this cold
fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

972
01:48:58,074 --> 01:48:59,075
No.

973
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:05,957
Well, we all know that cold fusion
has had, uh, a difficult childhood.

974
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:11,254
Those of us in the field are
orphans, bastards at best.

975
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:15,883
But difficult childhoods, I believe,
make the most interesting adults.

976
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:21,389
I know that most of you thought...

977
01:49:21,556 --> 01:49:24,976
I'm her biggest fan. I think she's a fox.

978
01:49:26,728 --> 01:49:32,358
Some may feel that its practical
application is still speculative.

979
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:38,364
But I want to share with you how
that dream is slowly becoming reality.

980
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,870
Oh, look at the time. Got to go.

981
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:50,168
With your help, we can all
work towards making the...

982
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:56,340
dream of cold fusion finally come true.

983
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,875
Got you, you slippery son of a...

984
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,418
What's going on here?

985
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:40,092
Damn!

986
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:49,685
<i>Donations totaling three billion
dollars were made today to</i>

987
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:54,315
<i>the Red Cross, The Salvation Army,
and the United Nations' Children's Fund.</i>

988
01:50:54,482 --> 01:50:58,945
<i>The funds were wired from the account
of jailed Russian tycoon Ivan Tretiak.</i>

989
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:03,157
<i>In other philanthropic news, a
non-profit research foundation</i>

990
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:07,328
<i>has been established to
develop cold fusion technology,</i>

991
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,664
<i>funded with an anonymous donation</i>

992
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:13,292
<i>and to be headed by Russian
physicist, Dr. Lev Botvin.</i>
