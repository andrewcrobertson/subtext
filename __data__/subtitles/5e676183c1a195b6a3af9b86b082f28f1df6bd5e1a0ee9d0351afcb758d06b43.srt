1
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:27,695
<i>You lost your adolescent already?</i>

2
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:30,656
<i>This will complicate matters...</i>

3
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,826
<i>A young one is on the way,</i>

4
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:38,664
<i>but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.</i>

5
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:13,157
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

6
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,244
<i>Beth.</i>

7
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,413
Mr. Keenig...

8
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,166
"Herr König."

9
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,460
Herr... Konish?

10
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,753
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

11
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,381
'Ö.'
"Herr König."

12
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:30,966
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

13
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,177
Gretchen and the movers
are right behind us.

14
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:36,639
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

15
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,395
No, she's Beth.

16
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,274
Ah, okay.

17
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,235
And what is going on
with your sister?

18
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,696
She deaf or something?

19
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:53,906
No.

20
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,369
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

21
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:17,847
You okay, honey?

22
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:21,892
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

23
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:24,895
Oh!

24
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,654
Good afternoon.

25
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,201
Good afternoon, Mr. König.

26
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,995
Ah, very good, Luis!

27
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:43,789
You've been practicing, huh?

28
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,665
How was your journey?

29
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,459
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

30
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,669
We almost forgot how beautiful
it is here.

31
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,173
Ah, we almost forgot
how beautiful you are, Beth.

32
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,590
Oh, stop!

33
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,051
Keep going!

34
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:57,970
Gretchen, come say hi.

35
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,183
Gretchen.

36
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,975
What's up?

37
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,269
Oh, Jesus.

38
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,313
Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.

39
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:08,272
Thank you.

40
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,731
No, thank you, Beth.

41
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:12,026
We are so glad to have you back.

42
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,780
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

43
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,072
I completely understand.

44
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,617
- We have something for you.
- I'm sorry.

45
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,536
It's...

46
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,164
The original sketch.

47
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,666
We drew that up

48
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,336
the night that you showed us
the land you acquired.

49
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,254
Beth, that is...

50
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:37,510
Well, we will display this
in the new guest lodge.

51
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,053
Oh!

52
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,765
You know, you two lovebirds
stumbled into my nest

53
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:45,351
almost eight years ago to the day.

54
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,185
And I believe there were more

55
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:50,064
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

56
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,024
Hello, Alma.

57
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,821
<i>Hello. It's nice to meet you.</i>

58
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:58,905
The pleasure is all mine.

59
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:01,575
Your German is already better
than your father's, huh?

60
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:04,245
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Ha! She said yes.

61
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,330
Ja, ja.

62
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,628
<i>Hey, Gretchen. How are you holding up?</i>

63
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,841
<i>I wish we could have spent a little more
time together after the funeral,</i>

64
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:18,342
<i>but I get it.</i>

65
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:21,387
<i>You're all over Europe
with your dad's family, huh?</i>

66
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:25,016
<i>Don't forget you have a band
that needs your voice.</i>

67
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,100
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you the new mix.</i>

68
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,936
<i>I knew your mom would have loved it.</i>

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,442
Beth? It's occupied.

70
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,057
Gretchen, let's go!

71
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,872
<i>Herr König is taking us
to the new house.</i>

72
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,645
<i>Can you sit with Alma this time?</i>

73
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,253
Car? What?
Car what?

74
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,703
What?

75
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,255
<i>Hello there!</i>

76
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:55,685
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

77
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,270
I have my hands full.

78
00:09:58,562 --> 00:09:59,981
Oh, me too.

79
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,734
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

80
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,653
No, I'm a daughter.

81
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,321
Oh, really?

82
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:08,906
Haven't heard about you.

83
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,908
Are you from England as well?

84
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,702
No, I'm not.

85
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,037
Why would you have heard about me?

86
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,580
I told...

87
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,124
Jesus.

88
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:19,625
Forgive me, my dear.

89
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,212
Didn't mean to startle you.

90
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,881
I told Dr. Bonomo about your family.

91
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,385
Dr. Bonomo is the medical superintendent
of the local hospital

92
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:33,139
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

93
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,224
which I am also funding.

94
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:37,977
This is Gretchen.

95
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,478
Gretchen.

96
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,772
Yeah.

97
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:44,817
Gretchen is from the United States.

98
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,196
It has been decided that
she is moving in with her father.

99
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:54,702
What a pleasant surprise.

100
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,087
<i>Hi, you have reached the
Vanderkurt residence.</i>

101
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,380
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

102
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,759
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

103
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,969
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

104
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:16,932
Hi, mom.

105
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,023
I know this is weird, um...

106
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,818
But it's good to hear your voice.

107
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:35,034
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

108
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm short on money, but I'm gonna try
to come home soon.

109
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,218
I know it's been tough.

110
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,096
But we are very happy you're here.

111
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:58,683
Excuse me.

112
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,602
Gretchen, my dear.

113
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:03,729
I, uh...

114
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:09,485
I've been thinking, for a young woman
like you there's, uh...

115
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,197
not so many things to do
here in the summer, and so...

116
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,826
I have a little idea.

117
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,952
A proposal.

118
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,039
How would you like
to come work for me at the resort?

119
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,873
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

120
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,625
<i>Well, it's an easy job,</i>

121
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,419
<i>and it will give you
something to do</i>

122
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,255
<i>while your parents build
a new resort for me.</i>

123
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:32,174
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

124
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,051
Herr König,
I think Gretchen...

125
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,154
I would pay you
an appropriate salary, of course.

126
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,306
- I don't...
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

127
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,855
Oh.

128
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:47,647
Schön.

129
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:49,275
Wonderful.

130
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,986
Come by the reception tomorrow.

131
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,406
<i>Here's your ID badge, sir.</i>

132
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,951
<i>Would you like to pay
with cash or credit card?</i>

133
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,206
Cash, or credit?

134
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,292
Cash.

135
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,171
"That will be 45 euro for a single room."

136
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:14,717
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

137
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,930
Oh, and this is Beatrice

138
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,433
and I am Gretchen.

139
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,768
- Can I go now?
- No.

140
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,648
You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.

141
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:34,487
You have to be polite and friendly,
even if the guest is rude.

142
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,823
And remember to put up the sign
if you go to the bathroom.

143
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:41,118
But if you have any real trouble,
just call the boss.

144
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,664
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

145
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:48,334
He lives in a vacation bungalow?

146
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,629
No, he has a villa way up there.

147
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,630
He bought the hotel,

148
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:57,093
and so the bungalows are basically
in the front yard of his villa.

149
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,637
Weird, right?

150
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:00,971
Super.

151
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,439
I'm so sorry.

152
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,941
No problem.

153
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,277
This happens sometimes.

154
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,991
How's your first day, my dear?

155
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,079
Can't complain.

156
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,873
And how is your German coming along?

157
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,543
Not good.

158
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,044
This is okay.

159
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,923
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

160
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,883
over the border, in Italy.

161
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:47,351
Well, I'll be along to pick you up
in one hour.

162
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:51,522
Oh, I have my bike.

163
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,648
Oh?

164
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,399
No.

165
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,192
No, no, no.

166
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,865
No, it will be too dark
on the country roads by then.

167
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,867
This is why you will not work late.

168
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:06,662
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

169
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,330
What?

170
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

171
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,211
You have a car.

172
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,755
I have a life, too.

173
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,134
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

174
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,718
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

175
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,387
<i>No. Every time I raise
an issue with you,</i>

176
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,265
<i>there is something
you have to say about it.</i>

177
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,475
<i>- I do everything you ask!
- No.</i>

178
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,101
<i>What? I work every day late shifts!</i>

179
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:33,022
<i>You're blasting your Scheisse music
on the car radio on your way to work.</i>

180
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:34,899
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

181
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,775
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

182
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,737
<i>and you are disturbing the wildlife
with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

183
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,186
They can dance on the carpet...

184
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:17,293
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

185
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:44,195
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

186
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,346
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

187
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,389
Alma?

188
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:16,060
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

189
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,943
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

190
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:28,948
My father's daughter scratched me.

191
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,366
Your sister?

192
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,703
- She's not my sister.
- Oh.

193
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,079
Come on now.

194
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

195
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,257
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

196
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,472
It's called vanishing twin syndrome.

197
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:58,269
It's when one fetus dies
in the early stages of the pregnancy

198
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:02,565
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

199
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,526
I always thought
it was kind of badass.

200
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,030
But yeah, she's a bitch.

201
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,450
Okay.

202
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,830
Another reason to not have kids.

203
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,707
Thanks for finishing my shift.

204
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,336
Erik and I haven't been
on a date in ages.

205
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,296
Here's my master key.

206
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,132
There's only one. Don't lose it.

207
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,802
And at 10 p.m. sharp you lock
everything up like I showed you.

208
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,360
And boss doesn't need to know.

209
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:36,200
It's fine.

210
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:37,204
Okay.

211
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,813
Good luck tonight!

212
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,608
Uh-huh.

213
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,601
Can I get a room?

214
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:24,855
May I see your ID or passport?

215
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,732
Can't just ask for my name?

216
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:34,864
Um...

217
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,534
Is it just you...

218
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,705
or are you here with a partner?

219
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,874
We have special rates and amenities

220
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,877
for couples and newlyweds.

221
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,924
For now, just me.

222
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,051
Okay.

223
00:20:58,723 --> 00:20:59,807
I'm Ed.

224
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,186
What's your name?

225
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,106
I'm Gretchen.

226
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,902
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

227
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:16,699
I won't be here for long anyways.

228
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:24,498
You like music?

229
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:29,670
Sure.

230
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:36,135
Then you should come to Paris.

231
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,601
Okay.

232
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:05,163
Hey!

233
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:10,795
Is this normal?

234
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:13,881
It's only my second day.

235
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:15,925
Better go check on her.

236
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:18,134
Uh-huh.

237
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:29,980
Resort Alpschatten...

238
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,066
<i>Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?</i>

239
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,776
<i>I can see the light from...</i>

240
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:35,194
<i>Gretchen?</i>

241
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:37,071
- Yes.
<i>- Where's Beatrix?</i>

242
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:40,782
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

243
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:43,244
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

244
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:44,704
<i>Gretchen.</i>

245
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,456
<i>I want you to lock up the doors
and wait for me,</i>

246
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,333
<i>and I'll come pick you up
right now.</i>

247
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,336
Uh...

248
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,838
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

249
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:57,382
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

250
00:22:57,383 --> 00:23:00,678
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

251
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,095
<i>Gretchen, listen to me carefully.</i>

252
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,472
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

253
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,122
Fuck no.

254
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,002
Yes, okay. Call me back.

255
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,340
Damn it.

256
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:05,886
Shit.

257
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:08,555
Gretchen?

258
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:54,185
Where are you?

259
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:57,813
Where are you? Come here.

260
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:03,254
Hello!

261
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,132
Please let me in!

262
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,259
<i>Ja?</i>

263
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,885
Please let me in right now!

264
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,888
- Please!
<i>- Yes, yes, coming.</i>

265
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,574
<i>I told you I'm coming!</i>

266
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:01,062
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

267
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:05,316
<i>The woman stood there
until the police arrived.</i>

268
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:07,943
I was chased.

269
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,403
Fuck!

270
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:15,117
It's really important that
your statement is as accurate as possible.

271
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:16,368
The receptionist,

272
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:19,830
she stated that she did not see
any woman in the parking lot.

273
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,584
May I suggest...

274
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:27,629
we change the last part into...

275
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,635
"The woman stood there until
Mrs. So-and-so entered the room...

276
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,763
"Then the police arrived."

277
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,227
That is so much better.

278
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,688
I think...

279
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,899
you are the victim of a prank.

280
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:50,987
<i>Everybody
is very nice here, honey.</i>

281
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:52,530
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

282
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,157
<i>but this is actually very common.</i>

283
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:59,203
- Dad.
- Gretchen?

284
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,247
What happened?

285
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:02,581
Did you fall?

286
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,666
Yeah, that's not the important part.

287
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,627
Your sister had some kind of seizure.

288
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:08,337
We need to get her checked out.

289
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,214
Dad, I was attacked.

290
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:11,756
By who?

291
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:13,926
I don't know, the cops think
it was a prank...

292
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:15,803
A prank?
Did somebody hit you?

293
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:18,014
No, I fell, but...
<i>Gretchen?</i>

294
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,229
She fell, it's okay.

295
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,234
<i>We are going to do an MRI...</i>

296
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,752
It might be childhood epilepsy.

297
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:49,753
Epilepsy?

298
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,756
<i>It might be?</i>

299
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,800
It means it might be genetic and
not caused by an injury or tumor.

300
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:58,012
The cause itself isn't life-threatening.

301
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,931
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

302
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,893
The better news is I'm the superintendent

303
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:07,521
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

304
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,276
What's causing the seizures?

305
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,655
There are many possible
triggers for a seizure in a child.

306
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,615
Fever. Certain lights.

307
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,701
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

308
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,995
But Alma is too young for that.

309
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:27,416
Has there been a stressful event
or disruption in your family lately?

310
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,639
<i>Hi, you have reached the
Vanderkurt residence.</i>

311
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,099
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia are here now,</i>

312
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,581
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

313
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:49,063
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

314
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:52,108
<i>Mom, this place is completely fucked.</i>

315
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,987
<i>Alma keeps freaking out, and they say
she has epilepsy or something.</i>

316
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,907
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

317
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:03,244
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

318
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,454
<i>I got the money.</i>

319
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,171
- What happened to you?
- Jesus.

320
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,176
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

321
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:29,312
I'm police investigator Henry Lando.

322
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:33,065
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

323
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,319
incident last night.

324
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:46,829
Which one?

325
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:49,665
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

326
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:56,005
I don't wanna talk to you.

327
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:57,465
Excuse me?

328
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:00,426
Um... excuse me.

329
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,553
There's another guest waiting.

330
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:13,022
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

331
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:17,068
Could you come see me
when you're done?

332
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,737
Fine.

333
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,293
I'm checking out.

334
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:36,921
Oh.

335
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,005
Okay.

336
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,851
You didn't charge me.

337
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:54,105
Don't I have to pay for the room?

338
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,400
Um...

339
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,069
No, you don't.

340
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,704
Do you smoke?

341
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,887
You coming?

342
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,309
Yeah, just give me a minute.

343
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:13,809
I have a house
back in the States.

344
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,603
I just need to get to an airport.

345
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,397
Well, lucky you.

346
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:22,985
We have one of these in Paris.

347
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:35,622
And then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

348
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:38,417
I wasn't going in there.

349
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:44,214
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

350
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,812
...and then the woman
went into that weird pink bungalow.

351
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:00,856
I wasn't going in there.

352
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:06,111
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

353
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:19,709
...and then the woman
went into that weird pink bungalow.

354
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:22,837
I wasn't going in there.

355
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:30,845
Watch out!

356
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,791
Do you smell this?

357
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:27,878
Yes.

358
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:39,140
Or are those molecules binding
to a receptor in your nasal cavity?

359
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,521
Got me.

360
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,662
And are you...

361
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,833
right now, in this moment...

362
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:14,133
are you putting your slashed skin
back together yourself?

363
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:22,558
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

364
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,851
Hm?

365
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,188
If I were you...

366
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:32,068
I would stay home
until my body was done

367
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,987
growing back those cells.

368
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,992
I wouldn't want to get hurt even more.

369
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,746
As if I was stuck in a loop.

370
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:47,416
Can you... do this?

371
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:53,589
Good.

372
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:01,931
Apology accepted.

373
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:06,102
Luis.

374
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:21,617
What are you doing?

375
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,119
I'm getting my stuff.

376
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,622
What? You aren't going
to sleep in the bed?

377
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,749
I mean, they said we can...

378
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,585
I can't sleep here again, Gretchen.
I've got work to do.

379
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,965
Beth has been watching Alma
while I've been here looking after you.

380
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,426
I have to go home and give her a break.

381
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:41,720
Please don't leave.

382
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:44,307
You'll be fine.
There are people in here all the time.

383
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,600
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

384
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,769
It's fine.
You'll be home soon.

385
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,190
What if she comes back?

386
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,691
Gretchen, stop it!

387
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,568
But why? I'm not making this up!

388
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:58,988
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

389
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,408
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

390
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,126
I wasn't high.

391
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:13,628
Oh, you were!

392
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,671
You were tested.

393
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,840
You stole money from Herr König

394
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:21,510
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

395
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,512
I can't force you to do anything.

396
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,785
You are almost eighteen years old.

397
00:40:25,786 --> 00:40:27,892
But you don't have a job anymore

398
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:31,145
and you will not be getting an allowance.

399
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:34,023
If you wanna run away,

400
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:37,193
you take your fucking bicycle.

401
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,332
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

402
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,667
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

403
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:56,087
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

404
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,673
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

405
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,843
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

406
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,429
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

407
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,100
<i>It's really bad.</i>

408
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,022
<i>I wanna come home.</i>

409
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,611
Where's Gretchen?

410
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,489
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

411
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,949
Where's Gretchen?

412
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,119
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

413
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,135
I told you to come see me.

414
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:48,597
I saved your life.

415
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:52,518
I saw the woman.

416
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:57,565
You saw her?

417
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,693
And you didn't tell anyone?

418
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,778
They think I'm crazy.

419
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,531
I need you to help me find that woman.

420
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,118
She's wanted for murder.

421
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,912
And I expect her
to come for you again.

422
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,250
I can protect you.

423
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,378
If we find her...

424
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:25,635
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

425
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,640
<i>Does Alma listen to music often?</i>

426
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:32,349
<i>She loves music,</i>

427
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,101
<i>especially since Gretchen
moved in with us.</i>

428
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,519
<i>Now...</i>

429
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,396
<i>And this is extremely important.</i>

430
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:42,151
<i>Nobody must know about this investigation.</i>

431
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,946
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

432
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:47,365
Loud music has showed to
trigger seizures

433
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:48,949
in people with Alma's condition.

434
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,037
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

435
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:55,456
It's just music.

436
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:58,000
You going out?

437
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:03,923
That's very cool.

438
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,220
No, it's not.

439
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,815
A month ago,
a married couple on vacation

440
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:22,858
had rented this cabin.

441
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:25,695
A cabin not far from here.

442
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:28,906
The husband told the police
that in the evening

443
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,950
he lost consciousness.

444
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,620
When he woke up...

445
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:39,750
he found a strange, blonde woman
in his bedroom.

446
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:45,423
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

447
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:50,094
The blonde woman's voice
had a hypnotic effect on the man.

448
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,598
He chased the woman into the woods,
but she got away.

449
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,852
When the husband returned to the cabin,

450
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:02,648
his wife had choked on her vomit.

451
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:07,695
Jesus.

452
00:44:15,578 --> 00:44:16,621
Dude...

453
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,959
The other night, a half-naked woman
came into the reception,

454
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,920
and she wasn't responding to anything.

455
00:44:30,843 --> 00:44:33,512
Where was she staying?

456
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:44,690
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

457
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:01,082
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

458
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:15,680
I didn't know
stakeouts were gonna be so boring.

459
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:19,850
When are we gonna see some action?

460
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:22,269
Almost 11.

461
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:25,523
Be on the lookout
and listen for anything strange.

462
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:58,179
What are you doing here?

463
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,141
What do you think?
You imbecile!

464
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:02,601
We can't, not here. We're leaving. Now!

465
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:05,771
Why? I'm cleaning this
fuck-pad all the time!

466
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:15,948
I beg you!

467
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,870
You'll have to make it up to me.

468
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,540
I promise.

469
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,629
Okay, fine.

470
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:34,508
Let me dry my hair, then we can go.

471
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,983
I know how you can make it up to me!

472
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:03,180
<i>Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!</i>

473
00:48:15,735 --> 00:48:18,988
<i>Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!</i>

474
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,362
She'll choke.

475
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,408
Last time I was too late.

476
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:34,183
Gretchen?

477
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:38,187
Did we wake you?

478
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:49,615
<i>All the owls have individual calls</i>

479
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:53,494
<i>so that they can understand each other
over long distances.</i>

480
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,788
<i>And maybe we can make a secret call</i>

481
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,417
so that we can understand each other.

482
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,794
Now, I brought you something.

483
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:04,130
I know that you will like this.

484
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,974
Gretchen, come sit with us.

485
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:16,434
Gretchen?

486
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,227
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

487
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:22,606
No.

488
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,484
Okay, good.
Please join us.

489
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,571
I went out last night.

490
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:31,782
Where did you go?

491
00:52:32,158 --> 00:52:33,868
The resort.

492
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:37,288
What were you doing there?

493
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,790
I was with Trixie.

494
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:41,584
<i>Huh.</i>

495
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:45,963
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

496
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:47,340
She wasn't.

497
00:52:48,257 --> 00:52:49,967
She was really confused.

498
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,094
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

499
00:52:53,095 --> 00:52:54,930
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

500
00:52:55,598 --> 00:52:58,267
Hm. I will look into this.

501
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:01,479
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

502
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:05,232
Seems like a lot of people
need assistance after ten.

503
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:07,777
It doesn't make sense economically.

504
00:53:07,902 --> 00:53:09,487
That's stupid, it's a hotel.

505
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:10,404
<i>Gretchen!</i>

506
00:53:10,408 --> 00:53:13,449
I can show you the numbers if you'd
like. It's not so interesting, but...

507
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,825
Maybe another time.

508
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,703
It's quite the place you got here.

509
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:20,247
Gretchen, what's the matter?

510
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:21,874
Why did you bring us here?

511
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:31,425
Your parents are planning a...

512
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,885
A new resort, I know.

513
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,931
Why do we have to live here?

514
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:37,934
Gretchen!

515
00:53:38,724 --> 00:53:41,727
- Because it's pretty outside?
- Calm down right now.

516
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:03,291
You are here because
your family belongs here.

517
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:10,088
That's a fucking weird way to put it!

518
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:12,174
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?

519
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:13,216
I don't know dad!

520
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,761
I'm just reflecting on this very
fucking weird living situation

521
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:17,471
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

522
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:18,764
Out!

523
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:20,223
Now!

524
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:22,810
Great.

525
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:24,227
No, no, Luis.

526
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,125
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

527
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:28,023
You need some family time,
I understand.

528
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:30,088
No, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

529
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:32,153
It's okay, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

530
00:54:32,154 --> 00:54:33,487
and I wish you a good evening.

531
00:54:33,488 --> 00:54:34,404
I'm very sorry.

532
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:36,616
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

533
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:39,201
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

534
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:43,414
And Gretchen, if there is
anything that... bothers you,

535
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:45,458
don't be afraid to...

536
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,877
talk to me.

537
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:52,882
Oh, I leave your package just here.

538
00:54:54,717 --> 00:54:56,969
Oh... it was a surprise.

539
00:54:57,136 --> 00:54:59,180
I was not supposed to say anything.

540
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:00,473
I am so sorry.

541
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:01,766
What package?

542
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:04,351
What package?

543
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:06,228
It has your family name on it.

544
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:21,953
It was your mother's stuff.

545
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:25,498
The small stuff, at least.

546
00:55:26,082 --> 00:55:27,958
I received it this morning.

547
00:55:27,959 --> 00:55:31,128
I... your father should perhaps
change the address on the counter...

548
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:34,173
What is it doing here, dad?

549
00:55:39,845 --> 00:55:41,222
I sold the old house.

550
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:48,187
It was... still my house.

551
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:52,024
And I put the money
in an account for you.

552
00:55:55,444 --> 00:55:57,905
I... I didn't want you
to get worked up again...

553
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:10,519
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

554
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,211
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

555
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:15,756
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

556
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:17,842
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

557
00:56:18,384 --> 00:56:21,220
<i>Mom, I really wanna go home.</i>

558
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:24,432
<i>It's really bad.</i>

559
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,521
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

560
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:37,361
<i>What do you think?</i>

561
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:44,243
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

562
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:47,538
<i>What's your take on that, mom?</i>

563
00:57:05,014 --> 00:57:07,350
<i>Next message.</i>

564
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:12,647
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,
my name is Alma.</i>

565
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:15,608
<i>I'm calling you
because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

566
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,653
<i>Gretchen calls you
when she feels bad,</i>

567
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:20,196
<i>but you never answer.</i>

568
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:22,281
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

569
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:24,116
<i>I'm worried.</i>

570
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:28,037
<i>If you get my message, I want you
to call Gretchen back on the phone.</i>

571
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,873
<i>You can tell her that you love her.</i>

572
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:33,167
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

573
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,461
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

574
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:38,464
<i>If you'd like to,
you can come visit us.</i>

575
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:41,050
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

576
00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:03,322
Good, you're packed.

577
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:06,617
Do you even know how to drive?

578
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:09,704
Where is everybody?

579
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,042
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

580
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:18,129
Alma had a very strong seizure.

581
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,216
It's your fault, Gretchen.
You know that.

582
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,260
You terrified her.

583
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,932
I want you now to write
a farewell note.

584
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:33,769
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

585
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,688
and I'll drive you to the station.

586
00:58:35,689 --> 00:58:37,607
The last train leaves in one hour.

587
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:56,584
Bring your bike.

588
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:27,948
You like it?

589
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:30,076
Sure.

590
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,454
You know it? A common cuckoo.

591
00:59:34,622 --> 00:59:36,540
A magnificent creature.

592
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,001
Common.

593
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:43,631
Ah. But its behavior is not.

594
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:47,551
Its nature is quite remarkable.

595
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,890
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

596
00:59:53,474 --> 00:59:57,979
Some species need our help
to survive and reproduce.

597
01:00:00,398 --> 01:00:02,650
I'm a preservationist, you know?

598
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,671
Oh, come along now.

599
01:00:24,672 --> 01:00:29,051
I want you to understand
who you got involved with.

600
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:33,764
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

601
01:00:33,765 --> 01:00:36,017
with an illegal firearm.

602
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:37,893
What are you doing?

603
01:00:37,894 --> 01:00:39,020
He's a cop.

604
01:00:40,813 --> 01:00:42,690
No, he's not.

605
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:44,734
Not anymore.

606
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:47,111
You see, Erik here...

607
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,280
he's actually a policeman.

608
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:52,908
He has access to police files.

609
01:00:53,618 --> 01:00:57,078
Herr Lando was recently discharged

610
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:00,416
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

611
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:04,629
one that he is personally involved with.

612
01:01:04,837 --> 01:01:08,883
Okay, Erik. I think it's time
to take Herr Lando to the police station.

613
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,135
Gretchen, let's get your money.

614
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:17,558
This way, please.

615
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:19,935
Come along, now.

616
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,582
<i>You are a
liability, Gretchen. I can't let you out.</i>

617
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,128
What the fuck did you spray me with?

618
01:02:27,336 --> 01:02:29,005
<i>Just pheromones.</i>

619
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:31,757
<i>I am giving you the chance
to be of great use</i>

620
01:02:31,758 --> 01:02:33,592
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

621
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:36,887
<i>The adolescent needs to be trained.</i>

622
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,809
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

623
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:53,654
It's a mild sedative.

624
01:02:53,655 --> 01:02:55,030
What?

625
01:02:55,031 --> 01:02:57,533
It'll make Alma sleep through the night.

626
01:03:03,164 --> 01:03:04,957
I'm staying here tonight.

627
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:12,089
<i>These creatures can't speak like you or I.</i>

628
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,965
<i>But when trained,</i>

629
01:03:13,966 --> 01:03:17,970
<i>their song can be dizzyingly persuasive.</i>

630
01:04:39,427 --> 01:04:42,013
<i>No, no! Stay focused!</i>

631
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:20,134
That's enough for today.

632
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:41,906
Come here.

633
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:48,162
Ah, ah, ah.

634
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:53,584
Something is not right.

635
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:09,475
It is always something of a
confirmation of my dreams

636
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,394
and good
intentions.

637
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,942
Gretchen, your parents need to hurry up
with those construction plans.

638
01:06:18,067 --> 01:06:20,569
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

639
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:24,573
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

640
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:29,829
<i>What happened to Herr Lando's wife
must not repeat itself.</i>

641
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,877
<i>I'm very sorry for what happened
to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

642
01:06:37,503 --> 01:06:42,258
But this one's mother
wandered off my area of authority.

643
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:47,763
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

644
01:06:48,097 --> 01:06:50,308
before we had another offspring

645
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:52,059
ready to replace her.

646
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:55,605
There were family matters
prolonging my endeavor.

647
01:07:00,901 --> 01:07:02,278
Actually...

648
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:06,656
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

649
01:07:06,657 --> 01:07:10,119
to witness three laying ceremonies
as of now?

650
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:11,579
Wow.

651
01:07:12,413 --> 01:07:15,458
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

652
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,128
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

653
01:07:19,754 --> 01:07:24,800
<i>A sacred process that keeps
an ancient creature alive and well.</i>

654
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:28,763
<i>A magnificent creature
whose approach to family</i>

655
01:07:28,764 --> 01:07:31,307
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

656
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:36,561
Which brings me back to you, Erik.

657
01:07:36,562 --> 01:07:39,231
You will get Beatrix ready to conceive.

658
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:42,902
<i>Consider your mishap last night
a dry run.</i>

659
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:49,784
Erik?

660
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,621
I told him, not in the house.

661
01:08:04,298 --> 01:08:05,841
Shh...

662
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:14,265
Oh.

663
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:16,268
Stay here.

664
01:08:16,602 --> 01:08:18,229
No, no, no, no.

665
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:20,147
You should be on your side.

666
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:21,983
You could choke, my dear.

667
01:08:36,204 --> 01:08:37,204
Nein!

668
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,057
Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?

669
01:08:56,058 --> 01:08:57,517
I don't feel so good.

670
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:01,021
Take this.

671
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,537
Everything's fine.

672
01:09:18,706 --> 01:09:20,499
Everything's fine.

673
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:31,385
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

674
01:10:00,581 --> 01:10:02,792
After my mom died,

675
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:05,920
I accidentally called our house...

676
01:10:07,713 --> 01:10:10,549
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

677
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:15,763
It kind of helped,

678
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:19,016
so I kept calling.

679
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:24,146
Maybe you can do that too.

680
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:11,902
Do you know what this bird is famous for?

681
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:20,453
This bird lays its eggs
in the nests of other bird species

682
01:11:20,953 --> 01:11:25,374
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

683
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:30,379
No! Not in here!

684
01:12:01,118 --> 01:12:03,746
Your parents spent their honeymoon here?

685
01:12:14,757 --> 01:12:17,343
How old is your sister?

686
01:12:23,099 --> 01:12:24,350
Gretchen?

687
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:27,395
Yes, I am fine.

688
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:30,273
<i>We are in the treatment center
by the hospital.</i>

689
01:12:30,481 --> 01:12:34,110
If you come back in the morning,
Alma won't even know you were gone.

690
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:36,820
<i>Alma is going to
stay here for the evening.</i>

691
01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:39,156
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor her sleep.</i>

692
01:12:39,157 --> 01:12:40,198
Dad?

693
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,491
<i>Beth and I are coming home.</i>

694
01:12:41,492 --> 01:12:43,619
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about...

695
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,498
<i>What is it, Gretchen?</i>

696
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:50,751
We can't trust them.

697
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:53,900
<i>Gretchen, we can talk
when we're home.</i>

698
01:12:53,901 --> 01:12:56,299
I told you I will protect you.

699
01:13:00,011 --> 01:13:01,178
Get ready.

700
01:13:01,721 --> 01:13:03,431
What's wrong with Beth?

701
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:22,533
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

702
01:13:24,118 --> 01:13:27,830
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

703
01:13:29,332 --> 01:13:33,294
<i>Astonishing resemblance
to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

704
01:13:34,211 --> 01:13:37,965
<i>The surrogate mother's distress
grows in close proximity</i>

705
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:40,216
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

706
01:13:40,217 --> 01:13:44,305
<i>Thus both host parents
have been removed from the premises.</i>

707
01:13:47,308 --> 01:13:50,352
Compared to animal brood parasites,

708
01:13:50,353 --> 01:13:55,358
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

709
01:13:55,733 --> 01:13:59,820
<i>Instead of leaving their offspring
in the care of a host,</i>

710
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:03,616
<i>homo-cuculidae returns
to claim their young.</i>

711
01:14:04,617 --> 01:14:06,618
Contact with the biological mother

712
01:14:06,619 --> 01:14:10,206
speeds up the process
of the offspring's physical development

713
01:14:10,623 --> 01:14:13,626
<i>and its abilities significantly.</i>

714
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:22,385
We are about to initiate
the first close-distance encounter

715
01:14:22,885 --> 01:14:24,804
with the biological mother.

716
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:46,575
Brood parasites.

717
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:51,080
They don't impregnate.

718
01:14:51,372 --> 01:14:53,833
They implant eggs.

719
01:14:56,419 --> 01:14:59,213
My wife and I tried to get pregnant.

720
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:05,386
I was supposed to fertilize that egg.

721
01:15:08,306 --> 01:15:09,682
Like your father...

722
01:15:11,142 --> 01:15:12,435
on his honeymoon.

723
01:15:14,979 --> 01:15:16,689
And then what do they do?

724
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:20,526
Release them into the wild.

725
01:15:22,778 --> 01:15:25,281
When the mother shows up...

726
01:15:25,282 --> 01:15:27,533
I end this experiment.

727
01:15:29,452 --> 01:15:31,454
What about my sister?

728
01:15:34,165 --> 01:15:37,084
That is not your sister.

729
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:40,338
Two.

730
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:44,592
Yeah, the sister of the young woman
and a rogue police detective.

731
01:15:45,593 --> 01:15:49,305
<i>Yeah, I am afraid we must commence
definitive measures immediately.</i>

732
01:15:49,972 --> 01:15:51,432
She's dead.

733
01:15:52,642 --> 01:15:54,477
The feather I wrote my name with.

734
01:15:55,686 --> 01:15:57,772
The plumage of the apportioners.

735
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:05,154
We're in the middle of an experiment.

736
01:16:05,363 --> 01:16:07,740
<i>What happened? You're bleeding.</i>

737
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:11,285
The recordings you made
behind my back...

738
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:14,705
Are they still under the staircase
at your house?

739
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:20,586
Yah.

740
01:16:24,173 --> 01:16:26,008
I'm sorry, Danielle.

741
01:16:48,072 --> 01:16:49,240
No! No!

742
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:00,042
I'm not going to hurt you.

743
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,455
Alma. Alma?

744
01:17:37,955 --> 01:17:39,874
Alma, we have to go.

745
01:17:40,207 --> 01:17:41,834
We have to go now.

746
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,821
Just stay right here.

747
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,959
Cover your ears and stay close to me.

748
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:52,131
Alma?

749
01:27:39,473 --> 01:27:41,309
Herr König!

750
01:27:41,684 --> 01:27:43,144
She's dead!

751
01:27:43,894 --> 01:27:45,229
Mom is dead!

752
01:27:46,314 --> 01:27:50,276
Where's your machine gun, my dear?

753
01:27:50,943 --> 01:27:52,903
Is it under your cast, huh?

754
01:27:56,073 --> 01:27:57,324
Why me?

755
01:27:57,325 --> 01:27:59,869
It's not about you,
you little brat.

756
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:02,079
This is nature.

757
01:28:03,623 --> 01:28:05,916
She is supposed to be focusing...

758
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:09,503
on reproduction and breeding.

759
01:28:10,254 --> 01:28:15,968
And you are competing
for resources with her offspring.

760
01:28:16,469 --> 01:28:19,305
Our process here ensures

761
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,641
that each new generation we breed

762
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,685
is more powerful than the last.

763
01:28:25,102 --> 01:28:28,064
And my dear,
when I am done with you

764
01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:30,858
and reunite Alma with...

765
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,983
I'm sorry.

766
01:29:58,487 --> 01:30:05,244
I would never hurt you.

767
01:30:08,205 --> 01:30:10,958
Stay away from her, Alma.

768
01:30:12,627 --> 01:30:18,132
We have to leave now.

769
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:38,903
My mom called.

770
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:52,291
She got your message.

771
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:03,010
Will she come to visit?

772
01:31:09,809 --> 01:31:10,851
No.

773
01:31:12,228 --> 01:31:15,523
S-She... can't.

774
01:31:17,692 --> 01:31:22,655
But she says thank you.

775
01:31:23,864 --> 01:31:25,783
Thank you, Alma.

776
01:31:57,023 --> 01:31:58,858
Thank you, Alma.

777
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:08,784
I really need your help.

778
01:32:21,756 --> 01:32:23,215
<i>Henry!</i>

779
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:26,177
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

780
01:32:29,513 --> 01:32:31,057
I stand by it.

781
01:32:31,849 --> 01:32:34,477
<i>Did you ever tell your wife
you'd protect her?</i>

782
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:40,274
What?

783
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:46,072
<i>Did you tell her
you'd protect her?</i>

784
01:32:51,243 --> 01:32:52,370
<i>Did you?</i>

785
01:32:56,749 --> 01:32:58,250
Yes!

786
01:32:59,377 --> 01:33:01,462
<i>Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

787
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:28,864
Alma!

788
01:33:29,532 --> 01:33:32,201
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

789
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:37,707
What are you doing?
She's one of them!

790
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,960
- Alma!
- I don't think so.

791
01:33:41,127 --> 01:33:44,130
- Come to me.
- She will be.

792
01:33:45,339 --> 01:33:47,258
She will become!

793
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:49,969
I don't think so.

794
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:51,052
Alma!

795
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:53,179
We need to find out
how many there are.

796
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:56,392
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

797
01:33:57,143 --> 01:33:59,312
- Stop!
- Let her go.

798
01:33:59,895 --> 01:34:02,898
Let her go,
she's destined to become a mother.

799
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:04,942
She is not your sister!

800
01:34:05,192 --> 01:34:06,776
They stopped reproducing before.

801
01:34:06,777 --> 01:34:08,362
They will go extinct without preservation.

802
01:34:08,487 --> 01:34:10,196
Oh, they will go extinct.

803
01:34:10,197 --> 01:34:12,283
Hundreds of years of research.

804
01:34:12,284 --> 01:34:14,327
This is the will of the apportioners.

805
01:34:14,452 --> 01:34:15,995
Let her go.

806
01:34:16,871 --> 01:34:18,551
You don't know
what you're doing!
