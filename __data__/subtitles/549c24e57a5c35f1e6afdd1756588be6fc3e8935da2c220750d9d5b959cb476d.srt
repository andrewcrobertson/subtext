1051
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,587
I have the Wolverine!

1052
00:42:11,588 --> 00:42:14,013
I alone control her!

1053
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:16,799
You come for me,

1054
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,585
you come for her.

1055
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,268
So sorry.
I know it's pronounced "him."

1056
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:24,491
I'm gender blind.
It's my cross to bear.

1057
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:25,821
Who's next?

1058
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:27,153
- Toad!
- [snarls]

1059
00:42:27,154 --> 00:42:28,957
You're up.

1070
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,248
Not all of you was asleep.

00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,185
- [Deadpool grunts]
- Don't bother.

1072
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:01,120
They're very thorough.

1073
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:04,355
If you know where we are,
start talking.

1074
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:05,960
You're in The Void.

1075
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,797
Think of it as purgatory.

1076
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:10,394
Reed called it
a metaphysical junkyard.

1077
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:11,768
Where anything useless goes

1078
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:13,770
before it gets
annihilated forever.

1079
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:16,906
And where the TVA sends
people that don't play nice

1080
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,336
with the rest
of the multiverse.

1081
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,743
- Like you?
- And you.

1082
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,340
[Deadpool] What does
the annihilating?

1083
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:22,911
Alioth.

1084
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:24,611
[Deadpool]
Alioth is in this thing?

1085
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,310
From Loki,
Season 1, Episode 5?

1086
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:29,479
Everyone here
is on the run from Alioth.

1087
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,018
Most don't make it.

1088
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:32,789
There's a resistance, though.

1089
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,892
Other people like us
that managed to survive.

1090
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:38,042
They're hidin' out
in the borderlands,

1091
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,193
trying to find a way
the fuck outta here.

1092
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:41,744
Then that's where we go.

1093
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,988
[Deadpool] "We"? Us? A team?

1094
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,232
The answer is yes.
Shake on it.

1095
00:43:46,233 --> 00:43:47,001
Fuck! You nicked it.

1096
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,388
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

1097
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:51,776
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

1098
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,393
Make 'em fix things.

1099

00:43:54,752 --> 00:43:56,109
Something funny, bub?

1101
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,475
She might have somethin'
to say about that.

1102
00:43:58,476 --> 00:44:00,279
Who's "she"?

1103
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:01,950
In The Void,

1104
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:04,481
you're either food for Alioth

1105
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:06,317
or you work for her.

Oh, you must be

1117
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:25,265
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

1118
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,805
She don't like the chatter.

1119
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:28,708

Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

1123
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,729
That's not Chuck.

1124

Ah, shit.

00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:52,995
[Deadpool] Oh, ableism. Great.

1126
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:56,296
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

1127

A Wolverine.

1128
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:01,268
I wondered when
I'd get one of you.

1129
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:02,070
You're one of Xavier's.

1130
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:04,370
[Deadpool] You-You know him?
You know Chuck?

1131
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:05,541
Oh, I knew him.

1132
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:06,712

[Deadpool] Amen. I've never
loved roommates. Mine's blind.

1136

Except she can see cocaine.

1137

You want to chime in,

Who are you?

Charles Xavier's twin,
Cassandra Nova.

1141
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:26,326
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:28,767
Hmm. You two are cute.

1143
00:46:28,768 --> 00:46:31,331
I have a good feeling
about this.

1144
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,351
And I've been trying to catch

all about you.

you're a psychotic
megalomaniacal asshole.

Hellbent on domination and pain.

00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,126
You said all that about me?

No! No! I don't...

1156
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:01,691

to come to this.

I do get a Charles
through here.

00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,081
Never mine, though.

1202
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:27,886
No. He didn't care to find me.

[Deadpool groans] Gen Z
and their trauma-bragging!

1204

Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

1205
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,626
or cancer like the rest of us?

1206

But I'm not like
the rest of you.

1207
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:39,997
Except maybe the Wolverine.

1208
00:48:39,998 --> 00:48:43,133
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

You're that scary, huh?

1210
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,366
The TVA certainly thought so.

1211
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:49,106
They sent me here
before I could walk.

1212
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:50,877
And you know,
it's the best thing

1213

in a garbage dump.

in the garbage dump.

Did he make you feel safe?

1224
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:16,864
We're mutants.
We're never safe.

1225

[whoops]

1228
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:25,373
[Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1229
00:49:25,374 --> 00:49:26,858
I don't...
I don't want the smoke.

1230
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:28,519
I don't have
any beef with you.

1231
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,817
I just want
to save my friends.

1232
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:31,114
I just... I want to go home.

1233
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,282
Well, the thing is,
I could get you home.

1234
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:35,751
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

1235
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:38,221
[Deadpool] Not good.
[groaning]

1236
00:49:39,783 --> 00:49:41,883
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

1237
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:45,030
[Deadpool straining] Your...
fingers are inside me,

1238
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,788
but not in a good way.

1239
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:49,133
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

1240
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:51,299
I have to get my hands dirty.

1241
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,600
- [Deadpool groaning]
- [shushing]

1242
00:49:54,765 --> 00:49:56,602
I've got you.

1243
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:00,342
[whispers] I've got you...

1244
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,983
[Wade, muffled]
What do you mean?

1245
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,954
I can't... I can't reach you.
You're not here.

1246
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:08,987
I'm right here.

1247
00:50:08,988 --> 00:50:12,156
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

1248
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:15,390
Then show me.
You got to do something.

1249
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,819
Show you what?

1250
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:21,340
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

1251
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:25,862
Ever since they turned you
down, you took a knee.

1252
00:50:25,863 --> 00:50:28,634
Baby, you never got back up.

1253
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,868
I know you're
going through something.

1254
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:34,144
Let me go through it with you.

1255
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:38,017
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

1256
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,532
Where'd you go?

1257
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:44,485
[Wade] Oh, my God.

1258
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:46,784
[♪ melancholy music playing]

1259
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:48,489
You just say it. Okay?

1260
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,193
Say, "I don't want you.

1261
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:52,129
"I don't want to be with you."

1262
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,890
Go ahead. Say it.
Say... Say, "I don't..."

1263
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:55,479
Say it.
You don't wanna be with me.

1264
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,069
Tell me that
and I'll walk away.

1265
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:57,959
Say, "I don't want you."

[sighs] Fuck...

1268
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:09,411
You'll never fucking matter.

1269
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:13,942
What?

1270
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:17,056
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

- matter.
- matter...

1276
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:34,903
[Deadpool]
She never said that.

1277
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:36,107
- [Cassandra] No.
- [groans]

1278
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,473

[Deadpool groans]
You are so mean!

1281
00:51:41,295 --> 00:51:43,379
My brain could taste
your fingers,

1282
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,050
and they tasted like hate!

1283
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:48,252
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

1284
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:51,271
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

1285
00:51:51,272 --> 00:51:54,291
And long before you came here.

1286
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:55,753
This is Baby Knife.

1287
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:57,393
She's gonna fuck you
in the face now.

1288
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:58,162
If you want to kill me,

1289
00:51:58,163 --> 00:52:00,429
it's going to take
more than a little blade.

1290
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,957
[Deadpool] How about six?

1291
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:06,138
[laughs mockingly]
My boy's wicked strong.

1292
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:07,865
That's my big boy.

- [strains] Almost done.
- Almost done what?

1314
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:16,208
Getting my knife out
of your buttocks,

1315
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:17,967
- pervert!
- Aah! Fuck!

Get your mind out of my pants!

1317
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,874
- I'm telling Blake.
- New rules.

1318
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:23,478
I talk now.

1319
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,250
That's gonna be very hard
on the audience.

1320
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:26,916
Shut the fuck up!

1321
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:28,582
Let me fuckin' think.

1322
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:31,619
Now we gotta get back
to Paradox, right?

1323
00:53:33,115 --> 00:53:33,884
Right?

1324
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,789
Je m'excuse. Am I allowed
to speak now or...

1325
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,693
Just nod, asshole.

1326
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:41,430
Right.

1327
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:42,816
Then we find the others
that poor kid, Johnny,

1328
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:44,203
was talking about
before you got him killed!

1329
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:45,666
[Deadpool] "Poor kid."
He's, like, 50!

1330
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:47,184
Yeah, if there's
a chance they know

1331
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,109
how to get out of here,
we find 'em.

1332
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,034
And make those TVA fuckers
fix my shit

1333
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:52,585
like you fucking promised!

1334
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:54,136
[Deadpool] I smell quest.

1335
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:56,138
[sniffing]

1336
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:58,415
I smell food.

1337
00:54:00,142 --> 00:54:05,224
So what made you finally wear
an honest-to-God costume?

1338
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,720
Mine's red
so they can't see me bleed.

1339
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:10,856
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

1340
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:13,089
Have you been checked
for ADHD?

1341
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,056
Mm-mm.

1342
00:54:14,057 --> 00:54:15,992
But I've had several STDs,

1343
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:18,732
which were probably caused
by ADHD.

1344
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:20,239
Fuck!

1345
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,307
What are you looking for?

1346
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:24,275
Oh. Thank fuck.

1347
00:54:24,276 --> 00:54:26,245
No, no, no, no, no.
That's rubbing alcohol.

1348
00:54:26,246 --> 00:54:28,005
You don't want to drink...
Oh, yeah.

1349
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,139
There you go. Fuck that liver.

1350
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,974
[exhales]

1351
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,582
- Good. Okay.
- [sighs]

1352
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:35,716
What the fuck are those?

1353
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:36,419
Oh.

1354
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,422
Back in civilian life,
I wear a toupee,

1355
00:54:38,423 --> 00:54:40,457
but nobody knows. [chuckles]

1356
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,228
[laughing]

1357
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,956
Everybody knows.

1358
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:47,760
Wanna talk about
what's haunting you,

1359
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:50,566
or should we wait
for a third act flashback?

1360
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:53,338
Ah... Go fuck yourself.

1361
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:57,606
You know...

1362
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:01,511
in my world, you're...
[clears throat]

1363
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,809
You're well regarded.

1364
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,580
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1365
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:07,979
They don't like me much
in mine either.

1366
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,913
You don't say.

1367
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,983
I wanted to be something,
you know. I...

1368
00:55:11,984 --> 00:55:13,886
Shit, I wanted
to be an Avenger.

1369
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:15,788
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1370
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:19,397
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1371
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,332
When my girlfriend left me,

1372
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,896
- and I just...
- You had a girlfriend?

1373
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:25,117
Yeah.

1374
00:55:25,118 --> 00:55:26,337
Vanessa.

1375
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,703
When we met, she was a dancer.

1376
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:31,068
We had a whole life.

1377
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:33,102
It was good.

1378
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:36,139
But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.

1379
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:39,010
Fucked that right up.

1380
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:40,241
But you,

1381
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,176
you were an X-Man.

1382
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:44,323
Fuck that.
You were the X-Man. You...

1383
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:47,392
The Wolverine.

1384
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:51,330
He was a hero in my world.

1385
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,256
Yeah, well...

1386
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:56,566
he ain't shit in mine.

1387
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:04,607
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1388
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:06,510
He died.

1389
00:56:06,774 --> 00:56:07,235
How?

1390
00:56:07,236 --> 00:56:10,173
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked by a tree, but,

1391
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:12,076
really, you just
ran out of batteries

1392
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,232
- trying to save someone.
- Who?

1393
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:16,388
The shitheels
that grew her in a lab

1394
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,687
called her "X-23." But...

1395
00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:19,918

We don't know that.

He may have survived.

about Cassandra.

1765

crudely onto the ground

while the soil greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1768

He was like a brother to me.

make a difference. But...

But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1781
01:11:55,656 --> 01:11:57,955
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1782

was the only way

from her powers.

01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,502
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

but he works for Cassandra.
