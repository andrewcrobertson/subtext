1
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,509
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

2
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,095
Get that monkey on the train.

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,141
The Medici Brothers' circus is taking off!

4
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,221
Breathing normal...

5
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,431
heart rate normal.

6
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,892
You're cleared to perform.

7
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,563
Milly!
Another train!

8
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,488
Niños, wait!
We are coming, too!

9
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,085
Joplin!

10
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,712
Joplin, Missouri!

11
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,673
-Hey, sweetheart!
-Daddy!

12
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,457
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

13
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,125
You know, in the letter I sent?

14
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,630
I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.

15
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,048
Well, come here now.

16
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,384
Still me.

17
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,101
And you...

18
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,438
you're just as pretty as your momma.

19
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,406
We missed you, Dad.

20
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,284
I missed you, too.

21
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,499
Ivan and Catherine, thank you both...

22
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,209
for looking out for them.

23
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,794
Captain Farrier, of course.

24
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,587
It's Holt, come on now.

25
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,005
It's just Holt.

26
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,674
Don't you worry.

27
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,511
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

28
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,683
Come on! Come on!

29
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,142
Home sweet home.

30
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,436
-Hey! Holt!
-Hey, Puck.

31
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,730
-Hey, Thomas.
-Milly, come on!

32
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,065
Hi, Holt.

33
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,235
Hey, Miss Atlantis.

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,572
Pramesh!

35
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,365
The very best journey, dear friend.

36
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,784
The road that leads home.

37
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,035
Welcome home.

38
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,456
No hugs!

39
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,377
Pramesh, I missed you, too.

40
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,589
What's going on?
The camp's half the size it used to be.

41
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,216
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

42
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,474
Attention, everybody!

43
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,854
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

44
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,817
Because "keep the cages locked"
is the most important rule of all!

45
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,487
When I catch that fugitive scalawag
who interrupted my dream...

46
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,530
Rongo!

47
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,948
Where is Rongo?

48
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,994
Who's heading camp management?

49
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,162
I'm the strongman.

50
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,873
Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats!

51
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,627
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

52
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,254
Which means animal whereabouts!

53
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,298
Now, go find that monkey!

54
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,342
I'll have a look around.

55
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,808
All right, everybody. Back to work.

56
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,231
Holt!

57
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,869
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

58
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,289
Natalya, Vincenzo...

59
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,000
the Vanderjees, and then...

60
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,379
your wife.

61
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,172
Poor Annie.

62
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,468
How she fought.

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,223
She was the best of us.

64
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,101
I know it.

65
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,313
So, you know, for her,
let's have our best season yet!

66
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,233
Now where's my horses?

67
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,112
Funny story about that.

68
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,530
Funny how?

69
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,656
He sold them.

70
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,492
But our act is the soul of this show!

71
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,038
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

72
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,374
If only Milly would have learned the trade.

73
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,042
I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus.

74
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,211
-"Show-off"?
-You see?

75
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,714
I wanna make scientific discoveries.

76
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,549
I wanna be noticed for my mind.

77
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,717
Okay.

78
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,679
Then learn clairvoyance. Telepathy!
Something!

79
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,724
I can do a handstand for almost ten seconds.

80
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,771
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

81
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,066
Hang on now.
Without horses, what the hell's my act?

82
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,986
The crowds come to see me!

83
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,487
Max, please.

84
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,824
I need to work.

85
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,702
Good news.

86
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,495
One job, I have.

87
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,623
Okay, then. Give me a showstopper.

88
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,959
You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee?
He finally ran off with the bearded lady.

89
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,254
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

90
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,257
I need somebody good to tend the elephants.

91
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,301
No, you're not serious.

92
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,594
I am on occasion.

93
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,221
This is a big job and you know it.

94
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,804
No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of...

95
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:34,972
Dad.

96
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,562
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

97
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,899
Your scrawny, mangy, cut-rate elephants.

98
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,443
They're important.
Especially this season.

99
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,945
Why's that?

100
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,072
I know it goes against my nature...

101
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,867
but for once, I made an investment.

102
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,081
There she is!

103
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,792
Our brand-new Asian female.

104
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,880
I bought her off a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.
I had to get him way down on the price.

105
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,593
But I swear to you, Holt,
I saw something special in her eyes.

106
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,680
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

107
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,391
Oh, no. She's not sick.

108
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
Any day now...

109
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,145
She's having a baby.

110
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,278
Dad, watch! Dad! I'm getting better!

111
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,988
Hang on now, this is our tent?

112
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,699
What happened to our things?

113
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,910
We had nice furniture, we had rooms.

114
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,247
Max, what didn't you sell?

115
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,748
You son of a gun.

116
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,333
Dad, look!

117
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,127
Toys?

118
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,505
They're not toys.
They're for my science experiments.

119
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,175
Well, we're a circus, darlin', a circus.

120
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,844
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

121
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,471
You couldn't just take up one act?

122
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,849
Tumblin' or tightrope?

123
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,851
Maybe I don't need the world staring at me.

124
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,770
Maybe I'm just not you and Mom.

125
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,230
Well, who makes the rules in this family?

126
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,690
Mom did.

127
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,483
Yeah, well, I make them now.

128
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,402
So just... Go to your room!

129
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,820
This is my room.

130
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,865
This is all our rooms.

131
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,034
See this?

132
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,119
You know what this is?

133
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,787
It's your inheritance.

134
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,082
Dad!

135
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,753
Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.

136
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,588
He's stuck here.

137
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,507
Like you and me.

138
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,772
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

139
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,152
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

140
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,071
A new season!

141
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,461
Let me in, you little hairball!

142
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,345
Hey!

143
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,224
Would somebody please let me in my own train?

144
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,352
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

145
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,687
The elephants need us!

146
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,607
Good God, son,
you're gonna make me miss the war.

147
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,110
Gimme that. Go on, lead the way.

148
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,070
Move it!

149
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,117
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!
Don't make me have to incentivize.

150
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,077
Get her out of there, boys.

151
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,831
Easy, Rufus.

152
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,166
That's a lady in there.

153
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,127
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

154
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,421
But he just ain't on the marquee no more.

155
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,173
Time to see what he's been missing.

156
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,799
Do you ever get that feeling?

157
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,259
Like there's something you're missing?

158
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,553
Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist.

159
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,639
Weak ticker. Doc's advice.

160
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,100
Dad? Something's wrong.

161
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,894
She doesn't wanna leave.

162
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,441
Come on!

163
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,109
Let's get her outta there!

164
00:12:58,904 --> 00:12:59,988
What are you doing?

165
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:00,864
Come on!

166
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,325
Leave her alone!

167
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,160
-Stop hurting her, please!
-Leave her alone!

168
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,173
Dad, look.

169
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,716
What now?

170
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,969
Move her!

171
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,558
Whoa, we got a baby in here.

172
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:34,690
She had a baby!

173
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,025
Baby!
Notify the press!

174
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,193
"The Medici Brothers...

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,614
"proudly present America's newest,
precious bundle of joy!"

176
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,742
Look at that.

177
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,203
It's okay now.

178
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,498
Don't be scared.

179
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,588
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

180
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,495
Baby! We got a baby!

181
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,122
We got a baby!

182
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,837
What is that?

183
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,047
Baby Jumbo.

184
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,218
I already got fake freaks in the freak show!

185
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,512
I don't need a real one in the center ring!

186
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,181
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

187
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,767
Gone and bought yourself a baby monster.

188
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,727
Think he can hear me?

189
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,647
Boo!

190
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,209
Rongo! Telegram to Brugelbecker.

191
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,127
"We have been bilked with damaged goods.

192
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,631
"This is an aberration, travestation...

193
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,299
"and I demand my money back."

194
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,094
But whatever you do, do not call the papers.

195
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,638
We are not advertising this baby.

196
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,474
Tell me you didn't do it.

197
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,643
You did it?

198
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,481
Never do anything I tell ya
without checking with me first!

199
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,238
Why me? Why me?

200
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,907
A face only a mother could love.

201
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:49,992
Sir?

202
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,452
Many of us find you handsome.

203
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,496
I was talking about the elephant!

204
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,879
Look, she's drawing him a bath.

205
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,303
Need a vet to come to look at him, Max.

206
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,054
No, no witnesses!

207
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,808
We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks.
We promised them a beautiful baby!

208
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,144
You have until tomorrow night to fix that!

209
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,729
-Me?
-Yes, you!

210
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,022
This is my problem?

211
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,315
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

212
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,358
Make those ears disappear!

213
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,118
Don't look at me.

214
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,795
Look at him,
those giant ears weigh him down.

215
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,759
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

216
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,511
Welcome to the circus.

217
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,639
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

218
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,975
Aren't elephants afraid of mice?

219
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,645
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

220
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,023
Someone needs to keep him company
when he's not with his momma.

221
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,411
Look. Give him one.

222
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,122
If he can lift his ears out of the way.

223
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,835
No. You have to blow your ears
out of the way.

224
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,336
Like this.

225
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,718
Good luck with that.
Maybe you can teach him to juggle, too.

226
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,887
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

227
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,055
Do what I do.

228
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,515
Blow.

229
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,150
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

230
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,319
He thinks it's a game.

231
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,030
-Max, come here.
-What?

232
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,240
Watch this.

233
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,411
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

234
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:58,996
stampede!

235
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,455
Send 'em!

236
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,542
Get out of the way, Max!

237
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,006
I'm still working out the timing.

238
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,513
Let me have a turn.

239
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,614
Meanwhile,
for when you lead out the elephants...

240
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,949
I had the costume departments
make you up a little something.

241
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,034
Okay.

242
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,995
What in gosh...

243
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,830
You really broke the bank with this, Max.

244
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,373
A lot of kids come to the show.

245
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,125
You don't want me to scare anyone,
I get it.

246
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,210
Dad, Dad!

247
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,836
It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.

248
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,755
He jumped in the air. With his ears.

249
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,340
Guys, I said leave him be.

250
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,549
But he was this far off the ground!

251
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,717
Yeah, I bet he was.

252
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,469
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

253
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,596
Dad, really. We tried an experiment.

254
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,473
Just leave the poor guy alone.

255
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,605
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

256
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,149
Otherwise, you don't deserve to know.

257
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,278
It's been a rough year for both of them.

258
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,031
Annie knew how to talk to 'em.

259
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,249
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
step right up.

260
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,626
Hurry, hurry. Come see the circus today.

261
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:36,218
"To be or not to be...

262
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,012
"that is the question.

263
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,933
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous..."

264
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,119
That ain't no snake.

265
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,412
Heck, I could do it.

266
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,414
As you wish.

267
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,207
Get out of here!

268
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,169
Rongo, let's go!

269
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,300
Hey, get away from the baby elephant!

270
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,992
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

271
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,077
Ladies and gentlemen...

272
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:49,333
I am your Master of Ceremonies,
Maximilian Medici.

273
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,587
And now, I give to you...

274
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,173
the Medici Brothers' circus.

275
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,599
Okay.

276
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,476
Okay, okay, no one's gonna hurt him.

277
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,561
Okay, little guy, let's put on a show.

278
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,925
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

279
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,510
Hey!

280
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,928
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

281
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,557
Nah, he died in the war.
So sad.

282
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,948
What's he doing?

283
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,456
He's reaching for the feathers.

284
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,884
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

285
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,404
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

286
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,114
Those ears are fake!

287
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,866
Look! Look at the sign!

288
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,117
"Dumbo!"

289
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,253
Calm down, now.

290
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,884
He's a fake!

291
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,344
Yeah, he's a fake!

292
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,512
Shut up!

293
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,222
You're scaring the elephants!

294
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,850
Take it easy now. Calm down.

295
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,852
Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

296
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,772
All right, sit down.

297
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,149
-Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!
-I said sit down!

298
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,360
It's okay, little fella.

299
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,154
Fake!

300
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,616
Rongo! Music!

301
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,868
Happiness, joy!

302
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,254
Hear 'em making fun of your ugly baby?

303
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,840
Who's gonna help him now?

304
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,470
Holt, get those ears off the stage!

305
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,106
Okay, all right.

306
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,482
Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

307
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,150
Just calm down.

308
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,571
Okay. Attagirl.

309
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,489
We're here to protect him. Same as you.

310
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,200
Attagirl.

311
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,994
Nice and easy.

312
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,083
Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

313
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,712
Rufus, no!

314
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,090
-Rufus, stop!
-Mad elephant!

315
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,300
Get back!

316
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,224
Max, get the kids out of here!

317
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,185
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

318
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,728
Careful, careful.

319
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,153
Kids?

320
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,446
Go, go, go!

321
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:48,614
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

322
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,823
Come on, this way.

323
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,286
How do you like your job now, cowboy?

324
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,670
Milly, Joe!
Come on!

325
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,924
Let's go!
Come on!

326
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,293
And I wanna just emphasize,
we did everything right.

327
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,713
What it is, the tent just absolutely
fell down. It just collapsed.

328
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,091
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

329
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,721
Brugelbecker, I have a man dead,
do you understand?

330
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:03,058
This is what they're reading
from the Great Lakes to the Gulf!

331
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,562
You have a moral responsibility
to buy your killer elephant back.

332
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,605
What about the baby?

333
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,484
Well, at least he got a few laughs.

334
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:16,321
I'll put him in the clown act,
see if I can salvage something.

335
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,117
I'll buy her back half price.

336
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,162
You will buy her back full price.

337
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,581
Quarter price.

338
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,000
Half price it is!

339
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,798
Up!

340
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,845
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

341
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,180
Away. Back to your tent now.

342
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,806
But she's his mom!

343
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,766
Dad, please. Stop them.

344
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,101
Please!

345
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:47,728
Do something.

346
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,438
Mom would have done something.

347
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,815
Momma's not here.

348
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,989
Okay, little fella. Okay. Come on.

349
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,660
I know, I do.

350
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:09,082
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

351
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,457
Darlin', it's late.

352
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,294
Go on now.

353
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,141
I know. I can't sleep, either.

354
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:36,939
My momma told me there'd be times
when my life seemed locked behind a door.

355
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:43,820
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

356
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:50,410
And said whenever I have that feeling,
imagine that door...

357
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,954
and just turn the key.

358
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,750
So, I keep trying.

359
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,468
Not supposed to be in here alone.

360
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,887
I'm not. You're here.

361
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,222
What's that?

362
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,516
I just thought he might be hungry.

363
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,518
He's sad.

364
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:16,979
You don't eat when you're sad.

365
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,605
The mermaid does.

366
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,775
Come on.

367
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,194
Have one, Dumbo.

368
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,029
We're calling him Dumbo now?

369
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,824
If we call him Jumbo Junior...

370
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,368
it might make him miss his mom.

371
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,793
Here you go... Dumbo.

372
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,422
Come on, and flap those ears again.

373
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,799
To show us we didn't imagine it.

374
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,348
Your momma,
she didn't mean to hurt anyone.

375
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,351
She was just protecting you.

376
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:59,104
And we think your ears are great.

377
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,986
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

378
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,864
Nobody wants to be alone.

379
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,782
Well...

380
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,286
if you change your mind...

381
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:18,832
Night-night, Dumbo.

382
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:49,780
Wow!

383
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,827
It's not the peanuts that made him do it.

384
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,246
It's the feathers!

385
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,170
Dumbo!

386
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,828
Dumbo, you gotta do this in the show.

387
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:38,996
What do you mean?

388
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,206
'Cause if the circus sells more tickets
and Medici makes more money...

389
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,501
then we can get him to use some
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

390
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:45,710
Yeah!

391
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:48,172
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

392
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,965
Just show them all what you can do.

393
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,466
Come on. We gotta tell Dad.

394
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,303
No. He'll just tell us to be practical.

395
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,263
Shows got canceled for a week, right?

396
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,515
We can research and study and test.

397
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,061
You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo.

398
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,439
And we're gonna bring your momma home.

399
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,152
Fire!

400
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,549
So low.

401
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,468
An all-time low.

402
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,386
Who said he didn't want to be recognized?

403
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,558
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

404
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,560
Except for lights, music, fire and crowds.

405
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:44,520
You can do it.

406
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,687
Come on, Dumbo.

407
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:48,524
You can do it, Dumbo!

408
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,942
Show 'em all like you showed us!

409
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,448
-Come! Come! Come!
-Attaboy, come on.

410
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,076
Keep comin'. Come on.

411
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,000
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

412
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:16,635
Hey! Hey!

413
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,200
They love it! They love it!

414
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,539
All right, Dumbo.

415
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,999
You put out the fire.

416
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,602
He won't fly. He's scared.

417
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,478
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

418
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:16,737
Go on, Dumbo!

419
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,045
Attaboy.

420
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,633
Yeah! Rule Number One.

421
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,468
"Always have a big finish!"

422
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,687
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

423
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:52,981
Yeah!

424
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,285
Holt!

425
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,496
-Look, Max!
-What? What?

426
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,414
-He's trapped up there.
-Put the fire out!

427
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,085
Dumbo! Fly!

428
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,045
He won't fly without a feather!

429
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,552
Put the fire out!

430
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:22,803
Put it out!

431
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,430
-Joe!
-Stop!

432
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,977
Holt, I thought she didn't want to be
in an act.

433
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,106
Milly!

434
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,082
Here, Dumbo!

435
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,251
Come on.

436
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:55,919
Show 'em.

437
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:58,922
Come on, Dumbo.

438
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,075
Fly, Dumbo.

439
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,160
Fly!

440
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,261
Yeah!

441
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,298
You knew he could do this?

442
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,342
You should talk to your kids more.

443
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,312
Sotheby...

444
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,897
cancel my dinner with the president.

445
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,900
We've got business with an elephant.

446
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,867
Friends, the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

447
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,369
Happy clowns!

448
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,751
-Rongo the Strong!
-Boss.

449
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,670
Hello, Jo!

450
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,131
The Medici Brothers' circus.

451
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:08,260
Where true love and mystery abound!

452
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,847
Now where's my star?

453
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,266
Dumbo!

454
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:15,475
How's your bath?

455
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,519
Too warm? Too cold?

456
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,772
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

457
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:25,527
In our country, legend tells us
the gods can take animal forms.

458
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,696
Champagne for Dumbo!

459
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,364
No booze near the baby!

460
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,180
Sorry, Dumbo.

461
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,599
It's not your momma.

462
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,434
Take Dumbo back inside.

463
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,948
Ladies and gentlemen, please make way
for the emperor of enchantment.

464
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,449
For the architect of dreams.

465
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,535
For the Columbus of Coney Island.

466
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,079
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

467
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:24,044
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

468
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,506
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

469
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,299
Miss Marchant! Miss Marchant!

470
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,306
Signore Medici!

471
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,517
He knows who I am.

472
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:40,227
We were just passing through Missouri...

473
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,312
and we heard you were putting on
a little show.

474
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:45,482
Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.

475
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:49,027
No, sir. The honor is mine.

476
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:52,990
I would like to offer you a drink.

477
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,826
But I'm all out of bourbon.

478
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,621
And cognac and scotch.

479
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,087
Not now!

480
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,508
Is that a monkey in your desk?

481
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:13,635
Just for emergencies.

482
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,054
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

483
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,764
I probably should tell you...

484
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,225
the elephant is not for sale.

485
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:22,895
Dumbo will only fly for the Medici circus.

486
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,439
That's assuming he is real.

487
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,739
See for yourself.

488
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,283
And all due respect, I don't got all day.

489
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,868
-Pleasure to meet you...
-Excuse me.

490
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,120
Hello there.

491
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,255
So this creature of yours...

492
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,049
is supposed to fly?

493
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,968
Trade secrets.

494
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,689
Max, if you don't mind my asking...

495
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:12,152
where did you come upon the animal?

496
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,488
He hails from the far east.

497
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:15,656
How far?

498
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,282
Far.

499
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,992
He doesn't look like "magic" to me.

500
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,871
Well, what the heck can you tell
by appearances, right?

501
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:25,749
And you train flying elephants, too?

502
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,001
Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side.

503
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,422
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

504
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,927
Ah, yes.

505
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:41,598
Yeah?

506
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,309
And how on earth did you do that?

507
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:46,645
With the scientific method.

508
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,732
One picture, one picture!

509
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:51,859
Max.

510
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:55,362
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

511
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:59,992
And the tragedy of it is,
is you don't even know that you have it.

512
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,620
Do you know what it is that you have, Max?

513
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:04,705
No.

514
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,456
It's mystique.

515
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,002
Max, I know your type.

516
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:12,546
Charlatan, con man, opportunist...

517
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:15,549
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

518
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:19,928
And I know it comes from a deep desire
to build something authentic and true.

519
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,722
I know your game.

520
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,056
It's not a game.

521
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:26,685
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

522
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,146
It's up your sleeve.

523
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,191
It's in your pocket.

524
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,576
The secret to show business
is always keep a rabbit in your hat.

525
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,245
Or a monkey in your desk, I guess.

526
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,290
Ownership shares?

527
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:51,919
Max, look around you.
Your entire way of life is dying.

528
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,422
The future of the entertainment business
is to bring the audience to you.

529
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:57,257
And I've built that destination.

530
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,801
What I'm lacking...

531
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,553
is a protégé.

532
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:08,352
I know there's no Medici Brothers.

533
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:12,439
You probably always wanted one.

534
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,025
You're offering me a partnership?

535
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,193
Yes.

536
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,111
And a home.

537
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,863
For you and the entire troupe.

538
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:23,158
A home?
For all of us?

539
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,661
Yes. Join me.

540
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,704
Join me and my family.

541
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,415
Let me take us all into the future.

542
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:33,585
Let me take us all...

543
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,504
to Dreamland!

544
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,090
I wish Momma could've seen this.

545
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:23,552
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

546
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,226
Way to work your magic, Max.

547
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,280
We hear you, Dumbo!

548
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:45,991
Why won't you let him see outside?

549
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:48,118
Remember, young lady...

550
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:49,578
mystique.

551
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:56,418
Now this is why I joined the circus.

552
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,757
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

553
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,635
All right, sugar plum.
Remember, we got a job to do here.

554
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,513
My daughter, she fancies herself
the next Marie Curie.

555
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:11,725
Don't ever let anybody tell you
what you can't do.

556
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,436
Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't.

557
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:18,524
What is it exactly that we do here,
ma chérie?

558
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:21,777
We make the impossible possible.

559
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,243
And that's where you'll perform.

560
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,452
The Colosseum!

561
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,038
Dumbo will stay in the training tent behind.

562
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:34,706
Dumbo!

563
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,797
Why aren't we going with him?

564
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:45,759
Because that is your new home.

565
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,349
Wow!

566
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,185
Look at this place!

567
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,645
A library...

568
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,689
"And the children shall lead them."

569
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,732
We're grateful for the opportunity,
Mr. Vandevere.

570
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,193
Your family's mine.

571
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:09,825
You know, I've been brushing up
on your story, Mr. Farrier.

572
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,952
Kentucky's top trick rider.

573
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,537
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

574
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:16,623
only here, you'd be Captain Farrier...

575
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,916
war hero.

576
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:21,670
One-armed wonder.

577
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:23,213
National treasure.

578
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:24,923
Wow!

579
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,550
Well, I still can ride.

580
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:27,801
Oh, I know you can.

581
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,428
And you're going to.

582
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,973
Right after you get that little elephant
off the ground for me.

583
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:34,725
You mean once his act's working?

584
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,435
You're back in the saddle.

585
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,521
We're still working on the schedule
for the rest of your troupe...

586
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,565
but on Friday...

587
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:43,442
we premiere our little Dumbo.

588
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:47,946
I get goose bumps.

589
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,825
Why are you looking at me?

590
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:57,039
Well, because the only thing more amazing
than a flying elephant...

591
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,082
is the goddess who can fly it.

592
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,794
Have you lost your mind?

593
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,759
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

594
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,763
So, we fly Friday!

595
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,391
Dumbo's never flown with anyone.

596
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:21,980
That's why it's become abundantly clear
why we need you.

597
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:24,608
Dumbo!

598
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,531
-Hey, buddy.
-We missed you. You all right?

599
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,408
Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge.

600
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,410
No one sees the animal without his approval.

601
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:36,828
Holt.

602
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:38,455
Just call me Holt.

603
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:41,750
I thought you were a military man.

604
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,086
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

605
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,588
No.

606
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,967
So you better keep your elephant friend
on my good side.

607
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,306
Hiya, Dumbo.

608
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,315
Dumbo, you mind?

609
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:06,650
Can I get my arm?

610
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,320
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

611
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:12,114
Welcome.

612
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:15,200
For the record, this was not my idea.

613
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,869
Dumbo works alone.

614
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,495
So do I.

615
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:21,790
Bonjour, Milly, Joe...

616
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,543
And you...

617
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,548
Charming.

618
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,593
Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you
without your makeup.

619
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,053
So I gotta teach you to fly?

620
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,974
I know how to fly, ever since I was a child.

621
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,852
They taught Dumbo to fly, no?

622
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,729
So I don't need your expertise.

623
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,398
All right.

624
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,027
Well, just so you know, I've been to France.

625
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,987
It wasn't a good experience.

626
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,864
Show me your secret!

627
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,908
How on earth does your elephant fly?

628
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:58,368
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

629
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,205
He won't fly without a feather.

630
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:05,417
Well then, neither will I.

631
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:34,947
Whoa, slow down, princess. Safety first.

632
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:36,073
Guys, nets.

633
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,491
Come on, hurry.

634
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,412
All right, guys, good.

635
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,965
See, Dumbo?

636
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:56,218
I fly!

637
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,270
See if you can catch me!

638
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,566
Here, Dumbo!

639
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,295
We got some work to do.

640
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,972
Friends and colleagues...

641
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:26,892
let's give a warm Dreamland welcome
to our new executive vice president...

642
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,060
Mr. Max Medici.

643
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,856
Anything he needs, anything at all...

644
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,983
make it happen as you always do.

645
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,198
This is Miss Verna.

646
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:45,160
She will handle your schedule,
correspondence, and all your calls.

647
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:48,038
When you're needed in meetings,
she'll let you know.

648
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:49,790
Are there meetings today?

649
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,583
I'll let you know!

650
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:55,754
Mr. Vandevere, one question.

651
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,131
Exactly what do I do?

652
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:04,513
So where'd Vandevere find you?

653
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,225
I was a street performer in Paris.

654
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:11,103
He discovered me.

655
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,980
And here I am.

656
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:16,859
A millionaire's girlfriend.

657
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:18,318
That's a tough break.

658
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,196
It's all for show.

659
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,408
So you and he, you're not...

660
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:27,870
I'm one of many gems he wears
to reflect the light back onto him.

661
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,875
Good boy, Dumbo.

662
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,294
-Good job.
-Yeah! They're gonna love him.

663
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,171
I think you are the lucky one.

664
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,091
-Well done, Dumbo.
-Good boy.

665
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:44,553
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

666
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,307
So, how's everything?

667
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:50,309
-Good?
-We're making progress.

668
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,894
But he ain't quite ready yet.

669
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,605
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

670
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:57,149
-It's not that simple.
-Ma chérie...

671
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,694
we've already sold all the tickets.

672
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:04,489
Maybe our little scientist here
can show us that it's going to work.

673
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:18,629
Prepare for takeoff.

674
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:20,047
-Right wing?
-Check!

675
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,050
Left wing?

676
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,343
Check!

677
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:26,637
Take her up, Dumbo.

678
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,476
Let's go.

679
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,436
-Come on, buddy. Come on.
-Come on, Dumbo.

680
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:38,190
That's it.
Come on.

681
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,323
Let's try it again.

682
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,535
You got this.
Here you go.

683
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,552
You beautiful one-armed cowboy.

684
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:10,138
You've made me a child again.

685
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:24,778
Welcome to the Colosseum...

686
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:27,447
where the impossible is possible.

687
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,452
Buonasera. Max Medici.

688
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,580
I discovered the elephant, my elephant.

689
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:19,541
And basically I said no.
I walked out and that was the end of that.

690
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,126
The flying elephant's mine.

691
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:22,127
Yeah.

692
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,005
You're the guy!

693
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,257
You're the guy that's made out of magic dust!

694
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:29,092
Max.

695
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:31,595
J. Griffin Remington. Atlas Forge Bank.

696
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:33,847
He's the money man.

697
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,015
The J?

698
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,101
It's a pleasure to meet you.

699
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,269
How are you?

700
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:41,271
You know, they say
the moon is made out of magic dust.

701
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:44,233
That's why they're going to send
a man up there one of these days.

702
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:48,529
And my bank is going to be the bank
that finances the expedition.

703
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,364
What do you think of that?

704
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,033
Needless to say, Max...

705
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,868
we all have high hopes for tonight.

706
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:57,704
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

707
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:01,124
Well, you know, hopes, and dreams,
that's one thing. That's words.

708
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,335
But what we're talking about here is facts!

709
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:04,586
Plans!

710
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,005
Plans! That takes a lot of money.

711
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:08,549
Which he hasn't got!

712
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:12,135
So, we are hoping that your pachyderm
comes through with the goods.

713
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,097
Now let's get this show on the road!

714
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,397
We are looking good!

715
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:25,899
Don't worry, Big D.

716
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,277
There's just more room to fly out there,
that's all.

717
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,195
Round and round, just like we practiced.

718
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:33,156
And then Dad can talk to Vandevere
about the deal!

719
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,491
About the what?

720
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,742
We made a deal with Dumbo.

721
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,745
We promised we'd buy his mom back
with all the money he makes for the circus.

722
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,122
That's why he flies.

723
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,000
-Joe, not now!
-Are we ready?

724
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,085
Yeah.

725
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,510
Okay, let's go.

726
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,679
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

727
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,615
Pink elephants?

728
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,033
So?

729
01:01:57,134 --> 01:02:01,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!

730
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:06,059
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!

731
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,480
V.A. Vandevere,
in association with Max Medici...

732
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:15,068
proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...

733
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,446
You've seen a horse-fly.

734
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,032
You've seen a dragonfly.

735
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:22,701
You've even seen a housefly.

736
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,204
But you haven't seen anything...

737
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:29,082
until you see an elephant fly.

738
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:32,169
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

739
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:50,979
Coming through.

740
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:53,524
Come on.

741
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,544
He can do it.

742
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:17,339
I know he can.

743
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:24,263
And here to welcome him...

744
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:29,184
our own Queen of the Heavens!

745
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:21,778
Dumbo.

746
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:26,450
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

747
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:28,994
Nice and easy, like we practiced.

748
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:36,752
Dad?

749
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:38,462
Why aren't they putting up the nets?

750
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,008
Hey, guys?

751
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:45,260
Guys, what's going on?
Your men are supposed to be out there!

752
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:46,595
Change of plan. From the top.

753
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,441
I can't see the nets.

754
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:02,027
They're invisible.

755
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,906
What's wrong with you? They need nets!

756
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:08,951
Colette!

757
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,702
Wait, don't take off!

758
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:13,497
Dumbo...

759
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:14,623
Oh, boy!

760
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,375
...Prince of the Elephants.

761
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,129
I command you to fly with me.

762
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,287
Colette!

763
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:10,804
Lower the platform!

764
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,158
Fly, little one!

765
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,346
Magic dust!

766
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:21,458
Where's my show?

767
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,358
The elephant's headed to Nightmare Island.

768
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,922
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

769
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:46,877
Dumbo, it's okay.

770
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:48,170
We're here.

771
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,089
Good evening.

772
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,090
It's Mr. Vandevere.

773
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:53,509
-Hello, hi.
-Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

774
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:54,926
Everyone having fun?

775
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:56,636
Good.

776
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:57,888
-Having a good time?
-Yes, sir.

777
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,182
Fantastic.

778
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,184
Get him outta here.

779
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,185
-Yes.
-Over here!

780
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:05,604
-Folks, please.
-Hello.

781
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,439
Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit.

782
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,566
Come on.

783
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,069
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

784
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:15,572
Soldier, I give the orders here.

785
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,790
It's his bedtime.

786
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,919
This attraction is now closed.

787
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,261
Dad?

788
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:41,473
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

789
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,357
-Come on, I want to see Dumbo!
-I want to see Dumbo!

790
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:51,733
I want my money back!

791
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,151
I don't understand.

792
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:54,945
The elephant flies. You saw it.

793
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:57,072
I saw a vanishing act.

794
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:00,492
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

795
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:02,870
You can't control your animal.

796
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:05,289
You give me a little time, I can fix this.

797
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:08,625
Whatever! Till then, the bank is closed.

798
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:15,382
What happened up there?
You lost control of the animal.

799
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:16,550
You're the animal.

800
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:17,885
Where was my net?

801
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,304
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

802
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:25,309
Training?
You call that training?

803
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:28,020
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

804
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:29,938
He recognized that other elephant's call.

805
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,024
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

806
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,317
It's true. It's her.

807
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:35,110
She was sold from our circus two months ago.

808
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:36,528
Every child knows its mother.

809
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:39,281
And they say elephants never forget.

810
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:40,866
They can be together now.

811
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:43,076
Why are there children in my office?

812
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:47,039
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

813
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:49,833
Just reunite them,
and he'll do whatever you want.

814
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,628
No, he'll do whatever she wants.

815
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:56,757
You think I'd have bought her if I thought
she was related to him?

816
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,676
Doesn't help me at all.

817
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:07,142
You wanna know the most important thing
about growing up?

818
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:13,023
You've got to learn to go it alone.

819
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:18,445
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

820
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:20,030
And treat yourself to some new boots.

821
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:22,366
But, sir, you can't just kill her.

822
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,992
Why not?

823
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,327
Mr. Vandevere.

824
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:27,663
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

825
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:29,706
Don't do that to my kids.

826
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:33,669
You know, Holt, when my father left us,
it was a blessing really.

827
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,713
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

828
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,841
Maybe that's what your children need.

829
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:40,425
Don't tell me what my children need.

830
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:42,344
Best take a step back, Elephant Man.

831
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,014
Darling...

832
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:50,269
Dumbo and his mom need a little alone time.

833
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,604
So, Mommy's going to take a little trip...

834
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:54,940
so that Dumbo won't be distracted.

835
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:58,443
Milly!

836
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,195
Milly!

837
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,251
Colette?

838
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:17,337
I have rehearsal.

839
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:19,923
Max.

840
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:26,471
Nightmare Island.

841
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:27,639
Milly?

842
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:30,142
Home of the most dangerous beasts
in the world.

843
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:31,894
Sir, park's closing.

844
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,235
Milly!

845
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,240
Milly!

846
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,164
Did you find her?

847
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:53,916
No.

848
01:12:56,919 --> 01:13:00,839
Well, her momma always knew what to say.
No matter what.

849
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:02,257
She always knew.

850
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:06,136
Your children don't need you to be perfect.

851
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:08,931
They just need you to believe in them.

852
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,100
That simple, huh?

853
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,735
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

854
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:45,342
That's my daughter all right.

855
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:48,470
The only girl I know
who runs away to go to school.

856
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,306
It's our fault.

857
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:53,767
Bet Dumbo wishes he never met us.

858
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,353
You showed him he could fly.

859
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,438
You think he'd ever trade that?

860
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:01,358
He would to have his mom back.

861
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,282
I miss Momma.

862
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:11,827
Yeah, so do I.

863
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:17,583
There's something I want to show you.

864
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,712
With advances in both
engineering and medicine...

865
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:24,381
the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...

866
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:27,718
to assist ordinary families, workers
and veterans.

867
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:32,890
All kinds of technological marvels
await us in the 20th century.

868
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,726
You're gonna do great things.

869
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:37,978
I know it.

870
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,157
What's this?

871
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,491
Give me a break.

872
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:54,745
I gotta teach you how to read English, too?

873
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,710
Oh, Max, hello!

874
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,796
Good, you brought the paperwork.

875
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,006
Max...

876
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,259
I was reviewing your troupe...

877
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,761
and to be honest with you...

878
01:15:10,928 --> 01:15:14,139
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

879
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:17,559
So I was thinking, I don't know,
a month's severance? Seems fair.

880
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,144
Capisce?

881
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,356
I thought you promised to...

882
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,275
Max, the contract says that I'd hire them.

883
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:27,277
It never stipulated for how long.

884
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:30,447
So, get your little band of low-rent freaks
out of here.

885
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:33,909
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

886
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:36,411
Okay, let's have a heart.

887
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:38,413
Why don't you tell them?

888
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:53,387
‘Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

889
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:05,899
What's going on, guys?

890
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:07,943
Vandevere's fired them all.

891
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,195
They're to leave by tomorrow.

892
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,210
Goodbye, little friend.

893
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:27,421
Goodbye.

894
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,426
We wanted to see him one last time.

895
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:34,970
One last time to see him fly.

896
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:37,890
I don't think he wants to anymore.

897
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,350
Oh, no. But he must.

898
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,103
He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again!

899
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,148
I'm afraid it's rather worse than that.

900
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:47,733
Mr. Sotheby?

901
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,277
I've come to clear my conscience.

902
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:53,864
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

903
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,449
What order?

904
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:59,328
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone by tomorrow night.

905
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,330
And she's not meant to survive.

906
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,139
This "Dreamland" doesn't deserve him.

907
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,558
No circus does.

908
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:37,824
Well, who's gonna be willing to help me?

909
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,496
Set Dumbo and his momma free.

910
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:15,696
Welcome to the Colosseum,
where the impossible is possible.

911
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:20,617
Okay. Second time's the charm.

912
01:18:20,784 --> 01:18:24,121
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

913
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:26,164
Here to pick up the elephant
from Nightmare Island?

914
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,249
Confirmed.

915
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,042
Unlock the back gates.

916
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,609
Dumbo in position!

917
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,863
Soon as he flies, you run back to his tent
and I'll find you there.

918
01:18:58,155 --> 01:18:59,364
All right, Big D.

919
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:03,035
It's all up to you now.

920
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:05,829
Come on, Holt!

921
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:17,382
To hell with it.

922
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,889
Ready for positions.

923
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:26,225
We could have used a little rehearsal.

924
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:27,726
Rehearsal?

925
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:30,395
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

926
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,190
You sure you can do this?

927
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,067
I fly elephants all the time.

928
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:37,945
Are you sure you can do this?

929
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,739
With one hand tied behind my back.

930
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,963
Wait. What's that?

931
01:19:57,422 --> 01:19:58,549
Ma'am?

932
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:01,260
Ma'am?

933
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:04,096
Sorry, ma'am, attraction's closed.

934
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:07,391
My dream... to be a mermaid...

935
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,810
and now they've taken it away.

936
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:12,354
And yet I hear the water singing.

937
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,856
I hear them beckoning me home.

938
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:15,983
Lady, just be careful, okay?

939
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,360
-Return me to the vast abyss!
-Let's go.

940
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,904
-My destiny, the sea!
-Okay.

941
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:11,496
We've lost power!

942
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:12,998
Even the cages?

943
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:14,625
But the animals...

944
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:18,128
Find the breakers. Get the lights back on!

945
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:20,589
And make sure those cages are locked.

946
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,361
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

947
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:45,864
Making his second Dreamland debut.

948
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,909
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

949
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:49,887
Hey!

950
01:22:58,187 --> 01:23:00,105
It's a trick! Get back to the...

951
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:20,375
And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!

952
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:42,940
You.

953
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:45,275
Where is your circus of freaks?

954
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:48,987
What's going on?

955
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,281
The elephant's mother is gone!

956
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:53,784
His troupe's behind it!

957
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:56,245
Alert the tower and secure the gates.

958
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:58,747
Don't let them get out.

959
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,084
But why would they only take the one?

960
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,380
Keep your eye on Farrier and those kids.

961
01:24:06,547 --> 01:24:08,131
You! Come with us.

962
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:23,730
There they are!

963
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:26,859
Hey!

964
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,203
Hey, you!

965
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,663
What are you doing up there?

966
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,623
That's private property.

967
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,292
Come on! Get down here!

968
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:44,543
Now!

969
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:47,963
Hey, I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner.

970
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:51,800
He's just a maintenance man fixing a light!
Get back to your posts!

971
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:53,760
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

972
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:10,527
Let's try this again.

973
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:12,112
You and me.

974
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:28,837
Hey, the kids?

975
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:30,005
Where are the kids?

976
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,256
Hey, have you seen the kids?

977
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:35,427
Dumbo, Prince of the Elephants!

978
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:38,639
I command you to fly with me.

979
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:56,198
Dumbo, please fly.

980
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,784
Do it for your momma.

981
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:55,048
Where's your father?

982
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:10,105
Dumbo!

983
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:24,328
Hey! Get those kids!

984
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:28,749
Dumbo!

985
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:02,866
Come on.

986
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:05,285
There!

987
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:27,558
Just passing through!

988
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:30,519
Hey! You can't do that!

989
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:34,898
Get the elephant!

990
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,191
You get the elephant!

991
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:01,300
Don't worry. Dad'll be here soon.

992
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:02,885
Where's the elephant?

993
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:11,810
Why are you just standing there?
Get to the tower!

994
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:14,313
Electricity's failing! There's no elevators!

995
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:17,065
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

996
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:21,778
We seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.

997
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:38,795
What happened to my power?

998
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:41,465
What power, mon chéri?

999
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,133
You ungrateful...

1000
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,553
You were nothing before I made you my...

1001
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,681
I believe the word is "queen."

1002
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:53,268
I need lights!

1003
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,147
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1004
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:59,566
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1005
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:00,943
Right now it's impossible!

1006
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:03,111
Nothing's impossible!

1007
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,281
Mr. Vandevere!

1008
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,164
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1009
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:41,525
Milly! Joe!

1010
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,286
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1011
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,105
Get everyone out!

1012
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:22,274
Evacuate the park!

1013
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:27,988
Milly! Joe!

1014
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:42,336
Hey!

1015
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:50,135
Where is the elephant?

1016
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:51,553
Let her go!

1017
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:10,072
Come on!

1018
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,365
Milly! Joe!

1019
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:12,783
Dad!

1020
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,493
-You all right? All right?
-We're fine.

1021
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,036
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1022
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:18,247
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1023
01:32:18,413 --> 01:32:19,081
Back!

1024
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:22,668
Stay close.

1025
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:33,095
Come on, everybody.

1026
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:35,389
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1027
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:38,058
-Where are the Farriers?
-They must still be inside.

1028
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:11,717
Dad!

1029
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:13,844
It's okay, Joe.

1030
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:16,680
Come here. Come here.

1031
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:20,559
Dumbo!

1032
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:29,610
Dumbo!

1033
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:30,861
Come on!

1034
01:33:31,612 --> 01:33:33,906
-Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Jump!

1035
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:35,866
Come on. Come on.

1036
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:45,459
-All right, let's go.
-Stay close, come on.

1037
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:49,630
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1038
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:51,215
Come on!

1039
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,300
-Dumbo!
-Come on!

1040
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:55,511
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1041
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,554
Guys! Milly! Joe! Come on!

1042
01:33:57,721 --> 01:33:58,889
Dumbo, let's go!

1043
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,061
Go!

1044
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:10,651
Dumbo!

1045
01:34:10,817 --> 01:34:12,528
Get him!

1046
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:14,821
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1047
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:16,365
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1048
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:17,616
He lost the feather.

1049
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:20,536
Feather doesn't do nothin'.
Dumbo, you don't need the feather to fly.

1050
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:22,621
Dad, they're coming!

1051
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:24,831
Stand back! Stand back!

1052
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:25,999
Out of my way!

1053
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,128
Dumbo, remember this?

1054
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:32,256
From my momma?

1055
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:36,134
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1056
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:38,679
But I don't need this key to do it.

1057
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,138
And you don't need the feather.

1058
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,474
Come on.

1059
01:34:57,865 --> 01:34:58,782
Dad!

1060
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:00,033
Gotta go. Come on!

1061
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:04,204
-What are you doing?
-There ain't room for the three of us.

1062
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,081
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1063
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:07,749
Go on, Big D.

1064
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:15,257
Grab 'em!

1065
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:16,425
Hey!

1066
01:35:23,182 --> 01:35:24,600
Hey!

1067
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:28,228
That's my elephant!

1068
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:43,410
They're safe.

1069
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:45,162
Come on, let's go!

1070
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:49,499
Hey! Get back here!

1071
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:54,505
You freak!
What have you done?

1072
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:56,215
What they pay me for, mister.

1073
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:57,841
Put on a hell of a show.

1074
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:02,638
Hey! Him!

1075
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,848
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1076
01:36:05,015 --> 01:36:06,767
Hey, we had a contract, Medici!

1077
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:10,437
I'm no expert,
but I think you got bigger problems here.

1078
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:24,451
Wow. This is a disaster.

1079
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:26,954
Come on, I'll buy you a hot dog.

1080
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,081
Sounds good, J.G.

1081
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:11,039
Last call for cargo!

1082
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:12,791
All aboard!

1083
01:37:34,938 --> 01:37:36,398
Colette!
