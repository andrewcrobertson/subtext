'We were not
the Railway Children to begin with.

00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,599
'I don't suppose we even thought about railways

3
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:46,599
'except as a means of getting
to the theatre and the zoo.

4
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,224
'We were just ordinary suburban children

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,849
'and we lived with Father and Mother

00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,558
'in an ordinary red brick fronted villa

'with coloured glass in the front door...'

8
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,933
Come on.

9
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,766
'...a tiled passage that was called a hall

10
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,308
'and big fires in big fireplaces.

11
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:08,183
'We even had a gas fire
in the breakfast room

12
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,933
'and a servant's bell board.

13
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:16,891
'In fact, every modern convenience.'

14
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,766
Chins up!

15
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,433
'There we three of us.'

16
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,224
Now let's arrange your pretty hair.

17
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,974
'That's me, I'm Roberta.

18
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,891
'They call me Bobbie,
sometimes Lanky.

00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:33,433
'I'm the eldest, worst luck.

00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:37,766
'That's Phyllis, who means well.

21
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:43,141
'And that's Peter,
who wants to be an engineer.'

22
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,808
And don't forget to watch the dickey bird.

23
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,391
Watch the birdie.

24
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,641
Oh...

25
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:07,724
'Mother did not spend all her time
paying dull calls to dull ladies

26
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,016
'and sitting dully at home waiting
for dull ladies to pay calls on her.

00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,308
'She was always there, with us.'

28
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,724
'We had a father who was just perfect.

29
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,099
Her light's growing dim
and if it goes out, then she's dead.

30
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,099
She says she would be get well again
if children believed in fairies.

31
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,058
- Do you believe in fairies?
- Yes.

32
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:40,099
That's not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

33
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,599
Yes!

34
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,391
It's still not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?

35
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,933
YES!

36
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,599
Yes, I certainly do!

37
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,433
Mmm, it smells gorgeous.

38
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,558
It's fabulous, absolutely fabulous.

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,599
Now altogether... one, two, three.

40
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:12,766
Well done!

41
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,308
Happy Christmas!

42
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,308
I love you.

43
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:25,933
'You will think that we ought
to have been very happy

44
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,974
'and we were but we did not know how happy

45
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,433
'till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa
was over and done with

46
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,974
'and we had to live
a very different life indeed.'

47
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,391
Peter my boy, come here.

48
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,933
Dad... it's perfect.

49
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:56,016
It's more perfect
than any one could ever dream of.

50
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,433
Thank you, Dad.

51
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:04,974
'The dreadful change
came quite suddenly.'

52
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,558
You heaving brute!

53
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,974
'And that was the last we saw of poor Potts.'

54
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,433
What a wreck!

55
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,183
- Is there any hope?
- Hope?

56
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,183
Of course, it'll want hope yes,
and a new valve.

57
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,766
I'll tell you what, I'll give up
Saturday afternoon to it.

58
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,391
Yes, and you can help me.

59
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,933
I hate doing a job like this
especially at Christmas.

60
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,599
Who on earth is that?

61
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:51,683
An Englishman's house is his castle, but
I wish they had moats and drawbridges!

62
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,558
Come in.

63
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,183
Yes?

64
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,933
Please, sir.
There are two gentlemen wish to see you.

65
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,724
I've shown them into the study, sir,
I hope that was all right?

66
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,099
Excuse me.

67
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:24,849
I wish we did have
a moat and drawbridge.

68
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,599
Then if we didn't want anyone to...

69
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:30,266
I've never heard anything
so preposterous. When? Who?

70
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,516
- Why's Daddy shouting?
- I don't know, dear.

71
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:34,058
Come in.

72
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,016
Yes, Ruth?

73
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:41,184
What is it?

74
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:45,974
Please, ma'am, the Master wants you
to just step into the study.

75
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:07,599
Look, I'm not going to say a thing!

76
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,266
Come in.

77
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,974
I will not!

78
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,558
All right, cabby,
Scotland Yard.

79
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,141
It's bed-time.

80
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,224
Ruth will put you to bed.

81
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,099
But you promised we could stay up late.
Daddy was going to play with us.

82
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:07,724
Father's been
called away... on business.

83
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,391
Go up at once darlings, please.

84
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,599
It wasn't bad news, was it, Mummy?

85
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,433
Is anyone dead or...

86
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,183
Oh, no, nobody's dead.

87
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,016
I can't tell you anything about it tonight.
Up you go.

88
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:55,391
96... 97... 98... 99... 100.

89
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:07,558
Well, good night then.

90
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:15,891
Ruth!

91
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:17,516
What's up?

92
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:20,433
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

93
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,058
You'll know soon enough.

94
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,224
- Phyl?
- Yes.

95
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,849
If Mother doesn't want us to know
she's been crying then we won't know.

96
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:04,016
- That's all.
- All right.

97
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:15,683
She's gone into London,
that's all I know.

98
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,433
Now just you eat up.

99
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,099
Some dire calamity's happening,
I just know it.

100
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:46,099
Good evening, Mrs. Waterbury.

101
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,849
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Sally.

102
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:02,516
Oh, it's so cold!
Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.

103
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:06,558
My darlings, those men last night
did bring very bad news

104
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,349
and Father will be away
for some time

105
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,724
Is it something to do
with the Government, Mummy?

106
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,099
Yes... yes, it is.

107
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,516
Now it's bed time, my darlings.

108
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:25,308
And don't worry.
It will all come right in the end.

109
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:29,599
Don't you worry either
because we'll be as good as gold.

110
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:41,641
Oh, we used to say life was so dull...
Nothing ever happened like in books.

111
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,266
Now something has happened.

112
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:47,724
Yes, it has and it's made Mother unhappy.

113
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,724
Everything's horrid...

114
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,391
...just horrid.

115
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,391
Stairs... stairs... stairs...

116
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:59,933
'Everything continued to be
perfectly horrid for some weeks.

117
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,599
'Mother was nearly always out,

118
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:05,016
'the between maid was sent away...

119
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,099
'...and Aunt Emma came on a visit.

120
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,974
- Good afternoon, children.
- Good afternoon, Aunt Emma.

121
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,099
Your mother has sent for me
in her distress,

122
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,058
and I'm here for a while
but not for long.

123
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,433
I'm off to India as a governess

124
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,183
and as I shall be busy preparing
for my arduous journey,

125
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:51,433
I shall require you to be seen
and not heard.

126
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,766
Preferably to be not seen
and not heard.

127
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:57,266
Children should be kept
in their proper places.

128
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:59,808
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Aunt Emma.

129
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:03,308
- Yes, Aunt Emma.
- Excellent.

130
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,391
You may kiss me if you wish.

131
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,016
Altogether now

132
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,974
I have asked you not to use them utensils
in that manner.

133
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,099
I was up at four this morning cleaning them

134
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:34,933
as if I haven't got enough to do
what with the between maid leaving

135
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,433
and now your aunt asking me
to heave bloomin' great boxes about

136
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,974
like I was a navvy or something.

137
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,224
- Ruth.
- Yes?

138
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,558
There's no need to be so rude.
Cook was just trying to cheer us up.

139
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,766
Come on, you two.

140
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,141
Well...

141
00:15:56,725 --> 00:16:00,641
I'm very surprised at you, Cook.
Where's your dignity?

142
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,349
And take that silly hat off.

143
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,099
Get yourself dressed properly.

144
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,308
I don't know I seem to do
all the work round here.

145
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,599
We shouldn't really Peter,
she'll get soaked.

146
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,724
It's too late, she's coming.

147
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,724
Stairs... stairs... stairs...

148
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,891
I'll have fallen arches before me holiday.

149
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:21,141
I hope you're undressed and ready,
master Peter.

150
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,724
I haven't got all night, you know.

151
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,391
- Yes, Ruth.
- Good...

152
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,891
Oh!

153
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,391
Oh... ugh!

154
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,349
You...!

155
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,099
- Oh! Stop it!
- You nasty little limb, you!

156
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:03,766
If you don't mend your ways

157
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:08,391
you'll go where your precious
father's gone, so I tell you straight.

158
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,849
Ruth!

159
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,433
Huh!

160
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,433
We're going to have to play
at being poor for a while.

161
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,224
We're moving to a darling little house
in the country, up in Yorkshire.

162
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,099
- What?
- I know you'll love it

163
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:52,224
- Is Aunt Emma coming?
- No, Peter, unfortunately not.

164
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,224
- Don't you want a 1st Class, madam?
- No, Second. Thank you.

165
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,224
Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me.

166
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,474
- Are we on the right train for Yorkshire?
- Yes.

167
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,641
Thank you.

168
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,808
Ooh... careful.
Give that to me.

169
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:59,516
- I'll take that bag.
- Thank you so much.

170
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,224
- Goodbye.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

171
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,808
Excuse me.

172
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,016
We want to go to the house on the hill.
The Three Chimneys.

173
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:12,391
- Er, do you know the way?
- I daresay.

174
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:16,683
- Well, will you show us?
- I daresay.

175
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,558
Ay... oop!

176
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,849
Ow!

177
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:28,599
- Phyllis, are you all right?
- Yes.

178
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,849
Can't we put just one box
on your cart?

179
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:35,516
You asked me to show you the way,
nothing was said about boxes.

180
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,933
Never mind, darlings.
It's only a few more yards.

181
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,141
Whoa!

182
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,516
I wonder why she didn't leave
the lights on.

183
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,016
Who is she?

184
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:59,474
Mrs. Viney, The woman I engaged
to clean the place and to get the supper.

185
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,974
I expect Mrs. Viney's gone home.

186
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,641
Your train was late, see.

187
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,183
But she's got the key.
What do we do?

188
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,724
She'll have left that under the doorstep.

189
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,016
- We all do hereabouts.
- Well you might have said so.

190
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,641
You never asked, did you?

191
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,974
Nothing was said about a door key.

192
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,974
- May I borrow your lamp, please?
- I daresay.

193
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:28,016
If you say "I daresay" once more,
I shall have hysterics, I daresay

194
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,724
Oh... there we are.

195
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:49,766
What's that?

196
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:56,183
It's only the rats.

197
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:14,558
God works in mysterious ways
his wonders to perform.

198
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:25,266
- Ow!
- Rats!

199
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:29,349
- I wish we hadn't come.
- Don't you worry, darlings.

200
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:34,516
I saw a paraffin lamp on the table,
we'll soon have some light.

201
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:38,599
Oh, those poor little mice,
they were so frightened.

202
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,849
I don't believe they were rats at all.

203
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,433
You've often said you wanted
something to happen, well now it has.

204
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,933
It's quite exciting, isn't it?

205
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,391
I told Mrs. Viney to get
some meat and bread

206
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:54,974
and have some supper ready.
I wonder where...

207
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,183
Oh, I suppose she's laid it
in the dining room.

208
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,224
Come along darlings, up here.
Let's go and see.

209
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,849
Come along.

210
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,891
Oh darlings, mind the steps.
Mind how you go, Peter.

211
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:16,099
Oh!

212
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:24,058
Oh, that beastly woman!

213
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:26,266
She's taken the money
and not left us any food.

214
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:29,641
Aren't we going to have
any supper tonight? I'm starving!

215
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,183
I know! There's some food
in the cases in the cellar.

216
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,349
Aunt Emma sent them on
ahead of us. Come along.

217
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,724
Mind the step.

218
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,599
Come along, Bobbie,
it's a real feast.

219
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,849
Sardines, biscuits, ginger.

220
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:51,474
Raisins...

221
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,933
No Phyl, no! You do not put
the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.

222
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,849
Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.

223
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,599
Tell you what,
let's drink Aunt Emma's health.

224
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,433
- Good idea.
- Here's to Aunt Emma.

225
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,433
- To Aunt Emma.
- Aunt Emma.

226
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,849
And all who sail in her.

227
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,266
- Oh! What's that, Mummy?
- Pie.

228
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:20,183
- Pie?
- Apple Pie.

229
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:23,058
Apple pie for breakfast?
Then we're not poor after all.

230
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,933
This is the supper we should have had.

231
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,766
I found it in that little room
that we thought was a cupboard,

232
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:31,058
so Mrs. Viney wasn't so bad after all.

233
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,391
- Good morning, can I help you?
- I expect so. Viney's the name.

234
00:23:44,517 --> 00:23:46,849
Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.

235
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:50,224
Do come in.
We're just been talking about you.

236
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,058
Oh, I see you found your supper then.
Funny time to have it though.

237
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,641
It was like a great dragon tearing by.

238
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:42,849
A dragon's house looks like that tunnel.

239
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:45,224
I never thought we'd ever get so near
to a train as this.

240
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,641
- It's better than toy engines, isn't it?
- I don't know, it's different.

241
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:52,266
It seems so odd to see all of a train.
It's so tall.

242
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:54,849
I've always seen them cut
in half by platforms

243
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:58,058
I wonder if that train's going to London?
London is where Daddy is.

244
00:24:58,184 --> 00:25:00,599
- We don't know that, Phyl.
- He might be.

245
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,224
Oh! Ahem.

246
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,224
- How do you do?
- Eh?

247
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,391
- How do you do?
- Yes.

248
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:23,278
- Could I ask you two questions?
- Yes, well it depends what they are.

249
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:25,785
I can't spend all day conversationalising
with the junior public.

250
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,266
Now what are they?

251
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:29,641
What's the white mark
on the coal heap for?

252
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,576
That's to tell you how much coal there is
you see, in case anybody nicks it.

253
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,641
Second question, please.

254
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,683
Do you know anything
about engines?

255
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,641
Do I know anything about engines?
Why?

256
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,349
- Because I've got one.
- Er, what gauge?

257
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:44,058
I don't know anything about gauges,
but it's about this big.

258
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:45,224
Yes?

259
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,891
- It's brass and it blew up.
- It blew up.

260
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,099
Well just excuse me young man,
I've got a lot to do

261
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,683
cos the Station Master's
having his hair cut in Leeds, you see

262
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,224
and Perks must be about it.

263
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,599
- Perks? Who's Perks?
- Me, sir. I'm Perks.

264
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,141
Right on time.

265
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:22,224
- What is?
- This ere's the Scots Flyer.

266
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:37,099
Why is it going so slowly,
Mr. Perks?

267
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:43,349
Why... well it's all up hill
to Scotland, isn't it?

268
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:48,058
That train's going to Scotland.

269
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:50,224
If Daddy's not in London,
he's in Scotland

270
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,849
and that train is going to Scotland.

271
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,016
Perhaps, Phyl.

272
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,016
I don't think we're going to enjoy
being poor, you know,

273
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,558
being cold and all that.

274
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:11,641
Phyllis, try to imagine it
as an adventure.

275
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,974
All sorts of things might happen.

276
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,099
Mother could write about it.

277
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:20,724
Write a book.
You never know.

278
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,224
We won't always be poor, Phyllis,
I'm sure.

279
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,724
All right.
Good night.

280
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,349
Good night.

281
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:35,558
I'm still cold though.

282
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:38,516
...lightly on the-cheek.

283
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,766
...one of the men, in a bowler hat,
opened the door...

284
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:49,516
Father did not turn,
but left without a word.

285
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:07,266
Why don't we ask the next train
to take our love to Daddy?

286
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:10,308
Trains don't carry people's love,
they'd be above that.

287
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:12,099
Yes, they do if you tame them first.

288
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:14,141
I wonder why Daddy
hasn't written to us.

289
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:17,141
Mummy says he's too busy.
he'll write soon, she says.

290
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,266
Well, why don't we wave anyway?
Three waves won't matter.

291
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,308
We won't miss them.

292
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,349
Charming...

293
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,433
Charming!

294
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,099
About time they had it seen to.

295
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,224
The coal in the little shed
has held out well, Bobbie.

296
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,891
There was hardly any there yesterday
when I looked.

297
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,474
Well, we've only had one fire.

298
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,224
I know but I could swear there's more
than when we first came.

299
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:24,558
- That's silly.
- Course it's silly.

300
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:27,933
So it's you, Pete.

301
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,016
- It's you.
- It's me what?

302
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,599
It's you that's been putting
the coal in the shed.

303
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,641
But where from Pete,
for heaven's sake?

304
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,516
From the coal heap of course,
they've got stacks of it there.

305
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:42,641
But that's stealing!
Don't you remember your catechism?

306
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,641
"Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"

307
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,099
It wasn't stealing.
It was mining.

308
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:49,933
I took from the top.
That's mining, not stealing.

309
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,219
If it was, all the miners in the world
would be in jug.

310
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:54,933
Oh, Pete... Pete!

311
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:57,308
Oh Pete, Pete.

312
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,224
We'll have to take it all back.

313
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,266
- What?
- All of it.

314
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:03,099
- All of it.
- All of it!

315
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,724
All of it.

316
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:09,183
There can't be anything wrong in trying
to keep your own mother warm.

317
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:10,891
That can't be wrong.

318
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,577
It's all right Pete,
at least we can burn the evidence.

319
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,391
Mrs. Viney, here we are.
I've got the buns for tea.

320
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:29,516
- Buns?
- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...

321
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:31,266
Mrs. Viney, what's the matter?

322
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:35,183
It's your dear ma, master Peter,
she's... she's very poorly.

323
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:37,683
You'd better go back to the village
and get Dr. Forrest.

324
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,724
Right.

325
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,808
Don't let her die, Mrs. Viney.

326
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,766
Doctor Forrest!

327
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,433
Ahem!

328
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,849
Mother's very ill,
please come quickly,

329
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,891
Stay there, my boy.

330
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,141
Influenza.

331
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,724
But not serious.

332
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:46,474
Now my Lady Grave-airs,
I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?

333
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,391
- Of course, Doctor.
- Right.

334
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:51,099
Now we'll send down some medicine.
Keep a good fire going

335
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,099
and have some strong beef tea
ready to give her

336
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,224
the moment the fever goes down...

337
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,433
She can have the grapes now
and the soda water.

338
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,891
Oh, and you'd better get
a bottle of brandy.

339
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:02,099
You can go in now...

340
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:05,099
May I have the list?

341
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,641
Don't worry, funny face.

342
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,974
She's head nurse
but you can be Matron.

343
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,891
Oh, thank you.

344
00:34:16,017 --> 00:34:19,558
Oh, what utter nonsense,
I can't afford all that.

345
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:23,516
I haven't an idea in my head for a story

346
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:27,308
so there won't even be buns
for tea for some time.

347
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:32,724
Tell Mrs. Viney to boil some scrag-end
of neck for your dinner tomorrow

348
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,099
then I'll have some of the broth.

349
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,974
But even if we never have
anything to eat at all

350
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,224
you can't afford all those other things.

351
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,683
Right. So we've got to think
of some other way.

352
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:48,266
Now everybody, think.

353
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:50,349
Just as hard as ever you can,

354
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:52,016
think!

355
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,224
- I, O, N.
- You sure?

356
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,849
Yes.

357
00:34:58,225 --> 00:34:59,766
I...

358
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,058
O...

359
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:08,433
N.
There. Brilliant.

360
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,224
"Look out at the station."

361
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,016
Definitely one of your best works,
Michael Angelo.

362
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:48,974
Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

363
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,224
Oakworth!

364
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,099
Oakworth Station.

365
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,391
Oh, I thought I'd missed you.

366
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,308
You are the man who waves to us,
aren't you?

367
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:06,974
- Mind the doors, please.
- Aren't you?

368
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,381
- Yes my dear, I wave...
- Oh, will you take this, please.

369
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,618
We chose you because we thought
you had such a kind face.

370
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:14,641
Er, mind the doors please, Miss.
Sir. On the way, Mr. Mitchell.

371
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,308
Thank you, Mr. Perks.

372
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,433
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

373
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,599
Good evening.

374
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:38,099
Oh dear!
Oh! Good evening.

375
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,641
The name's Perks.
I believe we've met.

376
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,683
Yes, you were busy'cause of
the Station Master being in Leeds.

377
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:46,599
Yes, even busier now
'cause he had a drop too much

378
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:51,224
down at the Britannia Arms and fell over
and broke his daft leg playing billiards.

379
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,099
- Of course it was his own fault.
- Why?

380
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,849
He should've used the rest.

381
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,891
He will do that over the edge, you see.

382
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:59,391
The old gent asked me
to fetch this up straight away.

383
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:00,757
Thank you very much, Mr. Perks.

384
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,849
I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence
to give you like Father does, but...

385
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:08,516
Hey! Just stop that, please.
I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.

386
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:12,058
I just came to say I was sorry
to hear your mama wasn't so well

387
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,099
and to ask how she finds herself
this evening.

388
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,849
Oh and I've er, I brought her
a bit of sweet briar.

389
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,974
It's very sweet to smell that is.

390
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:22,849
Tuppence indeed.

391
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:25,599
Thank you very much and I beg
your pardon about the twopence.

392
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:27,349
No offences, I'm sure.
No offence.

393
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:29,974
And just to show I'll er,
I'll have a look

394
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,433
at that blown up brass engine
of yourn, shall I?

395
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,433
- What?
- Yes.

396
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,724
Oh, can you manage?
Bit heavy... Here you are.

397
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:43,391
Oh. Is that it?

398
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:50,558
Bit of a mess, isn't it?
Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.

399
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:52,724
- Good evening.
- Thank you, Mr. Perks. Good night.

400
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:07,141
- Oh!
- Oh, look at that!

401
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,558
Oh, everything...

402
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,974
"Dear Roberta, Phyllis and Peter,

403
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,224
"here are the things you want.

404
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,599
"Your mother will want to know
where they came from

405
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,391
"so please ask her to forgive me

406
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:24,724
"for taking the liberty
of allowing myself the great pleasure.

407
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,224
"Yours sincerely, G.P... Something."
I can't read it.

408
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,016
I think we were right to ask him.

409
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,683
Right?
Of course we're right.

410
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,891
I don't fancy telling Mother
the whole truth about this.

411
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:39,391
We shouldn't do that
until she's completely well.

412
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:42,016
And when she is, we'll be so happy
we shan't mind the fuss.

413
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:44,391
Oh, look at those roses!

414
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:47,016
I'll take them up to her.

415
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,641
- And the sweetbriar.
- Oh, thank you.

416
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,891
Cor, look!
I wonder what's in there.

417
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:19,016
So that's an end to it! Now listen.
It's true, we're poor,

418
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:22,974
but we shall have enough to live on
as long as I have ideas for stories.

419
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:28,433
But you mustn't go about telling people
of our affairs. It isn't right!

420
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,391
And you must never, never, never
ask strangers to give you things.

421
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,558
Always remember that.

422
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:36,660
- Yes, Mother.
- I shall write to your old gentleman

423
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,599
and I shall tell him
that I didn't approve.

424
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:40,933
I shall thank him too,
of course, for his kindness,

425
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:44,599
but it you that I don't approve of,
not the old gentleman.

426
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:47,266
He's been extremely kind.

427
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:51,516
You can give my letter to your Mr. Perks
to give to him.

428
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:56,308
And we won't say any more about it.

429
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:00,391
Isn't she marvellous
when she's angry?

430
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,516
Whoa!

431
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:22,724
Hello, head-nurse.

432
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:27,224
That's funny, I was thinking about you.
I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.

433
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,599
- Your mother's not worse I hope?
- No, but...

434
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:34,391
Come on, we'll go for a ride.

435
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,933
This is great fun.

436
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,724
Come on, out with it, head-nurse.
What's the trouble?

437
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:08,099
It's rather hard, you see, to'out with it'
because of what Mother said.

438
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,766
What did Mother say?

439
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:13,099
She said I wasn't to go telling everyone
that we're poor.

440
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:17,766
- But you aren't everyone, are you?
- Not at all. Well?

441
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:20,266
Well, I know doctors are very expensive

442
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:24,016
and Mrs. Viney told me that her doctor
only cost her twopence a week

443
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,099
- because she belonged to a club.
- Yes.

444
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,266
Well, could we join your club too, please?

445
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:31,516
The same as Mr. Viney.

446
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:33,266
You aren't cross with me, are you?

447
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:36,891
Cross? How could I be?
You're a very sensible little woman.

448
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:39,724
Now don't you worry.
I'll make it all right with your mother,

449
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,683
even if I have to make
a special brand-new club just for her.

450
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,391
Whoa!

451
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:48,349
Thank you.

452
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:58,266
Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up
in here.

453
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,016
Here's a new ribbon for you.

454
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:03,099
There, the surprise is ready.

455
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:05,576
When the bell rings again
you can come into the dining room.

456
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,183
Come on, Pete.

457
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,724
Of course.

458
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:53,849
Happy birthday.

459
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:29,391
Happy birthday, head-nurse.

460
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:41,766
Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.

461
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:51,224
My darling.

462
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:03,724
I helped to make it.

463
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,266
Happy birthday, Lanky.

464
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:29,724
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.

465
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:33,141
Lanky indeed!

466
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:35,849
Fatty.

467
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:39,016
- Hope you enjoy the cake.
- It's lovely. Thank you very much.

468
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:42,849
- Have a lovely party, my dear.
- Thank you for coming.

469
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,599
Thank you.

470
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:53,141
Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?

471
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,016
Thank you very much, Mrs. Waterbury.

472
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:08,766
Good night, good night.

473
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:13,349
Happy birthday!
Hey, happy birthday!

474
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,599
I hope Mother doesn't get too wet
in Wakefield.

475
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:12,599
We don't want her ill again.

476
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:14,266
It's like being in a besieged castle,

477
00:47:14,392 --> 00:47:18,433
the arrows of the foe striking
against the battlements.

478
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,599
No, it's more
like a great big garden-squirt.

479
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:23,974
- You're a great big garden squirt
- Thank you.

480
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,308
Stop it you two!
There's a train coming.

481
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:49,641
Oakworth! Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!

482
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,266
Oakworth Station!

483
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:53,599
Come on. Don't mind the rain,
it's only a shower.

484
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:54,766
That's it, thank you.

485
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:58,766
Mind the doors, please.
Mind the doors now.

486
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,933
Mind the doors, come on.

487
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:03,558
Right away, Mr. Mainprice

488
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,641
Mother should be on the next train
in about fifteen minutes.

489
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,183
That one was from London, I think.

490
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,641
Hey, there's something going
at the end of the station.

491
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,391
Yes, something's happened,
come on.

492
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,183
If you ask me this is a case
for the police courts.

493
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,391
No, the infirmary more like.

494
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:23,308
Let me pass please, will you?
I'll deal with this if you please.

495
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:29,308
- What's he say?
- Sounds like French to me.

496
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:31,141
I was in Calais once for a day.

497
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:35,433
- That's not French.
- Well what is it then if it's not French?

498
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:38,099
I don't know.
It's not French, I know that.

499
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,099
No, that's not French.
Nothing like it.

500
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:47,933
Try him with French if you know
so much then, clever dick.

501
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,433
Parlez vous français, Monsieur?

502
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,224
Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!
Enfin un amis.

503
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,933
Mon petit vous ne soures jamais
combien je suis content.

504
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,724
- Now that's French.
- What's he say?

505
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,933
I don't know...

506
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:04,599
Yes, well all right everybody.

507
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:07,486
Keep moving along, please.
I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.

508
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:10,891
All right now, now, now...
Go on.

509
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,076
Take him into the waiting room.
Mother can talk French.

510
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,451
She's on the next train
from Wakefield.

511
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:16,599
Right. Come on.

512
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:23,058
He thinks you're a policeman.
He thinks you're going to shut him up.

513
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:25,599
I know he does.
Look at his eyes.

514
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:29,016
They're like a fox's eyes
when the beast is in a trap.

515
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,891
Vous attendre.
Ma mere parlez français.

516
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,099
Nous...

517
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:42,266
- What's "being kind"?
- Er, "bon" is good.

518
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:45,558
Nous sommes bon
pour vous, Monsieur.

519
00:49:53,017 --> 00:49:57,391
Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at the
Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.

520
00:49:59,892 --> 00:50:03,016
C'est bon.
Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.

521
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:04,433
Je vous aide.

522
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,599
Look I'm not sure
we oughtn't to send for police.

523
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:08,599
- Don't!
- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.

524
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:10,845
She speaks French beautifully.
You'd love to hear her.

525
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:13,474
I'm sure he hasn't done anything
like you're sent to prison for.

526
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,099
Yes, well he looks
without visible means to me.

527
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:19,891
Still I don't mind waiting
till your mama comes.

528
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,933
I'd like to know what country
has got the credit of him.

529
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:25,433
Look, I've got an idea.
Foreign stamps.

530
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,016
We'll show them these.

531
00:50:27,142 --> 00:50:32,516
Regardes les stamps.
Quelle patrie?

532
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:35,516
Ah... Ruskie...

533
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,974
- Ruskie.
- My lord, he's Russian.

534
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,266
Yeah, I-I thought he was.

535
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,327
I'll wait here till you bring Mummy in.

536
00:50:50,392 --> 00:50:51,974
Not afraid?

537
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,516
No.

538
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,599
Oakworth Station!
Mrs. Waterbury, I have something to tell you.

539
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,493
- Mummy, we found a Russian.
- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.

540
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:05,516
Close the doors.
Right away, Guard!

541
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:07,516
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

542
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,183
Hello, Bobbie.
Qui est vous?

543
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:18,724
Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.

544
00:51:19,517 --> 00:51:23,099
Oh, it's all right.
Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.

545
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:25,625
- We'll take him home with us, Mr. Perks.
- Thank you, Madam.

546
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,099
Come on, help him on the other side.
Don't worry.

547
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:33,224
Don't worry, she'll look after you.

548
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,766
I knew he was a Russian.

549
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:39,392
Doctor.

550
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,099
I need to tell you.
Mother's got a very shabby Russian.

551
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:45,766
Your mother's got
a very shabby what?

552
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:49,099
He'll have to join your club.
I'm certain he hasn't any money.

553
00:51:49,225 --> 00:51:51,599
We found him at the station.

554
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:53,974
- Found him? Was he lost then?
- Yes, that's what he was.

555
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,641
He's been telling Mother
life story in French.

556
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,808
She said would you please
come directly.

557
00:51:58,934 --> 00:52:00,599
He's got a nasty cough

558
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:02,224
and he's been crying.

559
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:05,141
Oh, don't smile.

560
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,099
Please don't.

561
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,058
You wouldn't if you'd seen him.

562
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:12,266
I've never seen a man cry before.

563
00:52:12,392 --> 00:52:15,808
Haven't you?
I do it all the time.

564
00:53:08,892 --> 00:53:10,433
Bobbie!

565
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:14,683
I know you said
we weren't to ask any questions

566
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:17,683
but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?

567
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:21,516
Oh, my darling, no.

568
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:24,099
Bobbie, look at me.

569
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:28,099
Daddy was quite, quite well
when I heard from him last

570
00:53:28,225 --> 00:53:30,433
and he'll come back to us
some day.

571
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,058
Do tell us about the Russian.

572
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:44,766
That can't make a long story, my darling,
because I'm very tired.

573
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:48,724
He's a very clever writer,
but in Russia one dare not say

574
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,474
anything about the rich people
doing wrong

575
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,433
or what ought to be done
for the poor.

576
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,474
If one does, one is sent to prison.

577
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,766
Well he wrote a book about it all

578
00:53:58,892 --> 00:54:01,641
and he was three years in a dungeon.

579
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:05,099
No light, damp and dreadful.

580
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,683
Then they took him out
and they sent him to Siberia

581
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:10,224
and he was condemned
to stay there for life.

582
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,933
- For life? For writing a book?
- That's stupid.

583
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:16,433
Go on, Mama.

584
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,683
While he was at the mines,
some friends got a message to him

585
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:23,474
to say that his wife and children
had escaped to England.

586
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,308
So after many adventures he too escaped
and came here to look for them.

587
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:32,391
- Do you think he will find them?
- Oh, I do hope so.

588
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:35,724
I think my darlings, in your prayers
you might ask God

589
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,724
to show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives.

590
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,974
To show his pity
upon all prisoners and captives?

591
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:48,891
Yes, darling.
Upon all the prisoners and captives.

592
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:03,308
Merci.

593
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:12,516
He seemed pleased. I wish we could think
of other things to give him.

594
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,308
What about strawberries?

595
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:18,016
Perks promised me some
from his own garden ages ago.

596
00:55:44,142 --> 00:55:45,641
Look at that tree over there!

597
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,974
Lor, it's moving!

598
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,766
So are the others...

599
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,183
It's magic.

600
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:07,891
What is it?

601
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:16,224
It's much too magic for me.
I don't like it, I'm going home.

602
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:46,433
Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.

603
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,933
Hey! The 11:29 down hasn't gone by yet.

604
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,368
We must let them know at the station,
there'll be an accident.

605
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:13,683
- Let's run!
- No, come back.

606
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:15,724
It's too late, it's two miles away.

607
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,599
- We do something to the telegraph wires.
- But we don't know how.

608
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:27,743
If we only had something red, we could
go down on to the line and wave it.

609
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:30,576
But the train wouldn't see us till it came
round the corner. That's too late.

610
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,474
We could go round
and wave to the train.

611
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,224
We might wave anyway.

612
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,766
No. They'd only think it was us as usual,
we've waved so often before.

613
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,974
- Flannel petticoats!
- I beg your pardon?

614
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,391
- Flannel petticoats.
- Of course! Take them off.

615
00:57:56,225 --> 00:57:59,308
- Now.
- You're not going to tear them, Pete?

616
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,433
- Oh, shut up
- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.

617
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,599
If we can't stop the train,
there'll be an accident with people killed.

618
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:08,599
Now sticks, come on.

619
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:35,433
- I'll have two. It was my idea.
- They're our petticoats!

620
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:39,141
What's it matter who waves what
if we can only stop the train.

621
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,724
Stand firm and wave like mad.

622
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,808
Keep off the line, Bobbie.

623
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:56,641
They won't see us.
It's all no good.

624
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:01,558
- Stand off the line, Bobbie.
- It's all no good.

625
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:06,724
- Stand back!
- Not yet. Not yet!

626
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:11,849
- Stop!
- Stop!

627
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,808
Stop!

628
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,266
- Stand back.
- Stop!

629
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:31,433
Stop!

630
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:33,558
- Stop!
- Stop!

631
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:37,224
Stop.

632
00:59:39,517 --> 00:59:41,433
Stop...

633
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:44,099
Stop.

634
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,599
Stop. There's been an earthquake.
Don't move you'll all be killed.

635
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:57,849
The trees are walking down the bank
and there's a mountain of great stones.

636
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,391
We'll have a look at this earthquake
then get back to the train.

637
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,641
Bobbie.

638
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:26,308
Ladies and gentlemen, I think
you'll agree with me that we have three

639
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:32,516
charming children here
who are indeed an example to us all.

640
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,474
All right chaps, this is it.

641
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,808
One, two, three.

642
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:53,474
...I have learned
in the short time I have seen them

643
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,016
to look forward to knowing them better.

644
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:58,641
If I had to rename the Waterbury children,

645
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:03,516
I would call them
the Three Saviours of the Steel Road

646
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:05,099
or perhaps the Railway Children.

647
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:09,849
And now my dears, from the directors
of the Northern and Southern Railway

648
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:15,224
in grateful recognition
of a courageous and brave action

649
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,558
which averted an accident

650
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:21,474
on August 15th, 1905.

651
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,724
Oh, thank you.

652
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:46,308
It's your turn now.
Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".

653
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:50,016
- Oh, lor!
- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".

654
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,308
Ladies and gentlemen...

655
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:55,058
Ladies and gentlemen,

656
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:59,266
we shall treasure these watches
for the rest of our lives.

657
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:02,516
What I mean to say is,
thank you all very much indeed.

658
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,224
One, two.

659
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,016
You must be very proud, Mrs. Waterbury.

660
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:30,766
And er, this is from me.

661
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:23,141
It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?
The kind that very seldom happens.

662
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:26,933
But I did so want to talk to
the old gentleman about something else.

663
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:28,724
What did you want to say to him?

664
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,808
I'll tell you,
I've written him a letter.

665
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:38,099
"My dearest old gentleman,
I want to ask you something, please.

666
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:41,433
"If you get out of the train
and go by the next it would do.

667
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:45,433
"I do not want you to give me anything -
Mother says we ought not to.

668
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:50,599
"Besides, we only want to talk to you
about a prisoner and captive.

669
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:52,224
"Your loving friend, Bobbie."

670
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,433
Very good.
Yes, it is.

671
01:04:08,017 --> 01:04:13,058
My heart's thumping like a steam engine,
right under my sash, too.

672
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:15,266
People's hearts
aren't under their sashes.

673
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:16,933
I don't care, mine is.

674
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:20,974
If you're going to talk like a poetry book,
my heart's in my mouth.

675
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,641
My heart's in my boots
if it comes to that.

676
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:26,224
- He'll think we're idiots.
- He won't be far wrong.

677
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:29,141
Oakworth!

678
01:04:32,184 --> 01:04:35,141
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Perks.

679
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,266
- Hello. This is a very great pleasure.
- It was good of you to get out.

680
01:04:40,392 --> 01:04:43,266
Er, may I extend a cordial invitation
to the use of my room, sir?

681
01:04:43,392 --> 01:04:44,535
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir.

682
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,891
- Right away, Mr. Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr. Perks.

683
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:49,808
If you'd care to follow me, sir
just along here.

684
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,433
- Nice and tidy for you sir.
- Ah, thank you, Perks.

685
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:02,724
- I'll leave you to it then, sir.
- Thank you.

686
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,349
Well?

687
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,183
Well?
What is it?

688
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:18,058
- Oh, please...
- Yes?

689
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:21,308
- What I mean to say is...
- Yes?

690
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:25,724
- I wish I might say something.
- I wish you would say something.

691
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,974
Well then... it's about our Russian.

692
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,516
- Captive.
- A captive.

693
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:35,183
We want more than anything in the world
to find his wife and children for him.

694
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:36,558
Only we don't know how.

695
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,308
- What did you say his name was?
- I'll write it for you.

696
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,599
Um, would you have a pencil
and the back of an envelope?

697
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:49,141
Here, write it here.

698
01:05:55,809 --> 01:06:00,558
This is how you write it.
You say... Szczepansky.

699
01:06:07,142 --> 01:06:10,933
That man?
Bless my soul...

700
01:06:11,059 --> 01:06:12,433
I've read his book.

701
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,849
So your mother took him in
like the good Samaritan.

702
01:06:16,975 --> 01:06:20,391
I'll tell you what, youngsters,
your mother must be a very good woman.

703
01:06:21,392 --> 01:06:23,849
- Yes, she is.
- And you're a good man.

704
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:26,266
You flatter me.

705
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:29,141
Now am I to tell you
what I think of you?

706
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:30,891
- Oh, please don't.
- Why?

707
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:34,599
I don't know why exactly,

708
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,224
only if it's something horrid
I don't want you to.

709
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,433
And if it's something nice
I'd rather you didn't.

710
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:45,516
Then all I will say is that I'm very glad
you came to me about all this,

711
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:47,224
very glad indeed.

712
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,766
And I shouldn't be surprised
if I don't find out something very soon.

713
01:06:50,892 --> 01:06:53,183
Well now tell me something
about yourselves.

714
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:55,224
Tea first.

715
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:15,349
Who on earth?

716
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:20,058
Let's go and see.

717
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:26,058
- Hello.
- Hello.

718
01:07:26,184 --> 01:07:28,599
Hello.
Good news, my dears.

719
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:31,391
I've found your Russian friend's
wife and children.

720
01:07:31,517 --> 01:07:33,391
- Oh!
- And I couldn't resist

721
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:37,266
the temptation of having the pleasure
of telling him

722
01:07:37,392 --> 01:07:39,766
No, you tell him, my dear.

723
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:45,058
And the other two
will show me the way.

724
01:07:49,642 --> 01:07:54,599
Mother, Mr. Szczepansky's wife
and children have been found.

725
01:08:03,725 --> 01:08:06,266
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

726
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:08,391
Goodbye.

727
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,099
- Right away, Mr. Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr. Perks.

728
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:14,558
Goodbye.

729
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,308
Excellent.

730
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,058
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

731
01:08:45,017 --> 01:08:49,516
Ah! There, that's a likely
little brooch that.

732
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:53,308
I don't know as ever I seen a thing
more like a buttercup,

733
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:55,224
without it were a buttercup.

734
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,391
Mother gave it to me
for my birthday.

735
01:08:57,517 --> 01:09:00,641
Oh, is that it?
I didn't see it close to.

736
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:04,058
It highly decorative that,
thank you.

737
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:07,433
- When's your birthday, Mr. Perks?
- My birthday?

738
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:09,849
I gave up keeping my birthday
afore you lot were born.

739
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:12,433
But you must have been born
sometime, you know.

740
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:16,224
Even if it was 20 years ago
or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.

741
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:19,599
Yeah, well it weren't quite
so long as that.

742
01:09:19,725 --> 01:09:21,599
Oh... oh!

743
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:24,391
If you really want to know,

744
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:27,183
it's my 42 years
come the 1 5th of this month.

745
01:09:27,309 --> 01:09:28,474
Why don't you keep it then?

746
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,641
I've got other things to keep
besides birthdays.

747
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,724
Oh what?
Not secrets, Mr. Perks.

748
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,599
No, the kids and bloomin' missus.

749
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:48,391
I've sold another story, darlings,
the one about the King of the Mussels

750
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,933
so there'll be buns for tea.

751
01:09:50,059 --> 01:09:52,099
You can go and got them
the moment they're ready.

752
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:56,683
Would you mind if we didn't them tonight,
but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.

753
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:58,766
I don't mind, darling,
but why?

754
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:02,099
Well, it's Mr. Perks' birthday,
he's 42.

755
01:10:02,225 --> 01:10:05,349
He says he doesn't keep his birthday
any more, he's got other things to keep.

756
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:09,683
Not rabbits and secrets,
but the kids and the bloomin' missus.

757
01:10:09,809 --> 01:10:12,808
- His wife and children, Bobbie.
- It's the same thing, isn't it?

758
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:15,724
Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ
of endearment, isn't it?

759
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,308
- Term of endearment, Phyl.
- Yes.

760
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:20,558
We thought we'd make
a nice birthday for him.

761
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:22,058
He's been very nice to us.

762
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:24,974
And we agreed that next bun day
we'd ask if we could.

763
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,300
It would be rather nice to write his name
on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?

764
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:32,099
- Perks isn't a very pretty name.
- Albert's his other name, I asked once.

765
01:10:32,225 --> 01:10:33,808
I think Albert's a pretty name.

766
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,224
What's the matter with that?

767
01:10:41,392 --> 01:10:43,474
What about flowers?

768
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,224
He's got lots of flowers of his own,
hasn't he?

769
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:49,224
Yes, but it's always nice
to be given them.

770
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,349
Let's all just sit and think.

771
01:10:51,475 --> 01:10:55,974
No one's to speak
until they've thought of something.

772
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:04,099
- I've got it.
- What?

773
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:07,558
- Perks is so nice to everyone, right?
- Right.

774
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:11,266
So there must be lots of people
who'd like to help make him a birthday.

775
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,099
Mother said
we weren't to ask people for things.

776
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:16,433
For ourselves, she meant,
not for other people.

777
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:18,308
I think we should ask Mummy first.

778
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:20,974
There's no harm in it,
it depends how you do it.

779
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,308
I only hope Mr. Perks won't be offended
and think it's charity.

780
01:11:24,434 --> 01:11:26,266
Poor people can be very proud,
you know.

781
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:29,266
It's not because he's poor,
it's because we're fond of him.

782
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:31,872
All right, I'll look out some things
that Phyllis has outgrown.

783
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,433
- Will that do?
- I'm sure he'd love that.

784
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,641
Come back tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do.

785
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:39,641
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

786
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:40,933
Thank you, bye bye.

787
01:11:41,059 --> 01:11:43,808
I've always liked Mrs. Ransome.

788
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:47,058
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

789
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,766
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

790
01:11:50,892 --> 01:11:52,891
Bye!

791
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,933
'Some people were kind
and some were crusty

792
01:12:01,059 --> 01:12:02,974
'and some would give
some would not.'

793
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:06,035
It's Mr. Perks' birthday on Thursday,
would you like to give him a present?

794
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:10,766
- No, I would not. I hate the man.
- Thank you!

795
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:12,391
That was pretty rude.

796
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:17,266
'It's rather difficult work
asking for things, even for other people.

797
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:19,474
'as you've no doubt found
if you've ever tried it.'

798
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,766
Tobacco pipe, half a pound of tea.

799
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:27,266
- Woollen scarf from the Drapers.
- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.

800
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:30,599
There it is, you can have it
and good riddance to it.

801
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:32,891
- Oh!
- Thank you.

802
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:38,433
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

803
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:46,683
Thank you, Mr. James,
he'll love that.

804
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:48,891
Goodbye.

805
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,516
Hello?

806
01:13:08,642 --> 01:13:11,433
Hello, is anyone at home?

807
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,099
Me Mam's upstairs,
a-changing herself.

808
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:16,016
Mam, visitors!

809
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:19,433
Thank you Patrick, just coming.

810
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:23,641
I'm a bit late changing, Miss,

811
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:26,266
owing to me having had
an extra clean up today

812
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:29,099
along with Perks happening to say
it's his birthday.

813
01:13:29,225 --> 01:13:31,849
I don't know what put such an idea
into his head.

814
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,266
We keeps the children's birthdays,
of course,

815
01:13:34,392 --> 01:13:37,849
but him and me... Well, we've no time
for suchlike as a general rule.

816
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:41,099
We know it was his birthday
and we've brought him some presents.

817
01:13:41,225 --> 01:13:44,183
Oh, bring them in my dears.

818
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:56,683
Oh, don't, please don't, Mrs. Perks.

819
01:13:56,809 --> 01:13:57,974
Whatever is the matter?

820
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,474
Do you mean to say
you don't like the things we brought?

821
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,724
Don't you like them?

822
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:05,433
Oh, there, there, don't mind me,
I'm all right.

823
01:14:05,559 --> 01:14:10,099
Like them?
Why it's a birthday such as Perks never had,

824
01:14:10,225 --> 01:14:11,974
not even when he were a boy.

825
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,683
Good, I'm glad you're pleased.

826
01:14:13,809 --> 01:14:15,769
Could we wait and see
if Mr. Perks is pleased too?

827
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:17,808
I won't say another word.

828
01:14:17,934 --> 01:14:20,516
Could we have a plate for the buns, Mrs. Perks?

829
01:14:20,642 --> 01:14:22,224
Oh, of course.

830
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,433
Fit for a prince, I'd say.

831
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:28,974
I never thought there'd be more for him,
except the ounce of his backie.

832
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:43,058
Bless us, he's early.

833
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:45,308
Let's hide in there
and you tell him about it

834
01:14:45,434 --> 01:14:47,683
but give him the tobacco first
as you got it for him.

835
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:50,558
When you've told him,
we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".

836
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:54,933
Oh!

837
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:56,808
- How do.
- How do.

838
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:00,433
Hello, old woman.

839
01:15:04,725 --> 01:15:08,308
- Well here's a pretty set out.
- It's your birthday tea, Bert.

840
01:15:10,517 --> 01:15:14,849
And here's an ounce
of your extra particular.

841
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:18,766
Yes, she's a good old girl.

842
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:21,724
Eh, what's that pram doing here?
Hey, you're not...?

843
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:28,308
Well, what's all these bundles?
Eh?

844
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:31,183
And what's all this sweet stuff and...?

845
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,891
What's this squirrel
doing on the table, eh?

846
01:15:37,017 --> 01:15:40,933
Oh, lor!
Whatever should we do?

847
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:44,308
I've forgotten to put the labels
on any of the things.

848
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:46,766
He won't know what's from whom.

849
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:48,266
He'll think it's all from us

850
01:15:48,392 --> 01:15:51,641
and that we're trying to be grand and
charitable or something horrid like that.

851
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:52,849
Ssh, be quiet!

852
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:55,308
I don't care. I won't stand it.
I tell you straight.

853
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:58,224
But, it's them children
you make such a fuss about,

854
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,933
the children from the Three Chimneys.

855
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:03,683
I don't care,
not if it was angels from heaven.

856
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,049
We got on all right all these years
and no favours asked.

857
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,724
I'm not having these charity
goings-on at my time of life.

858
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:10,391
And don't you think it, Nell.

859
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:13,266
Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue,
for goodness sake.

860
01:16:13,392 --> 01:16:16,724
All three of'em is in the other room
a-listening to every word you speaks.

861
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:18,849
I'll give them something to listen to.

862
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,368
I've spoke my mind to these afore
and I'll do it again. Come out.

863
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,308
Come on out!
Out here, come on.

864
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:25,099
No, not you lot, you stop in...

865
01:16:25,225 --> 01:16:27,849
Sophie, look put some pants
on Benjamin, we've got company.

866
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:34,641
Right, you can tell me
what you mean by it.

867
01:16:34,767 --> 01:16:38,224
Have I ever complained of being short
as you starts this charity with me?

868
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,849
We thought you'd be so pleased, Mr. Perks.

869
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,683
I'll never try and be kind to anyone else
as long as I live.

870
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:46,641
- No, I won't. Not never!
- We didn't mean any harm.

871
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:48,660
It isn't what you means
so much as what you does.

872
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:51,724
We thought you'd love it.
We always have things on our birthdays.

873
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,535
Oh ay, from your own relations,
that's different.

874
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:54,974
No, not just our relations.

875
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,785
They're from all sorts of people
in the village.

876
01:16:56,809 --> 01:16:59,183
- And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.
- We did.

877
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:14,099
So you've been telling the neighbours
that we can't make both ends meet.

878
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:18,099
Now you've disgraced us as deep
as you can in the neighbourhood,

879
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:21,141
you can take that pack of tricks
back where it came from.

880
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,974
I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.

881
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,099
I don't doubt that you meant it kind

882
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:31,308
but I'd rather not be acquainted with you
any longer, if it's all the same to you.

883
01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:37,391
Look here.
We'll go if you like

884
01:17:37,517 --> 01:17:40,308
and you needn't be friends with us
any more, but...

885
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:43,391
We'll always be friends with you,
even though you're nasty to us.

886
01:17:43,517 --> 01:17:47,808
But before we go, let us show you
these labels to put on the things.

887
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:49,433
I don't want to see no labels

888
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:51,933
except proper luggage labels
in me own walk of life.

889
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:55,683
- Please let Bobbie show you the labels.
- All right, go on.

890
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:58,766
We wrote down everything
everybody said

891
01:17:58,892 --> 01:18:01,474
when they gave us the things
with the people's names on.

892
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,724
Because Mother said
that we ought to be careful because...

893
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,690
Well I wrote down what she said
and you'll see.

894
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:07,849
That's from Mother.

895
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,433
She thought Mrs. Perks might like
some of Phyllis' things.

896
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:15,641
"I can't do much..."

897
01:18:20,017 --> 01:18:24,933
Well that's all right.
I mean, your ma's a born lady.

898
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:27,099
We'll keep the little frocks
and what-not, Nell.

899
01:18:27,225 --> 01:18:28,349
Yes, Albert.

900
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:32,266
Then there's the perambulator
and the gooseberries and sweets.

901
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:33,808
They're from Mrs. Ransome.

902
01:18:33,934 --> 01:18:38,183
I can't send the pram back, Bert,
and I won't so don't ask me.

903
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:40,183
I'm not asking anything.

904
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:43,099
Then there's the shovel.
Mr. James made that for you himself

905
01:18:43,225 --> 01:18:45,183
and he says...

906
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,141
Oh, where is it?
Oh, yes, here.

907
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:50,224
- No er, you can read it.
- He says,

908
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,933
"You tell Mr. Perks it is a pleasure
to make a little trifle for a man

909
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:57,266
"as is so much respected."

910
01:18:57,392 --> 01:18:59,516
He's a good chap, that.

911
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:02,516
He's a very good chap, that.

912
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:05,099
He's not bad at all, that chap.

913
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:07,433
And everybody who gave anything
said they liked you

914
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,599
and thought it was
a very good idea of ours.

915
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:15,516
And nobody said anything about charity
or anything horrid like that.

916
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:18,974
We thought that you'd love to know
how fond everybody is of you.

917
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:23,849
And I've never so unhappy
in all my born days.

918
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,516
Goodbye.
Come on.

919
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:28,599
Stop!

920
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:36,641
I take back every word I've said
contrary to what you'd wish.

921
01:19:36,767 --> 01:19:38,474
- Nell?
- Yes, Albert.

922
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,099
Put the kettle on.

923
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:42,891
We'll take away the things
if you're unhappy with them.

924
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:44,224
I'm not unhappy about'em.

925
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,849
I don't know if I was ever better pleased.

926
01:19:47,975 --> 01:19:51,516
...Not so much with the presents
though frankly they're an A. 1 collection

927
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:53,641
but the kind respect
of our neighbours.

928
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:57,224
- That's worth having, eh Nell?
- I think it's all worth having...

929
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,683
And you've made a most ridiculous fuss
about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.

930
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:02,266
No, I haven't.

931
01:20:02,392 --> 01:20:04,868
If a man didn't respect himself,
no one wouldn't do it for him.

932
01:20:04,892 --> 01:20:07,641
But everyone respects you.
They all said so.

933
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:10,349
We knew you'd like it
once you understood.

934
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:16,933
Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?

935
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,266
May the garland of friendship
be ever green.

936
01:20:19,392 --> 01:20:22,266
May our garland of friendship
be ever green, Mr. Perks.

937
01:20:22,392 --> 01:20:24,599
Hear, hear!

938
01:20:24,725 --> 01:20:26,766
Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?

939
01:20:26,892 --> 01:20:30,433
Let's have a look at them buns
you brought in. Where are they?

940
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,974
Who wrote that?
It's Albert.

941
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,766
Holy Mary, Mother of God

942
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:39,099
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

943
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:57,516
Now go to sleep all of you
and not another word.

944
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:06,433
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

945
01:21:06,559 --> 01:21:09,891
Yeah they're jolly good
little kids, those Waterburys.

946
01:21:10,017 --> 01:21:12,474
Oh, they're all right,
bless their hearts.

947
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,766
It's you that's the aggravatingest
old thing that ever was.

948
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:18,224
- I was ashamed of you, I tell you.
- You needn't be.

949
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:21,599
I climbed down handsome
as soon as I understood it weren't charity.

950
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:24,474
Charity's one thing I never could abide,
and won't neither.

951
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,558
- Go to sleep, Albert.
- Yes, dear.

952
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:30,974
I tell you this though,

953
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,433
it isn't what you does
so much as what you means,

954
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:35,516
that's what I say.

955
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:38,599
- Now if it had been charity...
- Oh, drat charity, Bert.

956
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:42,766
Nobody won't offer you charity
however much you was to want it.

957
01:21:42,892 --> 01:21:46,099
That were just friendliness,
that were.

958
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:50,099
I reckon it's what people call
loving kindness.

959
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:53,308
- Now go to sleep, Bert.
- Yes dear, good night.

960
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:56,766
Good night, Bert.
Happy Birthday.

961
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:11,141
Nell?

962
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,391
Oh, all right, Bert,
as it's your birthday.

963
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:50,849
Hello, my dears.

964
01:22:50,975 --> 01:22:53,016
Hard at it, are yer?

965
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,599
Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.

966
01:22:55,725 --> 01:22:57,951
One good turn deserves another,
that's what I always say.

967
01:22:57,975 --> 01:22:59,349
Hello, Mr. Perks, how do mean?

968
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,683
Well I found these magazines, you see,
in the waiting room.

969
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,599
I was cleaning up.

970
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:09,349
They were in a cupboard and well
they're only collecting dust and...

971
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:12,016
Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.

972
01:23:12,142 --> 01:23:13,183
- Hello.
- Hello.

973
01:23:13,309 --> 01:23:15,724
I thought perhaps
you might like them.

974
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,391
There's a lot of pictures in'em.
and that,

975
01:23:19,517 --> 01:23:21,599
and you can colour'em up
with chalks and that.

976
01:23:21,725 --> 01:23:22,891
Anyway I don't want'em.

977
01:23:23,017 --> 01:23:24,808
- You're a dear.
- Yes, you are.

978
01:23:26,184 --> 01:23:29,599
- Hear, hear!
- Well, that's all right then.

979
01:23:29,725 --> 01:23:32,099
I must be getting along.
I've got lots to do.

980
01:23:32,225 --> 01:23:34,016
Perks must be about it.

981
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:36,974
Thank you.
That was very kind of him.

982
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:40,349
We'd better go inside,
it's going to rain.

983
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,392
Daddy...

984
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,433
- Where's Bobbie?
- I thought I heard her upstairs.

985
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:56,599
She knows it's tea time.
I wonder if she's all right.

986
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:17,641
Bobbie?

987
01:25:20,892 --> 01:25:22,516
What is it darling?

988
01:25:24,642 --> 01:25:25,724
Oh, Mummy!

989
01:25:40,725 --> 01:25:42,349
You don't believe Daddy did it?

990
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:45,099
- No.
- Because it's not true.

991
01:25:45,225 --> 01:25:48,641
They have shut him in prison,
but he's done nothing wrong.

992
01:25:48,767 --> 01:25:51,974
He's good and honourable
and he belongs to us.

993
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,766
Will it make you very unhappy
if you tell me all about it?

994
01:25:56,892 --> 01:25:58,391
I want to understand.

995
01:26:04,517 --> 01:26:08,183
Do you remember the day
those two men took Daddy away?

996
01:26:09,184 --> 01:26:10,224
Yes, I do.

997
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:14,766
Well they arrested him, charging him
with selling State secrets

998
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:18,016
with being, in fact,
a spy and a traitor.

999
01:26:20,059 --> 01:26:23,016
How could anyone believe that?

1000
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:25,433
How could anyone do such a thing?

1001
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:27,391
Someone did.

1002
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:32,099
Why didn't you tell someone, a lawyer?

1003
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:37,599
There wasn't anyone who could
hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?

1004
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:41,808
I don't know.
It's all so complicated.

1005
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:46,849
There was a man in the office
who was very envious of your father.

1006
01:26:46,975 --> 01:26:49,808
Daddy always said
he didn't quite trust him.

1007
01:26:50,559 --> 01:26:52,599
Why didn't you explain
all that to someone?

1008
01:26:52,725 --> 01:26:55,099
No one would listen.

1009
01:26:55,225 --> 01:26:58,224
Do you suppose
I haven't tried everything?

1010
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:02,266
No, my darling,
what we have to do, you and I,

1011
01:27:02,392 --> 01:27:05,808
and Daddy, is to be brave.

1012
01:27:55,975 --> 01:27:57,308
Where have you been?

1013
01:27:58,392 --> 01:27:59,974
Where have I been?

1014
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,183
Down to the station.
Don't ask why, it's a secret.

1015
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:03,474
Oh, please yourself.

1016
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,683
- There's a paper chase tomorrow.
- Oh, whoopee!

1017
01:28:06,809 --> 01:28:08,266
- Who?
- The grammar school boys.

1018
01:28:08,392 --> 01:28:09,392
Oh zippee!

1019
01:28:09,475 --> 01:28:11,599
Perks says we can see them
going along by the line.

1020
01:28:11,725 --> 01:28:13,141
Oh really?

1021
01:28:14,559 --> 01:28:16,391
What's a paper chase?

1022
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:35,766
Let me pass please

1023
01:28:40,809 --> 01:28:43,849
Hey! That's against by-laws.

1024
01:28:43,975 --> 01:28:47,266
- I ought to report him.
- They're only having fun.

1025
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:51,433
Passengers is forbidden to cross the line
on any pretence.

1026
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:55,016
He ain't no passenger.
He's out of sight now, anyway.

1027
01:28:55,142 --> 01:28:59,808
What the eye don't see the heart need
take no notice of, that what I always say.

1028
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:03,016
Come on then.

1029
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:06,433
He's gone in the tunnel.

1030
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:08,516
Oh, it is dark in here.

1031
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,724
They don't know what they're in for.

1032
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:20,599
It isn't easy running in the dark.

1033
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:23,724
They'll take a long time
going through, won't they?

1034
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,641
Aye, they will that.

1035
01:29:34,434 --> 01:29:36,891
- They went that way.
- Oh thanks!

1036
01:29:38,309 --> 01:29:41,183
I know! Let's cut across to the top
and see them come out the other end.

1037
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:43,474
- We'll be there before they are.
- Good idea.

1038
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,141
Yes, good idea!

1039
01:30:24,892 --> 01:30:29,349
- This way!
- No, this way. Come on, quick.

1040
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,016
There, that's all.

1041
01:30:40,142 --> 01:30:41,599
What should we do now?

1042
01:30:41,725 --> 01:30:43,891
Not yet, there's one in a red jersey.

1043
01:30:44,017 --> 01:30:45,724
He hasn't come out yet.

1044
01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:48,849
Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth

1045
01:30:48,975 --> 01:30:51,808
and perhaps we can see him
from the inside.

1046
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:05,933
It's dark in there.

1047
01:31:06,059 --> 01:31:08,599
- Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.
- I don't like it.

1048
01:31:10,017 --> 01:31:12,933
Still no sign of him.
I reckon he must have had an accident.

1049
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:15,849
Let's go and rescue him.
Come on.

1050
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:17,933
Come on, Phyl.
Keep close behind me.

1051
01:31:18,059 --> 01:31:20,219
If a train comes along
get flat against the tunnel wall

1052
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,058
and hold your skirts against you.

1053
01:31:22,184 --> 01:31:23,558
I still don't like it.

1054
01:31:34,225 --> 01:31:37,849
- I want to go back.
- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?

1055
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:39,433
It's another earthquake!

1056
01:31:56,142 --> 01:31:59,099
- It's a train.
- Oh, let me go back!

1057
01:31:59,225 --> 01:32:01,474
Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.
Stand back.

1058
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,516
Come in, come on.

1059
01:32:26,684 --> 01:32:29,016
It is a dragon.
I always thought it was.

1060
01:32:42,809 --> 01:32:44,016
Come on.

1061
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:46,849
Supposing that boy
was caught underneath the train...

1062
01:32:46,975 --> 01:32:49,266
- Oh!
- We've got to go and see.

1063
01:32:49,392 --> 01:32:51,933
Can't we go and get someone
from the station?

1064
01:32:52,059 --> 01:32:54,308
- Phyl, you wait here.
- No.

1065
01:32:54,434 --> 01:32:59,433
Hello?

1066
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:03,891
Hey you two, come quickly!

1067
01:33:05,434 --> 01:33:09,183
Oh, is that blood?
Is that red blood?

1068
01:33:09,309 --> 01:33:12,433
- Is he all killed?
- Phyllis, please.

1069
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:15,391
Hurry up you two, get help.

1070
01:33:29,267 --> 01:33:33,308
"It was on a hot summer's afternoon..."

1071
01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:38,974
Oh, do come down, we've found a hound
in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.

1072
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,300
They're bringing him here,
I've sent for Doctor Forrest.

1073
01:33:41,392 --> 01:33:44,183
But you should send for a vet,
I can't have a lame dog here.

1074
01:33:44,309 --> 01:33:46,391
Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.

1075
01:33:46,517 --> 01:33:48,599
Well then he ought to be taken
to his mother.

1076
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:51,974
His mother's dead,
his father's in Northumberland.

1077
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,058
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,
won't you?

1078
01:33:54,184 --> 01:33:56,599
I told him I was sure you'd want us
to have him here.

1079
01:33:56,725 --> 01:34:00,058
- You always want to help everybody.
- Come along.

1080
01:34:10,392 --> 01:34:12,266
I'm glad you brought him here.

1081
01:34:12,392 --> 01:34:16,058
- Let's get him to bed.
- It will hurt a bit, won't it?

1082
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:21,683
I hope you don't think I'm a coward if
I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.

1083
01:34:21,809 --> 01:34:23,558
I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.

1084
01:34:23,684 --> 01:34:28,099
Don't you worry, you're the one
who's got the trouble.

1085
01:34:28,225 --> 01:34:31,016
We'd love to have you here,
wouldn't we, Bobbie?

1086
01:34:31,142 --> 01:34:32,641
Yes.

1087
01:34:36,059 --> 01:34:38,891
That will be Doctor Forrest.
I'll go.

1088
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:52,891
- That's not the doctor.
- I know.

1089
01:34:53,017 --> 01:34:55,308
I know that voice though,
at least I think I do.

1090
01:34:55,434 --> 01:34:59,849
I thought I recognised it too.
It's not the doctor, that's for sure.

1091
01:35:03,142 --> 01:35:06,974
Could it be that Doctor Forrest
has been attacked by highwaymen

1092
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,724
and left for dead and this is the man
they've telegraphed

1093
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:12,516
- to take his place?
- Perhaps he's gone mad.

1094
01:35:12,642 --> 01:35:15,391
Perhaps he's caught something awful
from one of his patients

1095
01:35:15,517 --> 01:35:17,016
and that man's come to tell her.

1096
01:35:17,142 --> 01:35:19,368
Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man
up into Jim's bedroom.

1097
01:35:19,392 --> 01:35:20,974
Why should she?

1098
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,099
Listen.
The door's opening.

1099
01:35:34,725 --> 01:35:36,474
Now they'll come down.

1100
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,641
It's rude to listen like this.

1101
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:42,766
It's not listening, nobody in their senses
would talk secrets on the stairs.

1102
01:35:42,892 --> 01:35:44,683
Bobbie?

1103
01:35:44,809 --> 01:35:47,599
A relative of Jim's has come,
he wants to see you.

1104
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:48,765
Wash your hands and faces.

1105
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:50,724
We'll be in the dining room
when you're ready.

1106
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:51,891
Yes, Mama.

1107
01:35:54,225 --> 01:35:57,599
There now!
Fancy not thinking of that, hm?

1108
01:35:57,725 --> 01:36:01,099
- Any hot water, Mrs. Viney?
- Righto love.

1109
01:36:07,225 --> 01:36:09,766
You all right?
There we are, that's it.

1110
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,849
Well I never did!

1111
01:36:14,975 --> 01:36:17,558
This, my dears,
is Jim's grandfather.

1112
01:36:17,684 --> 01:36:21,058
Our own old gentleman!
I'm so awfully glad it's you.

1113
01:36:21,184 --> 01:36:24,099
When I just think of all
the old gentlemen there are in the world

1114
01:36:24,225 --> 01:36:26,016
it could have been anyone.

1115
01:36:26,142 --> 01:36:28,102
You're not going to take
Jim away though, are you?

1116
01:36:28,225 --> 01:36:29,391
Not at present.

1117
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,683
Your mother has most kindly consented
to let him stay here.

1118
01:36:32,809 --> 01:36:37,308
I thought of sending a nurse but your
mother said she'd nurse him herself.

1119
01:36:37,434 --> 01:36:40,641
But we won't have anything to eat
if Mother doesn't write.

1120
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:42,766
That's all right, Peter.

1121
01:36:42,892 --> 01:36:44,641
I see you trust your children.

1122
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:47,849
- Of course.
- Then I may tell them our arrangement.

1123
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:49,599
Sit down, my dears.

1124
01:36:52,059 --> 01:36:56,474
Your Mother, my dears, has consented
to give up her writing for a while

1125
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,808
and to become a matron of my hospital.

1126
01:36:58,934 --> 01:37:01,599
Does that mean we'll have to leave
Three Chimneys and the railways?

1127
01:37:01,725 --> 01:37:04,224
No, no, my darling. No.

1128
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:07,058
The hospital is here.

1129
01:37:07,184 --> 01:37:11,974
The Three Chimneys Hospital
and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.

1130
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,599
- Will Mother go on writing again?
- We shall see...

1131
01:37:15,725 --> 01:37:17,951
Perhaps something nice will happen
and she won't have to.

1132
01:37:17,975 --> 01:37:19,974
- But I like my writing.
- I know.

1133
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,099
Don't be afraid I'm going to try
and interfere but one never know.

1134
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:27,391
Very beautiful and wonderful things
do happen, don't they?

1135
01:37:27,517 --> 01:37:31,974
And we live most of our lives
in the hope of them.

1136
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,058
I got your letter my dear,
but it wasn't needed.

1137
01:37:43,184 --> 01:37:47,766
When I read about your father's case
in the papers at the time I had my doubts.

1138
01:37:47,892 --> 01:37:51,849
And ever since I've known who you were,
I've been trying to find out things

1139
01:37:51,975 --> 01:37:54,224
and I have hopes.

1140
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:57,641
- Oh...
- Yes, I may say, great hopes.

1141
01:37:57,767 --> 01:38:00,641
But keep your secret
for a little while longer.

1142
01:38:00,767 --> 01:38:03,974
Wouldn't do to upset your mother
with a false hope, would it?

1143
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:07,266
But it isn't false.
I know you can do it.

1144
01:38:07,392 --> 01:38:10,183
I knew you could when I wrote.
It isn't false hope, is it?

1145
01:38:10,309 --> 01:38:11,974
No, my dear.

1146
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,724
You don't believe Daddy did it?
Oh, say you don't believe he did.

1147
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:19,558
My dear, I'm perfectly certain he didn't.

1148
01:38:35,559 --> 01:38:38,058
'Life at Three Chimneys
was never quite the same again

1149
01:38:38,184 --> 01:38:39,824
'after the old gentleman came to see us.'

1150
01:38:42,059 --> 01:38:43,808
Oh, please Phyllis.

1151
01:38:43,934 --> 01:38:46,516
'The house became a hospital.'

1152
01:38:48,559 --> 01:38:50,808
I give you three guesses
who that is.

1153
01:38:53,975 --> 01:38:57,308
Is everything all right?
Good luck. I'll curtain up.

1154
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:00,224
Have you...

1155
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:04,433
Have you noticed the ship is sinking?

1156
01:39:04,559 --> 01:39:07,974
Yes I know, but don't blame me.

1157
01:39:09,725 --> 01:39:13,308
Oh, no!
Oh, no they'll all get so wet.

1158
01:39:14,392 --> 01:39:17,016
You'll need some light
on the subject.

1159
01:39:18,767 --> 01:39:22,516
As your solicitor
I must advise you.

1160
01:39:24,059 --> 01:39:26,266
Don't worry.

1161
01:39:26,392 --> 01:39:29,516
Don't worry,
I've managed to get most of the survivors.

1162
01:39:29,642 --> 01:39:31,224
Right, curtain down.

1163
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:34,558
Thank you, good evening.

1164
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:44,099
I hope you enjoyed it.

1165
01:39:54,392 --> 01:39:57,058
Children, will you please be quiet.

1166
01:39:57,184 --> 01:39:58,766
Oh, the blood!

1167
01:40:00,767 --> 01:40:02,933
- Oh, is it over?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1168
01:40:03,059 --> 01:40:05,391
- Oh, you are a good doctor.
- Can I have that please?

1169
01:40:05,517 --> 01:40:07,016
There we are.
How's that?

1170
01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:09,433
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

1171
01:40:09,559 --> 01:40:12,891
'Jim's leg got better
and he went home.'

1172
01:40:13,017 --> 01:40:15,641
- Right away, Mr. Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr. Perks.

1173
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,933
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1174
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:28,308
- Goodbye.
- Bye, I'll write.

1175
01:40:30,392 --> 01:40:35,099
- Lor lummy, Pete!
- They'll have to marry now!

1176
01:40:35,225 --> 01:40:36,225
Lummy.

1177
01:40:40,475 --> 01:40:43,599
'We seemed to be hardly
Railway Children at all in those days

1178
01:40:43,725 --> 01:40:48,724
'and as the days went on each of us
had an uneasy feeling about this

1179
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,933
'which Phyllis expressed one day.'

1180
01:40:51,059 --> 01:40:55,058
I wonder if the railway misses us.
We never go and see it now.

1181
01:40:55,184 --> 01:40:56,433
It seems ungrateful.

1182
01:40:56,559 --> 01:40:59,683
We loved it so when we hadn't
anyone to play with.

1183
01:40:59,809 --> 01:41:02,724
The thing I don't like is our having
stopped waving to the 9:15

1184
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:04,891
and sending our love to Father by it.

1185
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:07,391
Let's begin again tomorrow.

1186
01:41:21,392 --> 01:41:23,433
Hurry up, Fatty,
for goodness sake.

1187
01:41:23,559 --> 01:41:25,891
I can't, my bootlace is undone.

1188
01:41:26,017 --> 01:41:29,433
When you marry your laces
will come undone going up the aisle

1189
01:41:29,559 --> 01:41:32,683
and the man that you marry
will tumble over and smash his nose in.

1190
01:41:32,809 --> 01:41:37,516
I'd rather marry a man with
a smashed in nose than not marry at all.

1191
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:47,558
- Take our love to Father!
- Take our love to Father!

1192
01:42:25,559 --> 01:42:27,183
Most extraordinary!

1193
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:31,224
- Most extraordinary.
- Extraordinary indeed.

1194
01:42:32,684 --> 01:42:36,974
Now, Bobbie,
I wonder whether you could...

1195
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,016
Don't you feel well?

1196
01:42:41,142 --> 01:42:45,266
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel...

1197
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:47,224
Will you let me off lessons today?

1198
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:51,474
I feel as if I want to be
quite alone, by myself.

1199
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,724
Of course I'll let you off.

1200
01:43:00,434 --> 01:43:04,058
What is it?
You don't feel ill, do you?

1201
01:43:04,184 --> 01:43:07,224
No, not ill.

1202
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:11,099
I've just got to be alone,
do you know?

1203
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:15,849
Mm, sometimes Roberta,
you're so like me.

1204
01:43:22,225 --> 01:43:24,349
I'll be more alive in the garden.

1205
01:43:36,434 --> 01:43:38,933
- Morning, Miss, I'm sure.
- Good luck, Miss Roberta.

1206
01:43:39,059 --> 01:43:40,599
Thank you.

1207
01:43:42,559 --> 01:43:45,849
Hello. Look, if this is the train,
it'll be smart work.

1208
01:43:45,975 --> 01:43:50,474
Bless you. I seen it in the paper.
I was never so pleased in all my born days.

1209
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,349
One I most have and no offence I know
on a day like this.

1210
01:43:54,225 --> 01:43:57,058
And one for luck.
You ain't offended, are you?

1211
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:00,433
I haven't taken too great a liberty,
have I, on a day like this, you know.

1212
01:44:00,559 --> 01:44:03,433
- No, Mr. Perks, of course it's not a liberty.
- No.

1213
01:44:03,559 --> 01:44:07,224
Dear Mr. Perks, we love you quite as much
as if you were an uncle of our own

1214
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:08,683
but on a day like what?

1215
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:12,183
Well like this'ere. I told you,
I seen it in the papers, didn't I?

1216
01:44:12,309 --> 01:44:14,058
Saw what in the papers?

1217
01:44:14,184 --> 01:44:24,308
Oakworth!

1218
01:44:25,809 --> 01:44:28,641
Oakworth Station.

1219
01:44:28,767 --> 01:44:31,599
Oakworth. There we are.
Thank you, Madam.

1220
01:44:31,725 --> 01:44:34,308
Yes, thank you.
Quick as you can, please.

1221
01:44:35,725 --> 01:44:38,766
Oakworth Station.

1222
01:44:42,184 --> 01:44:45,558
- Right away, Mr. Cryer.
- Thank you, Mr. Perks.

1223
01:45:22,559 --> 01:45:25,516
Daddy, my Daddy!

1224
01:47:03,559 --> 01:47:07,599
'I think just now
we're not wanted there.

1225
01:47:07,725 --> 01:47:11,016
'Not for a few minutes anyway.

1226
01:47:11,142 --> 01:47:16,016
'I think it would best for us
to go quickly and quietly.

1227
01:47:16,142 --> 01:47:22,599
'We'll go to the end of the field
among the thin gold spikes of grass.

1228
01:47:22,725 --> 01:47:27,724
'We may just take one last look
over our shoulders, at the house

1229
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:31,224
'where neither we nor anyone else
is wanted now.'

1230
01:48:46,559 --> 01:48:50,058
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

1231
01:48:50,184 --> 01:48:52,224
Hope you loved it.

1232
01:49:04,559 --> 01:49:06,308
Goodbye.
