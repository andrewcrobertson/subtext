- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

173
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:27,450
[Chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

174
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

175
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,188
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

176
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,853
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

177
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,453
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

178
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:42,001
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

179
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:45,334
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

180
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,664
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

181
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:49,597
- Harv?
- Come on!

182
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:52,372
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?

183
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,108
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

184
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,377
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

185
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:01,855
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

186
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,983
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

187
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,527
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

188
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,893
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

189
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:12,489
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

190
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,763
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

191
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,031
Playtime is over, pal.

192
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:20,939
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

193
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,704
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

194
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:26,407
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

195
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,643
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

196
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:32,346
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

197
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:35,686
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

198
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:39,751
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

199
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,557
Just give me a second here, Harv.

200
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,425
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

201
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,764
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

202
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:53,705
Sally, I... I want you to...

203
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:57,438
Look, I wish... [sighs]

204
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:01,782
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

205
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,876
[Groans, chuckles]

206
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:09,152
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

207
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:15,493
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

208
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,797
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

209
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,599
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

210
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:23,902
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

211
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,303
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

212
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,473
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

213
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:34,780
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

214
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,946
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

215
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,558
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

216
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,996
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

217
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,762
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

218
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,134
You don't belong there, anyway.

219
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:56,197
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

220
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,940
[Engine starts]

221
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,241
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

222
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,753
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

223
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,223
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

224
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:25,433
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

225
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,201
Best for everyone or best for you?

226
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,491
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

227
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,374
[Light buzzing]

228
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:51,391
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

229
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,759
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

230
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,060
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

231
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,600
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

232
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,229
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

233
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,639
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

234
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,270
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

235
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:11,679
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

236
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,980
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

237
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:19,045
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

238
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,455
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

239
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:25,622
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

240
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,325
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

241
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,496
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

242
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,665
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

243
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:36,730
[Mia] He's hot!

244
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,470
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

245
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:42,638
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

246
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,239
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

247
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:48,252
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

248
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,085
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

249
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:54,285
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

250
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,320
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

251
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,301
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

252
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,631
[Guard] Sorry, pal.

253
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:08,970
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

254
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:12,540
I am speed.

255
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,205
[Cars whizzing]

256
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,475
Victory.

257
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,676
One winner, two losers.

258
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,719
[Engine revving]

259
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:25,316
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

260
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,952
[birds singing]

261
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,419
[Knock on door]

262
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,089
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

263
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,862
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

264
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,131
[Indistinct chatter]

265
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,049
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

266
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,713
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

267
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,188
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

268
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,623
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

269
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,990
[All shouting]

270
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,797
[Gulping]

271
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,310
Uh-oh

272
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,945
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

273
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:31,160
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

274
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,558
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

275
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,758
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

276
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,233
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

277
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,362
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

278
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:46,635
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

279
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:47,871
[Chuckling]

280
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:50,277
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

281
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:53,249
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

282
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,309
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

283
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:59,550
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

284
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:08,456
Agh! Shoot!

285
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,661
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

286
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:17,832
[Crowd cheering]

287
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,501
Come on, you can do it!

288
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,603
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

289
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:26,012
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

290
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:29,315
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

291
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,651
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

292
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,125
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

293
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:37,925
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

294
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:40,295
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

295
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:47,196
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

296
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,633
[Breaks squealing]

297
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,768
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

298
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:52,869
[All gasp]

299
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:58,342
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

300
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:01,945
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

301
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,046
[Groans]

302
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:07,184
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

303
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:08,694
I don't think I...

304
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:11,492
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

305
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,256
Doc?

306
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,564
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

307
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:22,405
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

308
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,376
You said you'd never come back.

309
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:28,041
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

310
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:31,017
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

311
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:32,951
[Chuckles]

312
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,482
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

313
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,825
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

314
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,888
Now, get back out there!

315
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:49,103
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

316
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,469
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

317
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,703
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

318
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,472
Kid, you can beat these guys.

319
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:59,946
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

320
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:11,591
[Murmuring]

321
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,561
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

322
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,396
Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

323
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:20,095
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

324
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,570
And look who he has for a crew chief!

325
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,335
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

326
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,742
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

327
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:33,307
[Crowd cheering]

328
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:35,408
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

329
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,386
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

330
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:39,855
Hey, Doc!

331
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:44,088
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

332
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,800
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

333
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,771
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

334
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,741
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

335
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,402
Vai! Vai, vai!

336
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,380
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

337
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,885
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

338
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:07,976
[All laugh]

339
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,647
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

340
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,886
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

341
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,139
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

342
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,974
What do you think of this?

343
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:36,208
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

344
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,816
What?

345
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,684
Whoa! Git-R-done!

346
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:48,723
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

347
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,765
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

348
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,663
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

349
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,897
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

350
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,738
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

351
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,748
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

352
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:14,245
No, you don't.

353
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,255
[Tire blows]

354
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,316
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

355
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:22,830
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

356
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:26,197
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

357
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:30,263
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

358
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,273
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

359
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,502
Guido! It's time.

360
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,876
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

361
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:47,979
[Air wrench whirring]

362
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,427
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

363
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:55,191
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

364
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,824
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

365
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,595
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

366
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,739
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

367
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:05,172
[Darrell] He's back in!

368
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,499
Peet stop.

369
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:10,880
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

370
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:29,224
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

371
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,666
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

372
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:35,263
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

373
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,602
This is it, kiddo.

374
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:39,165
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

375
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:41,678
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

376
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:43,145
- Go!
- [Revving]

377
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,976
We'll see about that!

378
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:50,044
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

379
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:56,051
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

380
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,207
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

381
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:12,270
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

382
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:16,974
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

383
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:21,544
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

384
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,714
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

385
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:29,025
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

386
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,273
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]

387
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,712
[Breaks screeching]

388
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,453
[Engine idling]

389
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,989
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

390
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:05,795
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

391
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:09,229
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

392
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,537
[Grunting, moaning]

393
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:20,980
What are you doin', kid?

394
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:24,280
I think The King
should finish his last race.

395
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:30,449
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

396
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:34,121
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

397
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:36,256
It's just an empty cup.

398
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

399
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:44,667
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

400
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:47,039
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

401
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,806
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

402
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:52,143
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]

403
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:53,683
[Laughing]

404
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:58,678
[Crowd cheers wildly]

405
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,158
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

406
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,829
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

407
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:18,432
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

408
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:23,914
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

409
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,381
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

410
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,419
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

411
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:31,614
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

412
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,920
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

413
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:37,587
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

414
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:40,961
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

415
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,500
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

416
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:44,192
- Boo!
- Boo!

417
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,364
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

418
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,533
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

419
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:57,939
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

420
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,787
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

421
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:04,847
You're The King! Yeah!

422
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,623
[Crowd cheers]

423
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,199
[Laughing and cheering]

424
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:18,726
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

425
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:24,570
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

426
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,439
Thanks, Doc.

427
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,913
Hey, Lightnin'.

428
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,645
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

429
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:35,579
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

430
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:38,420
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

431
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,598
But I didn't win.

432
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:48,328
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

433
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,099
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

434
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:55,336
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]

435
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,140
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

436
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,943
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

437
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,213
I'm gonna stick with them.

438
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:07,346
Well, I sure can respect that.

439
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:08,583
Still, you know,

440
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:12,525
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

441
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:15,119
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

442
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,591
Actually, there is one thing.

443
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,304
Whoo-hoo!

444
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,532
Whoo-hoo!

445
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:26,473
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

446
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,972
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

447
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,918
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

448
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,496
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

449
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:47,553
to get tires.

450
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:51,829
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

451
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:57,101
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

452
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,472
A real Ferrari!

453
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,670
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

454
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:05,203
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

455
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:10,079
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

456
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:12,487

Just passin' through?

460
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:32,674
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

461
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:36,010
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

462
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:39,848
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

463
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,387
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

464
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:45,288
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

465
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:47,849
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

466
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:52,057
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

467
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:54,292
- blah, blah, blah.
- [Lightning chuckles]

00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:57,693

K-i-s-s...uh... i-n-t!

00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,744
Great timing, Mater!

Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!

472
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:11,316
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

473
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:14,320
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

474
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:17,084
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

475
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:19,752
Hmm... Nah.

476
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,731
Yeah! Ka-chow!

[Sniffing] Ah-choo!

481
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:38,597
[Mater] All right, everybody
please keep together now.

482
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:43,442
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

483
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:46,482
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

484
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,611
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

485
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:54,145
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

486
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:58,025
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

487
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:04,528
- [Lightning] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Doc] Yeah!

488
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:07,127
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

489
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:10,265
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.

499
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:51,616
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!

500
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,675
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

501
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,586
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!

502
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:01,216
- [Pole hits metal]
- Huh? Look at this!

503
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:03,455
It's my hood! It's my hood!

504
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:06,623
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!

505
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:11,193
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!

506
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,139
Oh, dang.

507
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:26,844
You are a toy car!

508
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:31,688
You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.

509
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:34,823
[Woody Car] Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!

510
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:38,593
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!

511
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,033
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

512
00:35:41,102 --> 00:35:44,435
[Chuckling] Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,

513
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:47,066
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!

514
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:51,807
We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!

515
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,646
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!

516
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:59,984
- You're still not listening! [gasping]
- Ah!

517
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:03,685
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?

518
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:07,690
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!

519
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,221
Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!

520
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:11,698
Circus cars?

521
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,235
How can you be circus cars?

522
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,828
These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,

523
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:18,897
and they're gonna make me rich!

524
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,102
Wait a minute here.

525
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,645
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.

526
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,273
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?

527
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,149
[~ Brad Paisley: Find Yourself]

528
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:51,060
[Minny moaning]

529
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:55,793
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?

530
00:39:55,868 --> 00:40:00,100
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!
