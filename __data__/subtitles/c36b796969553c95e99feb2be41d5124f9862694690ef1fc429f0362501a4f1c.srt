gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103

[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,415

long-term loss,

00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:48,705
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

504
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,436
What do you want, Sally?

505
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,877
[sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

506
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:57,109
No. I know his type. Racecar.

507
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:59,242
That's the last thing this town needs.

508
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,813
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

509
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,826
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

510
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:09,327
Here she goes again.

511
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,091
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

512
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:15,794
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

513
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:19,668
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

514
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:22,731
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

515
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:23,969
Ignore him.

516
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,410
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

517
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,812
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

518
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,680
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

519
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:34,242
And if no one can get to you?

520
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,654
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

521
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:41,558
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

522
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:45,028
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

523
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:48,625
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

524
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:52,193
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

525
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,399
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

526
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,035
- [all] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

527
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,944
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

528
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,244
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

529
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,547
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

530
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,644
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

531
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:09,710
Oh, he can do it.

532
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,587
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

533
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,125
[all] Fix the road!

534
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,754
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

535
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,092
[all cheer]

536
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,362
[honking] Order in the court!

537
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,900
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

538
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:27,963
- [all] Yeah!
- No!

539
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,371
[VW van] Nice ruling.

540
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,601
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

541
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,547
[chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

542
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,445
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

543
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,147
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

544
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,883
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

545
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,652
[gurgling]

546
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:51,052
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

547
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,190
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

548
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,997
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

549
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,401
What? This place is crazy!

550
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,633
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

551
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,699
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

552
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:05,766
What?

553
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:09,406
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

554
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,074
You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,812
You start there where the road begins.

556
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,179
You finish down there
where the road ends.

557
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,422
[Mater] Holy shoot!

558
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:24,361
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

559
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,991
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

560
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,227
Five days?

561
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,237
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

562
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:35,274
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

563
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,832
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

564
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,039
[grunting]

565
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:45,550
[tires squealing, engine revving]

566
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,148
[Lightning] Freedom!

567
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,986
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

568
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,062
...and then...
then took the boot off.

569
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,935
Whoo-hoo!

570
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,664
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

571
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:13,610
California, here I come! Yeah!

572
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,973
Oh, feel that wind.

573
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,009
Yes!

574
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,110
[sputtering]

575
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,212
No. No, no, no.

576
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:25,821
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

577
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,883
How can I be outta gas?

578
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,919
[chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

579
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:34,330
[stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?

580
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,732
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

581
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:39,703
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

582
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:50,514
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

583
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,675
Hey, Sheriff.

584
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:54,015
- Why here?
- <i>[Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

585
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,577
- They were better before.
- <i>Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

586
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,521
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

587
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:01,424
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

588
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,327
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

589
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:07,127
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

590
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,100
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

591
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:13,536
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

592
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:15,836
That's why we made him the judge.

593
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,172
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
<i>Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

594
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,611
Now, I'm not one to brag

595
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:24,980
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

596
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:26,475
Oh!

597
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,385
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

598
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,252
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

599
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,588
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

600
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,358
- [snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

601
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:40,763
That won't be necessary.

602
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:45,133
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

603
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:47,832
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

604
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,265
Where's he goin'?

605
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:54,780
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

606
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:56,371
I shouldn't put up with this.

607
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,316
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

608
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,411
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

609
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,885
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

610
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,586
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

611
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:12,654
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

612
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,030
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

613
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,194
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

614
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,260
I must scream it to the world!

615
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,570
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

616
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:26,134
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

617
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:29,181
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

618
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,884
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

619
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,317
Is that what I think it is?

620
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:43,156
[Sally] Customers.

621
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:46,687
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

622
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,131
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

623
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,033
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

624
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,663
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

625
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:57,266
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

626
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:00,005
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

627
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,482
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,212
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

629
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:10,255
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

630
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,586
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

631
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:13,682
How can we help you?

632
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:17,820
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

633
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:21,128
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

634
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,634
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

635
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:26,536
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

636
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:29,665
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

637
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:33,803
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

638
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,574
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

639
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,845
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

640
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:42,251
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

641
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,653
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

642
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,056
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

643
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:50,289
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

644
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,093
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

645
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,624
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

646
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:01,639
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

647
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:02,867
No we just topped off.

648
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:06,810
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

649
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:09,347
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

650
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:12,748
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

651
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,981
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

652
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,353
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

653
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,755
Maybe ghost flames!

654
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,385
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

655
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:26,363
- [both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

656
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:29,458
[chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

657
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,025
Ow!

658
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:34,300
[laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

659
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,633
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

660
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:40,201
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

661
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,873
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

662
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,213
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

663
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:49,379
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

664
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,616
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

665
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,352
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:55,893
No, not really. But listen.

667
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,590
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

668
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:02,190
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

669
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:06,102
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

670
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,336
- <i>[locks beeping]</i>
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

671
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:13,276
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

672
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:16,508
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

673
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,675
I'm becoming one of them!

674
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,480
- [Lightning echoes]
- [sighing]

675
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:22,680
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

676
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:24,518
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

677
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,457
<i>[Male DJ] We'll be back</i>
<i>for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

678
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,256
- That's good.
- <i>...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

679
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:34,231
<i>[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning</i>
<i>McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

[laughing]

685

Hoo-hoo-hoo!

686
00:40:55,154 --> 00:40:56,143
Ha-ha!

687
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:00,981
Yeah!

[girls chattering and giggling]

690
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:14,937
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

691
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,238
[gasping] Oh!

692
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,674
Let me get this straight.

693
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:21,679
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

694
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:25,478
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

695
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,643
I got a road to finish.

696
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,353
[grunting and revving]

697
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,897
- He's done!
- Done?

698
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,332
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

699
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:48,604
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

700
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:51,541
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

701
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:55,807
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

702
00:41:56,382 --> 00:41:57,974
Oh!

703
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:02,014
[vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

704
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:05,712
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

705
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:09,316
- Oh!
- [blubbering]

706
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,686
Red.

707
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,631
Who do you think you are?

708
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,000
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

709
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,507
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

710
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:25,042
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

711
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,739
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

712
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:30,304
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

713
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:34,614
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

714
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:38,487
- What?
- [chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

715
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,923
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

716
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:43,689
If I win, you do the road my way.

717
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,286
Doc, what're you doin'?

718
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,495
I don't mean to be rude here,

719
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:51,297
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

720
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,895
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

721
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:58,637
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

722
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,904
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

723
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:07,476
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

724
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:10,488
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

725
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:13,081
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

726
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:18,289
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

727
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:20,127
and no lollygaggin'.

728
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,757
Speed. I'm speed.

729
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:24,394
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

730
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,494
[Luigi laughs]

731
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:30,438
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

732
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:33,034
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

733
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,979
The race is only one lap, guys.

734
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,539
<i>Uno</i> lappo! Don't need any help.

735
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:42,451
- I work <i>solo mio.</i>
- Fine. Race your way.

736
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:47,624
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

737
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,717
Gentlemen...

738
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:53,195
...start your engines!

739
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:56,995
[engine sputters]

740
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,904
[revving furiously]

741
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,338
- <i>¡Hijole!</i> Check that out!
- Whoa.

742
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:05,502
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

743
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:07,175
Luigi?

744
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,443
[chuckling] On your mark, get set...

745
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:12,746
<i>Uno</i> for the money,
<i>due</i> for the show,

746
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:18,518
<i>tre</i> to get ready, and <i>quattro</i>
to... I can't believe it. Go!

747
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:20,950
[giggling]

748
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,461
[cheering]

749
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,330
Huh?

750
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,492
Doc... the flag means go.

751
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,903
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

752
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,703
Doc, what are you doing, man?

753
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:41,337
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

754
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:44,541
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

755
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:47,380
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

756
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:50,521
You got your tow cable?

757
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:52,784
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

758
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,156
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

759
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,897
[yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

760
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:07,700
No, no, no, no, no!

761
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,240
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

762
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,274
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

763
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:14,778
[revving]

764
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:22,444
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

765
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:24,887
- I'm confused.
- [chuckling]

766
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:27,050
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

767
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:30,323
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

768
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:35,964
[gasps] Ah!

769
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:39,671
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

770
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,866
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

771
00:45:45,978 --> 00:45:47,912
I can make a little turn on dirt.

772
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,413
You think?

773
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:53,941
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

774
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,487
Hey, <i>ése!</i>
You need a new paint job, man!

775
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:59,524
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

776
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,957
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

777
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:06,487
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

778
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:08,157
Nah, not me, Flo.

779
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:10,701
I'm on one of them there special diets.

780
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:15,365
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

781
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:18,205
"You race like you fix roads."

782
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:23,044
[grunting] I'll show him.
[grunting] I will show him!

783
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,724
- [tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

784
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:39,423
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

785
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,192
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

786
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,998
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

787
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:49,097
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

788
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:55,443
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

789
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,551
Wow.

790
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,590
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

791
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:16,862
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

792
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes! Uh, amazing!

793
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:23,067
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

794
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:27,339
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

795
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,972
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

796
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:34,178
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

797
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:36,448
<i>[Italian] È bellissima!</i> It's beautiful!

798
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,252
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

799
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:42,490
Boy, I tell you what.

800
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:45,394
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

801
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:47,125
Doc, look at this!

802
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:50,133
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

803
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:53,694
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

804
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:56,741
Guido, look at Luigi!

805
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:59,071
This is <i>fantastico!</i>

806
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:02,602
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

807
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:06,981
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

808
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:10,349
That crazy old devil woman.

809
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:14,223
[sighs] Oh!

810
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:16,124
She's right!

811
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:17,752
- Ah!
- Guido!

812
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:21,595
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

813
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:26,668
Well, now... where the heck is he?

814
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,741
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

815
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:39,181
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

816
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,617
and asked me if he could
come down here.

817
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:44,087
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

818
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:46,989
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

819
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:49,984
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

820
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:56,156
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

821
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,633
I'll keep an eye on him.

822
00:48:57,703 --> 00:49:01,605
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

823
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:06,073
[engine revving]

824
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,439
[screaming]

825
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,246
[spitting]

826
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,455
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

827
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,253
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

828
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:24,659
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

829
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,222
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

830
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,360
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

831
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:34,530
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

832
00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:36,267
I'll put it simple.

833
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:40,505
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

834
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,984
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

835
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:48,849
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

836
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,515
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

837
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:58,728
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

838
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:01,796
[groans]

839
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,305
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

840
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,565
Hmm...

841
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:12,701
Whoa!

842
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,513
- Oh!
- [car crashing]

843
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:20,941
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

844
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:25,888
[screaming] Ow!

845
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:30,590
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

846
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:33,756
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

847
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:37,233
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

848
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:41,238
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

849
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:51,674
- Oh, Guido, <i>è bellissimo!</i>
- <i>Che cosa?</i>

850
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,119
- It looks great! This is great!
- <i>Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

851
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,646
[grunts, passes gas]

852
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,714
Oh, Lord.

853
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,419
- [chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

854
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:04,655
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

855
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:08,028
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

856
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,932
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

857
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:13,470
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

858
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:16,234
[groaning] Oh...

859
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:18,970
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

860
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:21,604
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

861
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,945
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

862
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,314
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

863
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,410
You make-a such a nice new road.

864
00:51:29,488 --> 00:51:32,150
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

865
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:33,816
Even though you not a Ferrari.

866
00:51:33,892 --> 00:51:37,988
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

867
00:51:38,063 --> 00:51:41,931
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

868
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,527
[chuckling] I like your style, eh?

869
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:49,165
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

870
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,699
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

871
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,438
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

872
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:56,640
Ramone, Ramone!

873
00:51:56,715 --> 00:51:58,808
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

874
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:01,876
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

875
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:05,582
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

876
00:52:05,657 --> 00:52:10,356
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

877
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:13,295
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

878
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:14,627
[exhales deeply]

879
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:15,859
Ah!

880
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:18,061
Stop! Let me...

881
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:22,304
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

882
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:24,399
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

883
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:27,809
Stop, stop! That's cold!

884
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:30,370
Help! Please! Stop!

885
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:33,815
- [coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

886
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:36,315
What was that for?

887
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,515
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

888
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,080
If you do, you gotta be clean.

889
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,683
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

890
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:44,490
What, I...? I don't get it.

891
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:47,157
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

892
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:50,463
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

893
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:55,165
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

894
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,108
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

895
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,577
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

896
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:04,911
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

897
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:08,180
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

898
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:11,711
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

899
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,920
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

900
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:19,361
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

901
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,095
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

902
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:26,537
Cone number one, if you want.

903
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,005
Oh...

904
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:34,873
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

905
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:38,040
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

906
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:40,277
[both chuckle]

907
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,952
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

908
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:46,650
Gonna... Yeah.

909
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:53,990
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [gasps]

910
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,555
Good-lookin' girl.

911
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:58,933
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

912
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:02,496
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

913
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:06,076
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

914
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:10,274
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

915
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:14,512
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

916
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:18,147
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

917
00:54:18,223 --> 00:54:20,521
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

918
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,355
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

919
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:25,419
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

920
00:54:25,497 --> 00:54:27,829
I can handle anything.

921
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:32,734
- [whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

922
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:36,531
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

923
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:39,042
- [tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

924
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,103
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

925
00:54:43,181 --> 00:54:45,012
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

926
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:47,985
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

927
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:49,486
Wait, Mater!

928
00:54:51,256 --> 00:54:52,621
OK, here's what you do.

929
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:56,092
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

930
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:58,652
And they do the rest. Watch this.

931
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,535
- [honking loudly]
- Oh!

932
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:12,804
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

933
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:16,677
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

934
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:19,649
[laughing loudly]

935
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:22,846
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

936
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:26,721
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

937
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,385
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

938
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:34,957
- [honking]
- Oh!

939
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:38,628
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

940
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,604
[gas sloshing, backfiring]

941
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:45,666
[laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

942
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:47,507
Oh, your turn, bud.

943
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,979
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

944
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:52,278
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

945
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,339
[clucking]

946
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:56,819
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

947
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,797
[snoring]

948
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,960
- [revving engine]
- Oh!

949
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,400
[all exclaiming and mooing]

950
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,320
[all gurgling]

951
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,440
[all backfiring]

952
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,320
[angry mooing]

953
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,160
[mooing]

954
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,840
That's Frank.

955
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,960
- [bellowing angrily]
- [shouting]

956
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,720
- [mooing]
- [engine revving]

957
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,320
[Mater laughing]

958
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,120
Run!

959
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
- Here he comes, look out!
- [bellowing]

960
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,800
[laughing] Whoa!

961
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,400
[screaming]

962
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,800
Run! He's gonna get ya!

963
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,160
[Mater laughing]

964
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,240
Oh! Customers!

965
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,960
Oh!

966
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,320
Ah, no, no, no.

967
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,160
Oof! Oh!

968
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,600
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

969
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,160
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

970
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,520
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

971
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,520
Oh, yeah... yeah.

972
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,680
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

973
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,960
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

974
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Oh...

975
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,360
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

976
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,720
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

977
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,680
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

978
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,480
- Where, where?
- [laughing]

979
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,160
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

980
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,400
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

981
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,640
- Way.
- Come on, look...

982
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,160
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

983
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,840
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

984
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,800
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

985
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

986
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,480
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

987
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,560
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

988
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,920
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

989
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,920
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

990
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,120
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

991
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,840
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

992
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,320

[chuckling] He's nuts.

999
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,680
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

1000
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,240
Just need to know where I've been.

1001
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,440
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

1002
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,480
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

1003
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,800
[chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

1004
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,400
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

1005
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,640
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1006
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,040
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1007
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,160
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

1008
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,760
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

1010
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,840
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

1011
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,040
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

1012
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,480
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

1013
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,720
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

1014
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,760
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1015
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,440
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1016
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,320
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

1017
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,160
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

1018
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,200
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

1019

Doc was a famous racecar!

And you know what?

1153
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,120
It never felt... happy.

1154
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,880
Yeah. I mean... really?

1155
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,680
Yeah. So I left California.

1156
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,040
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1157
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,560

01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,440
[chuckling] I'll say.

1325
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,720
[purring] Ka-chow.

1326
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,320
You're gonna fit right in
in California.

1327
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,320
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.

1328
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,200
Yeah, everybody except one.

1329
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,440
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1330
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,560
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1331
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,840
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1332
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,200
[# The Chords: <i>Sh-Boom</i>]

1333
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,600
[gasping] They fixed their neon!

1334
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:28,040
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]

1335
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,680
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

1336
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,680
Just like in its heyday, right?

1337
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,120
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1338
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,120
[chuckling]

1339
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,960
Shall we cruise?

1340
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,360
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1341
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,920
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1342
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,320
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1343
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,240
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1344
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,680
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1345
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,040
[mooing]

1346
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,520
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1347
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,920
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1348
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,400
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1349
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,560
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

1350
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,040
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1351
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,400
Good evenin', you two.

1352
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:03,160
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1353
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,080
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1354
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,800
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1355
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,480
Not that. That.

1356
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:19,600
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1357
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,960
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1358
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,680
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1359
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,920
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1360
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,960
[all gasp]

1361
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,640
It's the ghostlight!

1362
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,320
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1363
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,680
McQueen, over here!

1364
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,480
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1365
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,680
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1366
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,480
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1367
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,560
[Sally] Stickers!

1368
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,800
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1369
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,360
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1370
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,600
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1371
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,280
Sally! Sally!

1372
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,400
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1373
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,200
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1374
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,680
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [horn honking]

1375
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:05,240
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1376
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:08,680
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1377
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,640
[chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1378
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,440
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1379
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,360
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1380
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,040
<i>[Harv] Is that the world's</i>
<i>fastest racing machine?</i>

1381
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,640
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1382
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,200
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1383
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,520
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1384
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,840
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1385
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,760
- Harv?
- Come on!

1386
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,560
- <i>Kid, I'm over here!</i>
- How you doin', buddy?

1387
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,280
<i>My star client disappears</i>
<i>off the face of the earth!</i>

1388
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,560
- <i>How do you think I'm doing?</i>
- I can explain.

1389
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:47,040
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!</i>
<i>Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1390
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,160
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!</i>
<i>What do you need me for?</i>

1391
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,720
<i>That's just a figure of speech,</i>
<i>by the way. You signed a contract.</i>

1392
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,080
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I can't even find you on my GPS.</i>

1393
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,680
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1394
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,960
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- <i>Yeah, that's great, kid.</i>

1395
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,200
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1396
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,120
<i>While the world's been trying to</i>
<i>find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1397
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,880
- <i>Who are they gonna woo?</i>
- Chick!

1398
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,600
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out</i>
<i>what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1399
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,840
- <i>Show us the thunder!</i>
- <i>You want thunder?</i>

1400
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,520
<i>You want thunder?</i>
<i>Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1401
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,880
- Hey, that's my bit!
- <i>You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1402
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,920
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,</i>
<i>or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1403
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,720
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1404
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,600
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1405
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,960
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!</i>
<i>You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1406
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,880
Sally, I... I want you to...

1407
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,600
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1408
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,960
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1409
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,040
[groans, chuckles]

1410
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:54,320
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1411
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,680
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1412
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,960
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1413
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,760
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1414
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,080
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1415
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,480
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1416
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,640
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1417
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,960
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1418
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,120
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1419
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,720
- <i>Come on, get in the trailer.</i>
- Where's the old McQueen?

1420
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,160
- The bolt!
- <i>That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1421
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,920
<i>You're a big shining star.</i>
<i>You're a superstar.</i>

1422
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,320
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1423
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,360
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1424
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,120
[engine starts]

1425
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,400
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1426
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,920
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1427
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,400
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1428
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,600
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1429
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,360
Best for everyone or best for you?

1430
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,680
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1431
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,560
[light buzzing]

1432
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,560
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1433
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,920
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1434
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,240
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1435
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,760
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1436
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,400
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1437
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,800
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1438
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,440
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1439
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,840
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1440
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,160
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1441
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:04,200
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1442
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,640
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1443
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:10,800
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1444
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,480
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1445
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,680
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1446
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,840
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1447
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:21,880
[Mia] He's hot!

1448
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,640
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1449
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,800
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1450
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,400
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1451
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,400
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1452
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,240
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1453
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,440
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1454
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,480
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1455
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,480
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1456
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,800
[guard] Sorry, pal.

1457
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:54,120
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1458
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,720
I am speed.

1459
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,360
[cars whizzing]

1460
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,640
Victory.

1461
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,840
One winner, two losers.

1462
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,880
[engine revving]

1463
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:10,480
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1464
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,120
[birds singing]

1465
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,600
[knock on door]

1466
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,240
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1467
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:20,040
[gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1468
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,280
[indistinct chatter]

1469
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,200
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1470
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,880
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1471
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,360
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1472
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,800
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1473
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,160
[all shouting]

1474
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,960
[gulping]

1475
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,480
Uh-oh

1476
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,120
- [cheering, laughing]
- [giggling]

1477
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,320
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1478
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,720
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1479
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,920
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1480
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,400
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1481
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,520
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1482
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,800
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1483
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,040
[chuckling]

1484
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,440
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1485
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,400
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1486
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,480
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1487
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,720
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1488
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,600
Agh! Shoot!

1489
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,840
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1490
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,000
[crowd cheering]

1491
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,680
Come on, you can do it!

1492
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,760
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1493
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,160
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1494
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,480
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1495
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,800
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1496
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,280
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1497
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,080
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1498
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,440
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1499
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,360
- [soft music]
- [birds singing]

1500
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,800
[breaks squealing]

1501
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,920
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1502
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,040
[all gasp]

1503
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,520
[chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1504
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,120
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [all laugh]

1505
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,200
[groans]

1506
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,360
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1507
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,840
I don't think I...

1508
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,640
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1509
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,400
Doc?

1510
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,720
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1511
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,560
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1512
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,520
You said you'd never come back.

1513
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,200
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1514
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,160
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1515
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,120
[chuckles]

1516
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,640
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1517
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:27,000
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1518
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,040
Now, get back out there!

1519
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,280
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1520
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,640
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1521
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,880
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1522
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,640
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1523
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,120
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1524
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,760
[murmuring]

1525
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,720
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1526
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,560
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1527
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,240
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1528
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,720
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1529
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,480
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1530
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,880
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1531
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,480
[crowd cheering]

1532
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,560
<i>[Bob] Wow, this is history</i>
<i>in the making.</i>

1533
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,560
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend</i>
<i>in over 50 years!</i>

1534
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,000
Hey, Doc!

1535
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:29,240
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1536
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,960
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1537
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,920
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1538
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,880
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1539
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,560
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1540
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:48,520
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1541
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,040
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1542
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,120
[all laugh]

1543
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,800
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?</i>
<i>Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1544
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,040
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1545
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,280
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1546
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,120
What do you think of this?

1547
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,360
- [tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1548
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,960
What?

1549
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,840
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1550
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,880
- [laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1551
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,920
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1552
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,800
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1553
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,040
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1554
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,880
[chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1555
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,880
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1556
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,400
No, you don't.

1557
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,400
[tire blows]

1558
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,480
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1559
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,000
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1560
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,360
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1561
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,400
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1562
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,440
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1563
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,640
Guido! It's time.

1564
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:28,040
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1565
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,120
[air wrench whirring]

1566
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,560
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1567
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,360
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1568
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,960
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1569
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,760
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1570
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,880
- Yeah, baby!
- [all hollering]

1571
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,320
<i>[Darrell] He's back in!</i>

1572
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,640
Peet stop.

1573
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,040
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1574
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,360
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1575
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,800
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1576
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,400
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1577
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,760
This is it, kiddo.

1578
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,320
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1579
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,840
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1580
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,280
- Go!
- [revving]

1581
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,120
We'll see about that!

1582
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,200
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1583
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:41,200
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1584
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,360
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1585
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,400
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1586
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:02,120
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1587
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,680
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1588
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,880
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1589
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,160
[grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1590
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,400
- Oh, no!
- [crowd gasps]

1591
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,840
[breaks screeching]

1592
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,600
[engine idling]

1593
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,120
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1594
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,920
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1595
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,360
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1596
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,680
[grunting, moaning]

1597
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,120
What are you doin', kid?

1598
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,440
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1599
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,600
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1600
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,280
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1601
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,400
It's just an empty cup.

1602
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,080
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1603
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,800
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1604
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,200
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1605
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,960
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1606
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,280
- That's what I call racin'.
- [sobbing]

1607
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,840
[laughing]

1608
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,840
[crowd cheers wildly]

1609
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:56,320
- <i>Bravo il mio amico!</i>
- Way to go, buddy!

1610
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,960
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1611
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,560
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1612
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:09,040
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1613
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,520
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1614
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,560
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1615
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,760
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1616
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,080
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1617
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,720
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1618
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,120
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1619
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,640
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1620
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,320
- Boo!
- Boo!

1621
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:32,520
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1622
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,680
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1623
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,080
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1624
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:47,920
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1625
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
You're The King! Yeah!

1626
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,760
[crowd cheers]

1627
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,320
[laughing and cheering]

1628
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,880
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1629
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,720
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1630
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,560
Thanks, Doc.

1631
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,040
Hey, Lightnin'.

1632
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:16,800
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1633
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,720
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1634
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,560
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1635
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,720
But I didn't win.

1636
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,480
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1637
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,240
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1638
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,480
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [all laugh]

1639
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,280
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1640
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,080
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1641
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,360
