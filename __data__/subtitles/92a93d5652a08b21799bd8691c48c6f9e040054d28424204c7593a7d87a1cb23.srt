1
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,791
Books. Okay. Uh, yeah.

2
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,375
Absolutely.

3
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,500
And...

4
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,125
I'm not gonna read it.

5
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,500
I'll get it.

6
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,083
Okay, Mom.

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,041
- Hi.
- Hello.

8
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,392
Lea dropped it off this morning.

9
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,000
She is so happy it's yours.

10
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,883
I know exactly
where I'm gonna put it.

11
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,541
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
- Thank you!

12
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,916
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,250
So Daniel got her this, like, all-access
backstage pass and a VIP meet and greet

14
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,291
with that boy band she used to like,
August Moon.

15
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,958
Oh, yeah, they're cute.

16
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,101
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds fun, Izz.

17
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,875
You get to meet August Moon?

18
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,278
I'm not really into them anymore.

19
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:07,291
Now it's more about, like, aggressively
talented female singer-songwriters.

20
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,184
- Which I think is great.
- Right, of course, of course.

21
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,333
Oh, they're here.

22
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,500
Hi.

23
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,875
- Hey. -What's up?
- Hi.

24
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,309
- Oh, my God, you guys took forever.
- Hey.

25
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,125
VIP meet and greet,
all-access backstage pass,

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,750
her friends are coming,

27
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,083
- and, oh, yeah, Eva's going, too.
- Ugh.

28
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,833
- Hi. You look so cute.
- Hi. -Thank you.

30
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,392
- So you're going camping alone?
- Yes.

31
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,559
- And why would you do that?
- Seriously? Why wouldn't I do that?

32
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,041
Bears? Serial killers?

33
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,166
Dirt?

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,041
I'm looking forward to it.

35
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,833
Have a little me time,
process the last 20 years.

36
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,083
And what if I could just be the sort of
person that goes camping by herself?

37
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,625
What if all I need is Izz

38
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,333
and my artists and my gallery
and my friends?

39
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,500
- Okay. Well, is that what you want?
- Maybe that's all I want.

40
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,416
But is it?

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,083
I'm going camping to find out, right?

42
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,666
Speaking of things you want,
your 40th birthday party.

43
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,041
I don't need a party.

44
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,517
Thank you. I love you. Don't need it.

45
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,916
Stop it. You're having a party.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,958
It's nonnegotiable.

47
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,392
Mom, if you get lonely,
promise you'll text me, okay?

48
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,333
I'm gonna be fine, baby.

49
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,458
I just want you to be happy
and have the best time.

50
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,666
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,916
No, but, like...
but, like, really, though.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,750
What is going on?
Are you guys in an alliance or something?

53
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,083
Just focus on being selfish teenagers,
all right?

54
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,309
Oh, my God, August Moon!

55
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,666
- Ugh, so... - Seventh grade!
- So seventh grade!

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,166
- Haters gonna hate, Izz.
- Are they?

57
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,892
Just let that shit fly by.

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,750
And... we made it.

59
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,184
- Let's go guys.
- Okay, trunk should be open.

60
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,809
Let me know if you need help.

61
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,291
Okay. We will.

62
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,416
There she is.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,750
- Hey, Solène.
- Hi, Eva.

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,083
How are you?

65
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,000
- Oh, I'm well, thank you.
- You look really...

66
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,000
- I like your-your dress.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,500
Hello.

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,642
Hey, so, um, I'm gonna have
my phone on airplane mode,

69
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,142
but I'm gonna check it, like,
every three hours.

70
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,666
- You can make it four. Live a little.
- Okay.

71
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,625
Have so much fun and, you know,
good stupid, not stupid stupid.

72
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,892
- Yes, I know. Okay, I love you.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

73
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,226
- Thanks, Solène.
- Mwah. Mwah. -I love you.

74
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,517
- Love you so much. Mwah.
- Bye, Solène. Thank you. Love you, too.

75
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,541
Bye. Have so much fun.

76
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,791
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad. -Hey.

77
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,184
- Hi! -
- Hey, baby.

78
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,101
- How are you? Ready for some fun?
- I'm... Yeah.

79
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,125
- Georgia, Zeke, what's up?
- Oh, hey, Eva.

80
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,500
Hey.

81
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,708
Thank you for dropping them off.

83
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,708
I mean, I had to, right?

84
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,892
So are these guys, like,
so stoked for this trip or what?

85
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,500
"Stoked"? Very.

86
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,625
- Cool.
- Mm.

87
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,708
Cool, cool, cool.

88
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,583
So I got to... get to...

89
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,250
Yeah, real quick, I just wanted to, uh,
you know, invite you over sometime.

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,791
Come let us make you dinner.

91
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,708
Eva's a great cook.

92
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,000
That's...

93
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,000
- Or pickleball, you know?
- Um...

94
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,642
Come play pickleball.
You've heard of pickleball, right?

95
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,083
- Yes.
- It's so much fun.

96
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,476
- You know...
- You don't even have to be athletic.

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,250
You can pick it up in, like...

98
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,517
Eva's really good. She can teach you.

99
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,125
Yeah, I don't... I'm pretty bu...
I just, I got to go.

100
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,750
- Okay. Good. Great.
- I got to go.

101
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,666
Uh, enjoy your camping trip.

102
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,208
- Enjoy Coachella.
- Will do.

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,000
<i>No, I can't drive them
to your house.</i>

104
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, I have other things going on.

105
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,875
I got a life. I got plans.

106
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,934
I'm doing stuff this weekend
you can't even imagine.

107
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,916
I'm doing stuff
you could never do, Daniel.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,083
You like my outfit? You do?

109
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,642
Oh, my God, that means the world to me.

110
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,875
That is... that makes me feel
so much better

111
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,833
about the fact that
you fucking destroyed my life.

112
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,125
Sol!

113
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,583
- Sol, wait up.
- Oh.

114
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,708
Did you not get my texts?

115
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,767
- I'm in airplane mode. What's going on?
- Hi.

116
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,101
- What... Are you okay?
- Yeah, no. It's all good. It's all good.

117
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,791
- What's happening? What's...
- I can't do the trip now.

118
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,795
- Daniel...
- My whole merger thing just blew up.

119
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,833
I... S-Sol, can you please
take them to Coachella?

120
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,934
- Everything's paid for, all the hotels, the meals.
- What?

121
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,184
- It's all set.
- Are you kidding me?

122
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,833
They're booking tickets to Houston.
I... It's happening right now.

123
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,708
- Let Eva take them.
- Eva's coming with me.

124
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,041
Of course she is.

125
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,875
Come on, we... we really got to go.

126
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,198
- We got to go.
- Please. Please, please, please, please.

127
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,250
Okay.

128
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,708
- Yes?
- Yes.

129
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,684
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Okay, I'm going to get my sandals, Izz.

130
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,166
- Sol, I owe you. I do. I know.
- Yeah, you do. You do.

131
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,559
- Okay, have fun, guys.
- Mom. Mom.

132
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,208
- Hey, can you...
- Izzy, I love you.

133
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,833
I'm going to take 30 seconds,
and I'm going to get my sandals.

134
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,316
Okay, okay.

135
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,750
Stay hydrated.

136
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,333
O-Okay. Okay, okay.

137
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,791
Uh, VIP entrance is by <i>Lodestar?</i>

138
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,625
- Lodestar is...?
- Oh, wait, y'all.

139
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,934
- I got the stage lineup.
- St. Vincent is about to play. Let's go!

140
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,434
- Let's go. Come on.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys, w-wait.

141
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,017
- Really fast, really fast.
- Okay, sorry, sorry.

142
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,059
- Look after one another. And please check your texts.
- Yes.

143
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,434
- We're good. We're good.
- Come on, come on. Let's go!

144
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,767
- Okay. Bye.
- Come on. Bye. -Bye, Solène!

145
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,684
- Love you. - Whoo!
- Don't be stupid stupid!

146
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,541
We won't!

147
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,958
Okay.

148
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,958
- Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,916
- Do you mind if I...
- Uh, no, please.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,375
Thank you.

151
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,750
This your first time?

152
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,958
- Sorry?
- Getting Mooned.

153
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,041
What?

154
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,541
Once a Moonhead, always a Moonhead.

155
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,905
I'm here with my daughter and...

156
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,416
So which one is your favorite?

157
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,583
Oh, sorry.

158
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,583
Which one is your "daughter's" favorite?

159
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,250
No, I...

160
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,375
Mine's Adrian.

161
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,166
I mean, just look at him.

162
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,708
He's such a hottie.

163
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,791
Uh, actually, do you know
where the bathroom is?

164
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,458
Uh, yeah. Right out there.

165
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,517
- The VIP ones are on the right.
- On the right?

166
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

167
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,833
- Have a good one.
- See ya.

168
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh, uh, just a second.

169
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,541
Okay.

170
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,541
Do you mind?

172
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, you... you want to use the bathroom.

173
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,958
Yeah. Um, thanks.

174
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,125
Yeah.

175
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,458
Okay.

176
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,375
Hi again.

177
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Are you a part of that ASMR community
that gets off on listening to people pee?

178
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,833
No, I wasn't...

179
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,184
Because I don't think
you can just go around assuming...

180
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,666
- It's actually my trailer.
- What?

181
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,710
It's not literally mine.
You know, I don't own it.

182
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,583
- This is your trailer?
- Yeah.

183
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,375
I'm in a band. We're performing
on the main stage in an hour.

184
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,833
I'm Hayes Campbell.

185
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,541
August Moon?

186
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,833
Yeah.

187
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,125
I absolutely know who you are.

188
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,916
Um, anyway...

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,250
I'll...

190
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,500
Hey, you know, if you wanted to, um...

191
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,875
I don't know, hang out.

192
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,208
- Hang out?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,125
Do you want a drink?

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,875
- Uh...
- I mean, I've got all the, uh, the-the sodas,

195
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
the healthy ones, the not-so-healthy ones.

196
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,416
Um... there's kombucha.

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,333
Which, in case you never tried it,
it's like kind of a... a salad dressing.

198
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,333
Uh, but we also have beer,
we have wine, um, um, vodka...

199
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,500
Um, I'm actually with
my daughter for the...

200
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,625
August Moon meet and greet, and,
uh, I'm driving, so I don't think it's...

201
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,291
Your daughter,
she's, um, an August Moon fan?

202
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,583
Sh-She was.

203
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,458
- Ouch.
- Very sorry.

204
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:44,333
I-I do think she will be, um...
a future nostalgic fan,

205
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,125
but at this moment, today, right now,

206
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,041
you are so "seventh grade."

207
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,333
Damn.

208
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,458
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

209
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,625
My, uh, daughter's father bought
the tickets for the meet and greet,

210
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,750
and, um, he was
supposed to be here with her.

211
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,958
He...

212
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,125
Anyway, uh, canceled last minute.
Now I'm here...

213
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,875
So her father, not your husband?

214
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,166
Well, he was my husband,
but now he's just her father.

215
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,333
Mm.

216
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,791
Hayes, I think
they're almost ready for you.

217
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Who are you?

218
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,434
It's okay, Desmond.

219
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,726
- She's, uh, a friend. -
- Knock, knock, Hayes.

220
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,458
- It's showtime.
- Okay.

221
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,125
- Um, okay, so do you need me to dress you?
- Ha.

222
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,250
No. I'm fine, Jodie.

223
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,875
- Okay. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

224
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,250
- All right.
- Thanks, Jodie.

225
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,541
Yeah, mm-hmm.

226
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,708
That was Jodie.

227
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,583
- Jodie.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,708
Do you need someone to help dress you?

229
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,625
- On special occasions, yeah, sometimes.
- Mm.

230
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,791
Ah.

231
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,791
- I'm gonna...
- Oh, excuse me.

232
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,958
I'll just...

233
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,708
We've got news.

234
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,500
We got the TAG Heuer campaign.

235
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,142
- Oh.
- And he wants you to wear a watch.

236
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,309
- Great.
- So let's take this off.

237
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,434
- Let's get a look at this. And you need...
- Okay, yeah.

238
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,416
- These off? Okay.
- Yes, let's take those off.

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,208
Uh, James?

240
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,750
This is gonna be the best option.

241
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,875
Okay.

242
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,291
Wow.

243
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,541
Christ, get ahold of yourself, Solène.

244
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,791
- Mom. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, hi.

245
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,059
But, hey, but you don't understand.

246
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,517
St. Vincent was killing it.
We couldn't leave.

247
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,184
- No, it truly was transcendent.
- Okay, great. Let's just do...

248
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,434
- Oh, can we go back, really quick?
- We got to do this first, baby.

249
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay, I... Wh-Why?

250
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,392
Because your dad paid
a lot of money for this.

251
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm-I'm so grateful for that,
but August Moon is just, like, so...

252
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,375
Seventh grade.

253
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,166
N... No.

254
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,666
Sorry, I... Thank you.

255
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,875
I...

256
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,250
Epic. Yeah.

257
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,875
She was gonna say, "August
Moon is so epic." -"Epic"? Okay.

258
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,166
Yeah. Hey there.

259
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,434
I'm Zeke Randall,
Campbell Hall High School class treasurer.

260
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,000
It's truly an honor to meet you.

261
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,434
It's a pleasure to meet you.

262
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,958
- Hey.
- Hi.

263
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,083
- I love your shirt. There you go.
- Thank you.

264
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,767
Could you just, like, yeah,
could you just sign that for me?

265
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,291
Yeah, thanks.

266
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,091
- Can I take a picture?
- Yes, please.

267
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,583
Hey.

268
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,791
- Hi.
- I'm... uh, it-it's for, uh, it's for Izz... it's for Izzy.

269
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,125
- Izzy. All right.
- Yeah.

270
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,625
Two Z's?

271
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,583
- Uh, yeah, two Z's.
- Two Z's.

272
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,184
And, Rory, I just...
I have to say, you're...

273
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,333
Rory's my favorite, so it's like...

274
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,500
- Thank you.
- Really, yeah.

275
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,791
Thanks. Ah.

276
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,635
You know, I don't think
I ever got your name.

277
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,351
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, I'm good. Nice to meet you.

278
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,166
- Uh, Zeke. Yeah.
- Zeke?

279
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,291
Thank you so much.

280
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,708
Hi. Wh-What's happening?

281
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,250
- Do you guys...
- Oh, we met earlier.

282
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,333
- Oh.
- In line for the bathroom.

283
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,666
Yes.

284
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,375
And you must be the daughter.

285
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,458
Uh, yeah, Izzy, yeah.

286
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,458
- And, uh, this is...
- I'm, um...

287
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,250
Well, it's on the tip of my tongue,
I swear.

288
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,726
I mean, I literally forgot my own name.

289
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,000
- It's Georgia. It's Georgia.
- My name is Georgia.

290
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,625
Nice to meet you, Georgia.

291
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,833
Uh, we've totally taken up
enough of your time.

292
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,559
- Thank you so much.
- Aren't you gonna introduce me?

293
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,416
Oliver Hoyt-Knight, this is Izzy,
this is Georgia, Zeke...

294
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,541
Hey.

295
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,666
And...

296
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,333
still don't know your name.

297
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm Solène.

298
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,226
Oh, is that, uh, is that French?

299
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,500
Uh, just French grandparents.

300
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,166
Solène, the big sister, I'm guessing?

301
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,291
Okay. Solène the mom.

302
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,833
Yes, my mom.

303
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,541
Uh, you don't look like my mom.

304
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,875
- Okay.
- Hey, now, so...

305
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,416
- It's just a fact. She's Black.
- She is Black.

306
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,833
She actually owns
a contemporary art gallery in Silver Lake.

307
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,934
- You guys should, like, come visit sometime.
- I love art.

308
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,476
Yeah, in fact, wherever we go,
while everyone else is too hungover

309
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,250
to get out of bed,
Hayesy is out and about exploring.

310
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,934
- Right? He's got a special penchant for art museums.
- Guys, I'm sorry.

311
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,166
You need to go. I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,625
Uh, duty calls.

313
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,908
Thank you. Thank you.

314
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,434
- Thank you. -Good meeting you guys.
- Nice meeting you.

315
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,791
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye. -Bye.

316
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,291
Okay. Now we go.

317
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,708
Like that. Yeah.

318
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,125
What's up, Coachella?!

319
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,041
Thank you, guys!

320
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,333
Let's give it up for our band!

321
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,916
Are you having a good time?

322
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:57,125
Oh, we're so honored to be here
on this iconic stage.

323
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,833
Thank you so much for coming.

324
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,125
We appreciate all of you.

325
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,000
You guys ready?

326
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,041
Okay. Sorry, one second, guys. One second.

327
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,291
Cut it.

328
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,916
Right now?

329
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,791
- Right now?
- Yeah, definitely.

330
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,288
I'm sorry about that, guys.

331
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,708
Uh, slight change of plan.

332
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,416
I met someone tonight.

333
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,541
And I feel a little inspired.

334
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,375
Not planning on doing this, but...

335
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,750
this one's called "Closer."

336
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,851
<i>So?</i>

337
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,375
- So?
- How's it feel to be 40?

338
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,059
- Oh, there he goes.
- Honey, really? Okay. -

339
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,000
What? It's a milestone.

340
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,083
It is.

341
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,083
- It is.
- It's a good question.

342
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,000
Um, it feels very, very sweet.

343
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,333
I don't know.
I think I just feel really grateful.

344
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,250
I'm glad to be here.
I'm grateful to be here.

345
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,666
Maybe confusing.

346
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,500
You know?

347
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,934
Um, I had Izzy when I was so young,

348
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,625
so I feel like I, like, disconnected
from my age, uh, in my 20s.

349
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,059
I mean, I was just out of college, you know?
- Sure.

350
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,500
- Do you get it?
- I think

351
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,208
you're not even a person until you hit 30.

352
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,375
I mean, just think about it, right?

353
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,291
And then you spend
the next ten years after that

354
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,041
trying to figure out
the type of person you want to be.

355
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,791
- That is profound.
- That is drunk.

356
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,101
Well, let's drink
a little bit more. Hear, hear.

357
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,291
To life experience.

358
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,255
- Yeah, let's put that spin on it.
- Hear, hear.

359
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,833
Hey, hey!

360
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,583
Birthday girl. Hi.

361
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,583
- Whew, you startled me there.
- Yeah, I know.

362
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,291
Hi, Todd.

363
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,916
Hi. Um...

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Listen, I just wanted to come over and say
that I-I really admire you.

365
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,041
- Oh.
- Uh, you've built a community

366
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,416
around art and inclusiveness.

367
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,291
It's just... that's so cool.

368
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,583
That's very sweet. Thank you.

369
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,958
So I teach high school science.

370
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,958
Oh, cool. What year are your students?

371
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,291
Oh, sophomores.

372
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,916
- My daughter's gonna be a senior.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,583
And divorce, I mean,
it's such an identify shift, right?

374
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,291
- Yeah.
- I totally get it.

375
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,333
I mean, who am I
if I'm not Jessica's husband?

376
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,708
Do you have any children?

377
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,791
I do.

378
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,916
That's my son Rosco.

379
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,666
Oh, he's so cute.

380
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,583
- Charlie.
- Uh-huh.

381
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,833
Copernicus.

382
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,833
Rupert.

383
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,791
How long ago did you guys split up?

384
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,166
"Split" is such a specific word.

385
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,375
I'm just gonna say it.

386
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,250
Uh, I would like you
to accompany me next week

387
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,375
to a restaurant for a meal of food.

388
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,875
It's been rocky for a while.

389
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,916
Let's put it that way.

390
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,875
Oh. Sorry.

391
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,666
It's her.

392
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,333
Hi, honey.

393
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,125
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

394
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,833
Solène. We need you up front.

395
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,500
Okay, okay. Just give me a second.

396
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,708
Really, Solène,
we need you up front, like, now.

397
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,958
Okay. Okay. Is everything all right?

398
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,166
Yeah, we just need you.

399
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,916
She really uses her inclusive space to...

400
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,375
Oh.

401
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,083
And there she is now.

402
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,541
Hey.

403
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,083
Hi.

404
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,583
I don't know if you remember me,
but we met in Coachella.

405
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,875
Yes, I remember you.

406
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,375
So you know each other.

407
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,750
Great. Um, can I get anyone anything?
Water? Coffee?

408
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,833
- Thank you. We're all right, Jeremy.
- Oh. Yeah.

409
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,166
Bye.

410
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,291
Wow.

411
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,750
Um...

412
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,916
This is a surprise.

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,916
I did some online sleuthing
for a Solène of Silver Lake,

414
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,583
and, uh, well, I have
this very large, empty flat in London

415
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:00,041
that, uh, desperately needs some artwork.

416
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,458
So I was thinking maybe you could, uh...

417
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,916
Okay. Um...

418
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,583
Why don't we start in the back
with the ceramics?

419
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,746
You know, I was hoping
you'd start with the ceramics.

420
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,708
Um...

421
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:18,458
So these pieces were thrown by a fantastic
potter we work with called Susan Hable.

422
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,500
- Mm. She threw them at the wall?
- Sh...

423
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,791
N-No. She...

424
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,791
That's what they call it when they do
the work on the, on the wheel.

425
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,666
It's called throwing.

426
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,791
- Right.
- Right.

427
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,458
Who is he?

428
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,333
That's Hayes Campbell
from August Moon.

429
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,083
Where have you been?

430
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,083
Being in my 30s, obviously.

431
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:41,125
The silhouettes of these pieces
echo Susan's fascination with, uh...

432
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,750
gesture and movement.

433
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah, I can see that.

434
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,541
Yeah, her work's very popular.

435
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,416
I'm sure.

436
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,125
Great. Well, I will, um... just...

437
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,208
take all of... all of these ones.

438
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,791
Sorry, what do you mean?

439
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,333
Oh, just-just everything
in this general area would be great.

440
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,458
- Claire.
- What's up?

441
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,791
So, um...

442
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,684
This client would like to buy
all these pieces.

443
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,333
Okay.

444
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,916
Hi, Claire.

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,958
Hey.

446
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

447
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,875
I'll get that all dealt with.

448
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,208
- That's Claire.
- Mm. Seems nice.

449
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:32,250
She's very nice.
She's very hardworking, competent, single.

450
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,083
Sorry, what are these ones over here?

451
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,333
These took my fancy.

452
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,684
Hayes, I love you!

453
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,083
Um...

454
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,916
These pieces are by a local artist,
Amanda Friedman.

455
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,916
Uh, she lives in Eagle Rock.

456
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,041
She chose to feature,
um, a strong light source.

457
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,375
Mm-hmm.

458
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,338
As if aliens had just, uh, landed.

459
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,541
Hmm.

460
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,375
These are shot on
a medium and large format camera on film.

461
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,875
No digital manipulation.

462
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,625
So cool. I'll take them all.

463
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,250
- What?
- If you could Bubble Wrap them or whatever,

464
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,291
and then I'll send someone over later
just to pick them up.

465
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,583
These bowls, by the way, these are lovely.

466
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,541
- Thank you.
- And the spaghetti tiles?

467
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,041
I mean, the detail I-is beautiful.

468
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,333
And whatever this is,
I want it in my home.

469
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,958
Honestly, uh...

470
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,458
I think I'll take all of it.

471
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,166
This is real art,
and these are real artists.

472
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,250
They take their work very seriously,
as do I.

473
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,500
They made it with a great deal of care,
and you're coming in here like...

474
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,750
I don't know...
Like you're buying apples or something.

475
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,083
Honestly, I've been looking
for art like this for so long,

476
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,541
and-and I genuinely connect with it,
and so...

477
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,708
I-I would really like to buy it,
if it's okay with you.

478
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

479
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,708
- Okay.
- And for the record,

480
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:58,375
you have never seen me buy apples before.

481
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,166
It's fucked up.

482
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,125
So?

483
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,166
So?

484
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,642
Are you gonna show me something else?

485
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,666
Don't you have a football stadium
to get to or a photo shoot to attend?

486
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,250
Well, um, what's-what's the day today?

487
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,541
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah, no, don't have any of those until Wednesday.

488
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,125
I actually would love to show you
some more art,

489
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,083
but you just bought
everything in the gallery.

490
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,916
Oh.

491
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,375
Well, that was incredibly rude of me.

492
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,250
Does that happen a lot?

493
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,333
Yeah.

494
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,375
Well, if you have nothing left to show me,

495
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,142
then I'm gonna have to go find
another art gallery

496
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,934
- owned by a different art dealer...
- Okay. Okay.

497
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,208
I have a friend.

498
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:48,250
She's an artist I like very much.
She has a warehouse in Glendale.

499
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,541
She's not there right now,
but I happen to have the key.

500
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,958
I have been dying to go to Glendale
for the longest time.

501
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,642
- You have no idea.
- Middle of nowhere Glendale?

502
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,125
The middle of nowhere is
my favorite place in the world.

503
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,934
Why don't you have your driver meet us
out back, and we'll go to Glendale.

504
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,458
I mean, we could just go in your car.

505
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,041
- Sorry about the clutter.
- Oh. Uh, yeah.

506
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,291
I'll get that out of your way. Okay, um...

507
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,250
- Okay, I'm in.
- Whoops.

508
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,916
- I can take that.
- Oh, thank you.

509
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
Yeah, sure. Where do you want me to...

510
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,208
- Just on the floor or...
- Floor?

511
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,875
- Oh, yeah, the back. Sure, okay.
- Okay.

512
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

513
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,041
Sorry about all this.

514
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,625
Oh.

515
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

516
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,291
And go.

517
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
- Yeah.
- Okay.

518
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,750
- Um...
- I'm coming up to the, uh, light.

519
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,892
So it's usually best if you just don't
look them in the eye.

520
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,041
Okay, great.
Just staring straight ahead.

521
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:42,541
They are really not noticing anything.

522
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,125
I think we're good.

523
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,333
That's kind of amazing.

524
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,583
Wow. You're a natural.

525
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,083
Hello.

526
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,166
Thanks.

527
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,250
- I like these.
- Ah.

528
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,833
Natrice Miller. Fantastic.

529
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,541
Is this a painting?

530
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,291
Yes, it is.

531
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,916
- What does it mean?
- It's a calendar.

532
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,500
- No, don't do that.
- Don't what?

533
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,903
Do you really want the lecture
about how art is subjective?

534
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,875
What do you see?

535
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,166
It's a grid. It's grid-like.

536
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,708
It's-it's-it's numerical.

537
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,166
Which means that...

538
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,375
Please. I-I've got nothing.

539
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:49,458
So the artist calls this piece
a self-portrait.

540
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,000
Now, what's she's showing is that

541
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:56,791
she's not some, uh, untouchable genius
in a rarefied space.

542
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,666
This is her life as an artist.

543
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,541
I find its honesty incredibly moving.

544
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,708
This piece is from my friend Sarah.

545
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,934
Um, she's sending all of these
to a gallery show in New York,

546
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,208
but she never sends this one.

547
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,583
Hmm, why's that?

548
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,583
Um, I don't know. She doesn't want to.

549
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,333
Wow.

550
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,583
What's it called?

551
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,541
<i>Unclose me.</i>

552
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,083
What do you feel when you look at it?

553
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,958
Everything.

554
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,708
- How did you meet Sarah?
- Uh...

555
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,833
Uh, in college. Freshman year.

556
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:51,250
She was, uh, blasting a Fiona Apple song
from her dorm room,

557
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,916
and I knew instantly we'd be friends.

558
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,708
Should we go?

559
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,333
And-and, um, college?

560
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,000
What'd you study?

561
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,875
Um, I was an art history major.

562
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,458
- Although I started out as premed.
- A doctor?

563
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:10,750
Well, I was an 18-year-old people pleaser
from New Jersey,

564
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,083
and my parents really liked the idea.

565
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,791
But then I...

566
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,583
took an art history class for the credits,
and I fell in love.

567
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,458
Anyway.

568
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,583
What about you? What's your life story?

569
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,333
I'm sorry, was that your life story?

570
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,916
Partly.

571
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Tell me, how does one find oneself
in a boy band?

572
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,833
Very random.

573
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,666
Uh, I auditioned.

574
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,916
Others did, too.

575
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,625
You know, we were just Polaroids
on a wall, really.

576
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,333
You know, you got Adrian,

577
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,875
million-dollar smile.

578
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,958
Rory, Aussie rebel.

579
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,583
Simon, brooding poet.

580
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:56,000
Ollie, you know,
Ollie's just got that swagger.

581
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,416
And what about Hayes?

582
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,666
Oh, I'm just English.

583
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,666
Just works a charm, really.

584
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,000
You know, the funny thing is, the same day
that I auditioned for the band,

585
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,500
I also auditioned to play Tiny Tim

586
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,208
in the Hackney Playhouse version
of <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

587
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,625
And in the end,
I didn't end up getting it.

588
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,875
You know, not tiny enough, apparently.

589
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,125
But I did get the boy band.

590
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,750
Had I got the play,
I would've done it, and...

591
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,416
someone else would've been me
in the band.

592
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,541
And, uh, I would've been...

593
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,833
I don't know what I would've been.

594
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,416
God, I'm starving. Are you hungry?

595
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,041
We should go get a bite to eat.

596
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,666
I...

597
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,916
I'm not sure.

598
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,416
What... what do you mean?

599
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,833
I'm not sure what we're doing here

600
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:57,291
at a boiling hot warehouse in Glendale,

601
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,625
asking about my major.

602
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,750
Well, I told you. I-I love Glendale.

603
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,958
I feel like I don't meet people like you
very often.

604
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,166
And most people think
they already know me.

605
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,333
Hayes Campbell.

606
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,791
It's not me.

607
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,416
I don't know. You didn't seem to care.

608
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:26,208
And for what it's worth,
I think we met in a very interesting way.

609
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:31,333
I think you're smart and, you know,

610
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,625
y-you're also just-just...
y-you're hot, or whatever.

611
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,916
"Hot"?

612
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,458
Or whatever.

613
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,291
So I guess what I'm doing here is...

614
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,208
just trying to get to know you better.

615
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,000
Well...

616
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,666
I do appreciate your honesty.

617
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,541
So what should we eat?

618
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:14,125
Uh, we could go back to my hotel
in Beverly Hills,

619
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,916
order some room service.

620
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,208
Uh, that's... kind of a drive.

621
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,434
- Yeah, no, I was just throwing out some options.
- Mm.

622
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,833
- I-I don't really know L.A.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

623
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,375
How about, um, All Time on Hillhurst?

624
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,916
That is Hayes Campbell.

625
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,000
Is that a popular spot?

626
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:39,375
Um, it's pretty popular, I guess. It's...

627
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,958
Okay, uh...

628
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,375
Actually, let's go to my house.

629
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,333
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

630
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,583
Sounds good.

631
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,166
Here we are.

632
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,166
Wow.

633
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,958
It's a little, uh, bit messy.

634
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,708
Izzy's packing for camp, so, uh...

635
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,583
It's perfect. It's, um... it's a home.

636
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,791
Thanks.

637
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,791
Daniel hated... uh, my ex,
hated it.

638
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,875
He called it a starter house.

639
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,375
But...

640
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,458
I always thought of it like a home, too.

641
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,958
- Oh, shit.
- Is everything okay?

642
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:39,416
Yeah, everything's fine, sort of. It's...

643
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,125
Ah. Past the expiration date?

644
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,958
You know, I usually find those dates
to be more of a suggestion.

645
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,916
No, no, it's just... it's...
My fridge is broken again.

646
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,625
So, um, I was just seeing
how long it's been down.

647
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,166
- But if you just want to go, then I-I...
- Oh, no. Hell no.

648
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,226
- Give it to me. Let me have a taste, yeah.
- What?

649
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,416
Oh, no, I mean, this has definitely got,
like, a week left in it for sure.

650
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,750
Oh, my God!

651
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,791
No, it doesn't.

652
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,708
Why would you do that?

653
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,250
No, that's yours.

654
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,625
Okay, uh, yeah.

655
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,708
Um... put me to work.

656
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,250
What? No. I'm not gonna let you smell-test
the contents of my refrigerator.

657
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,833
Woman, time is a-wasting. Put me to work.

658
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,767
- It would be my honor.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

659
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,916
Uh, cooler from the garage,
we fill it with ice,

660
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,458
sort it into two categories:
salvageable and hazmat.

661
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,916
Okay, got it.

662
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,333
Oh, um, those sandwiches.

663
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,833
Do we still get those or...?

664
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,500
Let me get the cooler.

665
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,333
- Tomato?
- Yes.

666
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,708
Thank you.

667
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,250
Your daughter, you, uh, close?

668
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,416
Yeah, we are.

669
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:00,458
I mean, she is my daughter
and I am her mother,

670
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:04,583
so we do drive each other
up a wall sometimes, but, um...

671
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,958
but yeah.

672
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,125
She's my favorite person.

673
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,208
So what about you?

674
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,767
You and your parents, are you guys close?

675
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,291
Oh. No, not really.

676
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,916
I mean, they split up
when I was very young.

677
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,791
Mum remarried to, uh...

678
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,250
"Darren from Scunthorpe.

679
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,000
Good show, Hayes."

680
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,726
- You're not a fan?
- I mean, he's nice enough.

681
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,750
He's just a twerp.

682
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,291
And he's from Scunthorpe,
which is a bit of a shithole.

683
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:36,333
He's-he's, uh, he's not bad really.

684
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,916
What about your dad?

685
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,642
Dad's wanted a lot more of a relationship
in the last few years,

686
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,250
which is really funny timing

687
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,892
given that he wasn't really there
for the first 16 years of my life.

688
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:47,791
Now he wants to be best mates.

689
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,583
Yeah.

690
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,291
I don't know.

691
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,583
I mean, I want to be close to him, but...

692
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,958
It's hard to trust people, isn't it?

693
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,458
Yeah.

694
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,000
This is very good.

695
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,166
Thank you.

696
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,958
This Daniel guy, ex-husband,
what happened to him?

697
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,083
Really?

698
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,916
Not even a softball question
to warm us up a little bit like,

699
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,559
"Hey, Solène, what's your favorite color?"

700
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,017
Hey, Solène,
what's your favorite color?

701
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,041
That's actually a very personal question.

702
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,291
For context, um...

703
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,000
I had just moved to L.A.

704
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:36,000
Um, I wanted to be in the art scene
in Downtown New York,

705
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,708
- but I could afford to be in the art scene in Downtown L.A.
- Mm.

706
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,875
So I met Daniel, uh,
at a party in Echo Park.

707
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,291
Hate him already.

708
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,684
It's getting late.
I think that maybe we should...

709
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,125
- Solène.
- Mm-hmm. Hayes?

710
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,333
We're just talking.

711
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:54,500
We're two people with trust issues who
need to open up a little. -

712
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,416
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

713
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,125
Oh, you want to know the worst thing that
can happen when you open up to someone?

714
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,583
Please tell me.

715
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,291
Okay.

716
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,583
I'll tell you.

717
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:14,458
Daniel, he was very intelligent,
outgoing, very driven...

718
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,333
and we really liked each other.

719
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:25,625
So we got together, fell in love,
got married, got pregnant...

720
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,833
Although not in that order.

721
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,791
And then we were just very young.

722
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,000
With a baby.

723
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,583
We, you know, put our heads down.

724
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,333
He was crushing it at work.

725
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:41,541
The gallery had finally opened,
Izzy was at school,

726
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,375
but there was, uh, distance.

727
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,500
It's... we had... there was a drift.

728
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,166
But I thought, you know,
"Okay, that's normal.

729
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,708
That's normal. You know?

730
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:58,125
So you didn't get a fairy tale. Grow up."

731
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:02,166
And then one night
about three years ago...

732
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,916
we were out at dinner
with his work friends,

733
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,333
and, um, I was repeating some stupid...

734
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,583
gossip about, uh, someone we all knew,

735
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,708
who cheated on someone else,

736
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,791
and the whole table went silent.

737
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,517
Like, you know that feeling
when you walk into a room

738
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:29,541
and you know everybody
was just talking about you?

739
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:34,583
And I look at Daniel,
and he won't look at me.

740
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,208
He wouldn't look at me.

741
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:41,208
So we got back to the house,
paid the sitter,

742
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,458
and I asked him.

743
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,416
He said her name was Eva.

744
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,125
She was a...

745
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,041
young lawyer at his firm.

746
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:05,083
The thing that I'm the most angry about
is I was so nice about it.

747
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,750
I offered to forget it.

748
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:14,666
I said that, for us, for our family,
for the good of our family, I would...

749
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,333
I mean, people make mistakes...
I'll forget... I'll...

750
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,250
I'll forgive it.

751
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,625
And then he said...

752
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,583
he didn't want to move past it.

753
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,458
He was in love.

754
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,166
And then he very quietly...

755
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,000
left.

756
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,000
So that, in my experience,
is the worst thing that can happen

757
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,333
when you open yourself up to someone.

758
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,125
Well...

759
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:59,875
we're still here.

760
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,208
Mm-hmm.

761
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:06,333
Eating great fucking sandwiches.

762
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:09,208
They are great, aren't they?

763
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,750
And maybe we're not all Daniel.

764
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,166
I'll take that under consideration,
Hayes Campbell.

765
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,458
Oh, please not the first and last name.

766
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,000
Do you not like that?

767
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,791
It just doesn't tell the whole story.

768
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,750
I see that.

769
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,000
Just... I'll be right back.

770
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,000
Hello.

771
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,083
Oh, hi, Izzy.

772
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,250
Hey... uh, no.

773
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,500
Why'd you stop?

774
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,083
No reason.

775
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:02,291
What is that song?

776
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,666
Uh, it's-it's nothing, really.

777
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,916
I like it.

778
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,625
Yeah?

779
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,708
Yeah.

780
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,250
- I'm too old for you.
- No, you're not.

781
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,875
Okay.

782
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,458
- I could be your mother.
- You're not.

783
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,375
- But I could be.
- But you're not.

784
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,083
No.

785
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,166
Can I take you back to your hotel?

786
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:43,125
Uh, no, it's fine. Desmond's outside.

787
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,375
So when can I see you again?

788
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,250
Hayes.

789
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,750
Solène.

790
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,250
- I can't do this.
- Why's that?

791
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:02,791
Because you're you and I'm me,
and we just don't fit.

792
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,375
- We'll see.
- Mm.

793
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,416
Glad you enjoyed the sandwich.

794
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,166
Legendary.

795
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,375
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

796
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,666
- I know. I know. I'm packing.
- Yes, good. Okay.

797
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,625
Sup?

798
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,416
Are you okay?

799
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
I'm fine.

800
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,166
Oh, my God, are you high?

801
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,458
No.

802
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,208
- Did Tracy give you a gummy again?
- No.

803
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,208
I'm fine.

804
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,166
All right. And I'm packing,
so don't come in, please.

is that, as a JC, you get to, like,
hang out with different divisions and...

813
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,708
- Izzy!
- Hi!

814
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:06,083
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

815
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:09,125
Oh, my God. How are you?

816
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,916
- So happy we're here. Okay, wait.
- Okay, girls, let's go. Come on.

817
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,267
Come on.
- Okay, okay. Wait, I'll see you in one second, okay?

818
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,392
- Bye, guys.
- Izz, I need you.

819
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,833
Okay, okay, I'll be right there.

820
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,601
- Um, I-I really... I got to go.
- Okay. I know, I know, I know.

821
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,465
- Okay, do you have your, uh, bug spray?
- Yes.

822
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,661
- Antihistamines?
- Yes, Mom.

823
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,458
- I have everything, okay?
- Okay.

824
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:24,601
- Okay, we'll talk on Sundays.
- Okay.

825
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:25,976
- Sundays, Sundays. Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.
- Okay.

826
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,184
- I love you. And you have a good summer.
- Bye-bye-bye. I will.

827
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,625
Love you. Bye.

828
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:30,750
I need you.

829
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:33,553
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We do really... We got to go.
- What? No, no.

830
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,017
<i>We've reached
our cruising altitude of 32,000 feet.</i>

831
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,730
<i>And we're expecting a smooth flight
all the way into LaGuardia.</i>

832
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

833
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,750
How was the flight?

834
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,375
It was fine. Good.

835
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,250
Uneventful.

836
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,791
New dress?

837
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,375
No.

838
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,708
How was your show?

839
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:33,000
Fine.

840
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,833
Good.

841
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:36,083
Uneventful.

842
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,500
I brought you your watch.

843
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,375
Well, I think it looks
a lot better on you.

844
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:14,583
Okay. Okay.

845
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,947
- There's so many buttons.
- I know, but it looks so good.

846
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,875
Can I have the chicken fingers?

847
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,083
Cool. Uh, what do you want?

848
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,583
- A BLT.
- BLT.

849
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,583
Fries?

850
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:15,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we'll have some fries.

851
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,500
And a cookie plate.

852
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,791
And a cookie plate.

853
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,572
Here are your chicken fingers.

854
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:00,333
Is that the same song you were playing
at my house on the piano?

855
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,250
Mm-hmm.

856
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,625
I like it. It's good.

857
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

858
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:11,000
Have you always played guitar?

859
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,875
No.

860
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,878
- I didn't know how to play an instrument before I started the band.
- Mm.

861
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,708
They told us it wasn't necessary.

862
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:21,875
Yeah.

863
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,416
You want to hear a story?

864
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,333
Mm-hmm.

865
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:29,333
A few years ago,

866
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:31,500
the head of my label calls me.

867
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,458
And he says that the lead singer
of my favorite band

868
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:38,916
wants to meet me.

869
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,291
I'm so excited.

870
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,041
Maybe we'll hit it off,

871
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,458
record a song.

872
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,375
And I get there,

873
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:52,083
and it's his ten-year-old daughter's
birthday party.

874
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,690
And he wants me to take pictures with her
and all her friends.

875
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,291
I think that's my greatest fear in life.

876
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,666
That I'm a joke.

877
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,083
You're not a joke.

878
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,666
You're not a joke.

879
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,416
Morning.

880
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,833
Morning.

881
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:07,916
I hope you don't mind
that I borrowed your cardigan.

882
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,541
It's only temporary. I will give it back.

883
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,833
- Oh, no complaints here.
- Okay. Just checking.

884
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:26,875
I'm leaving this afternoon
to go on the European leg of my tour.

885
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,833
Don't worry. I'll be out of your hair
before you know it.

886
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,596
And I was really hoping
you'd come with me.

887
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,500
You know I can't do that.

888
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:38,625
Why not?

889
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,333
Izzy.

890
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,208
- And I don't think it's...
- She's at camp all summer.

891
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,916
The gallery, I-I have to,
you know, work...

892
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,250
I literally bought all of the art
in your gallery, so, I mean...

893
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,958
Don't your artists need
some more time to m-make some art?

894
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:03,041
I don't have any clothes.

895
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,809
- I have an army of stylists, an army.
- No, no, no, no.

896
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,101
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

897
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,708
I did not bring enough underwear.

898
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,416
Well, we can go to Target.

899
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,458
And we'll get some Fruit of the Loom.

900
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:14,976
- That's what you wear, right? Fruit of the Looms?
- Thank you.

901
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

902
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,916
- Thank you. Only the best.
- So...

903
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:23,250
When was the last time
you took a real holiday?

904
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,708
What about what people will say?

905
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,375
I don't care what they say.

906
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:43,083
And worse comes to worst,
we'll just say that you are my...

907
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:46,291
extremely attractive art consultant.

908
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,125
Everyone has secrets.

909
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,750
Hi, Gene.

910
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,125
Hey, everyone, this is Solène.

911
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:16,125
- She's my art consultant.
- Hi.

912
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,625
Hi.

913
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,208
Art consultant?

914
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,708
- Okay.
- Okay.

915
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,166
- Hi.
- Hi.

916
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,892
- Come on. We got to go.
- Uh, break a leg. Oh.

917
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:00,392
- Okay, this is for you. Ears.
- Thank you.

918
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,875
- Hayes.
- And, uh, and down there...

919
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,166
Thank you. Okay.

920
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,875
What's up?

921
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,625
Pretty amazing, huh?

922
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,351
- Izzy?
<i>- Hey, Mom.</i>

923
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,875
How are you? What's up?

924
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:49,583
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm... I-I'm good.
Thank you.

925
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,291
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm doing
some, uh, traveling.

926
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,583
Oh, where?

927
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:57,125
I'm, uh, I'm-I'm all over the place.

928
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,500
<i>Come on. I, like, need to know.</i>

929
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,375
What do you think, huh?

930
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:04,041
<i>- Who's that?</i>
- It-it-it's, uh, my new client.

931
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,059
- Oh, my God, what are you doing?
- He came into the gallery,

932
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,851
and he liked the stuff,
so now we're traveling around.

933
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:09,625
Anyway, tell me about the musical.

934
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,083
- What about Izzy?
- I haven't told her yet.

935
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:29,642
You embarrassed to be jet-setting around
the world with a 24-year-old pop star?

936
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:30,791
Because that's... it's fine.

937
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,059
I know how it is.
No, it's fine, it's fine.

938
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,666
I only get 15 minutes
to speak with her every week,

939
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,625
and there is so much camp drama.

940
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,208
You having a good time?

941
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,666
<i>Oui.</i>

942
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,791
That was reckless.

943
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,958
We're in Paris.

944
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,333
It's still reckless.

945
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,458
It's still Paris.

946
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:08,666
We have a long weekend coming up,
and Rory and Simon are going off to Ibiza,

947
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:13,708
but Ollie and I rented this spectacular
house in the south of France.

948
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:17,416
It's peaceful... quiet.

949
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,791
And I think we could have a lot of fun.

950
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,666
Okay, hold on.

951
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,333
Ah. Oh.

952
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,416
Wow.

953
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,875
Okay.

954
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,791
- Oh.
- Is this a funeral?

955
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,875
Hi.

956
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:10,875
- Hi.
- Hi.

957
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,250
Is this Hayes's chair?

958
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,458
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

959
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,291
Family history of, uh, skin cancer.

960
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,458
Ah.

961
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,750
So, are you guys having fun on the tour?

962
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,666
- Mm-hmm. -Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's fun.

963
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,416
Charlotte, how long have
you and Ollie been dating?

964
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,208
Dating?

965
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,500
We've been hanging out for a while.

966
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,851
I'm getting popsicles. You guys want some?

967
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,708
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes. -Okay, one, two.

968
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,833
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

969
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,208
Okay.

970
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,500
Wait, pass one to me.

971
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:51,892
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, look at this. -Hello.

972
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:55,500
Excuse me. So sorry.

973
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,958
- Hi.
- Hey.

974
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,500
- Make some room?
- Make some room please.

975
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,416
Hello.

976
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

977
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,166
Please warm me.

978
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,250
- Okay.
- I'm done.

979
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,250
This place is incredible.

980
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:17,892
I plan to keep doing
absolutely nothing all weekend.

981
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,875
Not sign an autograph, write a tweet.

982
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:22,728
So, Ollie says you own an art gallery?

983
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:24,083
Yeah, in Silver Lake.

984
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,958
It's amazing.

985
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:28,375
- Solène's got a real eye for talent.
- No doubt.

986
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,125
I hear you're a mom, too.

987
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,458
Yes. Yes.

988
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,791
Uh, I have a daughter, Izzy.

989
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,333
She's, um, 16.

990
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,750
I love that. Where does she go to school?

991
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,333
Uh, she just finished her junior year
at Campbell Hall.

992
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:41,833
Oh, my God.

993
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:44,250
I have a friend who graduated
Campbell Hall two years ago.

994
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,933
That's crazy. I wonder if she knows her.

995
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,791
Now, that's hilarious.

996
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,916
Charlotte, wha... um, what do you do?

997
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,666
I'm in college.

998
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:59,416
I'm taking a year off
to, you know, travel.

999
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,958
Charlotte is being modest.
Okay, she's brilliant.

1000
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:03,559
She speaks like ten different languages,

1001
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,708
and plus she's an amazing dancer.

1002
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:08,333
I wonder what Rory
and Simon are doing.

1003
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:13,250
Simon, how many models
are with you right now?

1004
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,226
We're gonna have to do
something a little naughty

1005
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,601
to prove that we're having more fun.

1006
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,041
Orgies are still a thing, right?

1007
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,726
- Ollie, can you not, please?
- I know, I know.

1008
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,916
Now that you're with Solène,
you're like a middle-aged man.

1009
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,916
You know, before you showed up,
he behaved like an actual pop star.

1010
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,916
Do you just say every fucking thing
that pops in your head?

1011
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,750
Popsicles.

1012
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,666
Come on, guys.

1013
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:40,541
Solène, how did you guys meet?
We need to know the story.

1014
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:43,250
Uh, we met at Coachella.

1015
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:45,684
- Actually, it was at an August Moon meet and greet.
- Yeah.

1016
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, my God. You're a Moonhead.

1017
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,791
- No, no.
- That's so cute.

1018
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,625
It's actually kind of a crazy story.

1019
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,083
Uh, she wasn't supposed to be there.

1020
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,291
And then she was,
and she was with her daughter.

1021
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,583
Yeah, yeah.
No, we-we, uh, we met by accident.

1022
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,750
By accident, yeah.

1023
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:01,916
In my trailer.

1024
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,416
And then Hayes, you know, really upped
the ante when he dedicated a song to me.

1025
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,041
"Closer"?

1026
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,583
- Yes.
- Of course that was the one.

1027
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:12,958
We do that
when one of us finds a girl,

1028
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,375
or in Hayes's case, a woman, cute.

1029
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,416
We pretend to change the set list
at the last minute.

1030
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,250
- It's a bit.
- It's a bit. Right.

1031
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,684
Oh, my God, wait. Oh, wait.

1032
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,434
Do you guys remember when he did it
for that Swedish actress

1033
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:25,916
who was, like, in love with him?

1034
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,392
- Hayes told you that, didn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

1035
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:29,458
- Hanna. Wasn't it Hanna, Hayes?
- Oh, my God.

1036
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:30,701
Poor Hanna. She was obsessed.

1037
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,916
I mean,
can you imagine if he did it?

1038
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,541
That would be so fucked up.

1039
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,892
She just kept showing up.

1040
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:39,166
We couldn't ditch her 'cause she was,
like, famous in Sweden or something.

1041
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,833
She was like 33 and clueless.

1042
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,583
It was, like, so awkward.

1043
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,916
- Oh, shoot, I forgot my, um, thing.
- Just let me...

1044
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,750
I just need it. So excuse me.
Sorry. Just got to grab it.

1045
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,375
Enjoy the popsicles.

1046
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,541
- Bye.
- Bye. -See you.

1047
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,291
Why'd you do that?

1048
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:56,500
Do what?

1049
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:09,166
I'm sorry about Ollie.

1050
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,166
- He can be a...
- It's fine.

1051
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,083
He's a guy in his 20s.

1052
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,375
What's that supposed to mean?

1053
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,934
It means I think it's time I went home.

1054
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,541
- Hey, Sol, can we just take a beat...
- It's not you.

1055
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:22,083
It's me.

1056
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,416
You are very, very beautiful,

1057
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,458
and I fell for your fuck-boy move.

1058
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,833
40 and clueless, I guess.

1059
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,958
Can I explain myself? It was stupid.

1060
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:32,726
- I was trying to impress you.
- And it worked.

1061
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,083
And it worked for Hanna, too. Nice job.

1062
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,059
I'm sorry, is it so shocking to you
that I've slept with other women?

1063
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,125
Other older women? No.

1064
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:41,083
- It's even fine that you have a type.
- I actually liked Hanna.

1065
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:42,517
- You know what, Hayes?
- Not that that's any of your business.

1066
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:45,666
I got swept up in the idea of you,
and it's been fun, it really has,

1067
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,166
- but we both knew it had to end.
- Does it?

1068
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,000
- Does it what? I...
- Does it have to end?

1069
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:53,500
W-We have a few more weeks of the tour,
then I'm gonna be in L.A.

1070
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:57,416
It would just be me,
and we could hang out like normal people.

1071
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,333
Um, yeah, it's not gonna work for me.

1072
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:03,000
This was fun, but now it's, uh, not.

1073
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,875
Wh-What are you so afraid of, Solène?

1074
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:09,083
The father of my child
lied to me for a year,

1075
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:10,833
and all of his friends knew.

1076
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,958
Everybody knew except for me.

1077
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,541
Which is a gut punch similar to the one
I just felt by the pool with your friends.

1078
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,500
- I'm not Daniel.
- Tell that to my stomach.

1079
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:22,791
You know, I-I know what it is
that you're doing.

1080
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,184
You're bailing. You're running away.

1081
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,333
No, I'm not running away.

1082
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:28,250
Oh, you're not running away?

1083
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,041
You're literally packing a bag.

1084
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,000
Hayes, this doesn't
have to be dramatic, okay?

1085
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,563
- We both knew what this was. It's fine.
- What if I want more?

1086
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:37,041
- Wh...
- For the first time in

1087
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,791
I don't even fucking know how long,
I-I'm actually happy.

1088
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:44,125
I mean, usually, I feel numb or...

1089
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:47,791
you know, I-I feel like I'm supposed to be
feeling something when I'm not.

1090
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,625
But with you,

1091
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:54,708
laughing, just being with you,

1092
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:58,166
holding you at night, I mean,

1093
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,833
it's meant the world to me.

1094
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,583
And I'm writing music.

1095
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:05,000
God, the music I'm writing now,
I-I actually feel like I care about it,

1096
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,500
so-so why on earth
would I want this to end?

1097
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:18,125
This is where you say, "Of course, Hayes,
I... I feel some of this, too."

1098
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,250
I can't say that.

1099
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:25,166
God, you know
what the crazy thing is, Sol?

1100
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,125
I don't think you ever
even gave us a chance.

1101
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,559
I mean, does anyone in your life
even know about me?

1102
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:35,416
Does your daughter? Do your friends?

1103
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,250
If the roles were reversed, do you think
anyone else would give a shit?

1104
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,375
Or judge?

1105
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,083
I mean, did anyone with Daniel and Eva?

1106
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,750
Izzy did. Tracy did. I did.

1107
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,791
I do.

1108
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:50,250
So, what, you're, um,
you're ashamed of me?

1109
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:51,375
Is that it?

1110
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:56,708
I... am...

1111
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,833
ashamed.

1112
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,541
Um...

1113
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,583
Okay, well...

1114
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,750
I'm going to go find
somewhere else to sleep tonight,

1115
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:17,250
and I'll arrange a flight back to L.A.

1116
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,833
<i>Izzy's turning 17.</i>

1117
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,375
Can you believe it?

1118
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:49,018
I got to say, I'm really surprised
you got her a new car, Daniel.

1119
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:51,333
It's not new. It's used.
I got it at CarMax.

1120
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,083
It's like new. Almost new.

1121
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:57,666
Well, we had a price cap,
so I bought her watercolors and an easel.

1122
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,851
Well, that's cool. I mean, you know?

1123
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:00,392
She's got something cute
and something powerful.

1124
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:02,833
Do you think she should,
like, just, like, come home to it?

1125
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:04,291
- Um...
- Or, oh, no. I know.

1126
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,833
Framed photograph of the car wrapped up.

1127
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,351
You can give it to her
when you pick her up at camp.

1128
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:09,958
- Okay.
- Great.

1129
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:12,000
Okay, ready? Okay.

1130
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:16,541
Oh, uh, do you remember
Kip Brooks from my old firm?

1131
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:17,791
Maybe. Why?

1132
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:21,291
Well, we had lunch
with him and his wife last week,

1133
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,017
and they were telling us about
this amazing trip that they took to Rome,

1134
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:27,041
and he said that he could've sworn

1135
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:30,375
that he saw you there in a café
with the kid from August Moon.

1136
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,208
- Were you in Italy?
- Yes, I was.

1137
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,125
I was in Venice for the Biennale.

1138
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:37,458
Oh, right on.
Finally stepping up to the plate.

1139
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:38,958
Nice.

1140
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:42,125
Uh, thing is, he said that

1141
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:46,375
you guys were kissing and holding hands.

1142
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:50,541
And, I mean, that would just be, like,
mind-blowing if that were true.

1143
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,625
Yeah, that would be mind-blowing.

1144
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,541
Um, he is a client.

1145
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,166
He's been by the gallery.

1146
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:02,000
Okay, well, I mean,
I'm sure we can all agree

1147
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:06,125
that any relationship with
a 24-year-old world-famous pop star

1148
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:09,875
would be crazy on, like, so many levels.

1149
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:14,083
Well, I'm not really interested
in relationship advice from you, Daniel.

1150
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:17,583
But in this case,
I do agree it would be crazy.

1151
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,250
Okay, I'm gonna go
snap some pics of the car.

1152
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,541
Please know I'm not unaware
of his, uh, stunning...

1153
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,291
hypocrisy.

1154
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,625
Cool.

1155
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,833
I'm leaving him.

1156
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:43,208
He obviously has no idea yet, but, um...

1157
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,083
Yeah, it's over between us.

1158
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,666
Um, why are you telling me this?

1159
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,083
Because I wanted you to know the truth.

1160
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,041
Would you want to get Thai food
with me sometime?

1161
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,333
- No.
- Okay.

1162
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,875
Thank you so much.

1163
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,125
<i>The food,</i>

1164
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:09,041
the people-watching, the art,
uh, it was...

1165
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,375
- it was Europe.
- Mm-hmm.

1166
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,041
Who's this guy you were with?

1167
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:16,416
He's a pretty high-profile client,
so I probably shouldn't name names.

1168
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,875
So it's strictly professional?

1169
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,750
Well, this client...

1170
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,916
he's very young.

1171
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,416
How young are we talking?

1172
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,833
20s.

1173
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,000
Mid-20s.

1174
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,583
Oh, okay. That's nothing.

1175
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:34,541
I mean, if you were gonna tell me
something happened,

1176
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:36,083
I'm just saying, that's nothing.

1177
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:37,500
Okay, so hang on.

1178
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:42,166
Um, when Daniel does it, it's gross,
but if I were to do it, it would be fine?

1179
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,583
Yeah. Because I hate him and I love you.

1180
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,059
<i>You live there
and obviously enjoy living there,</i>

1181
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,541
<i>but there must be things you miss.</i>

1182
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,767
<i>I miss British humor.
I mean, you know.</i>

1183
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:52,833
<i>Yeah.</i>

1184
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:57,333
<i>Our humor is this...
Just doesn't always travel.</i>

1185
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,750
- Hi. Hi. Solène Marchand?
- Yes.

1186
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,375
- Brenda McCall, Dana's mom.
- Oh.

1187
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,434
- I think she's in a bunk with your daughter.
- Yes, yes.

1188
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,392
Izzy has mentioned Dana. Hello.
How are you? -

1189
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:56,250
Can I just tell you, you are my hero.

1190
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,375
Also divorced.

1191
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:01,250
You have inspired me not to lie about
my age on my Hinge profile, so...

1192
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,916
Well...

1193
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,309
Uh, you're even prettier in person.

1194
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,434
- Um... Oh. No, no. It's... No, no.
- Can I get a selfie?

1195
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,658
- Thanks so much.
- Neil, stop.

1196
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,958
- What? Come on. What...
- Can we just trade places?

1197
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,625
- Neil.
- What did I do?

1198
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:15,583
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1199
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:19,958
I have to tell you, my daughter has had
a crush on Hayes since she was like ten,

1200
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,583
and she is so heartbroken.

1201
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:24,125
Yeah.

1202
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:37,125
We talked like
a million times, Mom.

1203
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,750
You never said anything.

1204
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:42,291
I mean, I could tell something
was going on.

1205
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,375
I didn't tell anyone.

1206
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:49,875
I kept thinking,
"I'm just gonna have this experience,

1207
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:51,750
and no one will ever know."

1208
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,291
Mom, it's Hayes Campbell.

1209
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:55,208
You're right.

1210
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:57,291
You're right.

1211
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:01,250
We're not dating anymore.

1212
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:04,166
I mean, I don't know if we... Anyway.

1213
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,458
I ended it ten days ago.

1214
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:08,500
Which is what's so crazy
about all of this.

1215
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:11,666
- Wait, wait, you broke up with him?
- Yes.

1216
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,833
Wow.

1217
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:15,000
Okay.

1218
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,291
You know, I could have handled
that you were dating him.

1219
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,791
It pisses me off that you lied to me.

1220
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,750
Like, Dad lied, and that sucked.

1221
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,708
I thought I could count on you.

1222
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:36,625
I am so, so sorry.

1223
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,916
It will never happen again. I promise.

1224
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,333
People on the Internet that are
picking you apart are disgusting.

1225
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,041
It's 'cause you're a woman,
and it's 'cause you're older than him.

1226
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,666
They hate you for it.

1227
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,166
So that's just hypocritical and unfair.

1228
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,333
And wrong.

1229
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,750
You like him?

1230
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,375
Yeah, I do.

1231
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,458
Is he a feminist?

1232
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:15,041
'Cause that's important here.

1233
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:18,666
- I mean, he is still a guy...
- Right.

1234
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,583
But, um...

1235
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,101
but, yeah,
he's a feminist.

1236
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:26,750
Mom.

1237
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:31,375
Why would you break up
with a talented, kind feminist?

1238
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,916
Because...

1239
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:40,833
Where's he now?

1240
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:43,708
He's in L.A., I think.

1241
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,500
So?

1242
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,208
What are you gonna do?

1243
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,833
Hey, guys, you think you can
give me the room for a bit?

1244
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,625
Hi.

1245
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,333
Hi.

1246
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:58,500
You okay?

1247
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:02,250
It was horrible...

1248
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:05,291
But... seems to have died down.

1249
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:12,500
What I am not okay with
is how I treated you.

1250
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,958
I'm sorry.

1251
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,833
When you said this is the part

1252
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:21,625
where I was supposed to say
that I felt all those things, too...

1253
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,458
I was afraid.

1254
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:31,375
I do, very much...

1255
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,541
feel all those things.

1256
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,750
With you, I feel...

1257
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,125
everything.

1258
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,500
So...

1259
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,333
maybe you're right.

1260
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,625
Maybe it doesn't have to end.

1261
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:58,333
I'm sorry, Solène. I, um...

1262
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,250
I wasn't expecting this.

1263
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:02,791
- Of course. I...
- I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now

1264
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:04,809
with everything that's going
on, you know? -

1265
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:07,583
- I totally understand.
- I just need a moment.

1266
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:09,125
You know.

1267
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:17,958
All right, I've had a moment.

1268
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,250
<i>It's gonna be a lot.</i>

1269
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:26,583
We're ready.

1270
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:28,958
There's gonna be
a firestorm of attention on us.

1271
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:31,458
- We'll just delete all our social media.
- You sure?

1272
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:33,083
Ignorance is bliss.

1273
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:34,583
This feels good.

1274
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:37,666
- So.
- So.

1275
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,583
I don't think I can delete TikTok.

1276
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,626
- Do I have to delete TikTok?
- No, you don't. No.

1277
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,625
- Yes. Okay.
- All right.

1278
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:44,791
A second.

1279
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:55,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

1280
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,541
You must be Daniel. I'm Hayes.

1281
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,833
Mm.

1282
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:02,833
I'm sorry to hear about Eva, mate.

1283
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,541
- That, um, sucks.
- Yeah.

1284
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,916
Wh-Where's Izzy? I'm taking her to school.

1285
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,875
I will let her know.

1286
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:11,291
I just put a pot of coffee on.
You want a cup?

1287
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,958
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1288
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:17,291
You know, there's a dozen photographers
out there across the street.

1289
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,500
Yeah, we know.

1290
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:22,041
Um, my head of security just installed
some pretty incredible cameras,

1291
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,325
so we should be fine.

1292
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,083
Security. Okay.

1293
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:28,666
Um, what's your endgame here, bro?

1294
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,791
"Bro"?

1295
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,559
Didn't realize we were
on bro terms, Daniel.

1296
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,503
I don't know what you want me
to say to you, man.

1297
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:37,750
I mean, how long are you gonna keep up
this insanity with my wife?

1298
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:39,916
Daniel?

1299
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,125
What are you doing here?

1300
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,458
I'm gonna go get Izzy.

1301
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:45,958
Thanks.

1302
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:49,625
It was really nice to have met you, bro.

1303
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,083
- What's up?
- What's up?

1304
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:58,333
I don't know... just thought I'd like to
check to make sure our daughter is safe

1305
01:31:58,416 --> 01:32:01,291
from crazy fans and paparazzi
while she's here at her mother's home.

1306
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,125
- Of course we all want that.
- Oh.

1307
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:06,000
Which is why we have security,
and Izzy understands

1308
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:08,625
this is all gonna blow over,
and she says she's fine with it.

1309
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,375
Well, then you got it all covered, huh?

1310
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,833
Pretty much.

1311
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:14,250
You know,
I think I'll drive her to school today.

1312
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:15,750
That's great.

1313
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:17,666
- I'll pick her up.
- Fine.

1314
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,125
Is that all?

1315
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,083
Is there something
you'd like to say, Daniel?

1316
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:26,246
As a matter of fact, there is.
I mean, you're my w...

1317
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,833
You're the mother of my child,
and you're screwing this kid

1318
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:33,184
that she's had a poster of next to her bed
since she was ten.

1319
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,642
I mean, it's a little fucking weird.

1320
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:36,291
First of all, I'm not your wife.

1321
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:39,750
I was your wife,
and you lied, cheated and left.

1322
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:42,642
The only reason that I met Hayes
was because you thought a business trip

1323
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:44,892
was more important than
a bonding experience with your daughter.

1324
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:47,708
- I had to go to Houston.
- Yes, I know, Daniel! I know that!

1325
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:50,458
It's work... I get it... but
it is also a choice! -

1326
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,166
And that is the choice
that you repeatedly make for yourself,

1327
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:56,916
so excuse me if this whole white knight
routine is falling a little flat.

1328
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,708
Ooh, zing.

1329
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:00,851
Also, she never had a poster of Hayes
in her bedroom.

1330
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,000
It was Rory. It was always Rory.

1331
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,875
Sol, c-can you hear yourself?

1332
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,892
I mean, come back to reality
for just a moment here.

1333
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,559
Do you have any idea
what they're saying about you?

1334
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:11,416
No.

1335
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:14,291
Wow, okay.

1336
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:17,333
Um, I'll be outside.

1337
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:24,166
- Hey.
- Bye, Mom.

1338
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,250
You okay?

1339
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:27,000
- Yeah, no, I'm just running late.
- Okay.

1340
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,958
- I'm gonna pick you up, all right?
- Okay.

1341
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:30,333
- Ready? Okay?
- Yeah.

1342
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:31,851
Hey, sweetheart!

1343
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:33,833
Over here, over here!

1344
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,500
Come on, guys.

1345
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:38,625
Take a break.

1346
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:03,375
- You all right?
- Huh?

1347
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:05,125
Uh...

1348
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:07,250
What's the matter?

1349
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:08,625
Um...

1350
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:12,666
Charlotte just texted me from New York.

1351
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,750
Ollie's, um... he's got himself
in a bit of trouble.

1352
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,083
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

1353
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:20,125
I-I'm gonna pack a bag
and go and see him this afternoon.

1354
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:23,166
- And I'm really sorry. This is so...
- Oh. Okay. Okay.

1355
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,625
Last-minute and crazy.

1356
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:26,416
I-I understand. Go.

1357
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,660
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1358
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:29,642
Okay. It's-it's just gonna be
a few days, all right?

1359
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:31,506
- All right.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry about this.

1360
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,750
I can't do anything about the phone stuff,

1361
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:43,583
but I'll put up a "by appointment only"
sign to keep out weirdos.

1362
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:45,142
Okay, that's a good plan.
Would you, um...?

1363
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:47,625
- Tracy, hi. Come in, come in, come in.
- Hi. Uh...

1364
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,416
Hi.

1365
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,041
- What's with the horde?
- Um, okay.

1366
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:57,541
People are, uh, having feelings.

1367
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,541
You're okay?

1368
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:05,265
I mean, I didn't know my being happy
would piss so many people off.

1369
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:07,791
Oh, right. Did I not warn you?

1370
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,875
People hate happy women.

1371
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,875
It's kind of a lot.

1372
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:14,291
- Sol, it's almost 3:00.
- Oh, God. Okay.

1373
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,434
- Uh, sorry, I got to pick up Izzy from school.
- No.

1374
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:18,708
We're... it's a thing,
and she hates when I'm late.

1375
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:29,416
Bye, Izz!

1376
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,458
- Honey, what's going on?
- Drive, Mom.

1377
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,708
- Well, who are those...
- Just drive please.

1378
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,916
Honey, what happened back there?

1379
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,708
Oh, those were just some seniors

1380
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:53,458
asking if you could get a picture
of Hayes's penis for them.

1381
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:56,666
So, you know, just a regular Tuesday.

1382
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,833
- They said that?
- No, actually.

1383
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:00,958
Uh, they said "dick."

1384
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:07,000
Then there's that guy in band, Trevor,
you know, that I really like.

1385
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:09,583
Well, we've been texting.

1386
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:14,250
And I thought he liked me, too, but then
you know what he said to me today?

1387
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:18,041
"Tell your mom I turn 18 in a month."

1388
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:20,166
So, yeah, that's how my day was.

1389
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:24,208
Oh, Izz.

1390
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:28,083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1391
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:30,208
Can you just drop me at Dad's?

1392
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:33,000
- I just can't deal today.
- Okay.

1393
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,583
Um...

1394
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:50,208
Love you.

1395
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,309
You have time for a comment?

1396
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:21,083
What do you have to say
to the fans of August Moon?

1397
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:24,833
What do you have to say to all the fans
in the world who are brokenhearted?

1398
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:44,017
<i>Hey, Sol, this is Jodie.</i>

1399
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:46,583
<i>Do you want to comment
on these latest stories?</i>

1400
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:50,166
<i>You know, given the tenor of them,
you might want to say something.</i>

1401
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,750
<i>All right? Give me a call back.</i>

1402
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,142
- Hey, you. How you doing?
- Hey.

1403
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:40,541
Oh, God.

1404
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,208
I tell you, that flight, oy.

1405
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:46,333
I am so tired.

1406
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:49,041
Mwah.

1407
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:51,458
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1408
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,333
Why'd you give me the watch?

1409
01:38:55,416 --> 01:38:57,416
And why aren't we moving?

1410
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,375
Hey.

1411
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,708
Sol, Sol, what's wrong?

1412
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:06,625
I can't do this anymore.

1413
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,875
Us, our relationship, I...

1414
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:12,916
I can't do it anymore.

1415
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
It's Izz.

1416
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:23,125
- Okay, um...
- It's just...

1417
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:24,625
It's too much for her.

1418
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:31,000
I mean, it's... it's actually insane.

1419
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:35,458
I mean, she didn't sign up for
any of this, and it's too much for her.

1420
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:37,125
And I have to put her first.

1421
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:40,416
Okay.

1422
01:39:41,416 --> 01:39:43,416
Okay, let me just, um...

1423
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:47,250
Let me just think about this for a second.
Um...

1424
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,833
I mean, look, I-I could quit.

1425
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,791
- I could quit all of it.
- No, you can't.

1426
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:55,559
I'm f...
I'm fine with doing that.

1427
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:56,666
I could do that.

1428
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,458
It would just get worse.

1429
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:10,458
Please don't do this, Solène. Please.

1430
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:12,208
Please just go.

1431
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:14,791
You're not gonna fight for us?

1432
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:35,333
I auditioned for the band when I was 14.

1433
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,125
It shouldn't ruin a whole life.

1434
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,000
It's not going to.

1435
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:52,500
You're gonna have a big, beautiful life.

1436
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:58,291
I'm so sorry.

1437
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,000
I love you, Solène.

1438
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,916
I love you, too.

1439
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:55,375
Just promise me
you'll revisit this in five years.

1440
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:59,916
Izzy will be out of school,
living her best life.

1441
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:04,541
And I'll be some D-list celebrity
that nobody gives a shit about.

1442
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:10,250
It's too long.

1443
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:16,916
If you get a shot at happiness,
you take it.

1444
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,833
And I will, too, okay?

1445
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:09,250
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi, sweetie.

1446
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,416
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Oh. I love your hair.

1447
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,208
<i>Oh, thank you. I just did it.</i>

1448
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:15,958
It's beautiful. You look really good!

1449
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:17,541
<i>- How's Chicago?
- Good.</i>

1450
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:20,000
<i>I mean, like, freezing right now but good.</i>

1451
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:21,583
Are you staying warm?

1452
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:25,708
Do you need anything,
a sweater or a-a vest or a-a scarf?

1453
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:29,166
<i>No, I have about 5,000
of your sweaters here.</i>

1454
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,750
Okay.

1455
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,500
<i>When it comes to the Ramona Coaster,</i>

1456
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:35,017
<i>one minute you're soaring
through the air...</i>

1457
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:38,583
<i>a little heat from the cayenne and a
little smokiness from the sweet paprika...</i>

1458
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:40,306
<i>Put "milk steak." She'll know what it is.</i>

1459
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:42,933
<i>No, she won't know what it is, Charlie.
Nobody knows what that is.</i>

1460
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:02,875
<i>Thank you.</i>

1461
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:06,250
<i>Hayes Campbell!</i>

1462
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:13,958
<i>- You sit there. Okay.
- Okay.</i>

1463
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:18,750
<i>That was amazing, Hayes.</i>

1464
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,809
<i>Thank you so much.
Really special performance, wasn't it?</i>

1465
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:23,625
<i>Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.</i>

1466
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:25,208
<i>Thank you.</i>

1467
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:28,041
<i>It seems like you have been
touring nonstop.</i>

1468
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:31,458
<i>- Yeah.
- Presumably, there is a break somewhere in your future.</i>

1469
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:33,184
<i>- You need a break, Hayes.
- I-I need a break.</i>

1470
01:48:33,208 --> 01:48:36,916
<i>I-I'm-I'm on my last legs, I think,
at the moment, Graham.</i>

1471
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,208
<i>But, um, no, I think, um, it-it's just
about, you know, getting through the tour.</i>

1472
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:44,541
<i>And, um, I think after that,
I-I've scheduled myself a little break,</i>

1473
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:47,333
<i>maybe a little holiday to L.A.</i>

1474
01:48:47,416 --> 01:48:49,041
<i>L.A.? Any particular reason why L.A.?</i>

1475
01:48:50,125 --> 01:48:53,666
<i>Uh, there's someone
I would like to see there.</i>

1476
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,666
Thank you.
-Bye.

1477
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:34,041
How are you?

1478
01:49:45,666 --> 01:49:47,101
Really compelling collection.

1479
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:49,892
You know, I think there's a Teddy Kelly
back there with your name on it.

1480
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:51,375
Yeah.
