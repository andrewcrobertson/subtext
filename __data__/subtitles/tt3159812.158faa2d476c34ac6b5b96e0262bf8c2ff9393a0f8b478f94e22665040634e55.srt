waste all her wishes?

352
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,131
Finder, I warn you.
Don't be tempted

353
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,770
to use the wishes
for selfish...

354
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,561
You know the rules.
The Finder chooses the wish.

355
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,211
Howleen, it's your wish.

356
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,884
It's my wish!

357
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,287
Don't you want
to be popular?

358
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,404
My wish is to be popular.

359
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,891
But...
Just do it!

360
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,164
As you choose.

361
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,250
Did it work?

362
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,845

is weak and easy to prompt.

364
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,771
No. Howleen has a good heart. You
wouldn't corrupt her like the others

365
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,968
because she has friends!

366
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,808
(SCOFFS) Her friends can't help
her if her friends aren't around.

367
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,487
Hey, Howleen!

368
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,648
You look really pretty today!

369

HeY- 9l'l0ul.

370
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,091
I was wondering if you'd come
to my party this weekend.

371
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,960
You're so cool, if you come, I just
know everybody else will show up!

372
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,249
Wow, really?
Um, sure! Thanks!

373
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,089
Smashing outfit! A winner!

374
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,802
I'm telling you,
Twyla, anything you want,

375
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,689
just ask me,
and bam, it's yours!

376
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,046
You gotta want something.

377
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,168
Mm, nope, I'm good.

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,241
Hm, really?

379
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,368
Howleen,
you're as fresh as spring!

380
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,728
Such an organic look!
(INHALES)

381

Going to the Coffin Bean after
school, if you wanna fang out.

382
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,562
Sure, sounds great!

383
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,843
Gory? Really?

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,050
I know, crazy, right?
Even she's nice to me now.

385
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,323
Come on, Twyla!
I can make you popular, too!

386
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,129
No, no, thanks. You know me. I'm
comfortable being in the shadows.

387
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,448
Fine, whatevs.

388
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,165
How déclassé.

389
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,208
I'm guessing
you used the genie

390
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,203
to make yourself popular.
(LAUGHS)

391
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,323
You know, back in my day, you
had to earn your popularity

392
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,405
by being born into the right family!
(LAUGHS)

393
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,122
I love being a genie, but in
my lantern, it gets so lonely.

394
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,362
You can't have any
friends in a lantern?

395
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,408
I had one, once.

396
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,689
But she and I,
well, we drifted apart.

397
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,366
Oh!

398
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,885
(CHUCKLES) <i>I</i> get that!
(GIGGLES)

399
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,564
But I always pull it together.

400
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,484
Monster High is
so wonderful. But...

401
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,568
But what?
I can't stay.

402
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,680
I serve the Finder, after her last
wish, I go back to the lantern.

403
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,921
But why?

404
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,971
I live by rules, Frankie.
It has always been that way.

405
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,608
Changing the way things have
always been is my specialty.

406
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,171
Well, of course
Howleen's changed.

407
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,563
Being popular is not easy.

408
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,402
Not everyone can handle it with
the grace and humility of moi.

(MOANS)

410
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,282

humility means something else!

Gil's parents

412
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,130
invited me over for
dinner last night,

413
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,406
it was so much fun!

414
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,569

make his fave lily pad linguinel

Whoa!

420
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Okay.

How's my Cleo,

425
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,481
Hey, Deuce, have you talked
to my brother and the guys?

426
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,005
Nah, they're still
on the show.

Man, I bet they're having
the time of their lives.

the last stunt was rough.

the absence of the headmistress.

440
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,484
You're going away?

441
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,690
Yes, unfortunately, I have to
attend an emergency meeting.

442
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,242
I have left all the details and
instructions in that guidebook.

443
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,681
Headmistress Bloodgood,
time to go.

444
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,283
Yes, very well. I have every
confidence that, in your hands, Abbey,

445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,807
this school will be in exactly the
same condition as when I left it.

446
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,163
Perfect.
I will be back in a few days.

wanted, and it changes them.

something different in the shadows.

something is living there.

I cannot say.

into the ears of the Finders,</i>

850

learned of this</i>

the mirror was smashed

869
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,051
into 13 pieces
a long time ago.

870
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,925
They're supposedly scattered
here throughout the lantern.

I've been using this map, but it
keeps taking me to the wrong places.

Come on!

I don't care.

I got those tickets for that
thing you wanted to go to...

Guys! I see the finish line!

1221

We'll be the first dudes
to ever win this show!

1222

(ALL SCREAMING)

1224
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,326
One last wish. That will send
us both back to the lantern.

1225
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,845
We are ready.

1226
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,246
Do you have to go?

1227
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,242
Can't you stay?

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1229
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,203
I would love to stay,

1230

experience what real teenage
life is like at Monster High,

1231
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,681
but I'm a genie.

1232
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,842
There is no other way.

1233
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,571
What if there were?

1234
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,324
Whisp, come here.

1235
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,927
You thought you wanted the world.
But I can see through you.

1236
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,605
Literally.

1237
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,807
L9eTyou.

1238
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,968
You were tired of
lurking in the shadows

1239
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,168
while Gigi got to go
out and make friends.

1240
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,840
I know what it's like to be
in someone else's shadow.

1241
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,767
You thought if you
couldn't be something,

1242
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,962
you'd have to be against it.

1243
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,441
But if you were the genie...

1244
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,488
What? You'd have to
follow the rules.

1245
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,080
But she's, like, evil!

1246
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,446
Howleen's right!

1247
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,610
If Whisp were the genie, then she'd
be bound by the rules of the lantern.

1248
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,802
You'd have to do
what your Finder wanted!

1249
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,321
You choose.

1250
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,085
That's what I'd always wanted.

1251
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,128
It's all I ever wished for!

1252
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,325
Gigi, I'm ready
for my final wish.

1253
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,565
I Wish

1254
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,561
that Whisp becomes
the new genie...

1255
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,324
(GIGGLES) Yes!

1256
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,050

stay at Monster High.

1261

feel like a party?

Howleen, how about it?

01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,250
Oh! I, um,
didn't think I'd be invited.

No. No. That's what my parents
wanted you to be.
