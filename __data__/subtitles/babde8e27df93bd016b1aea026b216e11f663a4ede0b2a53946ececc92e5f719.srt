<b>How much energon have you</b>

<b>Let's go. Ten seconds.</b>

204
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,833
<b>Happy to take the lead today, captain.</b>

207
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,958
<b>You don't have the touch or the power.</b>

00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,375
<b>Ready positions, Ross Boggins. Let's go.</b>

209
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,416
<b>She's in a good mood today.</b>

210
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:49,500
<b>You ready?</b>

211
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,750
<b>Always ready. Let's punch in.</b>

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
<b>Don't go on that.</b>

218
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,333
<b>Hold tight.</b>

219
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,041
<b>Throw it out.</b>

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,791
<b>I shot the base.</b>

221
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,541
<b>I shot the stable.</b>

222
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,166
<b>Got it, though. Got it, bro.</b>

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,250
<b>Evacuate!</b>

224

<b>Negative. Do not</b>

<b>bring protocol. Evacuate.</b>

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,125
<b>We're gonna need more left. It's closing.</b>

236
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,250
<b>Just grab your package. Go.</b>

237
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:05,916
<b>Good idea.</b>

238
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,416
<b>What? No! I didn't mean it.</b>

239

<b>Nothing much. Just normal</b>

<b>Orion Pax, could you</b>

<b>Run! Run!</b>

<b>Where did I make it?</b>

251
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,000
<b>Come on. Go, go, go!</b>

252
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,083
<b>What the hell, Pax? I</b>

00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:55,916
<b>told you to evacuate.</b>

254
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,041
<b>I did, eventually.</b>

255

<b>If I get fired because of you...</b>

256
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
<b>Oh, please. They're not gonna fire you.</b>

<b>Alita-1, you're fired.</b>

258

<b>What? Why? I followed</b>

<b>protocol to the letter.</b>

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,125
<b>That is true. I was the</b>

<b>No one asked you, Darkwing. Please. I</b>

<b>Alita. Next time, why don't you stop and think</b>

<b>Talking back to a superior like that.</b>

282
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,750

<b>Hey, and I appreciate you having my back.</b>

288
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,291
<b>I'm glad you were there with me to get</b>

<b>Ah, nobody does it better.</b>

304
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,583
<b>Once again, I have narrowly returned with</b>

<b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, listen.</b>

<b>Alright, what if, what if, what if,</b>

<b>No, that's good because we wouldn't.</b>

340

<b>But, but if we beat just one Transformer,</b>

<b>Hex. We're mining bots who can't</b>

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,958
<b>How could anyone not love it?</b>

538
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,958
<b>You gave my best racers a</b>

539
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,041
<b>real run for their money.</b>

540
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,083
<b>So we're not getting demoted?</b>

541
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:21,250
<b>Demoted?</b>

542
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:23,833
<b>[Laughing]</b>

543
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,333
<b>[Laughing]</b>

544
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,500
<b>The fact of the matter is, we're halfway</b>

545
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,375
<b>into the first shift</b>

546
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,458
<b>since the race ended.</b>

547
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,541
<b>And that mining crew has</b>

548
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,208
<b>already reached 150% quota.</b>

549
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,708
<b>You inspired them to work harder.</b>

550
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,833
<b>With Sentinel Prime, sir, we joined the</b>

551
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,750
<b>race to show everyone our potential.</b>

552
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,375
<b>That weak bots can do</b>

553
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,875
<b>more than just mine energy.</b>

554
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,250
<b>Outstanding.</b>

555
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,958
<b>I love a bot that can think for himself.</b>

556
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,958
<b>Perhaps you two could tour the mines,</b>

557
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,458
<b>speak to your brethren, and</b>

558
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,500
<b>help them see their potential.</b>

559
00:24:59,125 --> 00:24:59,500
<b>Wow.</b>

560
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:00,666
<b>Great.</b>

561
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,375
<b>That sounds incredible.</b>

562
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:03,500
<b>I would love to be--</b>

563
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,416
<b>Sir, it's time.</b>

564
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,291
<b>Ah, yes.</b>

565
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,041
<b>I'm sorry, friends.</b>

566
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:07,916
<b>We're preparing our</b>

567
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
<b>next travel to the surface.</b>

568
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,500
<b>But in the meantime,</b>

569
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,083
<b>I've got a treat for you.</b>

570
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,041
<b>Hang tight.</b>

571
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,208
<b>Arachnid, have someone escort these</b>

572
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,375
<b>heroes to my personal service facilities?</b>

573
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,083
<b>Best care in Iacon.</b>

574
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,000
<b>Until next time, Legends.</b>

575
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,125
<b>Sentinel Prime.</b>

576
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,208
<b>Ha ha ha.</b>

577
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,875
<b>The Sentinel Prime.</b>

578
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,083
<b>You're still mad at me?</b>

579
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,041
<b>I am less mad at you.</b>

580
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,791
<b>I'm telling you, Dee, I got a feeling</b>

581
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,083
<b>that everything's going to change.</b>

582
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,166
<b>And we're going to go--</b>

583
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,000
<b>Argh!</b>

584
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:37,875
<b>You miners!</b>

585
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:39,375
<b>Argh!</b>

586
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,083
<b>Argh!</b>

587
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,541
<b>Darkwing.</b>

588
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,250
<b>No!</b>

589
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:44,833
<b>No!</b>

590
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:45,750
<b>No!</b>

591
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,875
<b>Wait, wait, you don't understand!</b>

592
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,416
<b>We were supposed to go to Sentinel</b>

593
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:50,958
<b>Prime's service pod!</b>

594
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,958
<b>You two folks aren't going</b>

595
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,708
<b>to see anyone ever again!</b>

596
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,375
<b>I'll make sure of that!</b>

597
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,291
<b>You're picking up a fake-ass Sentinel!</b>

598
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,291
<b>Ugh.</b>

599
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,833
<b>Hate that guy.</b>

600
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,958
<b>You, products of the Sentinel!</b>

601
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
<b>It's like our chest of the Sentinel.</b>

602
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,583
<b>There's no one to tell you</b>

603
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,541
<b>who can call it "Gumwood".</b>

604
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,250
<b>You're real!</b>

605
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,041
<b>You're-- you're-- you're others!</b>

606
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,625
<b>You're not me!</b>

607
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:26,875
<b>You're here!</b>

608
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,625
<b>And you're not me!</b>

609
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,041
<b>Uh, yeah?</b>

610
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:32,541
<b>Awesome!</b>

611
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:33,875
<b>I am so sorry.</b>

612
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,375
<b>That must have been weird for you.</b>

613
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,791
<b>I just haven't had a lot of company since</b>

614
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,750
<b>they put me down here in sublevel 50.</b>

615
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:40,416
<b>50?</b>

616
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,833
<b>But there are only 40 sublevels.</b>

617
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:43,875
<b>That's what I thought!</b>

618
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,708
<b>Turns out they're 10 more</b>

619
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:46,958
<b>and they are not pleasant.</b>

620
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,250
<b>Probably why nobody ever</b>

621
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,291
<b>really talks about them.</b>

622
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,875
<b>How long have you been down here?</b>

623
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:51,666
<b>How long have I been here?</b>

624
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:52,375
<b>Haha!</b>

625
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,875
<b>Let's see.</b>

626
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:54,166
<b>Somewhere between a</b>

627
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,375
<b>long time and forever.</b>

628
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,208
<b>I mean, I had other jobs,</b>

629
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,333
<b>but I kept getting reassigned,</b>

630
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:00,750
<b>because I'm so good at what I do.</b>

631
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:01,541
<b>Oh!</b>

632
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,833
<b>I'm B-127, by the way.</b>

633
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,166
<b>But you can call me "B".</b>

634
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,291
<b>I'm actually working on some nicknames.</b>

635
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,125
<b>The one I'm floating</b>

636
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,916
<b>right now is "Badassatron",</b>

637
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,666
<b>which is actually</b>

638
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,833
<b>pronounced "Badassatron".</b>

639
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,958
<b>But if you have any critiques--</b>

640
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:15,875
<b>Great, great.</b>

641
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,208
<b>How do we get out of here?</b>

642
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:18,958
<b>Great question.</b>

643
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,291
<b>You don't.</b>

644
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:20,791
<b>We don't?</b>

645
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:21,291
<b>No.</b>

646
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,958
<b>We have limited access to</b>

647
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:23,916
<b>the waste management area,</b>

648
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,333
<b>but the new shift manager</b>

649
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,583
<b>there does not like distractions.</b>

650
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,458
<b>No, they prefer we stay</b>

651
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,333
<b>here on the task at hand.</b>

652
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:31,958
<b>Which is?</b>

653
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,458
<b>Oh!</b>

654
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,458
<b>The scrap comes in from the chute there</b>

655
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:36,916
<b>onto the conveyor belt.</b>

656
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,958
<b>Our job is to look for anything that</b>

657
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:39,958
<b>might be worth salvaging</b>

658
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,083
<b>before it hits the</b>

659
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,625
<b>furnace and gets smelted.</b>

660
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,875
<b>So you watch Garbage Barn?</b>

661
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:45,791
<b>Yes!</b>

662
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,041
<b>It is so great that you're here now.</b>

663
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:48,958
<b>I can't wait to learn</b>

664
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:49,916
<b>everything about you</b>

665
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,583
<b>and then tell you everything about me.</b>

666
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,458
<b>I have a lot of hopes and dreams that I</b>

667
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,666
<b>am just dying to share</b>

668
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,416
<b>with one or two new best friends.</b>

669
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,500
<b>Uh, yeah.</b>

670
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,541
<b>Oh, where are my manners?</b>

671
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:00,250
<b>Come on.</b>

672
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:00,916
<b>I'll introduce you to</b>

<b>the rest of the crew.</b>

674
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:02,500
<b>Hey, guys!</b>

675
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,500
<b>We've got company!</b>

676
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,208
<b>This is EP-508.</b>

677
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,750
<b>This is A-atron.</b>

678
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,708
<b>And this fella here is Steve.</b>

679
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:11,958
<b>Steve?</b>

680
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,833
<b>Yeah, he's for him.</b>

681
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,416
<b>Question.</b>

682
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:15,833
<b>Do they talk back to you?</b>

683
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,666
<b>Um, they're not real.</b>

684
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:18,708
<b>What?</b>

685
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,583
<b>You think I'm that crazy?</b>

686
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,000
<b>No, no, it's just you've been down here.</b>

687
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:22,833
<b>I was talking to Steve.</b>

688
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:23,916
<b>What?</b>

689
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,083
<b>Classic Steve.</b>

690
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,208
<b>What is that?</b>

691
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,000
<b>This guy.</b>

692
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,625
<b>Who's he coming from?</b>

693
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,000
<b>Oh!</b>

694
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,666
<b>Steve!</b>

695
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:33,458
<b>No!</b>

696
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,041
<b>I am so sorry.</b>

697

<b>Steve!</b>

698
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,166
<b>No!</b>

699
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:38,541
<b>Steve!</b>

700
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,791
<b>Put this on ambush.</b>

701
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,208
<b>Pulling the high guard</b>

702
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,541
<b>for immediate support.</b>

703
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,000
<b>Immediate support!</b>

704
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,125
<b>That's Alpha Trion.</b>

705
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,458
<b>One of the primes?</b>

706
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:51,291
<b>Repeat.</b>

707
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,083
<b>Zeta Prime has fallen.</b>

708
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,416
<b>It's an SOS message.</b>

709
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,416
<b>Protect the matrix.</b>

710
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,333
<b>Sending location coordinates.</b>

711
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,875
<b>Sending location coordinates.</b>

712
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,500
<b>Holy primus.</b>

713
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
<b>Are those a coordinates to</b>

00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,000
<b>a location on the surface?</b>

715
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,583
<b>This could be where the</b>

<b>primes died in the Quintesson War.</b>

717
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,583
<b>Which means this is where we could find</b>

<b>the Matrix of Leadership.</b>

<b>Well, obviously, I can believe it. I just</b>

1074
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,000
<b>saw it, but I still--</b>

1075
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,625
<b>I can't believe it.</b>

1076
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:18,708
<b>Sentinel lied to my face.</b>

1077
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,208
<b>It was all a sham. How</b>

1078
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,083
<b>could we have been so gullible?</b>

1079
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,791
<b>Oh, this, this, is</b>

1080
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:25,958
<b>going to change everything.</b>

1081
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:33,708
<b>You just had to do it, didn't you?</b>

1082
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,458
<b>Me? What did I do?</b>

1083
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,750
<b>You just had to go to the surface, had to</b>

1084
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,291
<b>enter the Iacon 5000.</b>

1085
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,625
<b>You just had to break protocol.</b>

1086
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,583
<b>Who cares about protocol?</b>

1087
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:47,041
<b>I do. I care. Because nothing bad happens</b>

1088
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,208
<b>when you stay on protocol.</b>

1089
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:50,750
<b>Sentinel Prime has been forcing us to</b>

1090
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,541
<b>work in the mines until our gears strip.</b>

1091
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,500
<b>And all the while, he's been giving the</b>

1092
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,500
<b>energon away to our greatest enemies.</b>

1093
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,166
<b>And what do you think he's going to do to</b>

1094
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,708
<b>us when he finds out that we know?</b>

1095
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,333
<b>I'm not thinking about what he's going to</b>

1096
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,625
<b>do. I'm thinking about</b>

1097
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:03,708
<b>what we're going to do.</b>

1098
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,000
<b>Well, that's the whole thing. You're</b>

1099
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,541
<b>never thinking about anything else.</b>

1100
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,166
<b>Just yourself. Fantastic.</b>

1101
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,458
<b>Another Orion Pax Master Plan.</b>

1102
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,875
<b>I can't wait to hear this.</b>

1103
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,291
<b>Don't you want to stop him?</b>

1104
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:14,625
<b>No, I want to kill him!</b>

1105
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,375
<b>I want to put Sentinel in chains and</b>

1106
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:18,958
<b>march him through the mines</b>

1107
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,333
<b>so everyone can see him for</b>

1108
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,916
<b>the false prime that he is.</b>

1109
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,958
<b>I want him to suffer and</b>

1110
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,916
<b>then to die in darkness.</b>

1111
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,791
<b>But we all know that it doesn't matter</b>

1112
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:30,875
<b>what I want, right Pax?</b>

1113
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:32,791
<b>The fact is, we're</b>

1114
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,583
<b>just cogless bots, right?</b>

1115
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,333
<b>He had limited options.</b>

1116
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:41,583
<b>And now, now we have none.</b>

1117
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,916
<b>No son or daughter of</b>

1118
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,958
<b>Cybertron is born without a cog.</b>

1119
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,375
<b>Oh, yeah. I've been with myself since I</b>

1120
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,041
<b>came online, and this</b>

1121
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,958
<b>slot's always been empty.</b>

1122
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,125
<b>So what are you saying? Are you saying--</b>

1123
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,250
<b>No, no way. Nobody could be</b>

1124
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,625
<b>that evil. Not even Sentinel.</b>

1125
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,791
<b>He removed your cogs</b>

1126
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,791
<b>before you came online.</b>

1127
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:08,250
<b>We were born with transformation cogs,</b>

1128
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,666
<b>but he took them from us.</b>

1129
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,291
<b>What defines a Transformer</b>

1130
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:16,750
<b>is not the cog in his chest,</b>

1131
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,916
<b>but the spark that resides in their core.</b>

1132
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,708
<b>A spark that gives you the</b>

1133
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:26,708
<b>will to make your world better.</b>

1134
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:32,916
<b>My fellow Primes had that spark, and I</b>

1135
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,958
<b>see their strength in you.</b>

1136
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,666
<b>Take their cogs and</b>

1137
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,250
<b>access your full potential.</b>

1138
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,500
<b>Prima.</b>

1139
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:48,250
<b>Onyx.</b>

1140
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:50,083
<b>Alchemist.</b>

1141
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:52,125
<b>Microns.</b>

1142
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,333
<b>Warriors of noble spirit.</b>

1143
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:56,708
<b>Loyalty.</b>

1144
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:57,875
<b>Strength.</b>

1145
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,750
<b>Their uniqueness enhanced by these.</b>

1146
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:36,041
<b>They were one. You are one. All are one.</b>

1147
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:53,666
<b>We have you. You gave us the</b>

<b>ability to change your world.</b>

1149
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,875
<b>How you choose to use</b>

<b>that power is up to you.</b>

1151
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:08,333
<b>They found us.</b>

1152
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:10,958
<b>Oh, yes. Turn the fight back.</b>

1153
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,791
<b>No. You must return to</b>

1154
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,500
<b>Iacon City and alert everyone.</b>

1155
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,750
<b>Embedded in this are the records I assume</b>

1156
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:24,000
<b>you. Use it to reveal the truth.</b>

1157
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:25,666
<b>We will.</b>

1158
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,791
<b>This tunnel leads to the mountains.</b>

1159
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:31,208
<b>Cybertron's future is in your hands.</b>

1160
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,333
<b>We're out of time. We gotta move.</b>

1161
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,541
<b>Wait, wait. We can't just leave you here.</b>

1162
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,458
<b>Your fight will come, my friend. Primus</b>

00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,250
<b>has a purpose for us all.</b>

1164
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:45,333
<b>But this fight... This</b>

1165
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,541
<b>fight is mine. Now go.</b>

1166
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,750
<b>Stand down, old tire.</b>

1167
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,791
<b>Old, you say?</b>

1168
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,083
<b>Not too old for you.</b>

1169
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,458
<b>We need to hurry.</b>

1170
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,416
<b>I still think we have better odds</b>

1171
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,125
<b>fighting than outrunning them.</b>

1172
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,416
<b>Wait. We have cogs.</b>

1173
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,041
<b>They can transform now.</b>

1174
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,791
<b>That's right. Everyone ready?</b>

1175
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,000
<b>I was born ready.</b>

1176
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:54,583
<b>On three. One.</b>

1177
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,708
<b>Fuck!</b>

1178
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,333
<b>How do we use these things?</b>

1179
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,208
<b>I don't know. Just try.</b>

1180
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,541
<b>It's working. It's working!</b>

1181
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:19,833
<b>My head! My head!</b>

1182
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,500
<b>Help! Help!</b>

1183
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:29,708
<b>This is not! Faster!</b>

1184
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,625
<b>Come on!</b>

1185
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,916
<b>Transform!</b>

1186
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,000
<b>I've got two wheels! I need wheels!</b>

1187
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,958
<b>Oh, wow. We're alive.</b>

1188
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:32,416
<b>Never mind me. That was incredible. See me slide? Oh, please, I am doing this. Yes!</b>

1189
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,750
<b>Hey, whoa, buddy. Are you okay?</b>

1190
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,250
<b>I'm great. Are you kidding me? We can</b>

1191
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:43,083
<b>transform. We transform.</b>

1192
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:46,083
<b>Oh, wait. I know. We're wasting time. We</b>

1193
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,166
<b>have to get back to Iacon.</b>

1194
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:49,375
<b>Looks like the fastest way back to Iacon.</b>

1195
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,083
<b>Here, I got to do that.</b>

1196
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:51,291
<b>Whoa, hey, what are you doing?</b>

1197
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:52,208
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

1198
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:53,125
<b>Yeah, but be careful.</b>

1199
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,583
<b>Our proof is inside and</b>

1200
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:55,916
<b>you're spilling it everywhere.</b>

1201
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:58,000
<b>I...</b>

1202
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,166
<b>...got... ...it.</b>

1203
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:05,333
<b>Okay.</b>

1204
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:10,708
<b>Follow me.</b>

1205
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,791
<b>Alpha, triumph! You are still alive.</b>

1206
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:22,750
<b>Would you look at that.</b>

1207
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,916
<b>You look horrible.</b>

1208
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:27,416
<b>Traitor.</b>

1209
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,958
<b>You are a disgrace.</b>

1210
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:32,583
<b>Primus will surely...</b>

1211
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,083
<b>Uh-huh. Yes, shut up.</b>

1212
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,041
<b>I seized an opportunity to</b>

1213
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,625
<b>take control of my future.</b>

1214
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,916
<b>Anything to get out of working for you</b>

1215
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,458
<b>and that boring council of elders.</b>

1216
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,416
<b>Seriously, I would watch you, Prime,</b>

1217
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,125
<b>spend half the day losing a war,</b>

1218
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,000
<b>and the other half sitting around waxing</b>

1219
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:50,541
<b>poetic about loyalty and honor.</b>

1220
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,291
<b>Now look at you.</b>

1221
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:53,625
<b>Hear my words.</b>

1222
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,958
<b>You will fall.</b>

1223
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:58,833
<b>And a new Prime will rise.</b>

1224
00:59:58,916 --> 00:59:59,416
<b>Here you go again.</b>

1225
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:01,333
<b>I don't want to listen</b>

1226
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:02,416
<b>to any more speeches.</b>

1227
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,291
<b>There were others in the cave with you.</b>

1228
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:06,458
<b>Who are they?</b>

1229
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,625
<b>They are to be your undoing.</b>

1230
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,250
<b>You've lost Sentinel.</b>

1231
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,333
<b>Nothing can do that.</b>

1232
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:23,666
<b>Oh, didn't I just say no speeches?</b>

1233
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,375
<b>You heard me, right?</b>

1234
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,291
<b>This is what I'm talking about.</b>

1235
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,625
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

1236
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:28,625
<b>All of them are like that.</b>

1237
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:29,958
<b>So disrespectful.</b>

1238
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,958
<b>Okay, hunt down the others.</b>

1239
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:34,958
<b>With pleasure.</b>

1240
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:44,291
<b>Hey, buddy.</b>

1241
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,125
<b>Oh, hey.</b>

1242
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,625
<b>You've been a little quiet.</b>

1243
01:00:58,708 --> 01:00:59,333
<b>You all right?</b>

1244
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,208
<b>All I can think about is</b>

1245
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,041
<b>Sentinel's smirking face.</b>

1246
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,583
<b>He must pay for what he's done.</b>

1247
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,333
<b>Someone has to do something.</b>

1248
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:08,958
<b>We are.</b>

1249
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,416
<b>With Alpha's proof inside that device, we</b>

1250
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,791
<b>will show everyone the truth.</b>

1251
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,291
<b>You honestly believe it'll be that easy?</b>

1252
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,333
<b>Iacon doesn't want to hear the truth.</b>

1253
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,416
<b>They worship Sentinel.</b>

1254
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:20,833
<b>There's got to be a</b>

1255
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:20,958
<b>better way to bring him down.</b>

1256
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,791
<b>We just have to trust that everyone will</b>

1257
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,875
<b>believe what we show.</b>

1258
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,375
<b>I trusted Sentinel.</b>

1259
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,250
<b>With everything.</b>

1260
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:32,083
<b>I will never trust a</b>

1261
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,750
<b>so-called leader ever again.</b>

1262
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,958
<b>There's only one body I know I--</b>

1263
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,500
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

1264
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:50,625
<b>All right.</b>

1265
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,000
<b>Wake them up.</b>

1266
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:19,625
<b>Now, are you spies, or</b>

1267
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,375
<b>just incompetent lackeys?</b>

1268
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,041
<b>We're not spies.</b>

1269
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,375
<b>But he is incompetent.</b>

1270
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,583
<b>Scanning electrical emojis.</b>

1271
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,750
<b>He speaks the truth.</b>

1272
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,291
<b>That just means he believes</b>

1273
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:34,000
<b>himself like any spy would.</b>

1274
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:34,833
<b>No, no, no, no.</b>

1275
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:34,958
<b>Sit down.</b>

1276
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,166
<b>Sit down.</b>

1277
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:35,458
<b>Sit down, me.</b>

1278
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,791
<b>He wouldn't stop talking.</b>

1279
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:41,750
<b>Even when he was unconscious?</b>

1280
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,291
<b>Especially when he was unconscious.</b>

1281
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:44,958
<b>Enough.</b>

1282
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,750
<b>Two options for you.</b>

1283
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:51,125
<b>One, we slowly dismantle each of you, one</b>

1284
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,083
<b>bolt and screw at a time,</b>

1285
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:55,791
<b>and really make sure you feel it.</b>

1286
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:58,583
<b>Or two, in exchange for a quick death,</b>

1287
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,791
<b>you give us intel on the Energon trains,</b>

1288
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,791
<b>access to the mines, or anything else</b>

1289
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,958
<b>that could hurt your boss Sentinel Prime.</b>

1290
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,291
<b>Who exactly are you guys?</b>

1291
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,916
<b>The Cybertronian High Guard.</b>

1292
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
<b>I told you it wasn't tight enough.</b>

1293
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,208
<b>Prestigious defenders of Iacon.</b>

1294
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:18,958
<b>Prestigious?</b>

1295
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:19,583
<b>He's right.</b>

1296
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,625
<b>I read all about you in the archives.</b>

1297
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,416
<b>You are the most legendary</b>

1298
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,250
<b>warriors in all of Cybertron.</b>

1299
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,208
<b>Look, look, look.</b>

1300
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,583
<b>That starscream, and your</b>

1301
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,250
<b>shockwave, and soundwave.</b>

1302
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,666
<b>Guys, raise your hand</b>

1303
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,666
<b>if wave is in your name.</b>

1304
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,458
<b>There's a lot of waves.</b>

1305
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,000
<b>Silence.</b>

1306
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,333
<b>The yellow annoying one is correct.</b>

1307
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:36,958
<b>Woo!</b>

1308
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:38,875
<b>We were once the High Guard.</b>

1309
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:40,458
<b>We witnessed Sentinel's</b>

1310
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,541
<b>betrayal, saw the Prime's fall.</b>

1311
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,125
<b>Since that day, we've been</b>

1312
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,291
<b>fighting from the shadows,</b>

1313
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,791
<b>doing whatever we can</b>

1314
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,416
<b>to sabotage Sentinel.</b>

1315
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,041
<b>That's great.</b>

1316
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,125
<b>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</b>

1317
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,000
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

1318
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:52,083
<b>We're good.</b>

1319
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:53,333
<b>Everyone relax.</b>

1320
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,666
<b>I'm just saying we're allies.</b>

1321
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,333
<b>We were on our way back to Iacon,</b>

1322
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,583
<b>and now with your help, we can unify</b>

1323
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:01,958
<b>Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.</b>

1324
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,291
<b>The idea of a unified</b>

1325
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,250
<b>Cybertron is a myth.</b>

1326
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:08,416
<b>All that counts is the</b>

1327
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,250
<b>strength of one bot over another.</b>

1328
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,916
<b>Okay, so these guys are the moon tents?</b>

1329
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,125
<b>Yeah, just so I know.</b>

1330
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,708
<b>Hey, what are you doing?</b>

1331
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,666
<b>I tell you what I'm not doing.</b>

1332
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,708
<b>I'm not cowering in some busted ship</b>

1333
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:29,958
<b>playing king of the throne.</b>

1334
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,500
<b>I'm not pretending like</b>

1335
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:32,458
<b>I'm making a difference</b>

1336
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:33,708
<b>by throwing one punch and</b>

1337
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,791
<b>then running away to hide.</b>

1338
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,250
<b>I found out that</b>

1339
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,500
<b>Sentinel is rotten today,</b>

1340
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,583
<b>and I'm gonna make him pay for it.</b>

1341
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:40,541
<b>Two days!</b>

1342
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:41,666
<b>You think you can</b>

1343
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,250
<b>insult me and just walk away?</b>

1344
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,916
<b>No one leaves here unless I say so.</b>

1345
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,916
<b>Is that right?</b>

1346
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:52,708
<b>Well, how can you say so?</b>

1347
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,000
<b>With my head in your teeth.</b>

1348
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:06,083
<b>Dink!</b>

1349
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:11,291
<b>Get me!</b>

1350
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:12,000
<b>Going!</b>

1351
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,250
<b>Come on!</b>

1352
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:14,416
<b>Yeah, boy!</b>

1353
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,666
<b>You want to see the</b>

1354
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,458
<b>strength of one bot over another?</b>

1355
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:26,791
<b>Is that all you've done?</b>

1356
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:27,833
<b>Just cut the cut!</b>

1357
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,583
<b>Come on!</b>

1358
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,041
<b>I make him!</b>

1359
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,541
<b>Stop! D, he's not the enemy!</b>

1360
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:56,333
<b>Bear witness!</b>

1361
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,000
<b>This is the last time I show mercy.</b>

1362
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,416
<b>Decide, right now!</b>

1363
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,666
<b>You can stay here in hiding,</b>

1364
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,250
<b>bowing before your pathetic leader,</b>

1365
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,500
<b>or follow me as we march on Iacon</b>

1366
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:11,958
<b>and I take down</b>

1367
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,000
<b>Sentinel once and for all!</b>

1368
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,541
<b>D, 16!</b>

<b>D, 16!</b>

<b>D, 16!</b>

<b>D, 16!</b>

<b>B, come on!</b>

1373
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:49,208
<b>Aah!</b>

1374
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,125
<b>Engage all hostile. I've got the bridge.</b>

1375
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
<b>Aah!</b>

1376
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,791
<b>I don't need it! Get down!</b>

1377
01:07:52,250 --> 01:08:04,625
<b>What the hell are you doing?</b>

1378
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:13,291
<b>I feel like someone</b>

1379
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,166
<b>dropped a cliff on me.</b>

1380
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,958
<b>Or where are the others?</b>

1381
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:19,583
<b>Sentinel's troops took as many prisoners</b>

1382
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:20,708
<b>as they could carry.</b>

1383
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,125
<b>They got D, 16 and B.</b>

1384
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,458
<b>Oh, no.</b>

1385
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,250
<b>And half of those high guard nut jobs.</b>

1386
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,166
<b>Our proof. It's gone.</b>

1387
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,375
<b>So, what do we do now?</b>

1388
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,666
<b>D was right.</b>

1389
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:38,208
<b>About what?</b>

1390
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,416
<b>Everything. Look at it, look around.</b>

1391
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,208
<b>This is a disaster.</b>

1392
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,458
<b>It's all my fault. I</b>

1393
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:46,875
<b>should have stayed on protocol.</b>

1394
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,083
<b>Listen to me. I really</b>

1395
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:56,500
<b>want you to hear this.</b>

1396
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:57,791
<b>Are you listening?</b>

1397
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:01,750
<b>I'm better than you.</b>

1398
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,875
<b>Yeah, okay. I'm hearing you.</b>

1399
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,708
<b>I'm better than you in</b>

<b>every way, except you have hope.</b>

1401
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:10,958
<b>You always have.</b>

1402
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,000
<b>If you went back into the mine to rescue</b>

1403
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,166
<b>Jaz, you snuck up to the surface to find</b>

1404
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,541
<b>the Matrix of Leadership.</b>

1405
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,375
<b>Yeah. And how'd that work out?</b>

1406
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:22,333
<b>My point is that your instincts tell you</b>

1407
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:24,625
<b>to break protocol for a reason.</b>

1408
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:29,041
<b>This blind optimism that you have is why</b>

1409
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:32,708
<b>you make such bold and courageous choices</b>

1410
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,541
<b>that are also extremely stupid.</b>

1411
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:37,958
<b>First time giving a pep talk?</b>

1412
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:41,000
<b>You're inspiring. You can envision a</b>

01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,375
<b>better future that no one else can see.</b>

1414
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,916
<b>And if we ever want to see B and D-16</b>

1415
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,416
<b>again, that is the Orion</b>

1416
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
<b>packs that we need right now.</b>

1417
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,583
<b>Listen to me. We can do this.</b>

1418
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
<b>Those Energon trains will be heading back</b>

1419
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:04,166
<b>to Iacon. If we intercepted one...</b>

1420
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,375
<b>Hell yes. I can re-route</b>

1421
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:06,625
<b>it. What else do we need?</b>

1422
