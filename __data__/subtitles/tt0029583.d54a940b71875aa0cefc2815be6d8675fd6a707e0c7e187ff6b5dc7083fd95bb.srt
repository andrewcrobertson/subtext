1
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:34,037
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,582
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,503
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:43,672
Speak!

5
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,217
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:52,347
What wouldst thou know,
my Queen?

7
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:55,225
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:58,395
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,983
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:07,195
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,574
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:17,622
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:21,751
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,796
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,882
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,427
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,430
Snow White!

18
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,633
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,510
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:17,307
<i>We are standing by a wishing well</i>

21
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,436
<i>Make a wish into the well</i>

22
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,147
<i>That's all you have to do</i>

23
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:27,317
<i>And if you hear it echoing</i>

24
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:30,820
<i>Your wish will soon come true</i>

25
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:35,658
<i>- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing</i>

26
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:38,495
<i>For the one I love</i>

27
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,956
<i>- To find me
- To find me</i>

28
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,667
<i>- Today
- Today</i>

29
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:48,338
<i>- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping</i>

30
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:51,508
<i>And I'm dreaming of</i>

31
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:54,886
<i>- The nice things
- The nice things</i>

32
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,847
<i>- He'll say
- He'll say</i>

33
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:14,656
<i>- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing</i>

34
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,534
<i>For the one I love</i>

35
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,037
<i>- To find me
- To find me</i>

36
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:24,874
<i>- Today
- Today</i>

37
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,544
Hello.

38
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,712
Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:32,882
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,510
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,222
<i>Now that I've found you</i>

42
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:43,601
<i>Hear what I have to say</i>

43
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:47,105
<i>One song</i>

44
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,775
<i>I have but one song</i>

45
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,239
<i>One song only for you</i>

46
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:04,372
<i>One heart tenderly beating</i>

47
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:08,293
<i>Ever entreating</i>

48
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:12,797
<i>Constant and true</i>

49
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:16,384
<i>One love</i>

50
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:20,263
<i>That has possessed me</i>

51
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,766
<i>One love</i>

52
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:28,438
<i>Thrilling me through</i>

53
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,941
<i>One song</i>

54
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:36,321
<i>My heart keeps singing</i>

55
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:39,949
<i>Of one love</i>

56
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:45,955
<i>Only for you</i>

57
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,972
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,309
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,937
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:11,147
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:15,026
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,487
you will kill her!

63
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,114
But, Your Majesty,
the little Princess!

64
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,699
Silence!

65
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:25,995
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,624
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:32,794
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,546
you do not fail,

69
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:40,843
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:53,356
<i>One song, I have but one song</i>

71
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:10,081
Hello there.

72
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:12,041
What's the matter?

73
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,836
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,505
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,049
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:27,515
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,184
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,228
That's better.

79
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,773
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,610
There they are!

81
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,364
Can you fly?

82
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:47,243
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,378
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:02,467
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,344
I don't understand!

86
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:07,055
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,474
- But, but who?
- The Queen.

88
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:10,558
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,061
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:16,147
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,109
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:24,322
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,530
Please don't run away.

94
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,283
I won't hurt you.

95
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:37,872
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

96
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,417
But you don't know
what I've been through.

97
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,212
And all because I was afraid.

98
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,882
I'm so ashamed of the fuss
I've made.

99
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,470
What do you do
when things go wrong?

100
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,891
You sing a song!

101
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:29,882
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

102
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:33,386
<i>Life is just like a bright,
sunny day</i>

103
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,806
<i>Your cares fade away</i>

104
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,601
<i>And your heart is young</i>

105
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,816
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

106
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,403
<i>All the world seems to waken anew</i>

107
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,656
<i>Rejoicing with you</i>

108
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:56,993
<i>As the song is sung</i>

109
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,872
<i>There's no use in grumbling</i>

110
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:05,334
<i>When raindrops come tumbling</i>

111
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:09,964
<i>Remember you're the one</i>

112
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:15,970
<i>Who can fill the world with sunshine</i>

113
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,682
<i>When you smile and you sing</i>

114
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:24,520
<i>Everything is in tune and it's spring</i>

115
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:28,024
<i>And life flows along</i>

116
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:33,195
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

117
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:40,786
I really feel quite happy now.

118
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,247
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

119
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:46,167
Everything's going to be all right.

120
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:50,504
But I do need a place
to sleep at night.

121
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:54,342
I can't sleep in the ground
like you

122
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,345
or in a tree the way you do.

123
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,016
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

124
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,686
Maybe you know where I can stay.

125
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,189
In the woods somewhere?

126
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,441
You do?

127
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,611
Will you take me there?

128
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,616
Oh, it's adorable!

129
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:04,161
Just like a doll's house.

130
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,010
I like it here.

131
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,775
Ooh, it's dark inside.

132
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,455
Guess there's no one home.

133
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,501
Hello?

134
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:54,628
May I come in?

135
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,242
What a cute little chair!

136
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,331
Why, there's seven little chairs!

137
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,917
Must be seven little children.

138
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:37,546
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

139
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:43,552
A pickaxe. A stocking too!

140
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,892
And a shoe!

141
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:57,650
And just look at that fireplace.

142
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,610
It's covered with dust.

143
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,411
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

144
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:12,373
My, my, my!

145
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,708
What a pile of dirty dishes!

146
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,421
And just look at that broom!

147
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,052
Why, they've never swept this room.

148
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:28,389
You'd think their mother would...

149
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,058
Maybe they have no mother.

150
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:33,978
Then they're orphans.

151
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,438
That's too bad.

152
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,275
I know!

153
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,902
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

154
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,405
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

155
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,080
Now, you wash the dishes.

156
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,416
You tidy up the room.

157
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,377
You clean the fireplace.

158
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,462
And I will use the broom.

159
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,847
<i>Just whistle while you work</i>

160
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:16,979
<i>And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place</i>

161
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,315
<i>So hum a merry tune</i>

162
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:26,322
<i>It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace</i>

163
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:28,657
<i>And as you sweep the room</i>

164
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,868
<i>Imagine that the broom</i>

165
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:36,165
<i>Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune</i>

166
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:40,127
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Put them in the tub.

167
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,671
<i>When hearts are high the time will fly</i>

168
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:45,007
<i>So whistle while you work</i>

169
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,352
Not under the rug.

170
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:08,609
<i>So whistle while you work</i>

171
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,594
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

172
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:37,846
<i>In our mine the whole day through</i>

173
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:42,559
<i>To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do</i>

174
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,812
<i>It ain't no trick to get rich quick</i>

175
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,106
<i>If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick</i>

176
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,525
<i>- In a mine
- In a mine</i>

177
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,860
<i>- In a mine
- In a mine</i>

178
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:56,657
<i>- Where a million diamonds
- Shine</i>

179
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:58,826
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

180
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,161
<i>From early morn 'til night</i>

181
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:05,874
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight</i>

182
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,377
<i>We dig up diamonds by the score</i>

183
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:10,629
<i>A thousand rubies,
sometimes more</i>

184
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,923
<i>Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for</i>

185
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:15,259
<i>We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig</i>

186
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:47,082
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

187
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,711
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

188
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:53,338
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

189
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,841
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

190
00:22:55,925 --> 00:23:00,262
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

191
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:05,350
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

192
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:10,147
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

193
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,443
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

194
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:26,580
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

195
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:30,959
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho...</i>

196
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:35,839
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

197
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,302
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

198
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:44,640
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

199
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,645
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

200
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:54,274
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

201
00:23:56,611 --> 00:24:03,116
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...</i>

202
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:16,713
Let's see what's upstairs.

203
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:42,531
Oh, what adorable little beds!

204
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,828
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

205
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,872
Doc, Happy,

206
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,666
Sneezy, Dopey...

207
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,502
What funny names for children!

208
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:59,298
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

209
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,302
I'm a little sleepy myself.

210
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:37,377
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

211
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:42,549
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

212
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:47,679
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

213
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,267
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

214
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:57,064
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

215
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,994
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

216
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,749
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's home from work we go</i>

217
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,337
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

218
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:24,925
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,

219
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:29,012
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...</i>

220
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:30,389
Look!

221
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,268
Our house! The lit's light...
The light's lit.

222
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,776
Jiminy Crickets!

223
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:45,362
- The door is open.
- The chimney's smoking.

224
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:46,947
- Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

225
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,615
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

226
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,117
Or a dragon.

227
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,662
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

228
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,165
Felt it coming all day.
My corns hurt.

229
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,960
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

230
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,087
- What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

231
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:04,923
Yes. We'll squeak up...
Sneak up.

232
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:07,467
Come on, hen... Men.
Follow me.

233
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,727
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

234
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,188
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...

235
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,023
Search everywhere.

236
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,045
Quiet.

237
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:32,385
Look!
The floor, it's been swept!

238
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:38,558
Chair's been dusted!

239
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:41,394
Our window's been washed.

240
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:44,272
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

241
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,567
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

242
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:50,445
There's dirty work afoot.

243
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,573
Sink's empty.

244
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,576
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

245
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,288
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

246
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,376
My cup's been washed.

247
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:06,711
Sugar's gone.

248
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,924
Something's cooking.

249
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:13,593
Smells good!

250
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,888
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

251
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,144
See? It's witches' brew.

252
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,607
Look what's happened
to our stable... Table.

253
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,110
Flowers!

254
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:33,071
Look, goldenrod.

255
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:36,783
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

256
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:40,954
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I...

257
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:49,504
Thanks!

258
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:57,804
Hey!

259
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,480
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

260
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,317
I couldn't help it.
I can't tell.

261
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:13,862
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

262
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,698
It's coming.

263
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,744
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

264
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:24,914
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

265
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,374
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

266
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,917
Make a hard knot.

267
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:30,128
There, that will hold him.

268
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,173
Thanks!

269
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,509
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

270
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,018
- What's that?
- That's it.

271
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,855
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

272
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,714
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

273
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:20,053
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

274
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,263
Up. Down.

275
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:42,242
Here, take it.

276
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:45,245
Don't be nervous.

277
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,931
Don't be afraid.
We're right behind you.

278
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,142
Yes! Right behind ya.

279
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:50,852
Here it comes!

280
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:02,489
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

281
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:04,157
Hold it shut.

282
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,378
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

283
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:18,588
Get it now!

284
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:19,964
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

285
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,050
Don't let it get away!

286
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:28,139
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

287
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:30,058
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

288
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:32,685
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

289
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,979
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

290
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:36,898
What was it doin'?

291
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,405
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

292
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,449
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

293
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:47,575
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

294
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:50,036
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

295
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,663
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

296
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,498
We'll kill it dead.

297
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:22,318
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

298
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,195
- Gee!
- What a monster!

299
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,864
It covers three beds.

300
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,575
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

301
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,535
Which end do we kill?

302
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:00,440
Well...

303
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:04,944
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!

304
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,781
She's mighty purdy.

305
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:13,453
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

306
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,956
Angel, hah! She's a female!

307
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,960
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

308
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:24,130
What are wicked wiles?

309
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,633
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

310
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,136
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

311
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:33,306
Let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

312
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,849
- Look out.
- She's movin'.

313
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:37,018
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

314
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:38,478
Hide.

315
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:44,484
Oh, dear.

316
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:48,655
I wonder if the children are...

317
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,001
Why, why, you're little men!

318
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,342
How do you do?

319
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,517
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

320
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:20,895
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

321
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:24,649
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

322
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,652
I know, you're Doc.

323
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:31,531
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.

324
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:35,535
And you're, you're Bashful.

325
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:39,038
Oh, gosh!

326
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,918
And you, you're Sleepy.

327
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:46,045
How'd you guess?

328
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:50,049
And you?

329
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,262
And you're Sneezy.

330
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:02,729
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

331
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:05,690
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

332
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:09,402
- You mean he can't talk?
- He don't know. He never tried.

333
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,904
Oh, that's too bad.

334
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:19,704
You must be Grumpy.

335
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:22,457
Oh, yes! Yes!

336
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,918
Hah! We know who we are.

337
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:29,255
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

338
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,133
Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

339
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:35,344
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

340
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:38,014
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

341
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:39,891
- Snow White?
- The Princess?

342
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,100
Yes.

343
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:45,646
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Princess.

344
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:48,191
We're, we're honored.
Yes, we're, we're...

345
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:51,319
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

346
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:55,156
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

347
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:57,450
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

348
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,244
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

349
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,123
- Who's... Gutter...
- Shut up and tell her to get out!

350
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,709
Please don't send me away!

351
00:38:06,794 --> 00:38:08,878
- If you do, she'll kill me.
- Kill you?

352
00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:10,129
- Who will?
- Yes, who?

353
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,215
- My stepmother, the Queen.
- The Queen?

354
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,841
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

355
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:17,011
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

356
00:38:17,137 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm warnin' ya.

357
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,598
If the Queen finds her here,

358
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:24,143
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

359
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,813
But she doesn't know where I am!

360
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:29,816
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

361
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,485
She's full of black magic.

362
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:35,655
She can even make herself invisible.

363
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:40,493
Might be in this room right now.

364
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,333
Oh, she'll never find me here.

365
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,962
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

366
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:53,673
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

367
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,966
Cook?

368
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,635
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?

369
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,263
- Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!

370
00:39:00,347 --> 00:39:01,973
Crapple dumpkins.

371
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,225
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

372
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:07,520
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!

373
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,127
Soup!

374
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,670
Hooray!

375
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,397
Just a minute.

376
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:56,444
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

377
00:39:57,404 --> 00:39:59,363
Wash? Wash?

378
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:03,034
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

379
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,706
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

380
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,791
'Tain't New Year's.

381
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:14,003
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

382
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:15,713
Perhaps we...

383
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:20,927
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

384
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,472
When? When. You said whe...

385
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:29,477
Why, last week. Why, recently!

386
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,731
Yes, recently!

387
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:37,235
Oh, recently!

388
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:40,613
Let me see your hands.

389
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,121
Let me see your hands!

390
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:57,797
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

391
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:03,803
Come on, let's see them.

392
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:08,015
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

393
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,934
And you?

394
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,606
Worse than I thought!

395
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:21,279
How shocking!

396
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,367
Goodness me, this will never do.

397
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:32,498
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

398
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,995
Well, aren't you going to wash?

399
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,875
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

400
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,721
Did you hurt yourself?

401
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:42,735
Hah, women!

402
00:42:44,613 --> 00:42:46,530
Courage, men, courage.

403
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,742
Don't be nervous.

404
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,247
Gosh, it's wet!

405
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:58,918
It's cold too!

406
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:01,670
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

407
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:04,590
Well, it'll please the Princess.

408
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:07,051
I'll take a chance for her!

409
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,427
Me too!

410
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,806
Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

411
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:15,017
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

412
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:17,311
and they'll walk all over ya!

413
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:20,898
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

414
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:24,151
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

415
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:25,569
Do ya get in the tub?

416
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:28,155
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

417
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:31,409
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

418
00:43:31,493 --> 00:43:34,328
<i>Step up to the tub,
'tain't no disgrace</i>

419
00:43:34,454 --> 00:43:37,248
<i>Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place</i>

420
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:41,001
<i>Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go...</i>

421
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:46,924
<i>Pick up the soap,
now don't try to bluff</i>

422
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:49,427
<i>Work up a lather
and when you got enough</i>

423
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:53,639
<i>Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...</i>

424
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:58,519
<i>You douse and you souse,
rub and you scrub</i>

425
00:43:58,645 --> 00:44:01,480
<i>You sputter and splash
all over the tub</i>

426
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:04,358
<i>You may be cold
and wet when you're done</i>

427
00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:07,319
<i>But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun</i>

428
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:10,281
<i>So splash all you like,
'tain't any trick</i>

429
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,784
<i>As soon as you're through
you'll feel mighty slick</i>

430
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:17,496
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

431
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,722
Next thing ya know

432
00:44:34,848 --> 00:44:37,975
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

433
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:42,521
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called perfoom.

434
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:12,343
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

435
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:17,431
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

436
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:50,881
Get him!

437
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,134
Hey, let go of me!

438
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:56,845
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

439
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,014
Let me loose, you fools!
Let me loose!

440
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,976
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

441
00:46:02,102 --> 00:46:04,562
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

442
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:09,441
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

443
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:15,948
Get the soap!

444
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:28,627
- Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

445
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:38,762
Never say die. Never say die.

446
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,347
You don't...

447
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:04,330
<i>Now, scrub good and hard,
it can't be denied</i>

448
00:47:04,456 --> 00:47:06,957
<i>That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried</i>

449
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:11,128
<i>Well, it's good for the soul,
and it's good for the hide to go...</i>

450
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:28,354
Ain't he sweet?

451
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,190
Smells like a petunia.

452
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,651
He sure is cute!

453
00:47:34,736 --> 00:47:37,029
You'll pay dearly for this!

454
00:47:37,364 --> 00:47:38,864
Supper!

455
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,993
- Supper!
- Food. Hooray!

456
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,476
Magic Mirror on the wall,

457
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,896
who now is the fairest one of all?

458
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,858
Over the seven jeweled hills

459
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,486
beyond the seventh fall,

460
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,072
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

461
00:48:20,532 --> 00:48:24,868
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

462
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:29,998
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

463
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,751
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

464
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:36,255
Behold her heart.

465
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:39,758
Snow White still lives,

466
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,969
the fairest in the land.

467
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:46,807
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

468
00:48:47,642 --> 00:48:49,435
The heart of a pig!

469
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:52,104
Then I've been tricked!

470
00:49:15,462 --> 00:49:17,504
The heart of a pig!

471
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:20,132
The blundering fool!

472
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:23,927
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

473
00:49:24,012 --> 00:49:26,930
in a disguise so complete

474
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:30,476
no one will ever suspect.

475
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:37,691
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

476
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:42,154
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

477
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:46,992
Mummy dust to make me old.

478
00:49:48,328 --> 00:49:51,455
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

479
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,214
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

480
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:11,683
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

481
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:17,856
A blast of wind

482
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,401
to fan my hate!

483
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:25,155
A thunderbolt

484
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,201
to mix it well.

485
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,246
Now,

486
00:50:33,248 --> 00:50:36,375
begin thy magic spell.

487
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:01,066
Look!

488
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,402
My hands!

489
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:10,742
My voice!

490
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:13,954
My voice.

491
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:21,086
A perfect disguise.

492
00:51:25,425 --> 00:51:27,092
And now...

493
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:31,096
A special sort of death

494
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:33,765
for one so fair.

495
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,435
What shall it be?

496
00:51:39,439 --> 00:51:41,648
A poisoned apple!

497
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:44,484
Sleeping Death.

498
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:47,798
<i>I'd like to dance and tap my feet</i>

499
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:49,800
<i>But they won't keep in rhythm</i>

500
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:53,929
<i>You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em</i>

501
00:52:54,013 --> 00:52:57,933
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb,
the words don't mean a thing</i>

502
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:01,687
<i>Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?</i>

503
00:53:14,075 --> 00:53:15,367
I...

504
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,583
Oh, gosh!

505
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:32,342
<i>I chased a polecat up a tree,
way out upon a limb</i>

506
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:36,555
<i>And when he got the best of me,
I got the worst of him</i>

507
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:40,559
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb,
the words don't mean a thing</i>

508
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:44,438
<i>Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?</i>

509
00:54:54,884 --> 00:54:57,552
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

510
00:54:57,678 --> 00:54:59,638
Watch... Watch...

511
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,059
Thanks.

512
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:52,607
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

513
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:54,568
Hey! Hey!

514
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:04,202
Hooray!

515
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:44,993
That was fun!

516
00:56:45,077 --> 00:56:46,828
Now you do something.

517
00:56:46,913 --> 00:56:48,538
Well, what shall I do?

518
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:52,167
- Tell us a story.
- Yes, tell us a story.

519
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:55,253
- A true story.
- A love story.

520
00:56:55,755 --> 00:56:59,341
Well, once there was a princess.

521
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:02,010
Was the princess you?

522
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:05,180
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

523
00:57:05,264 --> 00:57:07,474
Oh, it was very easy.

524
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,810
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

525
00:57:11,437 --> 00:57:13,021
The only one for me.

526
00:57:13,105 --> 00:57:15,690
Was he strong and handsome?

527
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,525
Was he big and tall?

528
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,363
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

529
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:23,490
Did he say he loved ya?

530
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:25,617
Did he steal a kiss?

531
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:28,870
<i>He was so romantic</i>

532
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:33,875
<i>I could not resist</i>

533
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:49,140
<i>Some day my prince will come</i>

534
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:54,980
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

535
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:01,653
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

536
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,032
<i>To be happy forever</i>

537
00:58:06,158 --> 00:58:08,243
<i>I know</i>

538
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:17,585
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

539
00:58:18,504 --> 00:58:23,758
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

540
00:58:24,593 --> 00:58:29,431
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

541
00:58:30,516 --> 00:58:35,270
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

542
00:58:36,772 --> 00:58:42,193
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

543
00:58:42,862 --> 00:58:46,239
<i>Come true</i>

544
00:58:58,878 --> 00:59:00,837
Oh, my goodness!

545
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:02,839
It's past bedtime.

546
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:04,924
Go right upstairs to bed.

547
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:09,554
Wait! Hold on there, men!

548
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:15,643
The Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

549
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:17,270
But where will you sleep?

550
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:22,150
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in... in...

551
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:23,401
In a pig's eye!

552
00:59:23,486 --> 00:59:26,654
In a pig's eye... Sty.
No, no! I mean...

553
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:29,449
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

554
00:59:29,992 --> 00:59:32,619
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

555
00:59:32,745 --> 00:59:35,622
Now don't you worry about us.

556
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:40,752
- We'll be all right, ma'am.
- Go right on up now, my dear.

557
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:43,088
Well, if you insist.

558
00:59:45,091 --> 00:59:46,633
Good night.

559
00:59:46,759 --> 00:59:48,593
Good night, Princess.

560
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:53,556
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

561
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:56,935
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

562
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,021
Well, pleasant dreams.

563
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,024
Pleasant dreams.

564
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:09,239
Let go!

565
01:00:09,323 --> 01:00:11,157
- I saw it first!
- Now, men, don't get excited.

566
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:13,576
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

567
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:15,995
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

568
01:00:30,302 --> 01:00:33,847
Bless the seven little men
who have been so kind to me.

569
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:38,393
And... And may my dreams come true.

570
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:40,145
Amen.

571
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:44,566
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

572
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,402
Women!

573
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:55,743
A fine kettle of fish!

574
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:42,517
Dip the apple in the brew.

575
01:02:43,352 --> 01:02:46,980
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

576
01:02:57,783 --> 01:03:00,702
Look! On the skin!

577
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:04,872
The symbol of what lies within.

578
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:10,211
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

579
01:03:10,629 --> 01:03:13,047
To make her hunger for a bite.

580
01:03:16,343 --> 01:03:17,969
Have a bite?

581
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,182
It's not for you.

582
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:25,560
It's for Snow White.

583
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:29,314
When she breaks the tender peel

584
01:03:29,815 --> 01:03:32,150
to taste the apple in my hand,

585
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:35,987
her breath will still,
her blood congeal.

586
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:39,907
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

587
01:03:42,703 --> 01:03:44,162
But wait!

588
01:03:45,748 --> 01:03:48,082
There may be an antidote.

589
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,335
Nothing must be overlooked.

590
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:55,089
Oh, here it is!

591
01:04:05,517 --> 01:04:07,935
Love's First Kiss.

592
01:04:09,938 --> 01:04:11,773
No fear of that.

593
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,734
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

594
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:18,363
She'll be buried alive!

595
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:32,418
Buried alive!

596
01:04:44,139 --> 01:04:45,473
Thirsty?

597
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,642
Have a drink!

598
01:05:48,162 --> 01:05:49,871
Now, don't forget, my dear.

599
01:05:49,955 --> 01:05:52,623
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

600
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,751
full of witchcraft.

601
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:57,044
So beware of strangers.

602
01:05:57,546 --> 01:06:00,214
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

603
01:06:02,718 --> 01:06:04,385
See you tonight.

604
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:09,223
Yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

605
01:06:13,729 --> 01:06:15,396
Be awful careful

606
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:19,233
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

607
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:23,488
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!

608
01:06:24,865 --> 01:06:27,492
Disgustin'!

609
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:31,204
And be sure to watch out...
to wa... to wa...

610
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,830
To wa...

611
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:34,665
Watch out.

612
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:37,376
Thanks.

613
01:07:06,406 --> 01:07:08,908
Well... All right.

614
01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:13,830
But that's the last...

615
01:07:15,374 --> 01:07:17,416
Oh, go on. Run along.

616
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:23,256
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's off to work we go</i>

617
01:07:25,884 --> 01:07:26,884
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

618
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,095
Good-bye! Good-bye!

619
01:07:30,722 --> 01:07:35,017
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

620
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:38,354
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

621
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,979
Good-bye, Grumpy!

622
01:08:30,824 --> 01:08:33,951
The little men will be away

623
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:36,579
and she'll be all alone

624
01:08:37,122 --> 01:08:40,625
with a harmless old peddler woman.

625
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,130
A harmless old peddler woman!

626
01:08:56,266 --> 01:09:01,020
<i>Some day my prince will come</i>

627
01:09:01,813 --> 01:09:06,776
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

628
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:11,697
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

629
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:16,869
<i>To be happy forever I know</i>

630
01:09:19,665 --> 01:09:24,460
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

631
01:09:25,212 --> 01:09:29,382
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

632
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:34,053
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

633
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:39,183
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

634
01:09:39,851 --> 01:09:43,646
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

635
01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:46,899
<i>Come true</i>

636
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:57,076
All alone, my pet?

637
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,705
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

638
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:04,417
The, the little men are not here?

639
01:10:05,419 --> 01:10:07,545
No, they're not, but...

640
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:12,717
Making pies?

641
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:15,678
Yes, gooseberry pies.

642
01:10:15,762 --> 01:10:18,014
It's apple pies

643
01:10:18,098 --> 01:10:21,392
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

644
01:10:22,394 --> 01:10:26,772
Pies made from apples like these.

645
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:31,861
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

646
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:35,406
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

647
01:10:39,953 --> 01:10:41,787
Like to try one?

648
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:47,293
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

649
01:10:54,926 --> 01:10:57,636
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

650
01:10:57,763 --> 01:11:00,598
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

651
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:04,310
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

652
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:09,106
There, there. I'm sorry.

653
01:11:09,608 --> 01:11:12,109
Oh! My heart!

654
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:15,154
Oh, my... My poor heart.

655
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:19,116
Take me into the house and let me rest.

656
01:11:19,785 --> 01:11:22,328
A drink of water, please.

657
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:54,318
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

658
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:58,656
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
it's off to work we go</i>

659
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:02,993
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

660
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:19,385
Hey, look!

661
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:27,643
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

662
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:29,562
Go on! Get outta here!

663
01:12:34,526 --> 01:12:36,735
What ails these crazy birds?

664
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:38,988
They've gone plumb daffy.

665
01:12:39,072 --> 01:12:40,906
Yeah, they've...

666
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:50,833
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

667
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:54,044
I'll share a secret with you.

668
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:56,714
This is no ordinary apple.

669
01:12:57,215 --> 01:12:59,425
It's a magic wishing apple.

670
01:13:00,552 --> 01:13:02,261
A wishing apple?

671
01:13:02,387 --> 01:13:03,721
Yes!

672
01:13:04,222 --> 01:13:08,767
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

673
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:11,854
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

674
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:15,024
Now, make a wish

675
01:13:15,734 --> 01:13:17,443
and take a bite.

676
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:20,196
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

677
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,947
- 'Tain't natural.
- There's something wrong.

678
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,909
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

679
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,787
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

680
01:13:28,914 --> 01:13:30,581
- The Queen!
- Snow White!

681
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,083
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

682
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,628
Yes! Yes!
We, we, we gotta save her!

683
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:37,171
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

684
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:39,465
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

685
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:42,801
Come on! Giddap!

686
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:54,730
Wait for me! Wait for...

687
01:14:08,954 --> 01:14:13,165
There must be something
your little heart desires.

688
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,627
Perhaps there's someone you love.

689
01:14:17,254 --> 01:14:19,213
Well, there is someone.

690
01:14:19,297 --> 01:14:21,674
I thought so. I thought so!

691
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:26,553
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

692
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:29,515
Now, take the apple, dearie,

693
01:14:29,641 --> 01:14:31,183
and make a wish.

694
01:14:33,645 --> 01:14:36,105
I wish... I wish...

695
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:38,482
That's it, go on! Go on.

696
01:14:52,205 --> 01:14:55,207
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

697
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:59,586
where we will live happily ever after.

698
01:14:59,671 --> 01:15:02,631
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

699
01:15:07,053 --> 01:15:09,305
Don't let the wish grow cold!

700
01:15:11,057 --> 01:15:14,059
Oh, I feel strange.

701
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:19,148
Her breath will still.

702
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:23,527
Her blood congeal.

703
01:15:34,205 --> 01:15:37,875
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

704
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:48,052
Hurry, hurry.

705
01:15:53,892 --> 01:15:55,517
There she goes!

706
01:16:15,455 --> 01:16:16,914
After her!

707
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:49,113
I'm trapped! What will I do?

708
01:16:49,948 --> 01:16:52,366
The meddling little fools!

709
01:16:57,288 --> 01:17:01,208
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

710
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:05,045
I'll fix ya!
I'll crush your bones!

711
01:17:06,464 --> 01:17:08,132
Look out!

712
01:19:16,177 --> 01:19:19,680
<i>- One song
- One song</i>

713
01:19:19,764 --> 01:19:24,268
<i>I have but one song</i>

714
01:19:24,394 --> 01:19:26,937
<i>- One song
- One song</i>

715
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:31,775
<i>- Only for you
- For you</i>

716
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,861
<i>One heart</i>

717
01:19:34,946 --> 01:19:38,615
<i>Tenderly beating</i>

718
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:42,452
<i>Ever entreating</i>

719
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:48,458
<i>- Constant and true
- So true</i>

720
01:19:48,543 --> 01:19:51,878
<i>- One love
- One love</i>

721
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:55,966
<i>That has possessed me</i>

722
01:19:56,593 --> 01:19:59,553
<i>- One love
- One love</i>

723
01:19:59,637 --> 01:20:04,891
<i>- Thrilling me through
- So true</i>

724
01:20:04,976 --> 01:20:08,145
<i>- One song
- One song</i>

725
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:12,774
<i>- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing</i>

726
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:18,155
<i>- Of one love
- One love</i>

727
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:24,661
<i>Only for you...</i>

728
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:56,777
<i>And away to his castle you'll go</i>

729
01:20:57,862 --> 01:21:02,866
<i>To be happy forever we know</i>

730
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:42,698
Good-bye.

731
01:21:46,077 --> 01:21:47,828
Good-bye, Grumpy.

732
01:21:48,538 --> 01:21:50,080
Good-bye.

733
01:21:57,422 --> 01:21:59,089
Oh, Dopey.

734
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:04,720
Good-bye!

735
01:22:20,945 --> 01:22:26,199
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

736
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:31,955
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

737
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:36,209
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

738
01:22:36,294 --> 01:22:40,964
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

739
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:45,218
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

740
01:22:45,303 --> 01:22:48,597
<i>Come true!</i>
