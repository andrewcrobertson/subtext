1
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,106
You lost your adolescent already?

2
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,317
This will complicate matters...

3
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,779
A young one is on the way,

4
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:38,534
but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.

5
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:13,244
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

6
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,314
Beth.

7
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,151
Keenish.

8
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,036
Mr. König.

9
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,687
Herr... Konish?

10
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,723
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

11
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,591
'Ö.' "Herr König."

12
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,827
Where's Gretchen?

13
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,264
Gretchen and the movers
are right behind us.

14
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,001
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

15
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,639
No, she's Beth.

16
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,544
Ah, okay.

17
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:49,480
And what is going on
with your sister?

18
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,882
She deaf or something?

19
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:53,918
-No.

20
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,721
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

21
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,075
You okay, honey?

22
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:22,046
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

23
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,049
Oh!

24
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,483
Good afternoon.

25
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,071
Good afternoon, Mr. König.

26
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,565
Ah, very good, Luis!

27
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,401
You've been practicing, huh?

28
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,603
How was your journey?

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,271
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

30
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,507
We almost forgot
how beautiful it is here.

31
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:52,143
Ah,
we almost forgot
how beautiful you are, Beth.

32
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,544
-Oh, stop!

33
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:55,246
Keep going!

34
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:58,115
Gretchen, come say hi.

35
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,386
Gretchen.

36
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,089
-What's up?
-Oh, Jesus.

37
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,358
Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.

38
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,392
Thank you.

39
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,726
No, thank you, Beth.

40
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:12,096
We are so glad to have you back.

41
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,732
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

42
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,001
I completely understand.

43
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:20,137
We have something
for you.

44
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,672
It's...

46
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,543
The original sketch.

47
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,711
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

48
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,514
the land you acquired.

49
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,583
Beth, that is...

50
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:37,588
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

51
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,424
- Oh!
- You know, you two lovebirds

52
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:45,362
stumbled into my nest
almost eight years ago
to the day.

53
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,164
And I believe there were more

54
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,934
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

55
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,169
Hello, Alma.

56
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,482
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

57
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,692
The pleasure is all mine.

58
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,078
Your German
is already better
than your father's, huh?

59
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,031
Yes.
- "Yes", she says!

60
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,350
Ja, ja.

61
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,390
Hey, Gretchen.
How are you holding up?

62
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,694
I wish we could have spent
a little more time together
after the funeral,

63
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,329
but I get it.

64
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,798
You're all over Europe
with your dad's family, huh?

65
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,969
Don't forget you have a band
that needs your voice.

66
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,971
Anyway, I'm sending you
the new mix.

67
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,106
I knew your mom
would have loved it.

68
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,520
Beth? It's occupied.

69
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,652
Gretchen, let's go!

70
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,921
Herr König is taking us
to the new house.

71
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,890
Can you sit with Alma
this time?

72
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,189
Car? What?
Car what?

73
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,891
What?

74
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,400
Hello there!

75
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,946
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

76
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,482
I have my hands full.

77
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,184
Oh, me too.

78
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,954
Are you the housekeeper?

79
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,756
No, I'm a daughter.

80
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,391
Oh, really?

81
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,126
Haven't heard about you.

82
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:11,562
Are you from England as well?

83
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,863
No, I'm not.

84
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,132
Why would you have heard
about me?

85
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:16,767
I told...

86
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,135
Jesus.

87
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,703
Forgive me, my dear.

88
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,207
Didn't mean to startle you.

89
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,742
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

90
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:29,246
Dr. Bonomo is the medical
superintendent
of the local hospital

91
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:33,150
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

92
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,385
which I am also funding.

93
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,255
This is Gretchen.

94
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,590
Gretchen.

95
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:41,926
Yeah.

96
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,462
Gretchen is from
the United States.

97
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:49,566
It has been decided
that she is moving in
with her father.

98
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,771
What a pleasant surprise.

99
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:05,015
Hi,
you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.

100
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,317
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,

101
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,820
but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,

102
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:12,256
so get ready to say it.

103
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,160
Hi, mom.

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,234
I know this is weird, um...

105
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:28,071
But it's good to hear
your voice.

106
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:35,212
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

107
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,783
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

108
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,031
I know it's been tough.

109
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,399
But we are very happy
you're here.

110
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,769
Excuse me.

111
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,705
Gretchen, my dear.

112
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,008
I, uh...

113
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:08,579
I've been thinking,
for a young woman like you

114
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,650
there's... not so many things
to do here during the summer,
and so...

115
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,120
I have a little idea.

116
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:22,192
A proposal. How would you like
to come work for me
at the resort?

117
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,895
Oh, Herr König...

118
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,462
Well,
it's an easy job,

119
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,364
and it will give you
something to do

120
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,299
while your parents build
the new resort for me.

121
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,169
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

122
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,104
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

123
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,074
I would pay you
an appropriate salary,
of course.

124
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,475
I don't...
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

125
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,116
Oh.

126
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:47,618
Schön.

127
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:49,252
Wonderful.

128
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,222
Come by the reception tomorrow.

129
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,326
Here's your ID badge,
sir.

130
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:59,196
Would you like to pay
with cash or credit card?

131
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,401
Cash, or credit?

132
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,404
Cash.

133
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,774
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

134
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,811
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

135
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,951
Oh, and this is Beatrice

136
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,352
and I am Gretchen.

137
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,553
Can I go now?

138
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,554
No.

139
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,142
You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.

140
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:34,665
You have to be polite
and friendly,
even if the guest is rude.

141
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,668
And remember to put up the sign
if you go to the bathroom.

142
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:41,238
But if you have
any real trouble,
just call the boss.

143
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,775
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

144
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,478
He lives in a vacation
bungalow?

145
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,916
No, he has a villa way up there.

146
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,451
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

147
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:57,320
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

148
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,823
Weird, right?

149
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:01,025
Super.

150
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,016
I'm so sorry.

151
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,851
No problem.

152
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,471
This happens
sometimes.

153
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,243
How's your first day, my dear?

154
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,315
Can't complain.

155
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,952
And how is your German
coming along?

156
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,687
Not good.

157
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,091
This is okay.

158
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:35,993
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

159
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:38,196
over the border, in Italy.

160
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:47,537
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

161
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,675
Oh, I have my bike.

162
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:52,776
Oh?

163
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,544
No.

164
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,313
No, no, no.

165
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:00,751
No, it will be too dark
on the country roads by then.

166
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:03,320
This is why you
will not work late.

167
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,757
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

168
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,291
What?

169
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,261
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

170
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:14,232
-You have a car.

171
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:15,867
-I have a life, too.

172
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,104
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

173
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:21,605
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

174
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,274
-No. Every time I raise
an issue with you,

175
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:26,210
there is something
you have to say about it.

176
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,378
-I do everything you ask!
-No.

177
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,981
-What? I work every day
late shifts!

178
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,782
-You're blasting your
Scheisse music on the car radio

179
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,050
on your way to work.

180
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:35,086
I hear it across the forest.

181
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,653
This is a nature reserve

182
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,122
and you are disturbing
the wildlife

183
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,856
with your 'boom, boom...'

184
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:12,089
They can dance on the carpet...

185
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:17,387
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

186
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,447
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

187
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:10,875
Gretchen, turn it down!

188
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:12,475
Alma?

189
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:16,147
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

190
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:24,288
What happened
to your face?

191
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:29,060
My father's daughter
scratched me.

192
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:31,461
Your sister?

193
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,931
-She's not my sister.
-Oh.

194
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,266
Come on now.

195
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,568
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

196
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,676
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

197
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:53,783
It's called vanishing twin
syndrome.

198
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:58,521
It's when one fetus dies
in the early stages
of the pregnancy

199
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,960
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

200
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,729
I always thought
it was kind of badass.

201
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,133
But yeah, she's a bitch.

202
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:12,669
Okay.

203
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,975
Another reason to not have kids.

204
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,710
Thanks for finishing my shift.

205
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,747
Erik and I haven't been
on a date in ages.

206
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,548
Here's my master key.

207
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,052
There's only one. Don't lose it.

208
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,256
And at 10 p.m. sharp
you lock everything up
like I showed you.

209
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,591
And boss doesn't
need to know.

210
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:36,227
It's fine.

211
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,161
Okay.

212
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,682
Good luck tonight!

213
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,802
Uh-huh.

214
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,804
Can I get a room?

215
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,242
May I see your ID or passport?

216
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,011
You can't just ask for my name?

217
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,618
Uhm...

218
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:37,521
Is it just you...

219
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,757
or are you here with a partner?

220
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:43,793
We have special rates
and amenities

221
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,031
for couples and newlyweds.

222
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,069
For now, just me.

223
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,171
Okay.

224
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,977
I'm Ed.

225
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,281
What's your name?

226
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,218
I'm Gretchen.

227
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,056
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

228
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:17,027
I won't be here
for long anyways.

229
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,734
-You like music?

230
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,874
Sure.

231
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:36,313
Then you should come to Paris.

232
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:43,820
Okay.

233
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,242
Hey!

234
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,981
Is this normal?

235
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:14,318
It's only my second day.

236
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,986
-Better go check on her.

237
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,189
Uh-huh.

238
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:29,766
Resort Alpschatten...

239
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,394
Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?
I can see the light from...

240
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,206
Gretchen?

241
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,441
-Yes.
-Where's Beatrix?

242
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,710
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

243
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,447
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

244
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:44,847
Gretchen.

245
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:46,917
I want you to lock the doors
and wait for me,

246
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,053
I will come pick you up
right now.

247
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,020
Uh...

248
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:53,924
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

249
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,361
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

250
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,664
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

251
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,032
Gretchen, listen to me
carefully.

252
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,733
I need you to lock the doors...

253
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,868
Fuck no.

254
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,661
Yes, okay. Call me back.

255
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,209
Damn it.

256
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,755
Shit.

257
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,525
Gretchen?

258
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,844
Where are you?

259
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,682
Where are you? Come here.

260
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,140
Hello!

261
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:06,210
Please let me in!

262
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,128
Yes?

263
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,081
Please let me in right now!
Please!

264
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,132
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

265
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,442
I told you I'm coming!

266
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,131
I started bleeding.

267
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:05,469
The woman stood there
until the police arrived.

268
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:07,906
-I was chased.

269
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,606
Fuck!

270
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:14,845
It's really important
that your statement
is as accurate as possible.

271
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:20,350
The receptionist, she stated
that she did not see any woman
in the parking lot.

272
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,854
May I suggest...

273
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:27,491
we change the last part into...

274
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:33,130
"The woman stood there
until Mrs. So-and-so
entered the room...

275
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,832
"Then the police arrived."

276
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,305
That is so much better.

277
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,774
I think...

278
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,045
you are the victim of a prank.

279
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:51,081
Everybody
is very nice here, honey.

280
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:53,083
It's best we run some tests,

281
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:55,352
but this is actually
very common.

282
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:59,856
-Dad.
-Gretchen?

283
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,458
What happened?

284
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:02,526
Did you fall?

285
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,461
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

286
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,730
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

287
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,231
We need to get her checked out.

288
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:10,167
Dad, I was attacked.

289
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:13,938
-By who?
-I don't know, the cops think
it was a prank...

290
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:15,873
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

291
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:18,375
No, I fell, but...
- Gretchen?

292
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,415
She fell, it's okay.

293
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,153
We are going
to do an MRI...

294
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,838
It might be childhood epilepsy.

295
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:50,641
Epilepsy?

296
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:51,708
It might be?

297
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,011
It means it might be genetic

298
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,645
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

299
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:58,448
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

300
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,085
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah.

301
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:04,688
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

302
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:07,658
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

303
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,362
What's causing the seizures?

304
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,900
-There are many
possible triggers
for a seizure in a child.

305
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,634
Fever. Certain lights.

306
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:21,005
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

307
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:23,107
But Alma is too young for that.

308
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,308
Has there been
a stressful event

309
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,711
or disruption
in your family lately?

310
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:41,491
Hi,
you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.

311
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,860
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,

312
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:46,430
but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,

313
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,199
so get ready to say it!

314
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,903
Mom, this place
is completely fucked.

315
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:56,239
Alma keeps freaking out,
and they say she has epilepsy
or something.

316
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,977
I think Dad is blaming me.

317
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:03,447
I'm coming back home.

318
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:05,615
I got the money.

319
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,391
- What happened to you?
- Jesus.

320
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,396
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

321
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:29,439
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

322
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:33,343
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

323
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:36,513
incident last night.

324
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,723
Which one?

325
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:49,793
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

326
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,100
I don't wanna talk to you.

327
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,634
Excuse me?

328
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,403
Um... excuse me.

329
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,974
There's another guest waiting.

330
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:13,483
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

331
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:17,320
Could you come see me
when you're done?

332
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,856
Fine.

333
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,504
I'm checking out.

334
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,008
Oh.

335
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,043
Okay.

336
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,721
You didn't charge me.

337
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:54,357
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

338
00:32:56,194 --> 00:32:57,527
Um...

339
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:00,330
No, you don't.

340
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,840
Do you smoke?

341
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,790
You coming?

342
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:31,528
Yeah, just give me a minute.

343
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:13,737
I have a house
back in the States.

344
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:15,772
I just need to get
to an airport.

345
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:18,608
Well, lucky you.

346
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:23,080
We have one of these in Paris.

347
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:36,027
And then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

348
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,628
I wasn't going in there.

349
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:44,634
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

350
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:57,915
...and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

351
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:00,985
I wasn't going in there.

352
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:06,090
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

353
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:19,836
...and then
the woman went into that
weird pink bungalow.

354
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,974
I wasn't going in
there.

355
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:31,548
Watch out!

356
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:23,961
Do you smell this?

357
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,032
Yes.

358
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:39,742
Or are those molecules
binding to a receptor
in your nasal cavity?

359
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:45,748
Got me.

360
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,232
And are you...

361
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:06,003
right now, in this moment...

362
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:14,245
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

363
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:22,852
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

364
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:24,021
Hm?

365
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,424
If I were you...

366
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:32,363
I would stay home
until my body was done

367
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,132
growing back those cells.

368
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:40,137
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

369
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:43,941
As if I was stuck in a loop.

370
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:47,677
Can you... do this?

371
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,716
Good.

372
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,092
Apology accepted.

373
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:06,230
Luis.

374
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,512
What are you doing?

375
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,180
I'm getting my stuff.

376
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:26,749
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

377
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,552
I mean, they said we can...

378
00:39:28,652 --> 00:39:31,721
-I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

379
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,960
Beth has been watching Alma
while I've been here
looking after you.

380
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,495
I have to go home
and give her a break.

381
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:42,765
-Please don't leave.
-You'll be fine.

382
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:44,201
There are people here
all the time.

383
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,537
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

384
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,973
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

385
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:53,210
What if she comes back?

386
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,678
Gretchen, stop it!

387
00:39:54,777 --> 00:39:56,347
But why? I'm not making this up!

388
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:59,383
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

389
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,486
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

390
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:11,794
I wasn't high.

391
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:13,664
Oh, you were!

392
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:15,466
You were tested.

393
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,768
You stole money from Herr König

394
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:21,639
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

395
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:23,574
I can't force you
to do anything.

396
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,976
You are almost eighteen
years old.

397
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:27,978
But you don't have a job anymore

398
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:31,282
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

399
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,184
If you wanna run away,

400
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,254
then take your fucking bicycle.

401
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:51,068
Hi,
you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.

402
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:53,470
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,

403
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,006
but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,

404
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:58,909
so get ready to say it!

405
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,980
Mom? Mom...

406
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,516
Mom, I really wanna come home.

407
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,253
It's really bad.

408
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,192
I just wanna come home.

409
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:21,398
Where's Gretchen?

410
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:23,500
Or what do you think?

411
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,102
Where's Gretchen?

412
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:28,038
What do you think, mom?

413
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,288
I told you
to come see me.

414
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:48,858
I saved your life.

415
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,429
I saw the woman.

416
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:57,901
You saw her?

417
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:02,339
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

418
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,609
I need you to help me
find that woman.

419
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:09,079
She's wanted for murder.

420
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:12,116
And I expect her
to come for you again.

421
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,320
I can protect you.

422
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,823
If we find her...

423
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:25,896
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

424
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,601
Does Alma
listen to music often?

425
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:34,037
She loves music,
especially since Gretchen
moved in with us.

426
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:35,739
Now...

427
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,242
And this is extremely
important.

428
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:42,279
Nobody must know
about this investigation.

429
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,082
I don't know who to trust.

430
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:47,251
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

431
00:42:47,351 --> 00:42:48,887
in people with Alma's condition.

432
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:53,090
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

433
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,427
It's just music.

434
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,195
You going out?

435
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,873
That's very cool.

436
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,087
No, it's not.

437
00:43:15,412 --> 00:43:20,951
A month ago,
a married couple on vacation

438
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:23,053
had rented this cabin.

439
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,756
A cabin not far from here.

440
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:28,992
The husband told the police
that in the evening

441
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:31,161
he'd lost consciousness.

442
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:34,765
When he woke up...

443
00:43:35,232 --> 00:43:40,003
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

444
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:45,476
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

445
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:50,647
The blonde woman's voice
had a hypnotic effect
on the man.

446
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,886
He chased the woman
into the woods,
but she got away.

447
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:58,088
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

448
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:02,726
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

449
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:07,764
Jesus.

450
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:17,007
Dude...

451
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:21,946
The other night,
a half-naked woman
came into the reception,

452
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:25,148
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

453
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:33,590
Where was she staying?

454
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:44,735
The Lover's Nest.

455
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:01,285
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

456
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:15,766
I didn't know
stakeouts were gonna be
so boring.

457
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:20,270
When are we gonna see
some action?

458
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:22,239
Almost 11.

459
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:25,642
Be on the lookout and listen
for anything strange.

460
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,755
What are you doing here?

461
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,924
What do you think? You imbecile!

462
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,552
We can't, not here.
We're leaving. Now!

463
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,722
Why? I'm cleaning
this fuck-pad all the time!

464
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,565
I beg you!

465
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,737
You'll have to make it up to me.

466
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,073
I promise.

467
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,496
Okay, fine.

468
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,375
Let me dry my hair, then we can go.

469
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,432
I know how you can make it up to me!

470
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:03,047
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

471
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,980
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

472
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:04,481
She'll choke.

473
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,586
Last time I was too late.

474
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:34,444
Gretchen?

475
00:51:36,914 --> 00:51:38,448
Did we wake you?

476
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:49,927
All the owls
have individual calls

477
00:51:50,161 --> 00:51:53,697
so that they can understand
each other over long distances.

478
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:55,865
And maybe we
can make a secret call

479
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:58,936
so that we
can understand each other.

480
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:02,039
Now, I brought you something.

481
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:04,208
I know that you will like this.

482
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,152
Gretchen, come sit with us.

483
00:52:15,252 --> 00:52:16,387
Gretchen?

484
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,722
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

485
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:22,625
No.

486
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:25,695
Okay, good. Please join us.

487
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,765
I went out last night.

488
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,969
Where did you go?

489
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:33,871
The resort.

490
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:38,109
What were you doing there?

491
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,944
I was with Trixie.

492
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:41,811
-Hm.

493
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:45,983
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

494
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,285
-She wasn't.

495
00:52:48,386 --> 00:52:51,355
She was really confused.

496
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:52,957
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

497
00:52:53,057 --> 00:52:55,326
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

498
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:58,362
Hm. I will look into this.

499
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:01,698
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

500
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:05,436
Seems like a lot of people
need assistance after ten.

501
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:07,737
It doesn't make sense
economically.

502
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:10,374
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
- Gretchen!

503
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:11,608
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

504
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,310
It's not so interesting, but...

505
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:14,979
Maybe another time.

506
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:18,648
It's quite the place
you got here.

507
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:20,284
-Gretchen, what's the matter?

508
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:22,019
Why did you bring us here?

509
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:31,462
Your parents are planning a--

510
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,030
A new resort, I know.

511
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,068
Why do we have to live here?

512
00:53:37,168 --> 00:53:37,968
Gretchen!

513
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,736
Because it's pretty outside?

514
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:42,073
Calm down, right now.

515
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,360
You are here because your family
belongs here.

516
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:09,967
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

517
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:13,037
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?
-I don't know dad!

518
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:15,705
I'm just reflecting
on this very fucking weird
living situation

519
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:17,807
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

520
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:18,909
Out!

521
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:20,177
Now!

522
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:23,881
- Great.
- No, no, Luis.

523
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:26,016
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

524
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:27,885
You need some family time,
I understand.

525
00:54:27,985 --> 00:54:29,853
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

526
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:31,821
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

527
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:34,225
and I wish you a good evening.
-I'm very sorry.

528
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:36,626
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

529
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:39,130
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

530
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:43,534
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

531
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:45,702
don't be afraid to...

532
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,038
talk to me.

533
00:54:50,174 --> 00:54:53,077
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

534
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:56,981
Oh... it was a surprise.

535
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:59,283
I was not supposed
to say anything.

536
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:00,417
I am so sorry.

537
00:55:00,518 --> 00:55:01,952
What package?

538
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,323
What package?
-It has your family name on it.

539
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:22,106
It was your mother's stuff.

540
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:25,708
The small stuff, at least.

541
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,844
I received it this morning.

542
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:30,713
I... your father should perhaps
change the address

543
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:32,183
on the counter...

544
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,285
What is it doing here, dad?

545
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,192
I sold the old house.

546
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,667
It was... still my house.

547
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,169
And I put the money
in an account for you.

548
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:58,542
I... I didn't want you
to get worked up again--

549
00:56:07,717 --> 00:56:10,387
Hi,
you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.

550
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:13,157
Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,

551
00:56:13,257 --> 00:56:15,725
but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,

552
00:56:15,825 --> 00:56:17,928
so get ready to say it.

553
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:21,332
Mom, I really wanna come home.

554
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,635
It's really bad.

555
00:56:28,606 --> 00:56:30,773
I really want to come home.

556
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,448
What do you think?

557
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,722
What do you think, mom?

558
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:47,790
What's your take
on that, mom?

559
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:07,344
Next message.

560
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,849
Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,
my name is Alma.

561
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,818
I'm calling you
because of my sister, Gretchen.

562
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:18,455
Gretchen calls you
when she feels bad,

563
00:57:18,555 --> 00:57:20,357
but you never answer.

564
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:22,359
I can hear her from my room.

565
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:24,328
I'm worried.

566
00:57:24,495 --> 00:57:25,862
If you get my message,

567
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:28,465
I want you to call Gretchen
back on the phone.

568
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:31,268
You can tell her
that you love her.

569
00:57:31,669 --> 00:57:33,270
It would mean a lot to her.

570
00:57:33,937 --> 00:57:35,673
It would make her happy.

571
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,742
If you'd like to,
you can come visit us.

572
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,211
You are always welcome here.

573
00:58:01,165 --> 00:58:03,267
Good, you're packed.

574
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:06,870
Do you even know how to drive?

575
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:09,839
Where is everybody?

576
00:58:12,176 --> 00:58:15,012
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

577
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:18,282
Alma had a very strong seizure.

578
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,419
It's your fault, Gretchen.
You know that.

579
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,388
You terrified her.

580
00:58:25,956 --> 00:58:30,561
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

581
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:33,797
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

582
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:35,699
and I'll drive you
to the station.

583
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:37,867
The last train leaves
in one hour.

584
00:58:54,752 --> 00:58:56,653
Bring your bike.

585
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:28,118
You like it?

586
00:59:29,253 --> 00:59:30,387
Sure.

587
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,557
You know it? A common cuckoo.

588
00:59:34,691 --> 00:59:36,560
A magnificent creature.

589
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,129
-Common.

590
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,601
Ah. But its behavior is not.

591
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:47,738
Its nature is quite remarkable.

592
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,010
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

593
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:58,182
Some species need our help
to survive and reproduce.

594
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,719
I'm a preservationist, you know?

595
01:00:22,973 --> 01:00:24,508
Oh, come along now.

596
01:00:24,608 --> 01:00:29,279
I want you to understand
who you got involved with.

597
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:33,784
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

598
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:36,019
with an illegal firearm.

599
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,889
What are you doing?

600
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:39,289
He's a cop.

601
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:42,759
No, he's not.

602
01:00:43,427 --> 01:00:44,929
Not anymore.

603
01:00:45,162 --> 01:00:47,364
You see, Erik here...

604
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,533
is actually a policeman.

605
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:53,103
He has access to police files.

606
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:57,007
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

607
01:00:57,107 --> 01:01:00,344
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

608
01:01:00,477 --> 01:01:04,515
one that he is personally
involved with.

609
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:09,019
Okay, Erik. I think it is time
to take Herr Lando
to the police station.

610
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:11,321
Gretchen, let's get your money.

611
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,561
This way, please.

612
01:01:18,495 --> 01:01:20,163
Come along, now.

613
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,694
You are a liability, Gretchen.
I can't let you out.

614
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:27,164
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

615
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:29,099
-Just pheromones.

616
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:31,802
I am giving you the chance
to be of great use

617
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:34,104
in our quest for preservation.

618
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,140
The adolescent
needs to be trained.

619
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,879
Consider yourself lucky.

620
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:53,724
It's a mild sedative.

621
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:55,125
What?

622
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,761
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

623
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:05,202
I'm staying here tonight.

624
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:12,142
These creatures can't speak
like you or I.

625
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:13,744
But when trained,

626
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:18,116
their song can be dizzyingly
persuasive.

627
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,878
No, no! Stay focused!

628
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,666
That's enough for today.

629
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,647
Come here.

630
01:05:46,763 --> 01:05:47,631
Ah, ah, ah.

631
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:53,737
Something
is not right.

632
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:11,134
It is always something of a confirmation
of my dreams and good intentions.

633
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:16,160
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

634
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,694
with those construction plans.

635
01:06:17,794 --> 01:06:20,564
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

636
01:06:22,365 --> 01:06:25,102
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

637
01:06:25,937 --> 01:06:27,872
What happened
to Herr Lando's wife

638
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:30,041
must not repeat itself.

639
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:36,948
I'm very sorry
for what happened
to your wife, Herr Lando.

640
01:06:37,281 --> 01:06:43,553
But this one's mother
wandered off my area
of authority.

641
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:47,992
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

642
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:50,393
before we had another offspring

643
01:06:50,493 --> 01:06:51,896
ready to replace her.

644
01:06:52,263 --> 01:06:55,765
There were family matters
prolonging my endeavor.

645
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,372
Actually...

646
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:06,376
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

647
01:07:06,476 --> 01:07:10,680
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

648
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,748
Wow.

649
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:15,887
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

650
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:19,056
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

651
01:07:19,422 --> 01:07:25,162
A sacred process that keeps
an ancient creature alive
and well.

652
01:07:25,629 --> 01:07:28,632
A magnificent creature
whose approach to family

653
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:31,903
is beyond human comprehension.

654
01:07:34,537 --> 01:07:36,506
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

655
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:39,476
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

656
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:43,014
Consider your mishap last night
a dry run.

657
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:49,853
Erik?

658
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,570
I told him, not in the house.

659
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:05,970
Shh...

660
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:14,477
Oh.

661
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,218
Stay here.

662
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:18,282
No, no, no, no.

663
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:20,251
You should be on your side.

664
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,086
You could choke, my dear.

665
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,614
No!

666
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:56,120
Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?

667
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,055
I don't feel so good.

668
01:08:59,924 --> 01:09:01,125
Take this.

669
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,111
Everything's fine.

670
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,365
Everything's fine.

671
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:31,521
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

672
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,154
After my mom died,

673
01:10:03,553 --> 01:10:06,057
I accidentally called
our house...

674
01:10:07,657 --> 01:10:10,760
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

675
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,933
It kind of helped,

676
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,136
so I kept calling.

677
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,241
Maybe you can do that too.

678
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,056
Do you know what this bird
is famous for?

679
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:20,598
This bird lays its eggs
in the nests
of other bird species

680
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:25,635
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

681
01:11:28,506 --> 01:11:30,640
No! Not in here!

682
01:12:01,005 --> 01:12:03,941
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

683
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:17,421
How old is your sister?

684
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,395
Gretchen?

685
01:12:25,896 --> 01:12:27,665
Yes, I am fine.

686
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:30,401
We are in the treatment center
by the hospital.

687
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:31,768
-If you come back
in the morning,

688
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:34,171
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

689
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:36,674
Alma is going
to stay here for the evening.

690
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:39,176
Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor
her sleep.

691
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:40,044
Dad?

692
01:12:40,144 --> 01:12:41,612
-Beth and I are coming home.

693
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:43,846
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about--

694
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:47,750
-What is it, Gretchen?

695
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,921
We can't trust them.

696
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:53,357
-Gretchen, we can talk
when we're home.

697
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:56,293
I told you
I will protect you.

698
01:13:00,164 --> 01:13:01,465
Get ready.

699
01:13:01,764 --> 01:13:03,467
What's wrong with Beth?

700
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:22,319
Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.

701
01:13:24,021 --> 01:13:28,359
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

702
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:33,631
Astonishing resemblance
to her surrogate mother, Beth.

703
01:13:34,098 --> 01:13:38,035
The surrogate mother's distress
grows in close proximity

704
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,070
to the biological mother.

705
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:44,408
Thus both host parents
have been removed
from the premises.

706
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:50,214
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

707
01:13:50,314 --> 01:13:55,286
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

708
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:59,789
Instead of leaving
their offspring
in the care of a host,

709
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:04,128
homo-cuculidae returns
to claim their young.

710
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:06,430
Contact with the biological
mother

711
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:10,167
speeds up the process
of the offspring's physical
development

712
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:13,871
and its abilities
significantly.

713
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:22,613
We are about to initiate
the first close-distance
encounter

714
01:14:22,913 --> 01:14:25,015
with the biological mother.

715
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:46,836
Brood parasites.

716
01:14:49,473 --> 01:14:51,308
They don't impregnate.

717
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:54,044
They implant eggs.

718
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,350
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

719
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:05,489
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

720
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:09,927
Like your father...

721
01:15:11,095 --> 01:15:12,663
on his honeymoon.

722
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:16,934
And then what do they do?

723
01:15:18,635 --> 01:15:20,604
Release them into the wild.

724
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:25,376
When the mother shows up...

725
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:27,611
I end this experiment.

726
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,548
What about my sister?

727
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:37,254
That is not your sister.

728
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:40,290
Two.

729
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,593
Yeah, the sister
of the young one

730
01:15:42,693 --> 01:15:44,928
and a rogue police detective.

731
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:49,433
Yeah, I am afraid we must
commence definitive measures
immediately.

732
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,268
She's dead.

733
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:54,505
The feather
I wrote my name with.

734
01:15:55,506 --> 01:15:58,008
The plumage
of the apportioners.

735
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:05,103
We're in the middle of an experiment.

736
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,605
What happened? You're bleeding.

737
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,234
The recordings you made
behind my back...

738
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,612
Are they still under the staircase
at your house?

739
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:20,664
Yeah.

740
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,873
I'm sorry, Danielle.

741
01:16:48,058 --> 01:16:49,393
No! No!

742
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:00,237
I'm not going to hurt you.

743
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:37,708
Alma. Alma?

744
01:17:38,008 --> 01:17:40,010
Alma, we have to go.

745
01:17:40,177 --> 01:17:42,079
We have to go now.

746
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,074
Just stay right here.

747
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:05,195
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

748
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:52,342
Alma?

749
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,173
Mr. König!

750
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:43,247
She's dead!

751
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:45,583
Mom is dead!

752
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:50,620
Where's your machine gun,
my dear?

753
01:27:50,888 --> 01:27:53,057
Is it under your cast, huh?

754
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:57,161
Why me?

755
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:00,030
It's not about you,
you little brat.

756
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,501
This is nature.

757
01:28:03,601 --> 01:28:05,970
She is supposed
to be focusing...

758
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:09,672
on reproduction and breeding.

759
01:28:10,074 --> 01:28:16,247
And you are competing
for resources
with her offspring.

760
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:19,016
Our process here ensures

761
01:28:19,116 --> 01:28:21,952
that each new generation
we breed

762
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,854
is more powerful than the last.

763
01:28:25,022 --> 01:28:28,392
And my dear,
when I am done with you

764
01:28:28,691 --> 01:28:31,362
and reunite Alma with--

765
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:53,847
I'm sorry.

766
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:05,109
I would never hurt you.

767
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:11,362
Stay away
from her, Alma.

768
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:17,996
We have to leave now.

769
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,767
My mom called.

770
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:52,156
She got your message.

771
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,791
Will she come to visit?

772
01:31:09,787 --> 01:31:11,055
No.

773
01:31:12,356 --> 01:31:15,592
S-She... can't.

774
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:22,900
But she says thank you.

775
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,003
Thank you, Alma.

776
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,069
Thank you, Alma.

777
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:09,012
I really need your help.

778
01:32:21,759 --> 01:32:23,560
Henry!

779
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:26,330
You said you'll protect me.

780
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:31,235
I stand by it.

781
01:32:31,668 --> 01:32:34,571
-Did you ever tell your wife
you'd protect her?

782
01:32:38,976 --> 01:32:40,411
What?

783
01:32:42,212 --> 01:32:46,250
Did you tell her
you'd protect her?

784
01:32:51,388 --> 01:32:52,489
Did you?

785
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,163
Yes!

786
01:32:59,263 --> 01:33:01,932
-Okay, we are coming out now.

787
01:33:27,591 --> 01:33:29,059
Alma!

788
01:33:29,426 --> 01:33:32,362
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

789
01:33:34,264 --> 01:33:36,400
What are you doing?

790
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,768
She's one of them!

791
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:39,837
Alma!

792
01:33:39,938 --> 01:33:41,238
I don't think so.

793
01:33:41,438 --> 01:33:42,406
-Come to me.

794
01:33:43,073 --> 01:33:45,175
She will be.

795
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:47,478
She will become!

796
01:33:48,078 --> 01:33:50,614
- I don't think so.
- Alma!

797
01:33:50,781 --> 01:33:52,983
We need to find out
how many there are.

798
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:56,420
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

799
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,389
-Stop!
-Let her go.

800
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:02,927
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

801
01:34:03,026 --> 01:34:04,761
She is not your sister!

802
01:34:04,862 --> 01:34:06,096
They stopped reproducing before.

803
01:34:06,196 --> 01:34:08,465
They will go extinct
without preservation.

804
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:10,167
Oh, they will go extinct.

805
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:12,236
-Hundreds of years of research.

806
01:34:12,336 --> 01:34:14,438
This is the will
of the apportioners.

807
01:34:14,605 --> 01:34:16,106
Let her go.

808
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,509
You don't know
what you're doing!
