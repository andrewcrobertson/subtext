1
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,296
We have to move.
Come on!

2
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,102
Bombs blasted.
Soldiers were shot.

3
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,039
Yes.
I expect those things

4
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,372
would happen in a war.

5
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,373
Well, if you know,

6
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,576
then no reason for me

7
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,612
to keep answering
your questions.

8
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,714
Did you answer one?
I must've missed it.

9
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,988
What do you expect
to get from this?

10
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,124
"Get from this"?

11
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:11,592
If you think that's
a difficult question,

12
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,629
you might want to reconsider
your future in journalism.

13
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,831
I'm curious.

14
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:18,966
That never bodes well.

15
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:20,902
Well, maybe for you.

16
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,543
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

17
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,410
They're just pictures.

18
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,513
I don't believe that.

19
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,015
There must be stories
behind them.

20
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,683
Why does it matter?

21
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:37,819
They should be heard.

22
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,389
Don't you want the world
to know about you?

23
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Well, isn't that why
you went there?

24
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,669
You think I went to war
so people would know my name?

25
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,270
-I didn't say that.
-I think you did.

26
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,773
I'm not trying
to interrogate you.

27
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,675
All interviews
are interrogations.

28
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,744
The good ones, anyway.

29
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,614
Were all of these published?

30
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,684
-Some were.
-But not all?

31
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:15,957
What do I get?

32
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,391
What do you mean?

33
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,827
I tell you
about these pictures.

34
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:21,729
I give you all of my stories.

35
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,931
What do I get in return?

36
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,805
Does it have to be
so transactional?

37
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,272
Well, that's what life is.

38
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,255
I'll tell you a story about me

39
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,890
if you'll tell me a story
about you.

40
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,063
Fine.

41
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,070
<i>I'd been the model,</i>

42
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,574
<i>I'd been the muse,</i>
<i>I'd been the ingenue.</i>

43
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,242
<i>But I was done</i>
<i>with all of that.</i>

44
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,778
<i>I was good at drinking,</i>

45
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,513
<i>having sex,</i>
<i>and taking pictures.</i>

46
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,916
<i>And I did all three</i>
<i>as much as I could.</i>

47
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,151
<i>Life was fun.</i>

48
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,667
Beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.

49
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,402
That's great.

50
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,577
How many arguments
do you think they've had

51
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,079
since we left?

52
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,314
You think they actually
got out of bed?

53
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:21,716
Hello?

54
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,485
No.
He's not a "lunatic".

55
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,123
He's calculated. Evil.
And he won't last.

56
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,992
But the Germans
seem to love him.

57
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,593
Well, the French do not.

58
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,362
<i>-Vive la France, mon amour.</i>
-Lunch is served.

59
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,764
Bravo. Come sit.

60
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,932
<i>Merci.</i>

61
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,000
Please,
no more politics.

62
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,602
So, I was thinking,

63
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:44,138
we should swim
before cocktails this evening.

64
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,274
Wonderful. I agree.

65
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,675
But seriously,

66
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,278
France will not stand
for his ideas,

67
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,280
we will move against him.

68
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,348
And when that fails,
England will be ready

69
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,117
to ride to your rescue
once more.

70
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,686
-Ah.
-Darling, you're here!

71
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,655
We were going to send out
a search party.

72
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,324
The English love to brag
about saving the day.

73
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,692
It helps that you usually wait

74
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,459
until the last second.

75
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,299
-Roland.
-Hi.

76
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,499
Roland. Welcome.

77
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,768
Was it
a hideously long journey?

78
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,703
From Cassis?

79
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,505
From London,
of course.

80
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,639
I got stuck
behind a farmer.

81
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,374
You know Roland, don't you?

82
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,575
If I did, would I like him?

83
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,145
He's quite charming.

84
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,246
Mm. So I won't get bored

85
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,248
if we continue
with this introduction?

86
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,716
I doubt it.

87
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,818
His art gallery is selling
your tits and ass.

88
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,154
How much?

89
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,556
Oh. I get to speak for myself?

90
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,526
But clearly not priced
high enough.

91
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,961
Sold far too quickly.

92
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,864
I'd like to have
held onto them longer.

93
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:47,535
Suits me. I never did like
to hang around.

94
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,571
Haven't you heard?
That's what all ex-models do.

95
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,706
They travel the world

96
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,974
and pretend
to be someone interesting.

97
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,848
What about you?
Why don't I know you?

98
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,783
Well, I'm not
particularly important.

99
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,552
I just peddle their wares.

100
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,387
Well, if you're not
that important,

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,622
maybe you should
cut your commission?

102
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,758
I work night and day
for you, my dear man.

103
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,126
Oh.

104
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,461
You don't look like someone
who works night and day.

105
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,097
And there's paint
on your hands,

106
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,531
so I assume
you're also an artist.

107
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,534
I see you don't wash it off,

108
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,205
is that because
you want people to know?

109
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,473
Or do you leave it there
because you need

110
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,041
to convince yourself
that you are?

111
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:29,977
And you pour your own wine

112
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,645
before asking the host
if you could.

113
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,983
I'll bet the members
of any major family in England

114
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,685
know your name before you
walk through the door.

115
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,722
You're part
of the establishment,

116
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:42,723
and you hate that.

117
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,059
Am I right?

118
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:51,065
My lot are Quakers.
Not exactly establishment.

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,168
But otherwise...

120
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,804
She can see us all.

121
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,240
Can I have a go?

122
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:03,077
Please.

123
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,245
Good luck with that!

124
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,882
Hmm. You...

125
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,520
grew up staunchly
middle class,

126
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,154
which means you were poor
for the rich people

127
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,356
and rich for the poor people,

128
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,959
so you feel
you never fitted in either.

129
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,428
You're used to people
getting distracted

130
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,596
just by looking at you.

131
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,265
You've learned to use that.

132
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,933
Which makes you
cleverer than most.

133
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,737
You dislike anyone
who questions you,

134
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,108
especially when you know
you're wrong.

135
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,911
And you have secrets.

136
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,347
Many...

137
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,750
that you'll never share.

138
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:47,621
I'm never wrong.

139
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,789
That's our Lee.

140
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,459
And I can pour
my own wine, too.

141
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,563
<i>Salute!</i>

142
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,106
I've known you almost as long
as I've known Jean.

143
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,543
And I love you nearly as much.

144
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,378
We miss you.

145
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,881
Come back to Paris with us.

146
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,385
I don't know
who I am in Paris any more.

147
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,156
The question is,

148
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,127
who do you want to be now,
Lee Miller?

149
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,965
And what are you going to do
about that?

150
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,948
I've seen your work,
you know.

151
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,118
Tits and ass,

152
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,187
I remember.

153
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,657
No, I mean your real work,

154
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,026
your photographic work.

155
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,461
You're really very impressive.

156
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,031
Thank you.

157
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,134
I'd rather
take a picture than...

158
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,369
be one.

159
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,580
Do you mind if I come in?

160
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,482
You've known me
for four hours.

161
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,320
Just imagine
what I could know after five.

162
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:27,781
Roland?

163
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,888
Roland?

164
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,563
Ah.

165
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:17,998
Hello.

166
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,000
Morning.

167
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,273
We were taking bets

168
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,008
on what time
we'd see you today.

169
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,210
Mm. Who won?

170
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,446
Guess.

171
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,049
Well, he's much less square
than I would've thought.

172
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,888
-Ah, he lives.
-Morning.

173
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,357
Barely.

174
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,694
-Morning.
-Morning.

175
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,334
May I?

176
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,269
Please.

177
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:03,611
Now look here.

178
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,354
If I fall down these steps
and die,

179
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,390
be sure to say
nice things about me.

180
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,260
Don't let Man Ray
go on one of his rants.

181
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,096
"She lived as she looked,

182
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,698
"frivolously
and with adventure."

183
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:25,667
I'm not frivolous.

184
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,570
I'm not.

185
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:30,805
Where should we go from here?

186
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,508
Well...

187
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,143
Certainly not back down there.

188
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:40,682
I leave tomorrow.

189
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:44,686
Come with me to London?

190
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,458
When was the last time
you spent longer

191
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,861
than a few months
in one place?

192
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,632
How can you possibly
know all there is to know

193
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,500
if you stay in the same place
all the time?

194
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,604
And you find
enough purpose in that?

195
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,038
Well, maybe I haven't
found anything

196
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,775
interesting enough
to keep me around.

197
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,711
Anything or anyone?

198
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,463
God.

199
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,134
Don't run.

200
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,370
Well...

201
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,712
Would you just...

202
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,855
<i>This little lady</i>
<i>at the Shoe and Leather Fair</i>

203
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:56,223
<i>is showing off dainty footwear</i>
<i>for policemen.</i>

204
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,659
<i>But the serious</i>
<i>side of the show</i>

205
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,426
<i>has some very pretty things</i>
<i>for you to look at.</i>

206
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,328
<i>And you can</i>
<i>look at the shoes too.</i>

207
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,166
<i>Going from one extreme</i>
<i>to the other,</i>

208
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,068
<i>when Hitler</i>
<i>has his 48th birthday,</i>

209
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,070
<i>they make a show of it</i>
<i>in a big way.</i>

210
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,371
<i>In fact, over there,</i>

211
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,740
<i>the recipe for successful</i>
<i>birthday parties</i>

212
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,341
<i>seems to be something like</i>

213
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,877
<i>throw a few hundred men</i>
<i>on parade,</i>

214
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,712
<i>present a few dozen colours</i>
<i>flapping in the breeze...</i>

215
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,849
-Jesus, look at them all.
-They're idiots.

216
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,751
But dangerous.

217
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,587
They're all brainwashed.

218
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,888
Not everyone can believe this.

219
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,256
Surely they can see
what he is.

220
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,258
But they don't.
Look at them.

221
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,894
This is not an act.

222
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,027
The only
sane response

223
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,430
to tyranny is to paint.

224
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,432
-To create.
-And drink.

225
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,400
-And write!
-And dance!

226
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,769
<i>I still</i>
<i>don't understand</i>

227
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,236
how none of you saw it coming.

228
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,840
It happened so slowly,

229
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,076
yet kind of overnight.

230
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,145
We woke up one morning

231
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,347
and Hitler was the most
powerful man in Europe.

232
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,385
Even as it was happening
it didn't feel real.

233
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,222
So what did you do?

234
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:39,594
Well...

235
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:42,997
<i>I got on with my life.</i>

236
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,800
<i>By then, Europe was at war.</i>

237
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,803
<i>But it all seemed</i>
<i>a long way from London.</i>

238
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,306
<i>Roland, as an artist</i>
<i>and conscientious objector,</i>

239
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,374
<i>had been hired to develop</i>
<i>camouflage techniques</i>

240
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,677
<i>for the war effort.</i>

241
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:58,345
<i>And we felt safe.</i>

242
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,113
Roland?

243
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,348
Darling, you're back.

244
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,117
Holy hell.

245
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,588
Your turn.

246
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,056
<i>Which attacked the Italian...</i>

247
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,724
Please, let me start dinner.

248
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:10,858
Come on,
I've had a breakthrough.

249
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:14,862
-You promised.
-I didn't promise.

250
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,731
I make it a point
never to promise anything.

251
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,567
All right.

252
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,170
-How was town?
-Horrible.

253
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,238
It took forever to find a cab.

254
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,444
-Where do you want me?
-Right here, please.

255
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,347
<i>...a considerable blow</i>

256
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,248
<i>to Mussolini...</i>

257
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,283
You ready?

258
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,092
All right,
make me invisible.

259
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,326
If I can make you invisible

260
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,495
then I can hide anything.

261
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:53,067
<i>...that the</i>
<i>loss of German aircraft</i>

262
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,669
<i>to anti-aircraft defensive...</i>

263
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,370
Be quick, I'm starving.

264
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,072
Queues were dreadful.

265
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,607
But I did find us
some butter today.

266
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,775
Mm-hmm.

267
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,342
And they had chilli powder
at Fortnum's,

268
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,845
so if we have to eat rats,

269
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,445
at least
they'll be well spiced.

270
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,860
Concentrate.

271
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,129
That's quite hard to do.

272
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,971
Oh, God.

273
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,105
Oh, Jesus!

274
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,821
Hmm?

275
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,823
Don't be territorial, Audrey.

276
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,425
Editorial, I think you mean.

277
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:53,961
Excuse me, Miss Withers.

278
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:55,129
There's a Lee Miller
to see you.

279
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,831
The Lee Miller?

280
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,566
What's she doing in London?

281
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,400
Goodness.
Do show her in, Maud.

282
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:02,469
Do come in.

283
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:05,573
Thank you.

284
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,344
-Cecil Beaton, hello.
-Well, well.

285
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:14,682
Something to say?

286
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,988
Lee Miller. I hear you're
the woman to see about a job.

287
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,422
Audrey Withers.

288
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,491
And, yes, I am.
Please, do sit down.

289
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,526
Thank you.

290
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,429
May I?

291
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,532
We don't hire older models.

292
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,433
Oh, don't blow a gasket.

293
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,269
-I'm not a model any more.
-Oh, dear.

294
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,438
-So what exactly are you then?
-Cecil.

295
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,340
Would you give us a moment?

296
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,477
Please.

297
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,880
I'll be back
to fix this disaster.

298
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,352
I do apologise for Cecil.

299
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,288
-He can be a bit of a...
-Monster?

300
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,457
No. He never could hide
his disappointment

301
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,227
that women get old.

302
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,995
That's true.

303
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,731
And not entirely unique
to men in fashion.

304
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:07,802
But he is irritatingly
talented, so I manage.

305
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,310
Where was this taken?

306
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,479
That's, er, Syria.

307
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:23,918
Erm, my studio work
is right here.

308
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,420
Er...

309
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,858
Oh, these really are
rather spectacular.

310
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,325
Mm, thank you.

311
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,929
But Cecil is right,
I'm afraid.

312
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,998
We're not hiring
at the moment.

313
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,167
To be frank, what with
all that's going on,

314
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,334
we're not sure how much longer
they'll let us keep at it.

315
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,939
Let me get through
the next issue,

316
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,241
see where we stand
and we'll talk again.

317
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,010
How does that sound?

318
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,179
She didn't say no.

319
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,048
She didn't say yes.

320
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,583
You're looking at this
the wrong way.

321
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:59,120
Oh, please. You weren't there.

322
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:02,857
I just wanna do my part,
how hard can it be?

323
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,225
You'll find something,
my love.

324
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,260
God, that is so patronising.

325
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,168
Darling, I need
to tell you something.

326
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,571
What?

327
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,738
I've heard
that people in Paris

328
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:18,973
are going underground.

329
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,375
What do you mean?

330
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,511
It's getting dangerous.

331
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:29,150
Paul, Nusch, Solange, Jean,

332
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,285
they'll all be in hiding
from the Nazis.

333
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,555
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>go back to Paris?</i>

334
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,660
I couldn't. Not then.

335
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,129
Paris was occupied
by the Nazis,

336
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,998
and Britain was all alone,

337
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,533
and we were totally cut off.

338
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,004
So, what else
is there to know?

339
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,139
Oh, plenty.

340
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:53,808
And although my friends were
living under occupation,

341
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,977
even they
were doing something.

342
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,913
Paul and Nusch
had joined the resistance.

343
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:01,549
But I didn't know that then

344
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,484
and I had no way
of reaching them.

345
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:07,154
And, er...

346
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,191
And then everyone started
doing their bit.

347
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,360
Roland was out most nights
being an Air Raid Warden.

348
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,362
And I felt useless.

349
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,764
And the more depressed I got,
the smaller my ass got.

350
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:20,334
Which is usually the opposite.

351
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,435
But did she end up
giving you the job?

352
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,372
Oh, yeah,
she caved pretty quickly.

353
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,708
I think she realised
that wrangling Cecil Beaton

354
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,044
would be a lot more fun
with another woman around.

355
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:35,383
Cecil Beaton...

356
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,285
Ugh.

357
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,659
-Is everyone all right?
-Mercifully, yes.

358
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:45,960
Where's Audrey?

359
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,695
There.

360
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,230
It's actually
not as bad as it looks.

361
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,631
The structure is sound.

362
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:52,566
But we will need to move
in the basement for a while.

363
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,668
Are we out of business?

364
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,703
Oh! I don't see
why we should be.

365
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:56,837
I spoke to the Ministry
this morning,

366
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,139
and we have our paper ration.

367
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,875
-Well, that's a relief.
-We also have a mission.

368
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:03,544
To encourage the women
of Britain to do their duty.

369
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,049
Might I borrow these
for a moment?

370
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:09,884
-Certainly.
-Thank you.

371
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,053
Maud, come with me.

372
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,722
Er, and you.

373
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,725
-Would you care to join us?
-She's so creative.

374
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,026
Just hold it
in position...

375
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,094
-Okay.
-...with this ridiculous

376
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,429
strap thing.

377
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,997
-I can't see a thing.
-Can't see a thing?

378
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,532
-I can't see.
-My gosh.

379
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:27,601
Here, this is your...
Right here. Right, here we go.

380
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,370
There!

381
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,707
There, that's it.

382
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,108
Oh, goodness.

383
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,610
Maud, you can sit right there.
All right, here we go.

384
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,579
Pay no attention
to the burning building

385
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:39,914
over my shoulder.

386
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:44,452
<i>The Blitz</i>
<i>turned houses inside out,</i>

387
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,387
<i>streets upside down,</i>

388
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,756
<i>and created chaos</i>
<i>for the people of London.</i>

389
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,460
<i>But everyone carried on</i>

390
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,862
<i>and I did what I could</i>
<i>to capture it.</i>

391
00:24:58,065 --> 00:25:00,301
<i>Men were sent off to fight.</i>

392
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:04,271
<i>The wives were left behind</i>
<i>caring for their children.</i>

393
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:05,906
<i>Without that responsibility</i>

394
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,641
<i>we were able</i>
<i>to be single-minded.</i>

395
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,745
<i>We worked all hours.</i>

396
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:13,481
<i>Anything to get</i>
<i>the next issue out.</i>

397
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:17,918
<i>The months rolled by...</i>

398
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:20,254
<i>...bombs rained down.</i>

399
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,289
<i>It became part of daily life.</i>

400
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,960
<i>There were times</i>
<i>when we froze our asses off,</i>

401
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,295
<i>but we just kept going.</i>

402
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,766
<i>Audrey was a terrific boss</i>

403
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,768
<i>and we became friends.</i>

404
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,903
<i>There wasn't much more to it</i>
<i>than that.</i>

405
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,239
Oh, Audrey.

406
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,411
Children?

407
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:45,312
Oh, God, no. You?

408
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,648
Oh, God, no.

409
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,586
May I?

410
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,027
So you never
actually wanted children?

411
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,399
Well, I never thought I could.

412
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,541
I was never
cut out for mothering.

413
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,646
Why are you asking an
old woman so many questions?

414
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:23,684
-Come on, you're not that old.
-Oh.

415
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,886
Now, isn't that like a man?

416
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,355
First, I'm not young enough,
then I'm not old enough.

417
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,025
Just trying to understand.

418
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,594
What?

419
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,629
Trying to understand you.

420
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,504
Target...

421
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,042
<i>I was ambitious.</i>

422
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:50,512
<i>I was good</i>
<i>at shooting on my own.</i>

423
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:51,546
Er...

424
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:53,881
Maybe form a line.

425
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:54,982
<i>In my experience,</i>

426
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,651
<i>working partnerships</i>
<i>were tricky.</i>

427
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,588
<i>And there can</i>
<i>only be one boss.</i>

428
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:02,957
Evening, ladies.

429
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,993
<i>But then Davy Scherman</i>
<i>from</i> Life Magazine <i>showed up.</i>

430
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,928
-Hello.
-Hiya.

431
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,264
Not exactly the place
I thought

432
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,298
I'd find another Yank.

433
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:12,967
Uh-huh.

434
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,236
It's a little bit dark.

435
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,071
I know.

436
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,105
May I?

437
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:25,012
<i>Suddenly it wasn't</i>
<i>a competition, we were a team.</i>

438
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:26,981
<i>It felt easy.</i>

439
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,586
-Left a little.
-Yes, ma'am.

440
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,787
-Say "Blitz".
-Blitz!

441
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,656
Thank you.

442
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:40,861
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

443
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,951
I'm afraid this is
as far as you can go, ma'am.

444
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,786
No, I...
I'm with <i>Vogue Magazine.</i>

445
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,656
Look, she's with me.

446
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:08,923
You need
military accreditation

447
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:09,990
beyond this point.

448
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,126
Oh, God.

449
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,460
The publications
were informed, ma'am.

450
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,963
Only non-military access
for women.

451
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,965
Please make your way
over toward the mess block.

452
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,304
Jeez.

453
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:24,972
You think they'd let up
after I spent hours

454
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,140
in that goddamn car.

455
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,578
Sorry.

456
00:29:58,899 --> 00:29:59,933
Oh.

457
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,368
-Hello.
-Oh, excuse me.

458
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,270
I'm Lee Miller.
I work for <i>Vogue.</i>

459
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:06,574
Oh! Ann Douglas, ATA.

460
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,576
Wow, you fly.

461
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,377
Only ferrying our bombers
between bases. But...

462
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,413
Yes, I do.

463
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,081
Would you mind
if I took your picture?

464
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:16,183
Oh, no problem.

465
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,624
Your work, it really, erm...

466
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,458
It lets us know
what's going on out there.

467
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,397
Thank you.

468
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,468
Let's push you back
over here by the door.

469
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,006
Let's try that.

470
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,943
There you go.

471
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,746
See if we can get you
in the magazine.

472
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,980
Oh. Does this sort of thing
get published?

473
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,215
Hopefully.

474
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,820
Would you mind
taking off your hat?

475
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,790
Wonderful. Here we go.

476
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:58,827
There.

477
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,663
Don't wanna take any more
of your time.

478
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:02,930
Pleasure meeting you.

479
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:04,131
Lovely to meet you,
Miss Miller.

480
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:13,140
Are you still staying
in that shitty hotel?

481
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:16,377
Not for long if I keep
bringing home broken mirrors.

482
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,447
Mm. Well, you're welcome
to stay here.

483
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,685
-We have the room.
-You sure?

484
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:24,819
And Roland wouldn't mind?

485
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,755
The only people who care

486
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:27,856
about the men
I'm sleeping with

487
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,390
are the men
I'm not sleeping with.

488
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,334
Away?

489
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:42,504
Where?

490
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:43,538
The coast.

491
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,774
I'm only a few hours away.

492
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:47,776
For how long?

493
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:50,177
A while, I expect.

494
00:31:57,685 --> 00:31:59,687
We're getting ready,
aren't we?

495
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,656
For the invasion of Europe.

496
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,490
Oh, I know as much as you do,
I'm afraid.

497
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,995
I'll be disguising tanks
to look like ice cream kiosks,

498
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,631
but I didn't tell you that.

499
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:13,568
Davy, take our picture
before he leaves.

500
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:17,605
Yep.

501
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:27,448
Aw.

502
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,584
-Don't go.
-It won't be long.

503
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,319
Stop.

504
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:38,893
No. No. No!

505
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:42,362
Not some
poor woman's intimates!

506
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:43,565
If Lee Miller
thinks she can...

507
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,466
It's not about
what Lee Miller thinks

508
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,901
or doesn't think, Cecil.

509
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:50,370
This is about our duty
to our readers.

510
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:52,841
Those of us
without housekeepers

511
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:53,942
or hot water

512
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:57,177
care about
a lot more than couture.

513
00:32:57,211 --> 00:33:00,915
-It's not <i>Vogue's</i> place...
-It's not your place!

514
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,851
The pants stay on the line.
Thank you.

515
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:08,823
Lee.

516
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:13,160
Cecil.

517
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:14,662
Well, I think
that's what you English call

518
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,129
getting your knickers
in a twist.

519
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,902
Only a woman
could have taken these.

520
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,369
Well, thank you.

521
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:26,240
Audrey, listen to me.

522
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:29,276
When the time comes,
send me to Europe.

523
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,778
The Ministry
has been very clear

524
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:33,581
that when the time comes,
our duty will be...

525
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:36,250
To do our bit. Yes, yes, yes.
I know, I know.

526
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:40,020
But why should the men
get to decide what that is?

527
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:42,957
Why can't women go to
the frontline? Why?

528
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:45,693
As much as I admire
your tenacity, and I do, Lee,

529
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:48,328
it wouldn't work.

530
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,131
You wouldn't be able
to get anything back to us

531
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:52,499
without military sanction.

532
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:53,868
It's just fruitless.

533
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:55,603
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:58,205
Ask again.

535
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,377
Yeah. Yeah.

536
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:05,580
I'll be there.

537
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,383
All right, so long.

538
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,524
When do you go?

539
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,494
Dakota leaves in the morning.

540
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,931
You don't even speak French.

541
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,014
Hey.

542
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:41,883
Scoot over.

543
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,083
What's going on?
You all right?

544
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:46,588
That's bullshit.

545
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,023
It's bullshit!

546
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:51,859
I know
it's not your fault.

547
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,661
But I should have the right
to go as much as you do.

548
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:54,963
The only reason you get to go

549
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,664
is because
you have a set of balls.

550
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:59,266
Lee,
I was sleeping.

551
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,804
Look, I don't wanna
go anywhere.

552
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,273
I'm happy right here
in this bed with you.

553
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,545
I understand, I really do.

554
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:11,980
The British
and their damn rules,

555
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:13,748
they're never gonna send you.

556
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,349
Besides, you're an American.

557
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:19,119
Holy shit.

558
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,189
Holy shit!

559
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,926
That's right, I'm an American.

560
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,729
I'm an American.

561
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:30,130
You're a genius,
Davy Scherman.

562
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:33,768
You're a goddamn,
fucking genius!

563
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,436
<i>Turns out, I'd been barking up</i>
<i>the wrong tree.</i>

564
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,872
<i>The British were never</i>
<i>going to send</i>

565
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:40,440
<i>a female correspondent</i>
<i>to a war zone.</i>

566
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,644
<i>But the Americans</i>
<i>were different.</i>

567
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,277
<i>They weren't held back</i>
<i>by tradition.</i>

568
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,114
You're absolutely sure
you want to do this?

569
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,650
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

570
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,019
Will you be all right?

571
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,187
Let's hope so.

572
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:57,825
Do be careful.

573
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,127
-Please.
-I'll try.

574
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,817
<i>I was born determined.</i>

575
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,887
<i>And I had never felt so alive.</i>

576
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:29,691
<i>It was all an adventure to me.</i>

577
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,358
<i>I had to be</i>
<i>where the action was</i>

578
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,392
<i>and that was Europe,</i>

579
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,796
<i>and I'd arrived.</i>

580
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,598
<i>And finally had a chance</i>
<i>to see things for myself.</i>

581
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,435
There's no women allowed
in the press briefings.

582
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,237
You've gotta be kidding me.

583
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,078
Is there a powder room
around here?

584
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,530
The enemy
is well-trained,

585
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:10,665
well-equipped,

586
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,265
and battle-hardened.

587
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:16,504
Our air offensive has reduced
their strength in the air

588
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,707
and their capacity
to wage war on the ground.

589
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:22,677
As you may know,
we, along with our allies,

590
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,545
have increased the target
bombing over Germany

591
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,215
over the course
of the past few weeks.

592
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,416
Now, you will each be assigned
to specific units

593
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,985
as we continue
to put the pressure

594
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,720
on the ground attack
here in France.

595
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,790
It's pretty lively out there.

596
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:38,492
Watch your backs, your fronts.

597
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:39,560
Eyes on the road.

598
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:41,829
Dismissed.

599
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,409
You!

600
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:04,752
Well, you must be Lee Miller?

601
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:07,088
Well,
it's a war zone, Colonel.

602
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,488
Just Lee is fine.

603
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:10,024
Well, "Just Lee",
there's no women

604
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,159
in the press briefings.

605
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,594
I assume
you received the instruction.

606
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:16,097
I guess I didn't
hear correctly.

607
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,033
Can you hear me now?

608
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,202
Yes, sir.

609
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:23,436
We don't send women to combat.

610
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,072
Well, that's a problem
because I'm here.

611
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,207
Which means...

612
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,875
Which means
I have to deal with you.

613
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,147
Follow me.

614
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:43,024
These doctors perform
over 100 procedures per day.

615
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:44,725
Every day.

616
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,112
Just hold still.

617
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:19,727
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

618
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:24,332
We need
some scissors here.

619
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,535
Jesus Christ! Light!

620
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:29,871
I need a light over here.

621
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,139
-Here. Here, here.
-Over here with that.

622
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:33,608
-Lights!
-Oh.

623
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,609
Come here.

624
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,987
<i>Even when I wanted</i>
<i>to look away...</i>

625
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,325
<i>I knew I couldn't.</i>

626
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,700
<i>Roland wrote to me every week</i>

627
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,135
<i>begging me to come home.</i>

628
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:41,275
<i>He didn't understand</i>
<i>why I wanted to be there.</i>

629
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:47,515
<i>There were moments</i>
<i>when I didn't either.</i>

630
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,177
-May I?
-Of course.

631
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,023
We have to keep going.

632
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,358
Hey.

633
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,261
I've seen you here.

634
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:09,830
Who are you?

635
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:12,366
I'm Lee.

636
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,369
-I'm with <i>Vogue Magazine.</i>
-Yeah?

637
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:18,339
You scouting for models?

638
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:22,410
I don't need to, found you.

639
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:24,912
What's your name?

640
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:28,149
Kurt.

641
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,784
You have beautiful eyes, Kurt.

642
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,586
I've got my mom's eyes.

643
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,856
Lucky boy.

644
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,392
They tell me
I'm going home.

645
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:43,631
Hey,

646
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:46,267
can you take my picture?

647
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,539
When I get home
and all handsome

648
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,740
I want my girl
to see how brave I was.

649
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,611
Of course.

650
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:07,755
Miller.

651
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:13,060
Will you make sure
they print that?

652
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,296
I promise.

653
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:25,906
Grab your kit.
You're going to Saint-Malo.

654
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,576
You can hitch a ride
with Civil Affairs.

655
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:28,943
Really?

656
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:30,377
Write your own obituary
and send it to your editor

657
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:31,846
before you leave.

658
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:32,847
Standard practice.

659
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,950
Don't get excited.
Town's pacified.

660
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:21,862
Goddamn it!
Get out of here! Move!

661
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,464
What?

662
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,432
Hey! We have to move, come on.

663
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,334
What the hell
are you doing here?

664
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:29,236
They just said
it was pacified.

665
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,105
No, no.
You can't be here, lady.

666
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,408
Stay there!

667
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,677
Let's go! Eyes on me!

668
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:42,149
Charlie Three!

669
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,684
This is Baker One-Five.

670
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:47,087
Still receiving heavy fire
from enemy position. Over!

671
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,002
Coordinates...

672
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:03,837
Coordinates 325...

673
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:08,008
-364.
-364. Over.

674
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,778
Don't mind me.

675
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,146
Up 100, left 200.

676
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,649
Up 100, left 200.

677
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:16,651
I'd stay away
from that window, Mac.

678
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:17,818
They've got snipers.

679
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,159
What the fuck
was that?

680
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:27,928
-Jesus Christ, you again?
-You said to stay here.

681
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,733
-Downstairs now. Now!
-No, wait.

682
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:34,068
You wanna be useful,

683
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,003
there's a bunch
of French women in the cellar.

684
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:37,137
-Listen, buddy...
-Find me one

685
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,240
that speaks English. God!

686
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:32,059
Yeah, honey,
that's what they all say.

687
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:41,770
What you got?

688
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:46,206
That evil witch says
her neighbour's

689
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,808
been tipping off the Germans
about your night drops.

690
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:48,909
And the blonde?

691
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:52,514
She's just a girl
who got taken advantage of.

692
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:54,549
Sure she did.

693
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,483
What did you say?

694
00:46:56,518 --> 00:46:58,919
That's what
they all say.

695
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:00,555
-Private.
-How dare you?

696
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,923
What the hell?

697
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:03,891
They put up the white flag!

698
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,029
Asshole.

699
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,921
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

700
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,298
Fuck.

701
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,408
Who do I
have to sleep with

702
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:28,743
to get some dinner
around here?

703
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,581
About fucking time.

704
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:35,683
Not to be sentimental but...

705
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:37,384
I am glad you're not dead.

706
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,219
Good to see you.

707
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:42,657
Come on.

708
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,225
So...

709
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:52,667
Are you all right?

710
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:56,504
Yeah.

711
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,506
Yeah, I'm fine.

712
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:03,745
This goddamn
blank page.

713
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:06,280
Spoken like a true writer.

714
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:09,450
I want it to be good.

715
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:10,819
I want it to be true, but I...

716
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,754
I want it to be good.

717
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:15,924
Worry about
the true part first.

718
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:18,091
Make it good later.

719
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,969
-I'm happy to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.

720
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,974
It was napalm, wasn't it?

721
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:36,310
Well, we didn't know
it was napalm

722
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,645
until much later.

723
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:43,551
Audrey couldn't figure out

724
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:45,720
why the censors refused
to print it.

725
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:49,189
Never thanked her.

726
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:50,959
For what?

727
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:52,827
Well...

728
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:55,095
For trying.

729
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:24,926
What's that?

730
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,394
It's a poem.

731
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,196
By Paul Eluard.

732
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:31,733
Who's he?

733
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:35,235
He's... He...

734
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,170
He's my friend.

735
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:54,856
"On my school books.

736
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,624
"On my desk.

737
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:58,458
"And on the trees.

738
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:00,528
"On the sand.

739
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:02,564
"On the snow.

740
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:05,065
"I write your name."

741
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,092
Excuse me.

742
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:07,294
<i>Allez!</i>

743
00:52:07,327 --> 00:52:08,730
Excuse me.

744
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,144
What're they saying?

745
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:26,981
That she's a whore.

746
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,551
A dirty, collaborating whore.

747
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,508
No one can tell you
what it feels like.

748
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,343
Shame.

749
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,649
There are different kinds
of wounds.

750
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,387
<i>Not just the ones you can see.</i>

751
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:27,942
<i>Liberation.</i>

752
00:53:30,243 --> 00:53:32,580
<i>The word was as joyous</i>
<i>as it felt.</i>

753
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:35,850
<i>People celebrated.</i>

754
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,220
<i>But Paris was just one city.</i>

755
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,424
<i>The war continued</i>
<i>across Europe.</i>

756
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,599
<i>The fighting</i>
<i>was far from over.</i>

757
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,139
<i>And for me, well, things were</i>
<i>just getting going.</i>

758
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,426
David Scherman
and Lee Miller.

759
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,468
Any packages for Lee Miller?

760
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:36,276
<i>Merci.</i>

761
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:43,684
Mm-hmm.

762
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:48,990
Another loving metaphor?

763
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,358
Mm. Hmm.

764
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:03,004
Oh! God bless you,
Audrey Withers.

765
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,746
If we're heading out do I,
er, do I get to shave first?

766
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:13,548
That's all right. I'm, er...

767
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:16,651
I need to see a friend.

768
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,953
-I won't be long.
-All right.

769
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:49,482
Relax. Come on.
Take it off.

770
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:51,652
-No.
-You wanted this.

771
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:53,621
No.

772
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,623
Come on.

773
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,525
Stop. Please.

774
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:00,761
No.

775
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:02,930
-No.
-This is what you want.

776
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,869
Just
shut up. Shut... Shh!

777
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:09,136
-No!
-Shut up.

778
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,639
-You fuck, fuck!
-What?

779
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,440
-Get off of her!
-Get off of me.

780
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:14,709
-Crazy bitch.
-Get away from her.

781
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:16,911
-Fucker, leave her alone!
-Jesus Christ.

782
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:20,047
Asshole!

783
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:22,316
Jesus Christ.

784
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,151
You think
they'd be more grateful.

785
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:25,186
Get outta here.

786
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:29,456
Get outta here! Go on!

787
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,628
Dumb bitch.

788
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:35,428
Fucking...

789
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:39,767
Are you all right?

790
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:43,738
Here.

791
00:56:46,207 --> 00:56:47,575
Next time...

792
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:49,877
cut it off!

793
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,982
Excuse me, <i>madame.</i>

794
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:13,060
<i>Madame.</i>

795
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,198
Solange?

796
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,233
Lee.

797
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,139
Oh, Solange!

798
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,075
Solange.

799
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:35,082
Oh!

800
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,990
Oh, my God.
You're skin and bones.

801
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:46,861
You're freezing.

802
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:47,895
Yes.

803
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:59,073
Sit.

804
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:02,009
Come sit. Sit.

805
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:16,557
Solange...

806
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:22,263
They're gone.

807
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:25,766
Everyone's gone.

808
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:29,603
My son's gone.

809
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:34,008
He was trying to reach
the outskirts of Paris

810
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,544
to welcome the Americans.

811
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:38,913
We're here now.

812
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:41,582
Everything will be all right.

813
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:43,818
They shot him.

814
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:46,287
-The Germans.
-What?

815
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:50,157
Jean made him promise not
to join the resistance.

816
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,225
But I...

817
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,562
I could not stop him

818
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,930
after they took
his father away.

819
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:58,966
-They took Jean away?
-Yes.

820
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,570
Where did they take him?

821
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:04,939
I looked for him
after they released me.

822
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:06,941
Released you from...

823
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:09,443
From... From where, Solange?
I don't understand.

824
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:13,180
You have to ask
these questions

825
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:14,682
because you weren't here.

826
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:17,485
So you don't know.

827
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,921
No.

828
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:23,525
Come back
to the hotel with me.

829
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:26,760
What if Jean comes back
and he can't find me?

830
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:28,929
What if he comes back
and there's this mess?

831
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:31,832
Please come with me.

832
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:34,702
I promise
I'll take care of you.

833
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,171
Promise.

834
01:00:38,573 --> 01:00:41,041
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

835
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:29,423
Davy!

836
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,346
Oh.

837
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:22,977
Davy!

838
01:02:23,678 --> 01:02:25,246
Davy Scherman!

839
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:30,552
Lee,
what are you doing?

840
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:33,821
Did they lock...

841
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:37,157
Did they lock the door?

842
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,829
Come on.

843
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:44,164
All right, all right.

844
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,105
Where'd you go?
What the hell happened?

845
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,251
Here, drink this.

846
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,827
Okay. All right.

847
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,535
You're a good guy, Davy.

848
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:26,574
You're one of the good ones.

849
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:28,643
Yeah. I'm all right.

850
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:33,213
Really bad things
do happen.

851
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:35,215
You know?

852
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,690
Bad things do happen
to some of us girls.

853
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:47,027
Lee...

854
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:55,402
Lee, honey,
what do you mean by that?

855
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:02,677
You know what?

856
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:04,411
We'll talk about it later.

857
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,515
Let's get you to bed, okay?

858
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:09,149
Lean back.

859
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:11,385
There you go. There you go.

860
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,060
It's all right.

861
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,354
Well, I think it's safe to say

862
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:48,455
you're getting
the hang of this.

863
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:49,524
You think?

864
01:04:49,557 --> 01:04:51,425
-It's damn good.
-Oh.

865
01:05:20,522 --> 01:05:23,323
"And by the power of the word

866
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:24,559
"I start my life again.

867
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:26,994
-"I am born to know you.
-"To name you."

868
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:29,731
<i>Liberte!</i>

869
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:35,235
Oh.

870
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,437
I gave her my helmet.

871
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,907
She pissed in it.

872
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,776
Emptied it out the window.
I'm trying not to look.

873
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,878
You know,
disinfects it with hooch.

874
01:05:43,912 --> 01:05:45,513
And then hands it
straight back to me.

875
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,348
And being Davy, he put it
right back on his head.

876
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:49,784
Yep.

877
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,118
That's right.

878
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:54,188
Men usually do idiotic things
around our Lee.

879
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:01,295
It feels...

880
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:02,963
It feels strange to laugh.

881
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:08,368
We could never laugh
in hiding.

882
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:10,672
We could barely breathe.

883
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:12,874
Paris is like a smile

884
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:15,042
where half the teeth
are missing.

885
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:19,781
I saw Solange.

886
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,787
They kept her in prison
for three months.

887
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:29,791
We didn't know where.

888
01:06:29,824 --> 01:06:31,191
We didn't know
if she was alive.

889
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:34,428
And then one day she was back.

890
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,731
-Why did they take her?
-Who knows.

891
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:39,066
Evil Nazi logic.

892
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,169
And what's happened to Jean?

893
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:43,972
Do...

894
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:45,339
-Do you know anything?
-No.

895
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:46,741
We just...

896
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:48,442
We just don't know.
Everyone's looking for someone

897
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:50,477
but none of us
have any answers.

898
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,715
They're fucking barbarians.

899
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,350
And it's not just Jews.

900
01:06:57,317 --> 01:07:00,420
Artists. Communists.
Homosexuals.

901
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:02,256
Black people. Gypsies.

902
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:04,859
Anyone with an opinion.

903
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:07,595
Anyone who didn't fit
their ideals.

904
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:10,865
They just disappeared.
And with no warning.

905
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,601
All we know is

906
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:15,335
they pushed them onto trains.

907
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:17,337
Old women.

908
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,206
Tiny children.

909
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,876
And when they go off
on those trains,

910
01:07:22,844 --> 01:07:23,845
they don't come back.

911
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:26,213
Where do they take them?

912
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,248
They're just gone.

913
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:32,185
So many people are gone.

914
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:40,695
People don't
just disappear.

915
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,132
<i>Je sais pas.</i>
I don't... I don't know.

916
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:49,938
They do.

917
01:07:57,879 --> 01:07:58,880
Mm.

918
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,593
Yes. Yes!

919
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,260
Audrey Withers.

920
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:14,662
Thanks for the care package.

921
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:18,165
<i>Lee!</i>
<i>How's liberation of gay Paris?</i>

922
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:19,399
They say it's marvellous.

923
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:20,935
It must just be one big party.

924
01:08:20,969 --> 01:08:22,737
We're all on tenterhooks
to hear what you have to say,

925
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,838
<i>of course.</i>

926
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,506
<i>We're actually</i>
<i>celebrating here.</i>

927
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,008
<i>Maud's mother's made a cake.</i>

928
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:30,444
Have you spoken to Roland?
How's he getting along?

929
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:33,982
Lee?

930
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:37,051
<i>Are you there?</i>

931
01:08:37,085 --> 01:08:39,453
Have there been any reports
of missing people in the news?

932
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:42,255
<i>Missing?</i>

933
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:44,391
<i>I don't understand.</i>

934
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:46,527
Thousands and thousands
of missing people.

935
01:08:47,494 --> 01:08:49,030
Erm, anything?

936
01:08:49,063 --> 01:08:51,699
Sorry, it's not very clear.
Who's missing?

937
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:56,037
-It's not over at all.
<i>-I know.</i>

938
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,039
<i>But by the time</i>
<i>the next issue goes to print</i>

939
01:08:58,072 --> 01:08:59,540
<i>I'm sure there'll</i>
<i>be more good news.</i>

940
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,141
Erm...

941
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:05,880
I've gotta go.

942
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:07,982
<i>What...</i>

943
01:09:08,016 --> 01:09:09,651
<i>Do... Do be careful...</i>

944
01:09:41,049 --> 01:09:42,583
What?

945
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:44,085
Look what the cat dragged in.

946
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:04,872
Oh, God!

947
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:13,047
Are you all right?

948
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:15,215
Mm-hmm.

949
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,721
I think you should come home.

950
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:24,525
I can't just
come home, Roland.

951
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,094
I've missed you terribly.

952
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,865
This'll all be over soon.

953
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:33,233
I think you've got to let me
look after you now.

954
01:10:33,266 --> 01:10:34,367
Look after me?

955
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,305
Oh, Jesus Christ.

956
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:44,145
-What's the matter?
-Is that why you're here?

957
01:10:44,178 --> 01:10:45,146
To escort me home?

958
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:47,815
No. No.

959
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:51,519
Everything's changed.
It's all different now.

960
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:52,553
I'm the same.

961
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,422
You're the same.

962
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:57,191
Everything will be back
to normal,

963
01:10:57,225 --> 01:10:58,391
it'll all be better.

964
01:10:58,425 --> 01:10:59,861
Normal?

965
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:02,930
You only want me home
so you can feel better

966
01:11:02,964 --> 01:11:05,533
about spending the war
painting some fucking sheds.

967
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,434
There's no need to be cruel.

968
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:10,104
-What are you talking about?
-Please keep your voice down.

969
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:11,873
People are missing.
Our friends.

970
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:13,908
I can't just come home,
sit still, and do nothing.

971
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:18,478
Lee.

972
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:22,049
-I don't have a choice.
-That's not true.

973
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,951
Have you heard a goddamn word
I just said?

974
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:26,353
Yes, I have.

975
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:29,957
I'm just worried about you.

976
01:11:31,259 --> 01:11:32,260
Well, don't.

977
01:11:33,326 --> 01:11:34,327
And I love you.

978
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,430
Come home.

979
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:40,802
Please.

980
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:47,775
I love you, too.

981
01:12:18,139 --> 01:12:19,507
Roland thinks I should...

982
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,143
"Roland thinks"
is not really a sentence

983
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,878
I'd like to hear
finished right now.

984
01:12:27,982 --> 01:12:29,217
I'm heading to the front.

985
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:36,891
Ready to go?

986
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:43,097
That's not what I thought
you were gonna say.

987
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,277
<i>Why didn't I</i>
<i>just go home?</i>

988
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,080
<i>I guess I could have.</i>

989
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:03,351
<i>But I've always been the last</i>
<i>to leave the party.</i>

990
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:23,371
You want some?

991
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:26,607
Everybody's taking them.

992
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,441
Takes the edge off.

993
01:13:29,577 --> 01:13:30,711
I'm all right, thanks.

994
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:33,247
Suit yourself.

995
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,638
Oh, God.

996
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:00,341
My entire body hurts.

997
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:07,248
Ugh!

998
01:14:18,426 --> 01:14:19,860
<i>We drove for months.</i>

999
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:23,531
<i>Didn't wash for weeks.</i>

1000
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,938
<i>Five hundred miles</i>
<i>into the worst of it all.</i>

1001
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:47,788
-Colonel.
-Miller.

1002
01:14:49,824 --> 01:14:50,958
Suicide pacts.

1003
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:52,059
We're finding them everywhere.

1004
01:14:52,093 --> 01:14:54,295
Whole families
swallowing cyanide.

1005
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:55,663
We the first ones here?

1006
01:14:55,696 --> 01:14:56,831
Yes, you are.

1007
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:01,035
Thanks.

1008
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:42,843
There's so much life
in a person's eyes.

1009
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:46,680
Right up until the moment
that there isn't.

1010
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,730
It was no longer something
I'd heard about or imagined.

1011
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:06,867
It was real.

1012
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,492
Okay,
that's far enough.

1013
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,563
<i>Once you've seen it...</i>

1014
01:16:36,697 --> 01:16:38,567
<i>...you can never unsee it.</i>

1015
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:17,805
No sign of life, sir.

1016
01:17:24,812 --> 01:17:26,046
No sign of life.

1017
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:40,161
No sign of life, sir.

1018
01:17:43,697 --> 01:17:44,698
Oh, my God.

1019
01:18:01,015 --> 01:18:02,249
-Davy.
-Yeah?

1020
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:05,286
Davy, give me a leg up.

1021
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:10,824
All right.

1022
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:13,662
Okay.

1023
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:25,018
It's all right.

1024
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:38,132
It's all right.

1025
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:41,468
See?

1026
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:47,876
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1027
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,378
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1028
01:21:55,115 --> 01:21:56,283
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1029
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:17,164
Jesus Christ.

1030
01:23:26,508 --> 01:23:27,509
What?

1031
01:24:01,976 --> 01:24:02,944
Davy.

1032
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,451
And go.

1033
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:16,558
All right, let's go.

1034
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:20,528
Got it?

1035
01:24:21,596 --> 01:24:22,597
Yeah.

1036
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:26,133
-Okay, come on.
-Yeah.

1037
01:25:19,821 --> 01:25:22,523
Davy, slow down. Slow down.

1038
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:25,425
Is this it?

1039
01:25:26,259 --> 01:25:27,528
Yeah, left. Left.

1040
01:25:31,566 --> 01:25:34,368
Prinzregentenplatz, yeah.

1041
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:56,924
-Hiya, press.
-This place is off limits.

1042
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,291
Officers only.

1043
01:25:59,627 --> 01:26:01,562
-Cigarette?
-Thank you.

1044
01:26:03,131 --> 01:26:05,533
-It's kinda chilly out, huh?
-Sure is.

1045
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:10,571
I'm Lee Miller.

1046
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:13,173
This is my friend
David Scherman.

1047
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:16,511
We'd love to step inside

1048
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:20,213
for a few moments if...

1049
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:22,750
that would be all right.

1050
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:27,354
Thank you.

1051
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:33,427
-Good evening.
-Ma'am.

1052
01:27:21,274 --> 01:27:22,977
You guys
got any requests?

1053
01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:31,953
Welcome to
Hitler's humble abode.

1054
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:38,926
Thanks.

1055
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,763
-Cigarette?
-Oh. Thank you.

1056
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,468
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

1057
01:28:04,552 --> 01:28:06,587
-Hi.
-Hi.

1058
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:31,512
Davy.

1059
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:44,357
Fuck.

1060
01:29:05,046 --> 01:29:06,047
After you.

1061
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:47,588
Hey, Davy, it's hot.

1062
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:08,809
Davy.

1063
01:30:09,543 --> 01:30:10,578
Come here.

1064
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:12,380
-What?
-Come on, quick. I need you.

1065
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,716
For what?

1066
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:37,504
-Is it good?
-Locked.

1067
01:30:38,471 --> 01:30:39,472
All right.

1068
01:30:43,377 --> 01:30:44,345
All right.

1069
01:30:45,413 --> 01:30:46,414
Here?

1070
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:48,749
Yeah.

1071
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:02,630
-Ready?
-Yeah. You?

1072
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:09,437
-Oh. Hot!
-Wipe off the frame.

1073
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,842
-Yeah.
-Fucking thing.

1074
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,310
Wait.

1075
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:22,383
Jesus Christ!

1076
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,521
Is that in?

1077
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,792
-Just check.
-All right, it's in. Come on.

1078
01:31:31,826 --> 01:31:33,227
Make sure
you can't see my tits,

1079
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,862
we'll never get it
past the censor.

1080
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:43,771
Go.

1081
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:13,801
Davy?

1082
01:32:13,834 --> 01:32:15,703
I... I don't know...

1083
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:39,693
All those people.

1084
01:32:44,031 --> 01:32:45,433
All those people.

1085
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:51,105
They were all my people.

1086
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,249
Hitler and Eva Braun
were dead

1087
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:36,917
by the time we were
in his apartment.

1088
01:33:38,452 --> 01:33:40,522
They'd committed suicide
in Berlin.

1089
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:42,790
But we didn't know that.

1090
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,626
Did that change how you felt?

1091
01:33:47,596 --> 01:33:49,864
Washing
in <i>Der Fuhrer's</i> bathtub?

1092
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:53,767
What on earth
made you do that?

1093
01:33:56,737 --> 01:33:57,771
You think it was wrong?

1094
01:34:00,074 --> 01:34:02,076
I think it sounds like you.

1095
01:34:02,109 --> 01:34:04,044
-What does that mean?
-Being impulsive.

1096
01:34:04,078 --> 01:34:05,746
Not thinking
about the consequences

1097
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:07,781
or appearances.

1098
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:09,650
Why the hell should I
care about appearances?

1099
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,990
Why don't you answer
some goddamn questions, hmm?

1100
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:18,325
Fine.

1101
01:34:21,596 --> 01:34:22,730
Tell me about your mother.

1102
01:34:27,134 --> 01:34:28,369
What do you want me to say?

1103
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:31,640
Up to you.

1104
01:34:42,617 --> 01:34:44,151
I spent my entire life

1105
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:47,154
thinking that
I was the problem.

1106
01:34:50,191 --> 01:34:53,327
My mere existence
was the problem.

1107
01:34:57,164 --> 01:34:59,668
Took me a long time to realise
it wasn't me. It was her.

1108
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:06,473
I felt like she blamed me

1109
01:35:06,508 --> 01:35:08,075
for everything
that went wrong in her life.

1110
01:35:10,978 --> 01:35:11,946
And...

1111
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:21,690
And that made me feel like
I ruined everything for her.

1112
01:35:30,264 --> 01:35:31,566
That's really what you think?

1113
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:38,372
Do you have
another explanation?

1114
01:35:46,113 --> 01:35:47,582
That's disappointing.

1115
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:00,894
Stop.

1116
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:10,170
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:20,735
I think it's here.

1118
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:40,220
Where are they?

1119
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:45,225
-Where are my pictures?
-Are they not there?

1120
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:47,261
-Let me look.
-No, they're not fucking here!

1121
01:39:08,449 --> 01:39:10,919
Lee?
Hello, can I help you?

1122
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:13,954
Are... Are you looking
for something in particular?

1123
01:39:15,422 --> 01:39:16,423
Er...

1124
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:18,526
Can I... Can I help?

1125
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:22,362
Where are they? Huh?

1126
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,741
Oh, goodness!

1127
01:39:33,775 --> 01:39:35,409
Stop! Stop!
Please, you mustn't.

1128
01:39:35,442 --> 01:39:36,778
These are mine.

1129
01:39:36,811 --> 01:39:40,447
I took them. I decide
what happens to them.

1130
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:42,517
Lee!

1131
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:47,555
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

1132
01:39:47,589 --> 01:39:50,558
Stop, they're
an historical record.

1133
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:52,326
Well, who cares?
Nobody saw them!

1134
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:53,561
You didn't print them.

1135
01:39:53,595 --> 01:39:55,897
I fought for them, Lee.
I fought for them!

1136
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:57,397
-Fuck!
-These must be preserved.

1137
01:39:57,431 --> 01:39:59,399
For what? To just sit
in a filing cabinet?

1138
01:39:59,433 --> 01:40:01,970
The Ministry thought
they may disturb people.

1139
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:03,938
Fuck! This happened!

1140
01:40:03,972 --> 01:40:05,840
-This really happened.
-Lee. Lee!

1141
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,441
-This happened.
-Lee, Lee.

1142
01:40:07,474 --> 01:40:09,443
These images
will disturb people

1143
01:40:09,476 --> 01:40:10,812
more than they've already
been disturbed.

1144
01:40:10,845 --> 01:40:12,045
People need to move on.

1145
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,281
Move on? Move on?

1146
01:40:14,314 --> 01:40:16,951
All right. This little girl,
in a death camp,

1147
01:40:16,985 --> 01:40:19,152
raped and beaten!

1148
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:21,923
How does she move on?
How does she move on?

1149
01:40:21,956 --> 01:40:24,057
Ever. Ever.

1150
01:40:25,392 --> 01:40:27,060
Ever.

1151
01:40:37,572 --> 01:40:39,239
I just wanna...

1152
01:40:49,684 --> 01:40:51,553
I've sent them
to New York.

1153
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:53,988
And I'm hoping
that American <i>Vogue</i>

1154
01:40:54,022 --> 01:40:55,489
will publish them.

1155
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:58,626
I'm really trying, Lee.
I'm really trying.

1156
01:41:03,665 --> 01:41:05,065
Not hard enough.

1157
01:41:07,501 --> 01:41:09,571
You're not trying hard enough.

1158
01:41:35,797 --> 01:41:37,497
I know you think
I've let you down.

1159
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:41,435
And I wish

1160
01:41:42,269 --> 01:41:43,538
that you'd let me explain

1161
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:45,138
before you started
destroying them.

1162
01:41:50,377 --> 01:41:51,345
I'm sorry.

1163
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:06,293
My mother was unwell

1164
01:42:07,729 --> 01:42:09,196
when I was seven years old.

1165
01:42:11,633 --> 01:42:14,602
So I was sent to stay with

1166
01:42:16,269 --> 01:42:18,372
family friends
until she got better.

1167
01:42:21,576 --> 01:42:22,543
They were nice people.

1168
01:42:23,778 --> 01:42:25,245
They were good to me.

1169
01:42:29,182 --> 01:42:31,184
But there was another man
who came to visit.

1170
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:37,457
He had dark hair.

1171
01:42:42,764 --> 01:42:44,832
He took care of me
at the house when the...

1172
01:42:47,167 --> 01:42:48,903
The family
went into town one day.

1173
01:42:54,374 --> 01:42:55,977
He took me into the bedroom

1174
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:00,048
and told me,

1175
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:02,917
"Lie down."

1176
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,221
And he...

1177
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:12,727
He...

1178
01:43:19,466 --> 01:43:21,002
My mother said
I should never tell.

1179
01:43:24,504 --> 01:43:25,505
She was...

1180
01:43:26,206 --> 01:43:27,441
She was so ashamed.

1181
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:35,382
So I've never told.

1182
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:42,790
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1183
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,465
It's unthinkable.

1184
01:43:54,902 --> 01:43:56,904
But it happens all the time.

1185
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:09,817
And they just
get away with it.

1186
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:32,667
This is a...

1187
01:45:33,835 --> 01:45:34,836
lock of hair

1188
01:45:36,103 --> 01:45:37,470
from your first haircut.

1189
01:45:45,345 --> 01:45:48,249
This is the first book
I ever read to you.

1190
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:56,324
This is the first picture
you ever drew.

1191
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:05,333
This is the first picture

1192
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:07,500
I ever took of you
and your father.

1193
01:46:15,576 --> 01:46:17,078
I know I made mistakes.

1194
01:46:18,913 --> 01:46:21,682
And I know I may not have been
a good mother, Tony.

1195
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,054
But I really tried.

1196
01:46:36,063 --> 01:46:38,099
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

1197
01:46:48,843 --> 01:46:49,911
I wish I'd known.
