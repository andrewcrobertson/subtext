2
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Are you here to kill me?

3
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,220
I know what this is.

4
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,220
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

5
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,020
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

6
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,900
A man possessed of
some radical notions.

7
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,040
COBB: What is the
most resilient parasite?

8
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,960
A bacteria? A virus?

9
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,540
An intestinal worm?

10
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,750
What Mr. Cobb
is trying to say...

11
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,260
An idea.

12
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,930
Resilient. Highly contagious.

13
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,930
Once an idea has taken hold of the
brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.

14
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,810
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,230
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,940
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,070
Yes. In the dream state, your
conscious defenses are lowered...

18
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,650
and that makes your
thoughts vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,070
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,780
Mr. Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,450
from even the most
skilled extractor.

22
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,790
How can you do that?

23
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,080
Because I am the
most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,670
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

25
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,750
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

26
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,010
your defense is never down.

27
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,090
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,600
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

29
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,350
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,190
If this is a dream, and you
have a safe full of secrets...

31
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,690
I need to know
what's in that safe.

32
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,690
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,030
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

34
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,330
He knows.

35
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,210
What's going on up there?

36
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,930
Saito knows. He's
playing with us.

37
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,430
Doesn't matter. I can
get it here. Trust me.

38
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,100
The information is in the safe.

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,650
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

40
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,610
What's she doing here?

41
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,660
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

42
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Okay, make sure you
do. We're here to work.

43
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,130
If I jumped, would I survive?

44
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,720
With a clean dive, perhaps.

45
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,550
Mal, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,050
I thought you might
be missing me.

47
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,770
COBB: You know that I am.

48
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,980
But I can't trust you anymore.

49
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,900
So what?

50
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,270
MAL: Looks like Arthur's taste.

51
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

52
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,610
Please, have a seat.

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,920
MAL: Tell me...

54
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,920
do the children miss me?

55
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
You can't imagine.

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,930
What are you doing?

57
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,890
Just getting some fresh air.

58
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,890
Stay where you are, Mal.

59
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Goddamn it.

60
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,800
SAITO: Turn around.

61
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
The gun, Dom.

62
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,110
Please.

63
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,120
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

64
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,960
Did she tell you? Or
have you known all along?

65
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,960
That you're here to steal from
me, or that we are actually asleep?

66
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,430
I want to know the
name of your employer.

67
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,480
There's no use threatening
him in a dream, right, Mal?

68
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,850
Thatdepends on what
you're threatening.

69
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,770
Killing him would
just wake him up.

70
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,610
But pain...

71
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,490
Pain is in the mind.

72
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,490
And judging by the decor, we're
in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

73
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,380
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

74
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,220
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a
little bit longer. We're almost there.

75
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,030
He was close. Very close.

76
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Stop him!

77
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,700
This isn't gonna
work. Wake him up.

78
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,680
He won't wake.

79
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,940
- Give him the kick.
NASH: What?

80
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,150
Dunk him.

81
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,900
COBB: He's out.

82
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,410
You came prepared?

83
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,910
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

84
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,790
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

85
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,500
particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

86
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,550
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

87
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,800
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

88
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,760
- You got what you came for.
COBB: Well, that's not true.

89
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
You left out a key piece
of information, didn't you?

90
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,930
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

91
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,020
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

92
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,110
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

93
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,240
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

94
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,240
But your deception was obvious.

95
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,990
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

96
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,410
That Corporation that hired
us, they won't accept failure.

97
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,500
We won't last two days.

98
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,830
Cobb?

99
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,170
Looks like I'm gonna have
to do this a little more simply.

100
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,840
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

101
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,810
SAITO: I've always
hated this carpet.

102
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,810
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

103
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,360
But very definitely
made of wool.

104
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,110
Right now...

105
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,110
I'm lying on polyester.

106
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,410
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

107
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,830
You have lived up to
your reputation, Mr. Cobb.

108
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,550
I'm still dreaming.

109
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,550
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

110
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,770
Dream within a
dream? I'm impressed.

111
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,820
But in my dream,
you play by my rules.

112
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

113
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,820
We're not in your dream.

114
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,570
We're in mine.

115
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,590
Asshole. How do you
mess up the carpet?

116
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,090
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

117
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,380
I didn't know he was
gonna rub his cheek on it!

118
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,590
That's enough.

119
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,590
You. What the hell was all that?

120
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,640
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

121
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,600
We don't have time for
this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.

122
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
ARTHUR: He's not gonna
check every compartment.

123
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

124
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Listen. Every man for himself.

125
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,730
Yes, hello?

126
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,850
PHILLIPA: <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>
JAMES: <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

127
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,650
Hey, guys. Hey. How
are you? How you doing?

128
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,030
PHILLIPA: <i>Good.</i>
JAMES: <i>Okay, I guess.</i>

129
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,950
Okay? Who's just
okay? Is that you, James?

130
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,870
JAMES: <i>Yeah. When are
you coming home, Dad?</i>

131
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,660
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I
can't. Not for a while, remember?

132
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,330
JAMES: Why?

133
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

134
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,720
PHILLIPA: <i>Grandma says
you're never coming back.</i>

135
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,550
COBB: <i>Phillipa, is that you?</i>

136
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,060
Put Grandma on the
phone for me, will you?

137
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,890
PHILLIPA: <i>She's
shaking her head.</i>

138
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,270
Well, just hope she's
wrong about that.

139
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,190
JAMES: <i>Daddy?</i>

140
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,400
Yeah, James?

141
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,700
JAMES: <i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

142
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,200
James, we talked about this.

143
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,580
Mommy's not here anymore.

144
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
JAMES: <i>Where?</i>

145
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,380
WOMAN: <i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye-bye.</i>

146
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,590
Listen, I'm gonna send some
presents with Grandpa, all right?

147
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,750
And you be good, you be...

148
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,100
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

149
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,860
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

151
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,450
Well, down in the
dream, Mal showing up.

152
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,870
Look, I'm, sorry about your
leg. Won't happen again.

153
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,370
It's getting worse, isn't it?

154
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,620
One apology's all
you're getting, all right?

155
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,290
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

156
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,920
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

157
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,840
to Cobol Engineering
two hours ago.

158
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,630
By now, they know we
failed. It's time we disappear.

159
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,300
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

160
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,720
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

161
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,140
Stateside.

162
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Send my regards.

163
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
He sold you out. Thought to
come to me and bargain for his life.

164
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,700
So I offer you the satisfaction.

165
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,450
It's not the way I
deal with things.

166
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,510
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

167
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,510
But I can't speak for
Cobol Engineering.

168
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,160
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

169
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,700
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

170
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,080
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

171
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,120
why can't you plant
one there instead?

172
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,380
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

173
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,880
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

174
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,050
Elephants.

175
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,420
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

176
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,550
The subject's mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea.

177
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,550
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

178
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,560
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

179
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,400
Because I can find my own
way to square things with Cobol.

180
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,610
Then you do have a choice.

181
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,610
Then I choose to leave, sir.

182
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Tell the crew where
you want to go.

183
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,500
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

184
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,380
How would you like to go home?

185
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,090
To America. To your children.

186
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,600
You can't fix that. No one can.

187
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,600
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

188
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,650
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

189
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,610
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

190
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,280
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

191
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,950
His son will soon inherit
control of the Corporation.

192
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,200
I need him to decide to
break up his father's empire.

193
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,960
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

194
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,380
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

195
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,470
I'd need a guarantee.

196
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,300
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

197
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,390
Butlcan.

198
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,390
So do you want to
take a leap of faith...

199
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,400
or become an old
man, filled with regret...

200
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,400
waiting to die alone?

201
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:31,070
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

202
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,130
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

203
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,000
This can't be done.

204
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,510
Yes, it can. Just have
to go deep enough.

205
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,340
You don't know that.

206
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,390
I've done it before.

207
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,390
Who'd you do it to?

208
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,400
Why are we going to Paris?

209
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,690
We're gonna need
a new architect.

210
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,880
COBB: You never did
like your office, did you?

211
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,800
No space to think in
that broom cupboard.

212
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,260
Is it safe for you to be here?

213
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,850
Extradition between France
and the United States...

214
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,230
is a bureaucratic
nightmare, you know that.

215
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,150
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

216
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,820
Look, I, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

217
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,570
It'll take more than the
occasional stuffed animal...

218
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,740
to convince those children
they still have a father.

219
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

220
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,410
I never taught
you to be a thief.

221
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,790
No, you taught me to
navigate people's minds.

222
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,250
But after what happened...

223
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,250
there weren't a whole lot of
legitimate ways for me to use that skill.

224
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,590
What are you doing here, Dom?

225
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,140
I think I found a way home.

226
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,930
It's a job for some very,
very powerful people.

227
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,930
People who I believe can
fix my charges permanently.

228
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,110
But I need your help.

229
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,610
You're here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best.

230
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,660
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

231
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,280
- Money.
- Not just money.

232
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,780
You remember.

233
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,200
It's the chance to build
cathedrals, entire cities...

234
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,120
things that never existed...

235
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,500
things that couldn't
exist in the real world.

236
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,500
So you want me to let someone
else follow you into your fantasy?

237
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,970
They don't actually
come into the dream.

238
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,430
They just design the levels and
teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

239
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,310
Design it yourself.

240
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:06,310
Mal won't let me.

241
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,490
Come back to reality, Dom.

242
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,450
- Please.
- Reality.

243
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,160
Those kids, your
grandchildren...

244
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,330
they're waiting for their father to
come back home. That's their reality.

245
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,040
And this job, this last
job, that's how I get there.

246
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I would not be standing
here if I knew any other way.

247
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,840
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

248
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,140
I've got somebody better.

249
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,770
<i>Ariadne?</i>

250
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,690
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

251
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,980
Pleased to meet you.

252
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,820
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

253
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,240
A work placement?

254
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,700
Not exactly.

255
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,780
I have a test for you.

256
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,030
You're not gonna
tell me anything first?

257
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,830
Before I describe the job, I
have to know you can do it.

258
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,830
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

259
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,130
You have two minutes to design a
maze that it takes one minute to solve.

260
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,300
Stop.

261
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,640
Again.

262
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Stop.

263
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,150
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

264
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,240
That's more like it.

265
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,770
COBB: <i>They say we only use a
fraction of our brain's true potential.</i>

266
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,600
<i>Now, that's when we're awake.</i>

267
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,770
When we're asleep, our
mind can do almost anything.

268
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,940
Such as?

269
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,110
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

270
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,120
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

271
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,280
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

272
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,700
Genuine inspiration, right?

273
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,210
Now, in a dream, our
mind continuously does this.

274
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,000
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

275
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,590
And our mind does this so well that
we don't even know it's happening.

276
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,470
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

277
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,010
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

278
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,810
Now, this is where I need you.

279
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,350
You create the
world of the dream.

280
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,350
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

281
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,740
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

282
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,360
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

283
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,370
It's only when we wake up that we
realize something was actually strange.

284
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,120
Let me ask you a question.

285
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,670
You never really remember the
beginning of a dream, do you?

286
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,880
You always wind up right in
the middle of what's going on.

287
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,090
I guess, yeah.

288
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,050
So how did we end up here?

289
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,340
Well, we just came from the...

290
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,350
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

291
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,350
Where are you right now?

292
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,890
We're dreaming?

293
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,520
You're in the middle of
the workshop, sleeping.

294
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,650
This is your first lesson in
shared dreaming. Stay calm.

295
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,110
If it's just a dream,
then why are you...?

296
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,480
COBB: Because it's
neverjust a dream, is it?

297
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,950
And a face full of glass hurts like
hell. When you're in it, it feels real.

298
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,320
ARTHUR: That's why the
military developed dream sharing.

299
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,200
It was a training program for Soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

300
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,620
and then wake up.

301
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,580
ARIADNE: How did
architects become involved?

302
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,460
COBB: Well, someone had
to design the dreams, right?

303
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,800
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

304
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,930
Five minutes? What...? We were
talking for, like, at least an hour.

305
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,340
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

306
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,350
therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

307
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,430
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

308
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

309
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,530
COBB: You've got the
basic layout. Bookstore, café.

310
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,370
Almost everything
else is here too.

311
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,450
ARIADNE: Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

312
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,790
- Yours?
- Yes.

313
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,500
Remember, you are the
dreamer. You build this world.

314
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,330
I am the subject.
My mind populates it.

315
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,420
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

316
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,460
That's one of the ways we
extract information from the subject.

317
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,970
How else do you do it?

318
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,090
By creating something
secure, like a bank vault or a jail.

319
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,970
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

320
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,930
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

321
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,140
Well...

322
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,820
I guess I thought that the dream
space would be all about the visual...

323
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,150
but it's more
about the feel of it.

324
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,150
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

325
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:33,280
It's something, isn't it?

326
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Yes, it is.

327
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,230
ARIADNE: Why are
they all looking at me?

328
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,900
Because my subconscious feels
that someone else is creating this world.

329
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,360
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

330
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,570
Converge?

331
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,820
They sense the foreign
nature of the dreamer.

332
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,660
They attack, like white blood
cells fighting an infection.

333
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,080
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

334
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,870
Justyou.

335
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,540
This is great, but I'm telling you, if
you keep changing things like this...

336
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,430
Jeez, mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy?

337
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,430
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

338
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Very impressive.

339
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,580
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

340
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,090
Yeah, I cross it every
day to get to the college.

341
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,670
Never re-create places from your
memory. Always imagine new places.

342
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,670
You draw from
stuff you know, right?

343
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,050
Only use details. A streetlamp or
a phone booth. Never entire areas.

344
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,350
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

345
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,020
is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

346
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,270
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

347
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,440
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

348
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,570
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

349
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,280
Hey, get off of her.
Back up. Back up.

350
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,070
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

351
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,530
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

352
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,780
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

353
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,740
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

354
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,410
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

355
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,040
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

356
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,550
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

357
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,340
There was still
time on the clock.

358
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,050
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

359
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,800
- She'll need a totem.
ARIADNE: What?

360
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,430
A totem, it's a
small personal...

361
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,140
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

362
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,140
She's a real charmer.

363
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,940
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

364
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,860
Yeah. So a totem. You need a
small object, potentially heavy.

365
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,490
Something you can have on
you that no one else knows.

366
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,900
ARIADNE: Like a coin?
ARTHUR: No.

367
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,900
It needs to be more unique
than that. Like, this is a loaded die.

368
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,750
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

369
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,080
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

370
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,090
That way, when you
look at your totem...

371
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:18,090
you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

372
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,100
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

373
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,810
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

374
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,810
And I'm not about to just open
my mind to someone like that.

375
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,780
She'll be back. I've never seen
anyone pick it up that quickly before.

376
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,620
Reality's not gonna be enough for
her now, and when she comes back...

377
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,460
When she comes back, you're
gonna have her building mazes.

378
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,920
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

379
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,250
Eames? No, he's in
Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard.

380
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,210
It's a necessary risk.

381
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,590
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

382
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,590
We need a forger.

383
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,480
Rub them together all you
want, they're not gonna breed.

384
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,440
You never know.

385
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,650
COBB: I'm gonna get you a drink.

386
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,650
You're buying.

387
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,950
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

388
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,080
How's your handwriting?

389
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
- It's versatile.
- Good.

390
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,000
Thank you very much.

391
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,590
Incepüon.

392
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,590
Now, before you bother telling
me it's impossible, let me...

393
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,050
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

394
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,760
Interesting. Because Arthur
keeps telling me it can't be done.

395
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,890
Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

396
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,770
He is good at
what he does, right?

397
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,020
He's the best, but he
has no imagination.

398
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,190
Not like you.

399
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,360
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inoeption, you need imagination.

400
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,070
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

401
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,870
We tried it. We got the idea
in place, but it didn't take.

402
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,370
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

403
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,540
You need the simplest
version of the idea...

404
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,380
in order for it to grow naturally in
your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

405
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,090
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

406
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,470
We need the heir of a major Corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

407
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,050
Right there you have
various political motivations...

408
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,220
and anti-monopolistic
sentiments and so forth.

409
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
But all of that
stuff, it's, om...

410
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,270
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

411
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,940
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

412
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,020
Which is what?

413
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,110
The relationship
with the father.

414
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,950
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

415
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,200
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

416
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,790
He, formulates his own
versions of the compounds.

417
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,250
Why don't you take me there?

418
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,500
Once you've lost your
tail. The man at the bar.

419
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,130
COBB: Cobol Engineering.

420
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,630
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

421
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,340
Don't remember. Let's
see if he starts shooting.

422
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,130
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, half an hour?

423
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,300
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

424
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,180
All right.

425
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

426
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,150
My God, it's you, isn't it?

427
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,440
No, it isn't you.

428
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,030
Not dreaming now, are you?

429
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,070
MAN: Get him!

430
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,170
There!

431
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
<i>One café.</i>

432
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,870
Shh.

433
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:22,830
<i>One café.</i>

434
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,350
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

435
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:24,100
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

436
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,070
So this is your
idea of losing a tail?

437
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,900
Different tail.

438
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,660
Cobb said you'd be back.

439
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,380
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

440
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,550
It's just...

441
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,050
pure creation.

442
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,720
Shall we take a look at some
paradoxical architecture?

443
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,890
ARTHUR: You're gonna
have to master a few tricks...

444
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,600
if you're gonna build three
complete dream levels. Excuse me.

445
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,180
ARIADNE: What kind of tricks?

446
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,850
In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible shapes.

447
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,940
That lets you create closed
loops, like the Penrose Steps.

448
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,940
The infinite staircase.

449
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
See?

450
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,160
Paradox.

451
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,750
So a closed loop like that...

452
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,000
will help you disguise the
boundaries of the dream you create.

453
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,130
But how big do these
levels have to be?

454
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,460
It could be anything from the
floor of a building to an entire city.

455
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,050
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

456
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,630
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

457
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,140
And the better the maze...

458
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,970
Then the longer we have
before the projections Catch us?

459
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,930
Exactly.

460
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,930
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

461
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,810
No one likes to feel someone
else messing around in their mind.

462
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,730
Cobb can't build
anymore, can he?

463
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
I don't know if he
can't, but he won't.

464
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,320
He thinks it's Safer if he
doesn't know the layouts.

465
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,570
Why?

466
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,240
He won't tell me.
But I think it's Mal.

467
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,700
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

468
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,120
- They're still together?
- No.

469
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,590
No, she's dead.

470
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:16,590
What you see in there is
just his projection of her.

471
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,010
What was she like in real life?

472
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,010
She was lovely.

473
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,770
YUSUF: <i>You are seeking a chemist?</i>
COBB: <i>Yes.</i>

474
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,560
To formulate
compounds for a job?

475
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,610
And to go into
the field with us.

476
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,030
No, I rarely go into
the field, Mr. Cobb.

477
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,910
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

478
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,200
- Which are?
- Great depth.

479
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,200
A dream within a
dream? Two levels?

480
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,420
Three.

481
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,170
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

482
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,300
It is possible. You just
have to add a sedative.

483
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,760
A powerful sedative.

484
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,180
- How many team members?
- Five.

485
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,770
SAITO: Six.

486
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,980
The only way to know you've
done the job is if I go in with you.

487
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,230
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

488
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,570
This time, it seems there is.

489
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,450
This, I think, is a good place
to start. I use it every day.

490
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,450
COBB: What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

491
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,580
Perhaps you will
not want to see.

492
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,380
After you.

493
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,640
EAMES: Ten. Twelve.
All connected. Bloody hell.

494
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,440
They come every day
to share the dream.

495
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,440
You see? Very stable.

496
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,070
- How long do they dream for?
YUSUF: Three, four hours, each day.

497
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,280
In dream time?

498
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,120
With this compound? About
40 hours, each and every day.

499
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,960
- Why do they do it?
YUSUF: Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

500
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,540
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

501
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,130
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

502
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,130
- They come here every day to sleep?
MAN: No.

503
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,970
They come to be woken up.

504
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,180
The dream has
become their reality.

505
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,860
Who are you to
say otherwise, sir?

506
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Let's see what you can do.

507
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,660
You know how to find me.

508
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,670
You know what you have to do.

509
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,920
Sharp, no?

510
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,940
SAITO: Are you
all right, Mr. Cobb?

511
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's just fine.

512
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,040
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer
Morrow energy conglomerate.

513
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,080
COBB: What's your
problem with this Mr. Fischer?

514
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,090
That's not your concern.

515
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:44,630
Mr. Saito, this isn't your
typical corporate espionage.

516
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,380
You asked me for inception.

517
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,930
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

518
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,060
Now, the seed that we plant in this
man's mind will grow into an idea.

519
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,100
This idea will define him.

520
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
It may come to change...

521
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,570
Well, it may come to
change everything about him.

522
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,070
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

523
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,320
And we can no longer compete.

524
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,950
Soon, they'll control the
energy supply of half the world.

525
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,750
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

526
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,250
The world needs Robert
Fischer to change his mind.

527
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,960
EAMES: That's where we come in.

528
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,420
How is Robert Fischer's
relationship with his father?

529
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,300
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

530
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,970
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

531
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,350
Can you get me access
to this man here? Browning.

532
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,680
Fischer Senior's right-hand
man. Fischer Junior's godfather.

533
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,100
It should be possible, if you
can get the right references.

534
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:45,110
References are something of
a Specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

535
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,320
BROWNING: I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

536
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,610
LAWYER: Mr. Browning...

537
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Maurice Fischer's policy is
always one of avoiding litigation.

538
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,630
Well, shall we voice your
concerns with Maurice directly?

539
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,210
Not sure that's necessary.

540
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,210
No, no, no. I think we should.

541
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,570
BROWNING: How is he?

542
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,490
I don't want to bother
him unnecessarily, but...

543
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:36,490
MAURICE: Robert, I told you keep
out the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...

544
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,710
NURSE: Mr. Fischer.
MAURICE: Put it through.

545
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,630
Never, never. Never
do the same as I asked.

546
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,630
Leave that.

547
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,640
Here.

548
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,140
BROWNING: Must be a
cherished memory of his.

549
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,850
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

550
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,860
Robert...

551
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,440
we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

552
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,740
I know this is hard,
but it's imperative...

553
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,450
Not now, Uncle Peter.

554
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,700
EAMES: <i>The vultures are circling.</i>

555
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,290
<i>And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</i>

556
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,340
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

557
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,880
<i>and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</i>

558
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,890
So now in the first layer of the
dream, I can impersonate Browning.

559
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,310
<i>And suggest concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind.</i>

560
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,310
Then, when we take
him a level deeper...

561
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,980
his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

562
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,060
So he gives himself the idea.

563
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,710
Precisely. That's the
only way it will stick.

564
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,490
It has to seem self-generated.

565
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,070
Eames, I am impressed.

566
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:59,070
Your condescension, as always, is
much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

567
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,140
Were you going
under on your own?

568
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,810
No, no, I was just,
running some experiments.

569
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,940
I didn't realize
anyone was here, 30...

570
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,770
Yeah, I was just... I was
working on my totem, actually.

571
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,110
Here, let me take a look.

572
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,610
So you're learning?

573
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:38,740
An elegant solution for
keeping track of reality.

574
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,370
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was...

575
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:44,120
It was Mal's, actually. This...

576
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,130
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

577
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,550
Just spin and spin.

578
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,380
Arthur told me she passed away.

579
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,640
How are the mazes coming along?

580
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,680
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

581
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,310
that we are trying to access.

582
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:08,310
So I'm making the bottom level a
hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.

583
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,070
You know, I... Actually, I have
a question about this layout.

584
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,990
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

585
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,320
Why is that so important?

586
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,490
In case one of us
brings in our projections.

587
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,200
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

588
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,830
You mean in case
you bring Mal in.

589
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,170
You can't keep her out, can you?

590
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,840
- Right.
- You can't build...

591
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,340
because if you know the
maze, then she knows it.

592
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,680
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

593
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,680
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

594
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,060
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

595
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,180
No one said it's getting worse.

596
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:50,350
I need to get home. That's
all I care about right now.

597
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,360
Why can't you go home?

598
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:00,530
Because they think I killed her.

599
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,280
- Thank you.
- For what?

600
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,700
For not asking whether I did.

601
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,040
"I will split up my
father's empire."

602
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,420
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

603
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,380
which is why we need to plant
it deep in his subconscious.

604
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,090
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

605
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,050
We need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept.

606
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,640
How do you translate
business strategy into emotion?

607
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,390
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

608
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,310
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

609
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:36,070
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

610
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,950
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

611
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,830
We all yearn for
reconciliation, for catharsis.

612
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:47,750
We need Robert Fischer to have a
positive emotional reaction to all this.

613
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,750
All right, well, try this. Um...

614
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:54,750
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

615
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,130
That might work.

616
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,470
Might? We're gonna need to
do a little better than "might."

617
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,590
Thank you for your
contribution, Arthur.

618
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,760
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

619
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,010
Specificity?

620
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,020
Inception's not
about being specific.

621
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,020
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

622
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,440
EAMES: On the top level, we open
up his relationship with his father...

623
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,690
and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

624
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,530
Then the next level down, we feed
him, "I will create something for myself."

625
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:28,040
Then, by the time we hit the bottom
level, we bring out the big guns.

626
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,620
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
EAMES: Exactly.

627
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,960
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
Collapse with the slightest disturbance.

628
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,300
Sedation.

629
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,300
For sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming...

630
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,550
we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

631
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,320
Good night.

632
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,690
YUSUF: <i>The compound we'll
be using to share the dream...</i>

633
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,820
<i>Creates</i> a <i>clear connection
between dreamers...</i>

634
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,200
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

635
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,540
Brain function in the dream
will be about 20 times normal.

636
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,210
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

637
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,500
It's three dreams, that's
10 hours times 20...

638
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,540
Math was never my strong
subject. How much time is that?

639
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,920
It's a week, the
first level down.

640
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,930
Six months the second level
down, and the third level...

641
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,010
That's 10 years.

642
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,560
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

643
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,890
Depends on the dream.

644
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,350
So once we've made the
plant, how do we get out?

645
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,860
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

646
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,820
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

647
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,660
EAMES: This,
Ariadne, would be a kick.

648
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,530
It's that feeling of falling
you get that jolts you awake.

649
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,910
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

650
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,290
YUSUP That's the clever part.

651
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,710
I customized the sedative to
leave inner-ear function unimpaired.

652
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,710
That way, however deep the
sleep, the Sleeper still feels falling.

653
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,720
<i>Or tipping.</i>

654
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,390
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

655
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,100
We could use a musical Countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

656
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,490
EAMES: <i>He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.</i>

657
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,660
COBB: <i>Wasn't he supposed
to have a knee operation?</i>

658
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,080
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put
him under for, anyway. And we need...

659
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,160
We need at least
a good 10 hours.

660
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,830
Sydney to Los Angeles.

661
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,250
One of the longest flights in the
world. He makes it every two weeks.

662
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,920
He must be flying private, then.

663
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,260
SAITO: Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

664
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,680
ARTHUR: It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

665
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,300
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

666
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,680
the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

667
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,350
You'd have to buy out the entire
Cabin and the first-class flight attendant.

668
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,480
I bought the airline.

669
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,900
It seemed neater.

670
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,360
Well, looks like we
have our 10 hours.

671
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Ariadne? Terrific
work, by the way.

672
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,170
MAL: You know how to find me.

673
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,170
You know what you have to do.

674
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,760
You remember when you
asked me to marry you?

675
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,890
Of course I do.

676
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:19,890
You said you had a dream.

677
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,520
That we'd grow old together.

678
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,520
And we can.

679
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,910
COBB: You shouldn't be here.

680
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,250
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

681
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,630
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

682
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,630
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

683
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,900
ARIADNE: Why do
you do this to yourself?

684
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:09,570
It's the only way
I can still dream.

685
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,700
Why is it so important to dream?

686
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,700
In my dreams,
we're still together.

687
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,840
These aren't just dreams.

688
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,050
These are memories. And
you said never to use memories.

689
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,760
I know I did.

690
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,430
You're trying to keep her
alive. You can't let her go.

691
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,600
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

692
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,440
They're memories
that I have to change.

693
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,280
Well, what's down
there that you regret?

694
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

695
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,170
ARIADNE: This is your house?

696
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,790
Mine and Mal's, yes.

697
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,170
Where is she?

698
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:16,170
She's already gone.

699
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,640
That's my son, James.

700
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,890
He's digging for
something, maybe a worm.

701
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,770
That's Phillipa.

702
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,810
I thought about
calling out to them...

703
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,270
so they'd turn and
smile and I could see...

704
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:36,270
those beautiful faces of
theirs, but it's all too late.

705
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:41,570
MAN: Right now or never, Cobb.

706
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,830
COBB: Then I start to panic.

707
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,380
I realize I'm gonna
regret this moment...

708
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,880
that I need to see
their faces one last time.

709
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,550
WOMAN: James!
Phillipa! Come on in!

710
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,800
COBB: But the moment's past.

711
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,060
And whatever I do, I
can't change this moment.

712
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,270
As I'm about to
call out to them...

713
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:10,100
they run away.

714
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,400
If I'm ever gonna see their faces
again, I've gotta get back home.

715
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,400
The real world.

716
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,780
What are you doing here?

717
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,070
My name is...

718
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:06,070
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

719
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,130
I'm just trying to understand.

720
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,460
How could you understand?

721
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:22,590
Do you know what
it is to be a lover?

722
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:25,970
To be half of a whole?

723
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,020
No.

724
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,480
I'll tell you a riddle.

725
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,810
You're waiting for a train.

726
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,360
A train that will
take you far away.

727
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,370
You know where you
hope this train will take you...

728
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,780
but you don't know for sure.

729
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,660
But it doesn't matter.

730
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,250
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

731
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,040
COBB: Because
you'll be together.

732
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,550
MAL: How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

733
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,880
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

734
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,140
What happened here?

735
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,390
You promised! You
promised we'd be together!

736
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,640
Please, I need you to
stay here just for now!

737
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,020
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

738
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,650
I'll come back
for you. I promise.

739
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:40,710
Do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?

740
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,010
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

741
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,510
SAITO: It's time.

742
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,010
Maurice Fischerjust
died in Sydney.

743
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,350
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

744
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,770
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

745
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,860
All right.

746
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,020
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

747
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:06,030
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

748
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,070
And it doesn't have to be me...

749
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,080
but then you have to
show Arthur what I just saw.

750
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,170
Get us another
seat on the plane.

751
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,130
COBB: If I get on this plane and
you don't honor our agreement...

752
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,470
when we land, I go to
jail for the rest of my life.

753
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,850
Complete the job en route...

754
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,480
I make one phone
call from the plane...

755
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,480
you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

756
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,790
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, absolutely.

757
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,790
Thank you.

758
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,450
Excuse me, I think this is
yours? You must have dropped it.

759
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,500
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Would you care for a drink?

760
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,960
Water, please.

761
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,250
Om, same, please.

762
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,290
Um...

763
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,550
Thank you.

764
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,590
You know, I couldn't
help but notice...

765
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,340
but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

766
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,800
Yes, he, om...

767
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,220
He was my father.

768
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,220
Well, he was a very inspiring
figure. I'm sorry for your loss.

769
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,060
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

770
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,820
COBB: Hey.

771
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,030
To your father.

772
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:13,030
May he rest in peace?

773
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,220
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

774
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,440
Bit too much free
champagne before takeoff?

775
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,730
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

776
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:29,730
We know he's gonna be
looking for a taxi in this weather.

777
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:44,370
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?
- Walk away.

778
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,850
Just have him ca... I gotta go.

779
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:05,850
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

780
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,360
All right, Third and
Market. Snappy.

781
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,860
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

782
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,530
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

783
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:18,530
Maybe not. Can you
pull over and get this...?

784
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,330
Great.

785
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:26,620
Come on.

786
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,970
There's $500 in there. The
wallet's worth more than that.

787
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,850
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

788
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,140
I'm afraid that it doesn't...

789
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,650
- Cover him!
EAMES: Down! Down now!

790
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:00,650
What the hell is going on?

791
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,160
ARIADNE: This
wasn't in the design.

792
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,290
Cobb?

793
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,720
Get him!

794
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,220
Are you all right?

795
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,560
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

796
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,650
Fischer's okay,
unless he gets carsick.

797
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,650
Saüo?

798
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,250
COBB: Get Fischer
in the back room now.

799
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,380
- Get him in the back room. Move.
ARTHUR: What the hell happened?

800
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,010
COBB: Has he been
shot? Is he dying?

801
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,920
ARTHUR: I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

802
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,510
ARTHUR: What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

803
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,640
Why put a train in a
downtown intersection?

804
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,430
- I didn't.
ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?

805
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,270
Why the hell were we ambushed?

806
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:53,770
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

807
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,560
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

808
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:59,940
teach his subconscious to defend
itself, so his subconscious is militarized.

809
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,740
It should've shown
in the research.

810
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,700
COBB: Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

811
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,200
COBB: Don't tell
me to calm down!

812
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,290
This was your job, goddamn
it! This was your responsibility!

813
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,540
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

814
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,040
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

815
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,290
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

816
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:18,300
This was not a part
of the plan! He's dying.

817
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,500
Put him out his misety.

818
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,510
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

819
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,800
He's in agony.
I'm waking him up.

820
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,850
No. It won't wake him up.

821
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:30,640
What do you mean, it won't wake him
up? When we die in a dream, we wake up.

822
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,060
Not from this.

823
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,190
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

824
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,060
Right. So, what
happens when we die?

825
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,070
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

826
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,780
- Limbo?
ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.

827
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,200
ARIADNE: What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

828
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,580
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

829
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,660
by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

830
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,710
Which, in our case, is just you.

831
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,580
- How long could we be stuck?
YUSUF: Can't even think about...

832
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,170
- ...trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?

833
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,550
Decades. It could be infinite. Ask
him, he's the one who's been there.

834
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:03,920
ARTHUR: Let's get him upstairs.

835
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,840
Great.

836
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,010
Thank you.

837
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:13,430
So now we're trapped in Fischer's
mind, battling his own private army.

838
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,060
And if we get killed...

839
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:20,060
we'll be lost in limbo till our
brains turn to scrambled egg?

840
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,280
ARTHUR: Someone got first aid?

841
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,910
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

842
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,100
I didn't know we'd be
dealing with gunfire.

843
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,040
You had no right.

844
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,540
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

845
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,710
You knew about this
and went along with it?

846
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,920
I trusted him.

847
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,010
When? When he
promised you half his share?

848
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,430
No. His whole share. Besides,
he said he'd done it before.

849
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,680
What, with Mal? Because
that worked so good?

850
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,260
That has nothing to do with it. I did
what I had to to get to my children.

851
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,350
You led us into a war
zone with no way out?

852
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:59,560
There is a way out. We continue on with the
job, and we do it as fast as possible...

853
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,070
and we get out using
the kick, just like before.

854
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,690
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the Stakes.

855
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,740
I am sitting this
one out on this level.

856
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,320
COBB: Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

857
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,740
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

858
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:16,080
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

859
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,080
We have no other choice but to
continue on and do it as fast as possible.

860
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:25,460
Downwards is the
only way forwards.

861
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,760
Get ready.

862
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,760
You, come on. Let's
go shake him up.

863
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:37,020
I'm insured against
kidnapping for up to 10 million.

864
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,100
- This should be very simple.
COBB: Shut up! It won't be.

865
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,560
ARTHUR: In your father's
office, below the bookshelves...

866
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,770
is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

867
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,610
I don't know any safe.

868
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:52,120
COBB: That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

869
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,280
Tell us what it is.

870
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:59,290
I don't know.

871
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,290
We have it on good
authority you do know.

872
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,130
Yeah? Whose authority?

873
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,880
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
EAMES: What's inside it?

874
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:15,890
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

875
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,940
Useful?

876
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,440
Maybe.

877
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,650
You're on. You've got an hour.

878
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,980
An hour?

879
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,400
I was supposed to have
all night to crack this.

880
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,160
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the Chest.

881
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,200
You've got one hour, now get
us something useful, please.

882
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:43,870
- What's that?
- Good authority.

883
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,960
Uncle Peter.

884
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,380
Just make them stop.

885
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,880
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

886
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,720
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

887
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,560
Just let me talk to
him and I'll find out.

888
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,270
You have one
hour. Start talking.

889
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,650
FISCHER: You all right?

890
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,360
You okay?

891
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,700
Those bastards have
had at me for two days.

892
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,370
They have someone with
access to your father's office.

893
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,370
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

894
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:25,290
They thought I'd know the
combination, but I don't know it.

895
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,800
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

896
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,220
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

897
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,470
No, he never gave
me any combination.

898
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:39,760
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

899
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,140
Well, what, then?

900
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,850
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

901
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:48,850
based on your
experiences with Maurice.

902
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:54,150
We didn't have very many,
meaningful experiences together.

903
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,280
Perhaps after your mother died.

904
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,660
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

905
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:07,660
"Robert, there's really
nothing to be said."

906
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:10,300
Well, he was bad with emotion.

907
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,760
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

908
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,180
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

909
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,930
When we get down to the lower
levels, the pain will be less intense.

910
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,350
And if he dies?

911
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,980
Worst-case scenario?

912
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:27,850
When he wakes up, his
mind is completely gone.

913
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:32,110
Cobb, I'll still honor
the arrangement.

914
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,940
COBB: I appreciate that, Saito.

915
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:38,200
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

916
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,410
Limbo is gonna
become your reality.

917
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:44,620
You're gonna be lost down there so
long that you're gonna become an old man.

918
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,420
Filled with regret?

919
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,170
Waiting to die alone.

920
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,840
No.

921
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,300
I'll come back.

922
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,300
And we'll be young
men together again.

923
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,140
Breathe.

924
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,350
These people are gonna kill us if
we don't give them the combination.

925
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,440
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

926
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,480
They're gonna lock us in that
van, and then drive it into the river.

927
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,070
All right. What is in the safe?

928
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,860
Something for you.

929
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:21,740
Maurice always said it was
his most precious gift to you.

930
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,990
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

931
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,370
That's an alternate.

932
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,920
This would supersede
the other if you want it to.

933
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,710
It splits up the component
businesses of Fischer Morrow.

934
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:35,590
It'd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it.

935
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:39,720
Destroying my whole inheritance?

936
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:44,720
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

937
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:48,310
He loved you, Robert.

938
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,100
In his own way.

939
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,190
FISCHER: In his own way.

940
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,860
At the end...

941
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,700
he called me in to his deathbed.

942
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,610
He could barely speak.

943
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:06,620
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

944
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:12,670
He pulled me close.

945
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,630
And I could only make out...

946
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,630
one word.

947
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,760
"Disappointed."

948
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,140
When were you in limbo?

949
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:34,810
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

950
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,400
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

951
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:41,700
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

952
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,910
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

953
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:48,490
And the truth that, as we
go deeper into Fischer...

954
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,120
we're also going
deeper into you.

955
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,120
And I'm not sure we're
gonna like what we find.

956
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,050
We were working together.

957
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,930
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

958
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,350
I kept pushing things.

959
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:09,520
I wanted to go deeper and
deeper. I wanted to go further.

960
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,520
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

961
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,110
that we could get
trapped so deep...

962
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:22,030
that when we wound up on the
shore of our own subconscious...

963
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:27,030
<i>we lost sight of what was real.</i>

964
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,830
We created. We built
the world for ourselves.

965
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,960
<i>We did that for years.</i>

966
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,300
<i>We built our own world.</i>

967
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,180
How long were you stuck there?

968
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:49,180
Something like 50 years.

969
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,140
Jesus.

970
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,640
How could you stand it?

971
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,560
It wasn't so bad at
first, feeling like gods.

972
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,780
<i>The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.</i>

973
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:05,320
Eventually, it just became
impossible for me to live like that.

974
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:10,200
And what about for her?

975
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>She had looked something</i>
away, <i>something deep inside her.</i>

976
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,500
<i>A truth that she had once
known, but chose to forget.</i>

977
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:27,510
Limbo became her reality.

978
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,850
What happened when you woke up?

979
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,600
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

980
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,600
<i>to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that?</i>

981
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:45,020
<i>I knew something was wrong
with her. She just wouldn't admit it.</i>

982
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,860
Eventually, she
told me the truth.

983
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,370
<i>She was possessed by an idea.</i>

984
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:56,370
<i>This one very simple idea
that changed everything.</i>

985
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:01,630
That our world wasn't real.

986
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:06,420
That she needed to wake
up to come back to reality...

987
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:10,050
that in order to
get back home...

988
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:15,050
we had to kill ourselves.

989
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,110
<i>- What about your children?
- She thought they were projeotions...</i>

990
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:25,280
<i>That our real children were
waiting for us up there somewhere.</i>

991
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,150
MAL: I'm their mother!
COBB: Calm down.

992
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,570
I can tell the difference.

993
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,070
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

994
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,950
You don't know you're dreaming!

995
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,330
COBB: <i>She was certain
there was nothing I could do...</i>

996
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:40,330
No matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

997
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,340
She wanted to do it, but
she could not do it alone.

998
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:50,340
<i>She loved me too much, so she
came up with</i> a <i>plan on our anniversary.</i>

999
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,870
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1000
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:25,290
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1001
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,920
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1002
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,800
No, I'm not.

1003
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,470
Now, you listen to me.

1004
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:38,890
If you jump, you're not gonna wake
up, remember? You're gonna die.

1005
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,980
Now, just step back inside.

1006
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,900
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1007
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,900
We've talked enough.

1008
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,740
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1009
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,740
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1010
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,370
We're gonna talk about this.

1011
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,710
All right?

1012
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:05,710
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1013
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:09,920
No, I can't. You
know I can't do that.

1014
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,840
Take a second, think
about our children.

1015
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,340
Think about James.

1016
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,140
Think about Phillipa, now.

1017
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,220
If I go without you, they'll
take them away anyway.

1018
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:23,980
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1019
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,980
explaining how I'm
fearful for my safety.

1020
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:34,490
How you've
threatened to kill me.

1021
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,280
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1022
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,200
Why did...? Why
would you do this to me?

1023
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,250
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1024
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,460
We're going home
to our real children.

1025
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:49,250
No, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1026
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,050
You're waiting for a train.

1027
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:54,800
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1028
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,970
James and Phillipa
are waiting for you!

1029
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:00,970
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1030
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,350
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1031
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:06,730
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1032
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:10,730
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1033
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:15,660
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

1034
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:19,580
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1035
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:23,910
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1036
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,330
<i>So I ran.</i>

1037
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
MAN: Right now, or never, Cobb.

1038
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,510
WOMAN: James! Phillipa!
Come on in! Come on!

1039
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:42,100
All right, let's go.

1040
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:46,480
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1041
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,520
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1042
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,070
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1043
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:57,780
And if we are gonna
succeed in this...

1044
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:02,780
you have to forgive yourself, and
you're gonna have to confront her.

1045
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,950
But you don't have
to do that alone.

1046
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,870
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1047
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:12,870
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1048
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:19,720
We have to move.

1049
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,300
Time's up.

1050
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,220
All right. I don't know
any combination.

1051
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:27,480
- Not consciously, anyway.
- COBB: How about instinctively?

1052
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,610
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1053
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:34,650
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1054
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,070
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1055
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:39,490
I said, right now! Right now!

1056
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:44,490
Five, two, eight,
four, nine, one.

1057
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,420
You'll have to do
better than that.

1058
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:54,420
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1059
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:02,130
FISCHER: We're worth more
to you alive. You hear me?

1060
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,430
What'd you get?

1061
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,150
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1062
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:12,350
This helps us how?

1063
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,650
The stronger the issues, the
more powerful the catharsis.

1064
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:19,900
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1065
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:23,620
Work faster. The projections
are closing in quick.

1066
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:28,620
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1067
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,490
Damn it.

1068
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:08,490
You mustn't be afraid to
dream a little bigger, darling.

1069
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,430
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1070
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:28,310
Destroy his one
positive relationship?

1071
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,600
No, repair his relationship
with his father...

1072
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,100
whilst exposing his
godfather's true nature.

1073
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,270
We should charge Fischer a
lot more than Saito for this job.

1074
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,770
His security is gonna get
worse as we go deeper.

1075
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:41,690
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1076
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,280
EAMES: Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1077
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,990
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1078
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,290
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1079
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,790
- You've done it before?
ARTHUR: Yeah, and it didn't work.

1080
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:55,460
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1081
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,630
Excellent. But you
learned a lot, right?

1082
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,920
- I need some kind of distraction.
EAMES: No problem.

1083
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,300
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1084
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,510
Listen to me. You
drive carefully, all right?

1085
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:09,510
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1086
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,060
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1087
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,520
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1088
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,570
- You ready?
- Ready!

1089
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:22,820
Sweet dreams.

1090
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:26,030
WOMAN: Am I boring you?

1091
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:31,030
I was telling you my story. I
guess it wasn't to your liking.

1092
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:35,290
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1093
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:40,290
There goes Mr. Charles.

1094
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:44,380
Mr. Fischer, right?

1095
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,050
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I...

1096
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:54,350
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1097
01:25:55,270 --> 01:26:00,270
In case you get bored.

1098
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,190
Must've blown you off.

1099
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:08,070
That is, unless her phone
number really is only six digits.

1100
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:13,070
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1101
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,960
Goddamn it. The wallet
alone is worth at least 500...

1102
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,250
About $500, right?

1103
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,380
Don't worry about it. My people
are already on it as we speak.

1104
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,550
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1105
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,390
It's a gambit designed to turn
Fischer against his own subconscious.

1106
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,890
ARIADNE: And why
don't you approve?

1107
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,060
It involves telling the
mark that he's dreaming...

1108
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,390
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1109
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,480
Didn't Cobb say
never to do that?

1110
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,400
So now you've noticed
how much time...

1111
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,780
Cobb spends doing
things he says never to do.

1112
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,740
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1113
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,490
- I'm sorry, but...
MAN: Hold on! Wait!

1114
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,950
You look a bit perkier.

1115
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:56,950
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1116
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,210
Turbulence on the plane?

1117
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,090
No, it's much closer.

1118
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,630
That's Yusuf's driving.

1119
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,720
Um, I'm sorry. Who
did you say you were?

1120
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,980
COBB: Rod Green from marketing.

1121
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:22,690
But that's not
true at all, is it?

1122
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:26,360
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1123
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,610
I'm the head of your
security down here.

1124
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,700
Get out on a different
floor, keep moving.

1125
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,200
Dump the wallet. Security
will be looking for that.

1126
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:39,200
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1127
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:45,340
Security?

1128
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,670
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1129
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:52,670
I specialize in a very
specific type of security.

1130
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,510
Subconscious security.

1131
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,810
You're talking about dreams?

1132
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,680
Are you talking
about, om, extraction?

1133
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,270
I am here to protect you.

1134
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:18,240
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to
protect you in the event...

1135
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,790
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1136
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:25,250
You're not safe here.

1137
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:30,250
They're coming for you.

1138
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:50,190
Strange weather, isn't it?

1139
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:55,200
You feel that?

1140
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,530
What's happening?

1141
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:59,950
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1142
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:03,000
which is making his
subconscious look for the dreamer.

1143
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1144
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:15,590
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1145
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:20,590
We should probably
get out of here.

1146
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,660
COBB: You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1147
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:40,830
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1148
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:45,830
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1149
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:51,250
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1150
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:56,130
is to try and remember how you
arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?

1151
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,590
Yeah, I...

1152
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:02,140
COBB: No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1153
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:07,140
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1154
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:13,650
- You're not real?
- No.

1155
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:17,200
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1156
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,450
I was sent here to
protect you in the event...

1157
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:22,530
that extractors tried to
pull you into a dream.

1158
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:26,870
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1159
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:28,080
Yeah.

1160
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,580
<i>Okay-</i>

1161
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:37,050
Can you get me out of here?

1162
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:42,050
Right away. Follow me.

1163
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:58,860
Hold on a second.

1164
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,160
Jesus Christ! What
are you doing?

1165
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,580
These men were sent
here to abduct you, all right?

1166
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,870
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1167
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:13,870
I need you to work
with me, Mr. Fischer.

1168
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,680
If this is a dream, I should
just kill myself to wake up, right?

1169
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,930
I wouldn't do that if I
were you, Mr. Fischer.

1170
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:32,600
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1171
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,900
you may not wake up.

1172
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:39,900
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1173
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:44,370
You remember the training.

1174
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,620
Remember what I said to you.

1175
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:51,620
Give me the gun.

1176
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:03,470
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1177
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,230
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1178
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:17,440
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1179
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,240
There was, om, a lot of gunfire.

1180
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,410
There was rain.

1181
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:25,240
Uncle Peter.

1182
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,240
- My God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1183
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:35,420
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1184
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:37,630
You're in the back
of a van. Keep going.

1185
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,550
It had something
to do with, om...

1186
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:44,050
Something to do with a safe.

1187
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,840
God, why is it so
hard to remember?

1188
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,720
It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up.

1189
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,600
Listen, it takes
years of practice.

1190
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,190
You and Browning have
been pulled into this dream...

1191
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:56,100
because they're trying to
steal something from your mind.

1192
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:59,860
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1193
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,650
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1194
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:05,570
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1195
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:08,450
They're trying to extract a
number from your subconscious.

1196
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:13,040
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1197
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,330
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1198
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:19,340
Try and remember for
me. This is very important.

1199
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:21,630
Five.

1200
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:24,260
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

1201
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:26,510
That's good. We can
start there. Fifth floor.

1202
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,720
Yep.

1203
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,970
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1204
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:35,390
While you're all asleep in
528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1205
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,690
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1206
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:41,820
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1207
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:45,150
So we get a nice
synchronized kick.

1208
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:47,740
If it's too soon, we
won't get pulled out.

1209
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:51,160
But if it's too late, I
won't be able to drop us.

1210
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,500
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1211
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,500
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1212
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:09,010
They're with me. Go on.

1213
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:31,740
Mr. Charles.

1214
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,870
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1215
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,370
They were trying
to put you under.

1216
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:39,620
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1217
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:42,790
What do you mean, a
dream within a dream?

1218
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,420
Hey. I see you've changed.

1219
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,550
I'm sorry?

1220
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:51,600
I'm sorry. I mistook
you for a friend.

1221
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:55,850
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1222
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:58,940
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1223
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:00,980
Let's follow him and
see how he behaves.

1224
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,110
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1225
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,610
if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1226
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,820
Shh.

1227
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,910
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1228
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:18,500
Well, not exactly. They already
had him. They were torturing him.

1229
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:23,500
And you saw them torture him?

1230
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:30,300
The kidnappers
are working for you?

1231
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,930
Robert.

1232
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:36,180
You're trying to get that safe
open? To get the alternate will?

1233
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:40,600
Fischer Morrow has been my
entire life. I can't let you destroy it.

1234
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,100
I'm not gonna throw
away my inheritance.

1235
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:48,110
I couldn't let you rise to
your father's last taunt.

1236
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:51,280
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1237
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,410
That's his last insult.

1238
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:57,200
A challenge for you to
build something for yourself...

1239
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,200
by telling you you're not
worthy of his accomplishments.

1240
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:11,670
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1241
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:17,260
But he's wrong.

1242
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:20,060
You can build a better
company than he ever did.

1243
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,640
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1244
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:24,940
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1245
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:28,900
He's hiding something, and
we need to find out what that is.

1246
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:33,900
I need you to do the same thing to
him that he was going to do to you.

1247
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:39,870
We'll enter his subconscious and find
out what he doesn't want you to know.

1248
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,080
All right.

1249
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:49,090
- COBB: He's out.
- Wait.

1250
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,340
Whose subconscious
are we going into exactly?

1251
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:52,840
We're going into Fischer's.

1252
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,680
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1253
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,180
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1254
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,930
COBB: That's right.

1255
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:02,180
Security's gonna
run you down hard.

1256
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,060
And I will lead them
on a merry Chase.

1257
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:10,060
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1258
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:17,280
ARTHUR: You good?

1259
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,780
Hey. You ready?

1260
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:23,780
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1261
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,930
ARIADNE: Cobb?

1262
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:41,930
Cobb? What's down there?

1263
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:45,520
Hopefully, the truth we
want Fischer to learn.

1264
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:50,520
I mean, what's
down there for you?

1265
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:29,010
Did you see that?

1266
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,240
COBB: Eames, this is your dream.

1267
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,540
I need you to draw the security
away from the complex, understand?

1268
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,500
- Who guides Fischer in?
COBB: Not me.

1269
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,120
If I know the route, everything
could be compromised.

1270
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,830
- I designed the place.
COBB: No, you're with me.

1271
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,800
SAITO: I could do it.

1272
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,420
All right. Brief him on
the route into the complex.

1273
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:05,760
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1274
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,760
You keep this live. I'll be
listening in the whole time.

1275
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,100
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1276
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,560
FISCHER: You're not coming in?

1277
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,060
In order to find out the
truth about your father...

1278
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:20,940
you're gonna need to break
into Browning's mind on your own.

1279
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:25,940
SAITO: Come on, Fischer!

1280
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:21,340
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1281
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:24,420
Move!

1282
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:25,420
Go!

1283
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:45,690
YUSUP Sod it.

1284
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:54,870
I hope you're ready.

1285
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:07,880
No, it's too soon.

1286
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,970
Cobb, do you hear that?

1287
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:17,060
I first noticed it about 20 minutes
ago, I thought it was the wind up here.

1288
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:19,730
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1289
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,310
So, what do we do?

1290
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:26,310
We move fast.

1291
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:32,320
Yusuf's 10 seconds
from the jump.

1292
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,620
Which gives Arthur
three minutes.

1293
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,410
- Hey!
- That's him!

1294
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:40,290
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1295
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:43,750
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1296
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:48,750
Then they need a new
route, a more direct route.

1297
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:59,600
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1298
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,270
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1299
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,270
Eames?

1300
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,380
Did Eames add any features?

1301
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,010
I don't think I should tell you.

1302
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,760
We don't have time for
this. Did he add anything?

1303
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,180
He added an air-duct system...

1304
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:39,180
- ...that can cut through the maze.
- Good. Explain it to them.

1305
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,340
Paradox.

1306
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,750
ARIADNE: What was that?
- The kick.

1307
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,790
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1308
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:29,670
Yeah, we missed it.

1309
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,040
FISCHER: Man.

1310
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,510
Couldn't someone have
dreamt up a goddamn beach?

1311
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:39,840
EAMES: Well, what
the hell do we do now?

1312
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:41,850
We finish the job
before the next kick.

1313
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:46,850
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1314
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:10,420
WOMAN: <i>If you'd like to make a
call, please hang up and try again.</i>

1315
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:12,460
<i>If you need help, hang up...</i>

1316
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,460
How do I drop
you without gravity?

1317
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,300
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1318
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:45,370
You okay?

1319
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:54,540
SOLDIER: Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1320
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:58,260
Go, go, go!

1321
01:47:58,260 --> 01:47:59,590
There's something wrong.

1322
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:03,180
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1323
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:05,550
Just buy us more
time, all right?

1324
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:07,560
- Come on!
- On my way.

1325
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,560
SOLDIER: Come on! Move!

1326
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:38,440
All right.

1327
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,120
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1328
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:53,790
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1329
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:57,670
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1330
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:01,170
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1331
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:06,170
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1332
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:32,740
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1333
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:37,740
There's an entire
army headed your way.

1334
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,400
I'm in.

1335
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:13,070
SOLDIER: There he is.

1336
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:55,660
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1337
01:51:55,660 --> 01:52:00,660
Come on. Come
on, a little lower.

1338
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,750
ARIADNE: Cobb.

1339
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:08,920
No, she is not real.

1340
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,300
How do you know that?

1341
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:15,300
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1342
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:18,930
Hello.

1343
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:29,150
ARIADNE: Eames! Eames,
get to the antechamber now!

1344
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,280
EAMES: What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1345
01:53:16,410 --> 01:53:19,120
I couldn't shoot her.

1346
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:22,660
There's no use in reviving him. His
mind's already trapped down there.

1347
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,460
It's all over.

1348
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,710
So that's it, then? We failed?

1349
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:32,710
We're done. I'm sorry.

1350
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,090
It's not me that doesn't
get back to my family, is it?

1351
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:41,180
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1352
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:45,060
Let's set the charges.

1353
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:47,860
No, there's still another way.

1354
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:51,440
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1355
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:55,400
No, but there will be
enough time down there.

1356
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:56,700
And we will find him.

1357
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:00,780
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1358
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:04,710
We can give him his
own kick down below.

1359
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,580
Look, you get him in there.

1360
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:09,630
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1361
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:13,630
and we all ride the
kick back up the layers.

1362
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:18,550
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1363
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:22,720
Saito will never
make it, will he?

1364
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,350
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1365
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:28,440
If you are not back before the
kick, I am gone with or without you.

1366
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:33,440
She's right. She's
right. Come on. Let's go.

1367
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:38,280
Can I trust you to do what
needs to happen here?

1368
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,660
Mal's gonna be down there.

1369
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:42,240
I know where to find
her. She'll have Fischer.

1370
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:46,330
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1371
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:51,330
She wants me back
down there with her.

1372
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:20,280
All right?

1373
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:27,000
- This is your world?
- It was.

1374
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,670
And this is where she'll be.

1375
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:31,830
Come on.

1376
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:20,630
Saito. Saito.

1377
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:24,760
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1378
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,760
No room for tourists
on these jobs.

1379
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:35,850
Don't be silly.

1380
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:07,050
ARIADNE: You built all
this? This is incredible.

1381
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:10,100
We built for years.

1382
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:15,100
Then we started
in on the memories.

1383
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:20,150
This way.

1384
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,490
COBB: This was our neighborhood.

1385
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:06,990
Places from our past.

1386
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:08,950
That was our first apartment.

1387
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:11,330
Then we moved to
that building right there.

1388
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:14,040
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1389
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:17,000
You reconstructed all
of this from memory?

1390
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,460
Like I told you,
we had lots of time.

1391
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:22,590
ARIADNE: What is that?

1392
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,510
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1393
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:27,300
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1394
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,470
Come on.

1395
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:31,970
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1396
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:36,970
In the real world, we'd
have to choose, but not here.

1397
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,930
How are we gonna
bring Fischer back?

1398
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:20,520
We're gonna have to come
up with some kind of a kick.

1399
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,940
What?

1400
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,190
I'm gonna improvise.

1401
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:29,190
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inoeption.

1402
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,670
An idea is like
a virus. Resilient.

1403
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:48,380
Highly contagious.

1404
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:52,800
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1405
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,810
It can grow to define...

1406
01:59:55,810 --> 02:00:00,520
or destroy you.

1407
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,900
MAL: The smallest idea, such as:

1408
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:06,530
"Your world is not real."

1409
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:11,530
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1410
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:16,200
So certain of your
world. Of what's real.

1411
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,790
Do you think he is?

1412
02:00:19,790 --> 02:00:23,830
Or do you think
he's as lost as I was?

1413
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:27,420
COBB: I know what's real, Mal.

1414
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:30,420
No creeping doubts?

1415
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:33,340
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1416
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,850
Chased around the globe...

1417
02:00:34,850 --> 02:00:37,680
by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1418
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:41,940
the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1419
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:44,730
Admit it.

1420
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:47,730
You don't believe in
one reality anymore.

1421
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:49,440
So choose.

1422
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:54,440
Choose to be here. Choose me.

1423
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:20,970
You know what I have to do.

1424
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:24,980
I have to get back to our
children because you left them.

1425
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,690
Because you left us.

1426
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:28,650
- You're wrong.
COBB: I'm not wrong.

1427
02:01:28,650 --> 02:01:31,820
You're confused.

1428
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:34,650
Our children are here.

1429
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:38,070
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1430
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,330
Yes, but I'm gonna
see them up above, Mal.

1431
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,680
Up above?

1432
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:01,850
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1433
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:03,730
Watch.

1434
02:02:03,730 --> 02:02:05,600
James? Phillipa?

1435
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:08,190
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1436
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:10,860
You keep telling yourself
that, but you don't believe it.

1437
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:13,150
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1438
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:16,660
What if I'm what's real?

1439
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:20,450
You keep telling
yourself what you know.

1440
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:23,660
But what do you believe?

1441
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:27,040
What do you feel?

1442
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,670
Guilt.

1443
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:32,420
I feel guilt, Mal.

1444
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:36,550
And no matter what I do, no
matter how hopeless I am...

1445
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:40,970
no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1446
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:44,020
reminding me of the truth.

1447
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:47,730
What truth?

1448
02:02:47,730 --> 02:02:52,730
That the idea that caused you to
question your reality came from me.

1449
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:00,990
You planted the idea in my mind?

1450
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,410
What is she talking about?

1451
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:08,410
The reason I knew inception was
possible was because I did it to her first.

1452
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:13,420
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1453
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:15,840
We were lost in here.

1454
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,840
<i>I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.</i>

1455
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:28,680
<i>She had looked something</i>
away, <i>something deep inside.</i>

1456
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:35,100
<i>A truth that she had once
known, but chose to forget.</i>

1457
02:03:35,230 --> 02:03:40,070
And she couldn't break free.

1458
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:43,370
<i>So I decided to search for it.</i>

1459
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:48,370
<i>I went deep into the recess of her
mind and found that secret place.</i>

1460
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:50,870
<i>And I broke in...</i>

1461
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,790
<i>And I planted an idea.</i>

1462
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:58,790
<i>A simple little idea that
would change everything.</i>

1463
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,800
<i>That her world wasn't real.</i>

1464
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:22,990
That death was the only escape.

1465
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:30,500
You're waiting for a train.

1466
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:36,540
A train that'll
take you far away.

1467
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:40,670
You know where you
hope this train will take you...

1468
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:43,840
but you can't know for sure.

1469
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,850
Yet it doesn't matter.

1470
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:51,850
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1471
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:58,570
COBB: <i>But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...</i>

1472
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:03,570
<i>That even after she woke..., </i>

1473
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:08,860
That even after you
came back to reality...

1474
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:14,290
that you'd continue to
believe your world wasn't real.

1475
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,590
That death was the only escape.

1476
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:20,420
Mal, no! Jesus!

1477
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:24,300
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1478
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,550
You betrayed me.

1479
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:30,390
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1480
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:33,600
We can still be
together, right here...

1481
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:38,600
in the world we built together.

1482
02:06:56,890 --> 02:07:00,100
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1483
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:02,440
You can't have him.

1484
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:07,440
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1485
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,740
Fischer is on the porch.

1486
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:15,500
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1487
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:20,500
Go check he's
alive right now. Do it.

1488
02:07:33,810 --> 02:07:37,060
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1489
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:42,060
COBB: You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1490
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,190
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1491
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:51,190
That means he's down here
somewhere. That means I have to find him.

1492
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,950
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1493
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:58,540
I'm the only thing you
do believe in anymore.

1494
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:01,040
No.

1495
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:04,040
I wish.

1496
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:07,670
I wish more than
anything, but...

1497
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:10,550
I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1498
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:14,220
all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1499
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:15,390
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1500
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:18,470
Look at you.

1501
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:23,480
You're just a shade. You're
just a shade of my real wife.

1502
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,320
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1503
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:29,900
I'm sorry, you're
just not good enough.

1504
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,990
Does this feel real?

1505
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:38,950
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1506
02:08:45,170 --> 02:08:47,840
No, no, no!

1507
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:52,840
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1508
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:38,680
I was dis\.

1509
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:41,890
I was dis... Disa...

1510
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:46,890
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...

1511
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:53,320
I know you were disappointed...

1512
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:55,110
I couldn't be you.

1513
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:57,120
No.

1514
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,370
No, no, no.

1515
02:09:59,370 --> 02:10:03,120
I was disappointed...

1516
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:08,120
that you tried.

1517
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:29,310
What?

1518
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:44,410
Come on, come on.

1519
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:14,070
Dad?

1520
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:55,600
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1521
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:10,120
Don't lose yourself! Find
Saito and bring him back!

1522
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,120
I will!

1523
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:54,880
You remember when you
asked me to marry you?

1524
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,170
Yes.

1525
02:12:56,170 --> 02:13:01,170
You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together.

1526
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:05,340
But we did.

1527
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:10,350
<i>We did. You don't remember?</i>

1528
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:17,390
I miss you more
than I can bear...

1529
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:20,940
but we had our time together.

1530
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:25,110
And I have to let you go.

1531
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:30,120
I have to let you go.

1532
02:14:18,170 --> 02:14:23,170
I'm sorry, Robert.

1533
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:51,870
You know, the will means that
Dad wanted me to be my own man...

1534
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:55,500
not just to live for him.

1535
02:14:55,500 --> 02:15:00,500
That's what I'm
gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1536
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,510
What happened?

1537
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:11,390
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1538
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:14,930
No, to find Saito.

1539
02:15:14,930 --> 02:15:19,230
He'll be lost.

1540
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:24,230
No, he'll be all right.

1541
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:42,080
SAITO: Have you come to kill me?

1542
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:48,340
I'm waiting for someone.

1543
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:55,260
COBB: Someone from a
half-remembered dream.

1544
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,890
Cobb?

1545
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:01,400
Impossible.

1546
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:05,610
We were young men together.

1547
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:09,200
I'm an old man.

1548
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:14,200
Filled with regret.

1549
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:19,370
Waiting to die alone.

1550
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:25,250
I've come back for you.

1551
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:30,710
To remind you of something.

1552
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:37,840
Something you once knew.

1553
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:43,060
That this world is not real.

1554
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:50,230
To convince me to
honor our arrangement?

1555
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:55,570
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1556
02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:03,290
Come back...

1557
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:08,290
so we can be young
men together again.

1558
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:15,420
Come back with me.

1559
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:20,510
Come back.

1560
02:17:26,690 --> 02:17:29,020
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Hot towel, sir?

1561
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:32,070
We'll be landing in Los
Angeles in about 20 minutes.

1562
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:36,450
Do you need immigration forms?

1563
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:38,280
Thank you.

1564
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:40,910
Hot towel, sir?

1565
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:45,910
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1566
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,490
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1567
02:18:57,490 --> 02:19:02,490
Thank you, sir.

1568
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:44,990
Welcome.

1569
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
This way.

1570
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:12,600
MILES: James? Phillipa?

1571
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:19,770
Look who's here.

1572
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,820
<i>Hey-</i>

1573
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:26,700
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!

1574
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:30,080
JAMES: Daddy!
COBB: How are you?

1575
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,830
Look what I've been building!

1576
02:20:31,830 --> 02:20:35,710
- What are you building?
JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!

1577
02:20:35,710 --> 02:20:38,760
COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want
you to show me. Can you show me?

1578
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:43,760
JAMES: Let's go.
PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
