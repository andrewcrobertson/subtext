1
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,999
Mum!

2
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,199
Mum!

3
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,479
Mummy!

4
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,999
Mum!

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,359
Mum!

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,479
I had the dream again.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,799
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,079
"straight into
the huge black pot.

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,159
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,039
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

11
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,519
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,919
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,999
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,239
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,719
It's very late.

16
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,519
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,999
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact -

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,839
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,119
What have you done?

20
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,879
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,159
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,199
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,359
Please don't!

24
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,199
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,719
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,239
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,439
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,679
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,519
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,039
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

31
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,959
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

32
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,039
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

33
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,879
Mmm.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,159
Don't do that!

35
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,159
Ready?

36
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,879
Come on.

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,759
Quick. You're late already.

38
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,479
What have you got in there?

39
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,919
See you later, alligator.

40
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,599
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

41
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,719
What?

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,599
One with your milk in it.

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,399
I don't want milk.

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,159
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,519
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

46
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,839
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,799
Do you want a cuppa?

48
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,719
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

49
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,759
Aw.

50
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,759
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,239
Right?

52
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,719
Amelia?

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,399
Your son's school
is on the phone.

54
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,759
Oh, my God.

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,119
Did he hurt anyone?

56
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,439
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,439
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

58
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,679
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

59
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,319
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

60
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,319
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

61
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,559
Monitor?

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,439
He'll be separated
from the other children.

63
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,159
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,479
Samuel won't cope with this.

65
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,879
He already feels so different.

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,639
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,719
Mrs Fanning,

68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,079
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,799
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,959
What he needs
is some understanding.

71
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,559
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,959
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,519
I think I'll just find
another school.

74
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,919
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

75
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,879
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,599
that sees my son
as a human being

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,519
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

78
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,399
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,759
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

80
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,879
His name is Samuel.

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,599
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

82
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,679
You can play
on that swing you like

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,519
for as long as you like, OK?

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,439
Mrs Bruen hates me.

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,999
No, she doesn't.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,319
Just need a break, that's all.

87
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,439
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,519
I'll tell her later.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,439
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

90
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,799
Sam, don't bother the lady.

91
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,359
No, no, no. That's alright.

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,159
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,719
My dad's in the cemetery.

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,879
Oh. That's...

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,759
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

96
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,359
Samuel.

97
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,719
I'm sorry. He just...

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,479
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,479
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

100
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,199
We have to go.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,319
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

102
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,279
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

103
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,879
Right in front of
his own installation.

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,799
Lost all these sales.

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,759
You're not listening.

106
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,439
I am. I am.

107
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,439
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

108
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,359
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

109
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,839
Mum! Mum!

110
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,559
I'm gonna smash its head!

111
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,679
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,799
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

113
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,839
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

114
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,959
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

115
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,919
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

116
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,079
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

117
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,599
She wants to have
a princess party.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,759
Mum! Mum!

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,199
That's OK.

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,359
We don't have to come.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,239
You can still come.

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,319
Mum!

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,439
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

124
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,439
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

125
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,639
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

126
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,519
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

127
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,759
this year, anyway.

128
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,999
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

129
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,599
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,519
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

131
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,679
and I end up feeling awful.

132
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,879
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

133
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,999
We'll be fine.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,119
We'll be absolutely fine.

135
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,799
Mum! Look at me!

136
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,799
Mama!

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,839
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

138
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,759
You look tired, little one.

139
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,999
Have you been in the wars today?

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,359
A few wars.

141
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,919
He's had a big day, that's all.

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,479
He's just exhausted.

143
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,239
Poor little sweetheart.

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,599
Bugsy.

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,279
Come here, little girl. Hello.

146
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,799
You look tired too, love.

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,159
You OK?

148
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,279
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

149
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,079
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

150
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,719
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

151
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,239
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

152
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,519
You can choose one tonight.

153
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,679
Where did you get this?

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,119
On the shelf.

155
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,119
"If it's in a word
or it's in a look,

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,799
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

157
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,999
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,879
"then you can make friends
with a special one -

159
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,359
"a friend of you and me."

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,839
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

161
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,359
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,759
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

163
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,679
"That's when you'll know
he's around.

164
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,919
"You'll see him if you look.

165
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,279
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

166
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,159
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

167
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,959
But you said I could choose.

168
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
"This is what he wears on top.

169
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,039
"He's funny, don't you think?

170
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,159
"See him
in your room at night..."

171
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,199
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

172
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,479
Mum?

173
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,159
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

174
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,119
Mummy?

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,679
Mummy?!

176
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,919
"How sweetly they sung,

177
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,599
"telling of the happiness
and loveliness

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,679
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

179
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,119
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

180
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,519
It's that time of
night again.

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,159
Time...

182
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,519
If that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

183
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,799
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

184
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,679
Do you...

185
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,599
Mum!

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,359
- It's in my room!
- What is?

187
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,079
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

188
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,599
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

189
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,239
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

190
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,159
It's just a book.

191
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,439
It can't hurt you.

192
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,079
You've had a big day.

193
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,599
You're just exhausted.

194
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,159
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

195
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,639
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

196
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,079
I'm gonna protect you.

197
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,919
Mum, it's 9:00.

198
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,599
He's not running a fever
anymore.

199
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,799
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

200
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,559
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

201
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,679
Sorry. What was that?

202
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,079
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

203
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

204
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,079
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

205
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,119
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

206
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,079
88. Number 88.

207
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,919
Two fat ladies.

208
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,479
Good, Elaine!

209
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,999
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

210
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,639
Number 11.

211
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,319
Who has number 11?

212
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,319
Legs 11.

213
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,039
Hey? See what else we've got.

214
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,199
5 billion.

215
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,519
Anyone got 5 billion?

216
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

217
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,279
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

218
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,919
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

219
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,999
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

220
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,279
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

221
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

222
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,319
Why don't you go home?

223
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,719
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,599
I can cover for you.

225
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,119
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

226
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,679
I'll give you my pay.

227
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,519
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,719
You've got a sick boy.

229
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,519
Life's too short.

230
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,279
You're so sweet, Robbie.

231
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,679
- You should go.
- Yeah.

232
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,759
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

233
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,719
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

234
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,919
Rung you a million times.

235
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,919
What happened?

236
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,919
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

237
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,959
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

238
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,119
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

239
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,119
I'm so sorry.

240
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,519
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

241
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,359
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,759
It's not rubbish. It's real!

243
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,799
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

244
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,039
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

245
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,879
You got them for me
on the internet.

246
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,239
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

247
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,239
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

248
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,719
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

249
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,479
Well, I'm not scared.

250
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,479
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

251
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,079
That's enough.

252
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,559
You will be
when it eats your insides.

253
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,359
I've decided

254
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,159
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

255
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,799
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

256
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,759
Samuel.

257
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

258
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,279
life is not always as it seems.

259
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,399
It can be a wondrous thing.

260
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,639
But it can also be
very treacherous.

261
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

262
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,439
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

263
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,319
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

264
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,319
Samuel.

265
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,079
I was just
putting something back.

266
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,439
All your father's things
are down there.

267
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,439
He's my father.

268
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,479
You don't own him!

269
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,279
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

270
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,879
Can I come in?

271
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,159
Hey, matey. This is for you.

272
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,839
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

273
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,279
I'm not sick.

274
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,079
Oh. I-I thought...

275
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,679
No, he's not, actually.

276
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,639
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

277
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,639
You said that's not true.

278
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,119
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

279
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,239
who still believe in monsters?

280
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,359
I hate you!

281
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,839
She won't let me have
a birthday party

282
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,759
and she won't let me have a dad!

283
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,759
Ohh.

284
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,559
Don't eat it.

285
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,879
The Babadook did it, Mum.

286
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,999
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,479
The Babadook did it!

288
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,199
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

289
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,759
Ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,759
girls and boys,

291
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,999
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

292
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,959
Life is not always as it seems.

293
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,919
It can be a wondrous thing.

294
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,799
But it can also be
very treacherous.

295
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,039
In this DVD,

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,479
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

297
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,879
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

298
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,999
Do you think this is funny?

299
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,119
Oh, no. No. No!

300
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,679
Give it to me!

301
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,719
Do you wanna die?

302
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,719
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

303
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,279
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

304
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,999
Don't let it in!

305
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,239
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

306
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,639
I've already got this doll, Mum.

307
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,919
Now she's got a twin.

308
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,079
They can go shopping together.

309
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,039
Off you go.

310
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,319
He's just really tired.

311
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,359
Go and play right now.

312
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
Claire tells me you're a writer.

313
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,759
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

314
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,159
What kind of writing did you do?

315
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,959
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

316
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

317
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,679
It must be difficult.

318
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,999
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

319
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,639
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

320
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,199
and they find it very hard.

321
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,599
How's Richard's merger going?

322
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,679
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

323
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,359
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

324
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,479
Tell me about it!

325
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,719
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

326
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,279
That's a real tragedy.

327
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,479
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

328
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,479
You must have so much
to talk about

329
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,079
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

330
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,599
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

331
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,999
I'm not hurting anybody.

332
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,199
Bye.

333
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,039
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

334
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,639
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

335
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,599
She never comes to our house.

336
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,999
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

337
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,799
'cause it's too depressing.

338
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,679
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

339
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,119
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

340
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,199
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

341
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,519
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

342
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,999
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

343
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,399
Isn't it time you moved on?

344
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,879
I have moved on.

345
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,199
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

346
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,239
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

347
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,919
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

348
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,879
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

349
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,479
I do have a dad!

350
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,239
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

351
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,199
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

352
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,399
I do!

353
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,039
I want to know how you are.

354
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,679
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

355
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,799
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

356
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,319
I can't believe
you just said that.

357
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,759
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

358
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,159
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

359
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,599
That's not true!

360
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,759
And your mum doesn't want you.

361
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,999
No-one wants you.

362
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,799
What did you do?!

363
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,359
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

364
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,479
Is she alright?

365
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,999
Stay here
and look after the children

366
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,999
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

367
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,879
Mummy!
She wouldn't believe me!

368
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,279
Mummy! Mummy!

369
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,119
Mummy!

370
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,959
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

371
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,679
There is no Babadook!

372
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
Get out!

373
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,639
- Get out!
- Samuel?

374
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,799
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

375
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,559
Get out! Get out! Get out!

376
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,159
Please help me!

377
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,239
There's something wrong
with my son.

378
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,719
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

379
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,519
That's when the brain overheats.

380
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,799
It always looks worse
than it is.

381
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,599
I've never seen
anything like this.

382
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,599
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

383
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,319
All his other results
are normal.

384
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,319
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

385
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,999
Very committed to
the monster theory.

386
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,319
That's an understatement.

387
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,919
All children see monsters.

388
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,599
Not like this.

389
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,879
And it's getting worse.

390
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,479
He's becoming aggressive.

391
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,999
He could see a psychiatrist.

392
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,559
I can refer you.

393
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,079
Takes a few weeks to get in.

394
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,239
That'd be great.

395
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
But can you just give me
something for now,

396
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,639
just to make him sleep?

397
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,279
Um, just until...

398
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,599
...just until
we get an appointment.

399
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,839
Please?

400
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,439
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

401
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,799
and when we go home tonight,

402
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,719
this whole nightmare
will start up again

403
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,919
and I am really...

404
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,679
...I'm really not coping.

405
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,279
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

406
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,599
Just until the tests come back.

407
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,279
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

408
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,199
It's really bad.

409
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,519
These can make children
feel foggy.

410
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,679
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

411
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,759
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

412
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,199
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

413
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,519
Why don't people
like me?

414
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,519
Why do you say that?

415
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,279
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

416
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,279
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

417
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,639
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

418
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,959
and not worry.

419
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,119
I don't want you to die.

420
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,119
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

421
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,199
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

422
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,639
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

423
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,879
I've got the day off tomorrow.

424
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,839
Maybe we could do something,
hmm?

425
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,079
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

426
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,719
I think so

427
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,519
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

428
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,399
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

429
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,159
Then I won't mention it.

430
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,319
I promise to protect you.

431
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,959
Come on.

432
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,879
Come on.

433
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,519
Can you stay here with me?

434
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,359
Yes.

435
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,599
I love you, Mum.

436
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,319
Me too.

437
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,479
Her nose
is broken in two places.

438
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,279
She may need surgery.

439
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,599
I'll pay for everything.

440
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,279
You can't even pay
your own bills.

441
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,599
Look, I really have to go.

442
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,239
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

443
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,559
What?

444
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,519
A book turned up
at our place.

445
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,999
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

446
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,719
and put it on our doorstep.

447
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,999
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

448
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,839
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

449
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,999
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

450
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,719
I have to go.

451
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,319
Claire!

452
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,439
Hello?

453
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,359
Mmm, Babadook...

454
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,279
...dook... dook.

455
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,239
Hi.

456
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,039
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

457
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,319
Can you tell us what happened?

458
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,159
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

459
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,079
And?

460
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,119
And it contained violent
and graphic images

461
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,079
of my child and me
being murdered.

462
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,999
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

463
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,159
I burnt it.

464
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,759
You burnt it?

465
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,839
Yes.

466
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,239
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

467
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,679
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

468
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,919
What's he been saying?

469
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,439
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

470
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,199
How do you know
it's the same person?

471
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,559
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

472
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,239
The book you burnt?

473
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,319
Yes.

474
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,079
OK.

475
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,519
Don't worry about it.

476
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,839
Did you get your things done?

477
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,919
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

478
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,639
That's why she shakes like this.

479
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,319
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

480
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,519
that goes through your head.

481
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,999
Oh, it's alright, love.

482
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,799
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

483
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,359
He sees things as they are,
that one.

484
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,999
Oskar was the same.

485
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,639
He always spoke his mind.

486
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,399
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

487
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,599
Hey, Bugsy.

488
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,519
Hey.

489
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,799
Hey!

490
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,959
Eugh!

491
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,079
Don't come in here.

492
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,319
I don't want to buy anything.

493
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,319
Are you Amelia Vanick?

494
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,319
Yes.

495
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,799
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

496
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,519
from the Department of
Community Services.

497
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,479
My son's only been
away for two days.

498
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,879
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

499
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,999
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

500
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,919
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

501
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,399
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

502
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,919
at the moment.

503
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,719
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

504
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,519
Hello, Samuel.

505
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,359
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

506
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,279
How are you?

507
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,839
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

508
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,759
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

509
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,559
He had a fit yesterday.

510
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,839
I'm really tired, actually.

511
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,479
That's no good.

512
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,319
May I have a glass of water,
please?

513
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,479
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

514
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,999
It's a real mess.

515
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,319
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

516
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,799
I normally have
the house sprayed.

517
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,599
I did actually already
have it sprayed

518
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,319
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

519
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,919
and that's why I...

520
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,119
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

521
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,519
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

522
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,719
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

523
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,799
We've caught you
at a bad time.

524
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,679
I'll leave you with this.

525
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,199
We're required
to come back in a week

526
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,919
to talk through your options.

527
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,039
Here's my card.

528
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,759
Mum,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

529
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,919
What was
that noise I heard?

530
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,679
I didn't hear any noise.

531
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,879
Wind howling,
doors slamming.

532
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,719
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

533
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,839
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

534
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,759
Are you sick?

535
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,999
Oh, no, Granny.

536
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,559
It's only 6:00.

537
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,199
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

538
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,599
No.

539
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,519
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

540
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,399
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

541
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,679
Where's its mother,
Skip?

542
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,199
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

543
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,159
Are you off now, Dad?

544
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,799
Yep.
Soon as I fuel up.

545
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,679
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

546
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,759
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

547
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,479
"And the Prince
and the Princess

548
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,319
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

549
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,719
"for the rest of their days."

550
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,839
Babadook...

551
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,639
...dook... dook.

552
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,079
What are we doing?

553
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,839
We're going downstairs.

554
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,119
- Why?
- Because we are.

555
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,999
Iris, Iris, Iris.

556
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,759
No.

557
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,079
Glass and mirror attachment.

558
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,999
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

559
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,479
for a streak-free shine.

560
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,799
As part of
your steaming special,

561
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,559
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

562
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,919
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

563
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,519
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

564
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,799
That's just what I need.

565
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,959
I can't help it if I'm sick.

566
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,319
What do you expect me to do?

567
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,999
You do that!

568
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,439
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

569
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,719
I need to eat something.

570
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,239
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

571
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,119
You said to have them with food.

572
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,919
I'm really hungry, Mum.

573
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,879
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

574
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,759
Don't you ever stop?

575
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,239
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

576
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,599
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

577
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,679
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

578
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,439
I'm so sorry.

579
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,479
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

580
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,159
I've had absolutely no sleep.

581
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,439
I didn't know what I was saying.

582
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,039
I'll cook you something. Hey?

583
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,599
What would you like?

584
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,479
I'm not hungry anymore.

585
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,079
We really need to get
out of this house.

586
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,439
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

587
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,879
Do you want to go to Wally's?

588
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,399
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

589
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,959
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

590
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,279
Give it back!

591
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,199
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

592
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,079
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

593
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,439
Sit down, please.

594
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,599
Where are we going?

595
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,559
I just want to drive
for a little while.

596
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,039
Aarggh!

597
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,959
Mummy! Mummy!

598
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,359
Babadook.

599
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,199
You ran straight into me!

600
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,399
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

601
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,119
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

602
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,999
You could've killed someone!

603
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,639
Hey!

604
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,639
Hey, what are you doing?

605
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,519
Hey! Crazy bitch!

606
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,319
Hi, sweetheart.

607
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,639
Mum?

608
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,399
I can call Aunty Claire.

609
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,119
I can call
and she can come over.

610
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,799
Mum?

611
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,199
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

612
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,759
Mum. Mum, look at me.

613
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,439
It's nice and warm in here.

614
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,959
I don't want you to go away.

615
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,159
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,399
Mum?

617
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,799
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

618
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,159
I can call Mrs Roach.

619
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,839
I don't want you to call anyone.

620
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,079
I just need to sleep.

621
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,119
- Mum...
- Leave it!

622
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,159
There's something
in the house.

623
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,039
There's someone in the house!

624
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,759
Mrs Roach...

625
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,759
...can we come and stay
the night?

626
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,719
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

627
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,039
Has someone
broken into the house?

628
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,999
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

629
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,839
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

630
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,039
Oh, I was so worried.

631
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,519
I told him not to call anyone.

632
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,359
He asked
if you could stay the night.

633
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,079
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

634
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,999
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

635
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,999
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

636
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,519
Yes. Talk soon.

637
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,999
No worries. Talk soon.

638
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,919
I told you not to call anyone

639
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,799
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

640
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,039
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

641
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,159
An old lady who can hardly walk?

642
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,639
Do you want to make her sick?

643
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,519
Get that bloody thing off!

644
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,399
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

645
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,839
in front of our neighbours?

646
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,879
Is this what I have to do?

647
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,159
I'm sorry, Mummy.

648
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,319
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

649
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,239
What'd you say?

650
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,839
I said the Babadook...

651
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,399
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

652
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,079
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

653
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,519
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

654
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,079
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

655
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,599
Alright, Samuel?

656
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,039
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

657
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,519
Nothing!

658
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,559
I feel sick.

659
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,759
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

660
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,319
Mum, I don't think I need...

661
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,239
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

662
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,879
Good boy.

663
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,639
Ohh!

664
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,919
Mum!

665
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,799
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

666
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,159
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

667
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,599
Hey.

668
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,199
Hey!

669
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,919
Here we go.

670
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,639
There's more
where that came from.

671
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,999
Oh!

672
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,479
Aarggh!

673
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,679
What's the secret?

674
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,799
...letter of Max's, didn't you?

675
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,279
No, not for a minute.

676
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,079
Don't lie.
You called me a Jezebel. Why?

677
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,199
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

678
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,599
With fresh meat.

679
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,639
Only five...

680
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,959
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

681
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,079
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

682
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,599
to stab her son.

683
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,679
His body was found
in their basement.

684
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,319
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

685
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,399
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

686
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,279
Little is known about the tragedy

687
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,079
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

688
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,399
He had just turned seven.

689
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,719
Samuel?

690
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,319
Wake up, Mummy.

691
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,279
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

692
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,279
Don't go down there.

693
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,439
It's not safe.

694
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,839
Ohh... I thought you were dead.

695
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,359
I thought you were dead.

696
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,199
We're gonna be together.

697
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,999
You just need to bring me
the boy.

698
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,879
You mean Samuel?

699
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,079
You can bring me the boy.

700
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,159
You can bring me the boy.

701
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,679
You can bring me the boy.

702
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,039
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

703
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,159
I think it's going to rain.

704
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,519
No.

705
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,679
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

706
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,479
Oh, no.

707
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,519
No! No!

708
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,679
Bugsy!

709
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,559
Samuel!

710
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,199
Samuel.

711
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,959
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

712
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,799
You don't want him to die,
do you?

713
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,359
Samuel.

714
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,279
Are you listening to me?

715
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,399
Let me in, you little shit!

716
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,759
Let me in!

717
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,999
Let me in!

718
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,479
Let me in!

719
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,319
Let me in!

720
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,879
You little pig!

721
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,559
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

722
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,639
You don't know how many times

723
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,399
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

724
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,079
I just want you to be happy.

725
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,079
"I just
want you to be happy."

726
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,759
Sometimes...

727
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,439
...I just wanna smash
your head against a brick wall

728
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,559
until your fucking brains
pop out.

729
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,559
You're not my mother.

730
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,079
What did you say?

731
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,599
I said
you're not my mother!

732
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,999
I am your mother!

733
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,399
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

734
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,959
Get away!

735
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,799
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

736
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,519
- Argh!
- Argh!

737
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,679
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

738
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,759
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

739
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,639
I'm OK.

740
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,319
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

741
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,439
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

742
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,479
But I just wanted you to know

743
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,439
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

744
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,399
I love you both.

745
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,239
Samuel.

746
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,599
I'm sorry.

747
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,239
I understand you're scared.

748
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,079
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

749
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,039
I haven't been good at all.

750
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,079
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

751
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,799
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

752
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,959
We're going to
stay there tonight.

753
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,759
Do you want that?

754
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,999
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

755
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,639
I want you to meet your dad.

756
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,799
It's beautiful there.

757
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,839
You'll be happy.

758
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,799
Sorry, Mummy!

759
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,319
Mum!

760
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,879
Mum!

761
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,999
I'm not leaving you.

762
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,599
Mum? Mum?

763
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,079
You said
we'd protect each other.

764
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,879
I know you don't love me.

765
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,399
The Babadook won't let you.

766
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,639
But I love you, Mum.

767
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,279
And I always will.

768
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,399
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

769
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,039
I don't want you to go away.

770
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,559
No! No! No!

771
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,639
Mummy!

772
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,119
Mummy!

773
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,119
Mummy!

774
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,999
Mummy!

775
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,359
Mummy! Mummy!

776
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,439
Mummy!

777
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,959
Mummy!

778
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,639
What is it?

779
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,399
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

780
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,799
Ooh!

781
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,839
What do you want?

782
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,959
What do you want?

783
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,959
No.

784
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,839
Keep breathing.

785
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,999
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

786
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,159
No.

787
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,119
I think it's gonna rain.

788
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,039
Stop!

789
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,439
You are nothing.

790
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,599
You're nothing!

791
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,079
This is my house!

792
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,279
You are trespassing in my house!

793
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:57,159
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

794
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,639
No!

795
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,799
Mummy, don't!

796
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,719
Don't!

797
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,559
Aaaargh!

798
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,959
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

799
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,879
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

800
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,639
What time's the party?

801
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,919
Any time after three is fine.

802
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,759
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

803
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,279
Bye.

804
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,999
Bye, Sam.

805
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,279
That school's
a good choice.

806
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,359
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

807
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,999
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

808
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,639
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

809
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,599
It's time to get back.

810
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,879
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

811
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,159
Mmm.

812
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,919
Are you having a party?

813
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,599
It's Sam's birthday today.

814
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,799
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

815
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,239
That's not true.

816
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,759
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

817
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,959
That's unusual.

818
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,559
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

819
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,679
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

820
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,719
Sam's just like his dad was.

821
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,759
Always speaks his mind.

822
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,919
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

823
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,519
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

824
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,719
I'll take that for you.

825
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,759
Good shot.

826
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,959
Look, there's another one!

827
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,959
Where's your bowl?

828
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,879
Wow. You've got a lot today.

829
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,399
Am I ever gonna see it?

830
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,679
One day, when you're bigger.

831
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:34,119
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

832
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,999
Argh!

833
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,919
Argh!

834
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,039
It's alright.

835
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,679
It's alright.

836
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,639
It's alright.

837
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,119
Shhh...

838
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,079
Shhh...

839
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,999
Shhh...

840
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,759
Shhh...

841
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,119
Shhh...

842
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,319
How was it?

843
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,719
It was pretty quiet today.

844
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,199
Come here.

845
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,519
It's getting much better, Mum.

846
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,559
Wait!

847
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,599
I have a new trick.

848
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,799
Life is not always as it seems.

849
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,639
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

850
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,359
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

851
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,559
Abracadabra!

852
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,679
How did you do that?

853
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,479
Come here, you.

854
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,639
Come here.

855
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,159
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
