1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,380
Ellen, you burned another pot.
You're a fire hazard.

2
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,015
I never hear the whistle.

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,143
Feed the dogs, will you?

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,439
Don't be a grouch. I'm a wonderful
person. Enjoy what you've got.

5
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,811
Whose clothes are those?
Yours.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,812
If you were a dog bowl,
where would you be?

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,439
I'm taking them to the thrift shop.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,020
It's Mrs. Vaughn's
pet charity.

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,946
That's not gonna help you in this town.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,242
Look through that, see what you
want. It's mostly your city clothes.

11
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,534
Okay, guys, come on.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,662
Here you go.

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,909
Hey, I wear this to the Garden.

14
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,372
Locked doors.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,590
Garbage strikes.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,381
Dog dirt and muggers.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,886
Ship it.

18
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,889
Christine what?

19
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,391
Um...

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,314
You don't remember her name?

21
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,776
What's that name for people
who come over from the mainland?

22
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,857
Uh, tourists?
Summer dinks?

23
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,363
That's it.

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,029
So you picked her up at the
ferry. How many were in the group?

25
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,740
Urn, about 20 of us.

26
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,245
Spent the night on the beach?

27
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,666
Most of it.

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,874
Nobody saw her go into the water?

29
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,127
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

30
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,590
You mean, she ran out on you?

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,005
No, sir.

32
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,170
She must've drowned.

33
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,380
Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?

34
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,716
You live here?

35
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,343
No. Hartford.

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,805
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,351
Your parents were born here?

38
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,900
Yeah, but they moved off
when my father retired.

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,685
You an Islander?
No. New York City.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,235
You here for the summer?

41
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,896
Yeah, me and some friends got a house.

42
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,732
What are you paying?

43
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,650
Oh, um, $1,000 each.
There's five of us.

44
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,157
Uh, $100 a week for food, booze.

45
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,487
That's pretty expensive.

46
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,864
It's not bad.

47
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,538
Come on.

48
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,510
Action.

49
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,451
You're gonna have to take a look at this.

50
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,572
No.

51
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,999
I don't want to.

52
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,117
Please.

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,412
You're going to have to take a look at it.

54
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,543
Is it her?

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,120
That's what you're going to tell me.

56
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,746
I don't want to look.

57
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,924
Please, just take a look
and tell me if that's her.

58
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,071
Cut!

59
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,232
What have you got there?

60
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,365
Listen, we had a shark attack at
South Beach this morning, Mayor.

61
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,446
Fatal. I have to
batten down the beach.

62
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,031
Who have you told this to, Lenny?

63
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,207
I just found out about it.

64
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,034
There are some Boy Scouts in the water

65
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,836
a couple of miles down the coast

66
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,664
from where we found the girl.
Chief went to dry them off.

67
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,499
We'll take my car.
Come with us.

68
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,754
But I gotta do these signs...

69
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,633
Come, it'll give us time to
think of what the signs will say.

70
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,713
Action!

71
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,767
Okay. You can
take us back now.

72
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,226
I tell you, I can't do my job in a vacuum.

73
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,895
If this is what you want, you
should have hired Hendricks.

74
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,355
He's got relatives all over the island.

75
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,782
We hired the right man, Martin.

76
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,032
We didn't need someone
with old feuds, family ties.

77
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,113
We need someone to referee this thing.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,240
All right.

79
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,871
Let me tell you about
some of the vandalism

80
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,873
that's been going on, on this island.

81
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,171
You know the white picket
fence around my office?

82
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,918
Apparently the little cookers are
coming with karate chops or something

83
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,218
I don't know what...

84
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,010
Kids are breaking my whole fence.

85
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,265
You're such a...

86
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,232
Where's the... Daddy! Uh...

87
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,193
Right this way.

88
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,146
Okay.
I put in a number three.

89
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,985
That should be softer than the number two.

90
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,115
Try it now.

91
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,942
Hello, Mr. Quint.

92
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,447
How are you, Katie?

93
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,154
Looking well.
Thank you.

94
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,579
Four spools of piano wire, number 12.

95
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,952
Sure.

96
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,124
What do those fish do?
Eat that stuff?

97
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,497
No, they choke on it.

98
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,837
So then Denherder and Charlie

99
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,797
sat there trying to catch their breath

100
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,921
and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife

101
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,968
what happened to her freezer full of meat.

102
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,341
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

103
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,345
Mrs. Kintner must've put
her ad in <i>Field &</i> Stream.

104
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,142
<i>Looks more like The National Enquirer.</i>

105
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,559
All right, hold on a minute.
Hold everything. I said, hold it!

106
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,483
The price is $100.

107
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,023
As a unit.

108
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,447
That's $35.

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,002
Why don't you wait
till you get out a little farther, huh?

110
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,329
Grab that...

111
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,585
Wait a minute.
You have a permit for that?

112
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,756
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,843
Okay. Keep the safety on.

114
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,884
Marker.

115
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,302
Action.

116
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,054
Holy Jesus H. Christ,
look at this bunch of nuts.

117
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,106
Fit for trout fishing, clam digging,

118
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,857
rabbit hunting,

119
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,728
bass fishing,

120
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,446
everything...
Get that guy, Chief.

121
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,694
Wait a minute.
You got a permit for that?

122
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,900
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,530
All right.
Just keep the safety on.

124
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,370
And the more they come,
the worse they look.

125
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,573
You're not going out, too, are you?

126
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,036
Yeah. $3,000 is a lot of
money, and I'd like to have it.

127
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,666
I can certainly use it.
Look out, Chief.

128
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,882
You aren't going out with that
bunch of crazy nuts, are you?

129
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,217
I don't know yet.

130
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,818
Come on! Go get him!
Come on!

131
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,282
I think Harry's got it.
Let's go!

132
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,795
Get him up!

133
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,837
I got him!

134
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,788
Come on.
Would you give me a hand?

135
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,207
Get them out of here.

136
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,219
Get it over here.

137
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,112
Get away from the shark.

138
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,191
Marker.

139
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,822
Take a deep breath, Lorraine.

140
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,126
Did you see the television special,

141
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,253
the Cousteau special on sea otters

142
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,256
where the mother was killed
in front of the baby?

143
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,589
The baby saw it. You could see
the tears coming down its face.

144
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,140
It was the most incredible
thing I've ever seen, but terrible.

145
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,889
Mikey wanted us to adopt the sea otter.

146
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,098
I've never been this moved by
anything on television. It was really...

147
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,062
It was special.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,896
So, you're going on the Aurora.

149
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,152
You're gonna live there 18 months.

150
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,617
So she would go,

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,158
Like that. I mean, she
was a whacko. She was really smooth.

152
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,710
All this was happening during finals week.

153
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,038
She had my long-distance
telephone credit card.

154
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,919
And my father called up one day

155
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,750
and said, "What is
this $1,200 phone bill?"

156
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,923
What was I going to tell him? That
I knew some bozo

157
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,595
Into erotic phone calls?

158
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,299
She was driving me nuts.
She was great.

159
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,368
What was that?

160
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,536
I didn't hear anything.

161
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,676
Try breathing through your mouth.

162
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,853
I quit, Mr. Quint.

163
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,267
You don't go, you don't get paid.

164
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,193
I don't care.
Cut.

165
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,568
I'm not going on that old
slab after that crazy old shark.

166
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,403
I'm not crazy.

167
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,829
You miserable little son of a bitch.

168
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,830
You get that black fish on my boat.

169
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,128
Pump out the bilges, top up the fuel tanks

170
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,877
then get your ass out of here
because you're on the beach.

171
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,671
Beautiful. Cut it.

172
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,810
Marker.

173
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,941
Ready, Roy?
Yeah.

174
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,028
Action.

175
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,573
Gun jammed.

176
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,864
Okay, once again. Cut it.

177
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,951
Set it.

178
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,536
Marker.

179
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,331
Action.
