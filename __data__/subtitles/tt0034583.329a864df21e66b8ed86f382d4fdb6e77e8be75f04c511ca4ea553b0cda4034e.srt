1
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,818
With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,150
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,157
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:24,025
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:27,397
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,500
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,169
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,845
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:54,653
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,355
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:02,128
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,805
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,406
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,808
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,974
And wait and wait...

16
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,949
...and wait.

17
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,189
To all officers:

18
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:34,234
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:37,429
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,440
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,209
Important.

22
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,377
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,374
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:21,880
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,144
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,225
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,053
Halt!

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,319
Halt!

29
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,952
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,625
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:07,592
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:11,426
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

33
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,125
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

34
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,933
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

35
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:26,571
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

36
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,149
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

37
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,617
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

38
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,813
This place is full of vultures.

39
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,721
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

40
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:40,362
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

41
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,397
What an amusing little fellow.

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,897
Waiter.

43
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,302
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

44
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,838
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

45
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,658
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

46
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,078
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

47
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,448
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,920
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

49
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,119
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

50
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,294
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

51
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,127
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

52
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,769
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

53
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,131
That is kind of you.

54
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,445
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

55
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,278
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

56
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,554
- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?

57
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,986
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

58
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,958
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

59
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,154
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

60
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,300
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

61
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,960
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

62
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,720
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

63
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,920
I'll never get out of here.

64
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,165
I'll die in Casablanca.

65
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,597
But can't you make it just a little more?

66
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:34,758
Please?

67
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,372
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

68
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,804
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

69
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,136
All right.

70
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:45,280
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--

71
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,210
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

72
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,790
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

73
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:59,257
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

74
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,726
Remember, in cash.

75
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,597
Cheerio.

76
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,304
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

77
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,047
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

78
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,915
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

79
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,589
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

80
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,622
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

81
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:37,663
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

82
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,495
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

83
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,231
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

84
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,931
We have something
to look forward to.

85
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,439
And his father is the bellboy.

86
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,642
Excuse me.

87
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,275
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

88
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,074
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there.

89
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,381
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

90
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,581
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

91
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,819
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

92
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,964
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

93
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,432
Your cash is good at the bar.

94
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,601
What? Do you know who I am?

95
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,773
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

96
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,943
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

97
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,274
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

98
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,284
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

99
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:09,447
- But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?

100
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,122
What right do I have to think?

101
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,427
May I?

102
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,128
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

103
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,967
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

104
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,405
...today they are the honored dead.

105
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,468
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

106
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,773
I forgive you.

107
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,643
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

108
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,819
I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.

109
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,483
You despise me, don't you?

110
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,848
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

111
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,356
But why?

112
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,457
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

113
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:52,624
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

114
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:57,397
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

115
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,836
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

116
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,403
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

117
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:08,014
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

118
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:11,779
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

119
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:15,355
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

120
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:18,220
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

121
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,454
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

122
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:25,130
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

123
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:26,658
Look, Rick.

124
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,003
Know what this is?

125
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:32,305
Something that even you have never seen.

126
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,636
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

127
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:39,143
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

128
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,304
One moment.

129
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,781
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,786
And then, addio, Casablanca.

131
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:51,285
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

132
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,927
...you are the only one I trust.

133
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,992
Will you keep these for me, please?

134
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,961
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

135
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,898
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

136
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,662
Please keep them for me.

137
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:05,033
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

138
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,542
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

139
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,611
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

140
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:12,836
Rick...

141
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,141
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

142
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,750
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

143
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,014
Just a moment.

144
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:27,222
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

145
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,498
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

146
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:37,661
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

147
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,521
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

148
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,316
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

149
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,016
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

150
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:08,424
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

151
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,158
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

152
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,495
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

153
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:18,764
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

154
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,341
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

155
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,612
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

156
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,872
Suppose we do.

157
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:31,008
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

158
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,949
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

159
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,215
Oh, I like it fine here.

160
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:39,292
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

161
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,756
Sorry.

162
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,931
The boss's private stock...

163
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,536
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

164
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:53,731
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

165
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:01,076
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

166
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,584
Where were you last night?

167
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,020
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

168
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,692
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

169
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,225
Give me another.

170
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,162
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

171
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,530
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

172
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,228
- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.

173
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,806
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

174
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,536
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

175
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,982
Hey, taxi.

176
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,844
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

177
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,782
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

178
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,979
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

179
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,145
And come right back.

180
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,825
Yes, boss.

181
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,265
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

182
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,737
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

183
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,637
Someday they may be scarce.

184
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,078
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

185
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,871
Maybe get her on the rebound.

186
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,175
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

187
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,452
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

188
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,462
The plane to Lisbon.

189
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,938
You would like to be on it?

190
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,804
Why? What's in Lisbon?

191
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,045
The clipper to America.

192
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,943
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

193
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,086
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

194
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,149
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

195
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,018
It's a combination of all three.

196
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,659
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

197
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:55,296
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

198
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,760
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

199
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,165
I was misinformed.

200
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,103
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

201
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,107
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

202
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,672
...and the cashier
would like some money.

203
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,276
I'll get it from the safe.

204
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,007
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--

205
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,811
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

206
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,783
I'm awfully sorry.

207
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,023
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

208
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,927
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

209
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,498
A murderer, no less.

210
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,730
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

211
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:40,739
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

212
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,005
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

213
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:49,309
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

214
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,975
It will amuse your customers.

215
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,646
Our entertainment's enough.

216
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,282
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

217
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,983
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

218
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,322
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

219
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,057
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

220
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,167
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

221
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:10,270
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

222
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,564
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

223
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,867
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

224
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,909
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

225
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,602
How observant you are.

226
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,643
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

227
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,806
Yeah?

228
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,382
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

229
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,515
There are many exit visas sold in this café,
but we know that you've never sold one.

230
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,187
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

231
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,660
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

232
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,059
That is another reason.

233
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:40,030
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

234
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:43,102
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

235
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,796
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

236
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:47,574
Victor Laszlo?

237
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,337
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

238
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,503
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

239
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,139
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

240
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,287
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

241
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,556
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

242
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,884
- Manages what?
- His escape.

243
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,957
- But I just told you--
- Stop it.

244
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,791
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

245
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,296
This is the end of the chase.

246
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,094
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

247
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:15,633
Is that a serious offer?

248
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:18,165
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

249
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,169
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

250
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,171
- Okay.
- Done.

251
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,371
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

252
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,875
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

253
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,781
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

254
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,716
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

255
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,351
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

256
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,687
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

257
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:44,127
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

258
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,361
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

259
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,900
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

260
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,803
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

261
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,378
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

262
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,706
Let me point out just two items:

263
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:04,041
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

264
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:08,121
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

265
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,621
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

266
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,124
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

267
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,551
Maybe.

268
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,792
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

269
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,763
I have my orders.

270
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,400
I see. Gestapo spank.

271
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:25,402
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

272
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,940
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

273
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,237
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

274
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,540
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

275
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:35,945
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

276
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:48,958
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

277
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:53,760
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

278
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:59,101
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

279
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,037
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

280
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,085
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

281
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,281
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

282
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,090
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

283
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,663
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

284
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,824
Very well, sir.

285
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:30,333
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

286
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,134
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

287
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:35,833
I expected no less, captain.

288
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,636
Monsieur Ugarte.

289
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,048
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

290
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,284
May I first please cash my chips?

291
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,057
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

292
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,887
Rick! Rick, help me!

293
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:24,183
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

294
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,164
Excellent, captain.

295
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,996
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

296
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:38,264
I stick my neck out for nobody.

297
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,306
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

298
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:46,038
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

299
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:57,313
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

300
00:22:57,492 --> 00:22:59,392
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

301
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,688
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

302
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,365
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

303
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,527
We are very honored tonight.

304
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:13,868
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

305
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:17,011
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

306
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:19,806
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

307
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,008
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

308
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,778
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

309
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,548
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

310
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,183
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

311
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,019
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

312
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,727
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

313
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,663
There seems to be no secret about that.

314
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:45,033
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

315
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:47,437
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

316
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:49,507
Can you imagine us in London?

317
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,135
When you get there, ask me.

318
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,774
Diplomatist.

319
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,109
How about New York?

320
00:23:55,283 --> 00:24:00,152
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

321
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,556
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

322
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:08,389
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

323
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:12,863
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

324
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:18,869
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

325
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:22,633
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

326
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:26,542
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

327
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,943
Are my eyes really brown?

328
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,347
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

329
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,750
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

330
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,914
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

331
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:41,152
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

332
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:45,091
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

333
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,758
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

334
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:51,938
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

335
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,699
...until the day we marched in.

336
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:58,209
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

337
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,075
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

338
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,475
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

339
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:08,589
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

340
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,215
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

341
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,258
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

342
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,421
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

343
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,165
Perhaps.

344
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:28,274
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

345
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,166
Two Cointreaux, please.

346
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,674
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

347
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,969
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

348
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,081
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

349
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,447
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

350
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:15,951
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

351
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:20,658
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

352
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:23,353
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

353
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,032
The ring is quite unique.

354
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,831
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

355
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:32,430
What is your name?

356
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,905
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

357
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,672
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

358
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

359
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:44,676
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is.

360
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,616
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

361
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,815
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

362
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:53,153
Yes, what is it you want?

363
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,455
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

364
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:59,361
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

365
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,001
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

366
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,695
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

367
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,772
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

368
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,445
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

369
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,411
That was a gross understatement.

370
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,907
You're very kind.

371
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:18,608
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

372
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,548
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

373
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,094
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

374
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,028
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

375
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,168
Somewhere I've seen him.

376
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:35,893
- Sam?
- Yes.

377
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,800
He came from Paris with Rick.

378
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,439
Rick? Who is he?

379
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:43,008
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

380
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:46,476
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

381
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,377
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

382
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,111
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

383
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:55,580
Excuse me.

384
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,588
Major.

385
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:02,255
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

386
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,454
How do you do?

387
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:05,622
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

388
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,359
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

389
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:10,663
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

390
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,966
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

391
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:19,602
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

392
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:23,580
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

393
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:25,379
This is hardly the time or place.

394
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:29,990
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

395
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:31,419
With mademoiselle.

396
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,121
Captain, I am under your authority.

397
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,356
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

398
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:42,434
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

399
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,934
Very well.

400
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,169
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

401
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:55,447
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

402
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,512
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

403
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,754
I must find out what Berger knows.

404
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,152
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

405
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,671
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

406
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,837
Champagne cocktail, please.

407
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,412
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

408
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:06,554
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

409
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,713
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

410
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:12,757
As you see,
it was true every single time.

411
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,485
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

412
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:18,189
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

413
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:21,131
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

414
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:25,534
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

415
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,266
I see.

416
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:31,802
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

417
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,208
Underground, like everywhere else.

418
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,213
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

419
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,212
If you will come--

420
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,066
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

421
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,363
Very well, mademoiselle.

422
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:02,840
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

423
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:07,175
Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

424
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,915
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

425
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,519
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

426
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,489
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

427
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,185
I never expected to see you again.

428
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,494
It's been a long time.

429
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,691
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

430
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,538
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,639
Where is Rick?

432
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:46,719
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

433
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:51,122
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--

434
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,021
He went home.

435
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:57,395
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never--

436
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,965
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

437
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,261
Goes up there all the time.

438
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,500
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

439
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,673
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

440
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:16,607
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

441
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:19,150
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

442
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,278
Play it, Sam.

443
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,281
Play "As Time Goes By."

444
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,820
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

445
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,721
I'll hum it for you.

446
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,776
Sing it, Sam.

447
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,688
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--

448
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:46,306
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--

449
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,805
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

450
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,502
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--

451
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,045
This is Mr. Laszlo.

452
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:55,613
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

453
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,076
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

454
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,250
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

455
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,582
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never--

456
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,622
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

457
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,727
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

458
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:12,021
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

459
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,724
- What for?
- Your work.

460
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,596
Thank you. I try.

461
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,404
We all try. You succeed.

462
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,474
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

463
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:25,869
I wasn't sure you were the same.

464
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,481
- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.

465
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,986
How nice. You remembered.

466
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,952
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

467
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,318
Not an easy day to forget.

468
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:42,824
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

469
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,826
Yes. I put that dress away.

470
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:49,366
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

471
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,666
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

472
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:57,306
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

473
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,573
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

474
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:03,774
...to be found drinking after hours.

475
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,884
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

476
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,780
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

477
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,551
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

478
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,696
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

479
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,593
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

480
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,859
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

481
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:25,863
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

482
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,875
He hasn't played it in a long time.

483
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,346
- Good night.
- Good night.

484
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,140
Night.

485
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,514
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

486
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,922
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

487
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,689
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

488
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:52,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

489
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:32,929
Boss?

490
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,511
- Boss?
- Yeah?

491
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:42,073
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

492
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,218
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

493
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,545
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

494
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,187
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

495
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:51,551
Good, then have a drink.

496
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,693
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

497
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,419
Boss, let's get out of here.

498
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,155
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

499
00:36:58,332 --> 00:37:00,926
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

500
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,103
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

501
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:04,966
We'll take the car and drive all night.

502
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:08,005
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

503
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:12,544
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

504
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:20,577
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

505
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,483
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

506
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,719
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

507
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:32,359
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

508
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,992
What?

509
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:35,858
My watch stopped.

510
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,866
I bet they're asleep in New York.

511
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:41,803
I bet they're asleep all over America.

512
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:52,780
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

513
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,979
...she walks into mine.

514
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:05,160
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

515
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,131
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

516
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:10,429
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

517
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:13,801
- I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.

518
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,032
Play it.

519
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:17,508
Yes, boss.

520
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,997
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

521
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,329
What did you do,
and what did you think?

522
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:54,841
We said no questions.

523
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:01,538
Here's looking at you, kid.

524
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,245
A franc for your thoughts.

525
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,851
In America they'd bring only a penny.

526
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,255
I guess that's about all they're worth.

527
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,087
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

528
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,522
Well, I was wondering...

529
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,734
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

530
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,032
Why there is no other man in my life?

531
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,605
That's easy.
There was.

532
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,137
He's dead.

533
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,948
I'm sorry for asking.

534
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:13,018
I forgot we said no questions.

535
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:20,523
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

536
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,266
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

537
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,378
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

538
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:16,004
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

539
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:04,156
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

540
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:08,131
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

541
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,600
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

542
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:13,033
You said it.

543
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,174
Here's looking at you, kid.

544
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,461
My German's a little rusty.

545
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:47,331
It's the Gestapo.

546
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,074
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

547
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,738
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

548
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,012
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

549
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,850
It's pretty bad timing.

550
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,788
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

551
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:11,864
Let's see.

552
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,001
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

553
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,161
Looking for a job.

554
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:26,370
Was that cannon fire?

555
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,780
Or is it my heart pounding?

556
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:33,043
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

557
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:37,517
And getting closer every minute.

558
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:39,818
Here, here, drink up.

559
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:42,390
We'll never finish the other three.

560
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:46,032
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

561
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,327
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

562
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:51,528
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

563
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:53,336
It's strange.

564
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:57,942
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

565
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,478
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

566
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,649
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

567
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:05,978
No, we must leave.

568
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,387
Yes, of course. We.

569
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:12,320
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

570
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,524
Not at my hotel. I...

571
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,293
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

572
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,527
I'll meet you at the station.

573
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,929
All right, at a quarter to 5.

574
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:26,002
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

575
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:32,372
That's too far ahead to plan.

576
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,343
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

577
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:39,210
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

578
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:43,383
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--

579
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:46,818
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

580
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,062
I love you so much.

581
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:00,229
And I hate this war so much.

582
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,906
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

583
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:08,515
If you shouldn't get away...

584
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,616
If something should keep us apart...

585
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,420
...wherever they put you...

586
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:18,854
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

587
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:25,693
Kiss me.

588
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:29,034
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

589
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:06,505
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

590
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:09,198
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

591
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,502
But this note came just after you left.

592
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:28,322
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

593
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,586
Do you hear me?

594
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:34,233
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

595
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:27,682
Rick, I have to talk to you.

596
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:32,388
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

597
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,687
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

598
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,691
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

599
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:43,267
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

600
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,972
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

601
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:49,540
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

602
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,803
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

603
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:55,646
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

604
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,347
I can understand how you feel.

605
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:01,346
You understand how I feel.

606
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:03,818
How long was it we had, honey?

607
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,952
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

608
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,693
Every one of them.

609
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,263
Mostly I remember the last one.

610
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:16,030
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

611
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,932
...with a comical look on his face...

612
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:20,096
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

613
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:24,269
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

614
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:26,969
Does it got a wild finish?

615
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:29,274
I don't know the finish yet.

616
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,885
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

617
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:39,121
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

618
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,021
At the house of some friends...

619
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:44,061
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

620
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,428
A very great and courageous man.

621
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:50,099
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

622
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,864
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

623
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:57,141
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

624
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,073
And she looked up to him...

625
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:00,813
...and worshiped him...

626
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,812
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

627
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:06,111
Yes, that's very pretty.

628
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:09,983
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

629
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:12,955
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

630
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,458
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

631
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:20,957
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

632
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,036
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

633
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:28,299
Tell me...

634
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:31,335
...who was it you left me for?

635
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,344
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

636
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,414
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

637
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:06,304
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

638
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,846
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

639
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:12,075
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

640
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,344
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

641
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:17,115
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

642
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,349
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

643
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:23,462
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

644
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,531
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

645
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,534
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

646
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:38,237
There is nothing we can do.

647
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:41,942
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

648
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:43,104
I slept very well.

649
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,877
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

650
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:51,022
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

651
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:56,593
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

652
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:59,095
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

653
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,090
You have reached Casablanca.

654
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:04,030
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

655
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,364
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

656
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,304
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

657
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:12,172
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

658
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:14,677
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

659
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:16,940
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

660
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,246
And mademoiselle?

661
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:22,946
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

662
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:26,057
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

663
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,888
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

664
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,996
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

665
00:52:31,164 --> 00:52:33,359
- On one condition.
- And that is?

666
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:36,830
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

667
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:38,368
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

668
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,836
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

669
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,601
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

670
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:46,405
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

671
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,343
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

672
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:51,277
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

673
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,180
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

674
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:58,124
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

675
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,184
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

676
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:05,296
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

677
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:08,092
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

678
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,934
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

679
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:12,661
What if you murdered all of us?

680
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:17,207
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

681
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:19,709
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

682
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,407
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

683
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,175
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

684
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:27,912
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

685
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,612
But there is one exception.

686
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:32,417
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

687
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,493
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

688
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:38,194
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

689
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:39,923
This is still unoccupied France.

690
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,233
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

691
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:46,099
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

692
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:50,369
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

693
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,879
I believe you have a message for him?

694
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:57,312
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

695
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:00,877
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

696
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:02,919
Signor Ugarte is dead.

697
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:11,017
I'm making out the report now.

698
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:13,789
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

699
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:16,330
...or died trying to escape.

700
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,664
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

701
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,361
Good day.

702
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,405
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

703
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,604
Excuse me, captain.

704
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:33,807
Another visa problem has come up.

705
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:37,186
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:48,889
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

707
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:51,830
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

708
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:54,197
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

709
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:56,999
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

710
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,267
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

711
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:01,604
Thanks.

712
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:14,856
Don't be too downhearted.

713
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:17,118
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

714
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:18,625
Thank you very much, signor.

715
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:21,230
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

716
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:23,559
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

717
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,792
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

718
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:30,202
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

719
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,342
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

720
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:33,806
Here, sit down.

721
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:36,639
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

722
00:55:36,814 --> 00:55:38,441
Bourbon.

723
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:40,650
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

724
00:55:40,818 --> 00:55:44,015
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

725
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:47,219
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

726
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:49,416
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

727
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:50,890
Practically no one.

728
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:53,359
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

729
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:55,690
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

730
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,734
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I'll handle the entire transaction.

731
00:55:59,904 --> 00:56:02,771
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

732
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,463
And the carrying charges?

733
00:56:04,642 --> 00:56:07,406
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

734
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:10,512
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

735
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:12,239
I'll tell him when he comes in.

736
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,044
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

737
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,516
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

738
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:27,254
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

739
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:30,764
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

740
00:56:30,935 --> 00:56:32,869
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

741
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:40,204
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

742
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,510
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

743
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,015
Only 700 francs.

744
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:52,382
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

745
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:55,684
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

746
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:58,418
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

747
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:02,258
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

748
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:03,422
Doesn't matter.

749
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,536
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

750
00:57:07,705 --> 00:57:10,731
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

751
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,533
I have some tablecloths, napkins--

752
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,406
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

753
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:19,208
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

754
00:57:19,383 --> 00:57:20,407
Yes.

755
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:22,950
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

756
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:24,711
I don't think I will, Rick.

757
00:57:24,888 --> 00:57:29,188
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.

758
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,555
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

759
00:57:32,229 --> 00:57:35,460
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

760
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:38,192
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

761
00:57:39,737 --> 00:57:42,763
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

762
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:47,968
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

763
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:52,946
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

764
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,543
Not last night.

765
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:58,450
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

766
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:01,523
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

767
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:03,387
You can believe that if you want to.

768
00:58:03,594 --> 00:58:06,324
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

769
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,294
Above a saloon, it's true...

770
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:09,932
...but walk up a flight...

771
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,829
...I'll be expecting you.

772
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:16,702
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

773
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:18,603
You'll be there.

774
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:21,168
No, Rick.

775
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:24,843
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

776
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:29,444
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

777
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:38,586
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

778
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:40,662
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

779
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:45,426
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

780
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:49,038
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

781
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:51,037
You, however, are a different matter.

782
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:55,844
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

783
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,408
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

784
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:02,881
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

785
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:04,850
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

786
00:59:05,022 --> 00:59:08,480
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

787
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:11,086
We are only interested in two visas.

788
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:13,525
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

789
00:59:13,864 --> 00:59:15,957
You two will want to discuss this.

790
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:18,101
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

791
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:23,769
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

792
00:59:23,941 --> 00:59:27,308
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

793
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:29,341
But if the situation were different...

794
00:59:29,513 --> 00:59:32,073
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

795
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,546
...would you take it?

796
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,843
Yes, I would.

797
00:59:37,054 --> 00:59:38,248
Yes, I see.

798
00:59:39,423 --> 00:59:43,325
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

799
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:47,555
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

800
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:49,528
...why didn't you leave me then?

801
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:53,325
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

802
00:59:55,806 --> 00:59:57,273
I love you very much, Ilsa.

803
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:00,568
Your secret will be safe with me.

804
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:03,738
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

805
01:00:03,914 --> 01:00:06,246
Not more than 50 francs.

806
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,785
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

807
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:16,323
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

808
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,461
Well, good luck, but be careful.

809
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:21,462
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

810
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,824
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

811
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:27,731
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

812
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:29,805
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

813
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:33,170
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

814
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:34,332
Yes, something.

815
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:37,708
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

816
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:39,872
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

817
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:43,109
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

818
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:48,219
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

819
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:50,052
But it is worth a chance.

820
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:53,425
Thank you very much.
Good day.

821
01:00:53,664 --> 01:00:57,361
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

822
01:00:57,534 --> 01:01:00,401
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

823
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:03,005
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

824
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,043
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

825
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,382
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

826
01:01:16,587 --> 01:01:20,318
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

827
01:01:20,524 --> 01:01:23,357
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

828
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,154
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

829
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:26,990
I'm sorry.

830
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:46,543
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

831
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:50,951
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

832
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:53,021
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

833
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,555
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

834
01:01:55,726 --> 01:01:57,717
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

835
01:01:57,894 --> 01:02:00,158
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

836
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,457
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

837
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:04,567
You know how
that impresses Germans.

838
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,200
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

839
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:10,665
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

840
01:02:11,308 --> 01:02:15,768
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

841
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,544
It looks like you're a little late.

842
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:27,517
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

843
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:31,457
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

844
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:35,354
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

845
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:37,632
Sascha!

846
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:38,825
French 75s.

847
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:42,699
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

848
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:44,204
We will begin with two.

849
01:02:53,283 --> 01:02:55,478
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

850
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:59,053
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

851
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:08,891
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

852
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,828
You see, captain?

853
01:03:15,072 --> 01:03:17,472
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

854
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,539
We try to cooperate
with your government.

855
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:22,007
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

856
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:24,340
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

857
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:26,809
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

858
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:28,314
I blow with the wind...

859
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:30,885
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

860
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:32,783
And if it should change?

861
01:03:33,056 --> 01:03:35,217
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

862
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:37,485
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

863
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:41,095
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

864
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:44,294
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

865
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:46,026
A leader? Like Laszlo?

866
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,001
I have been thinking.

867
01:03:48,338 --> 01:03:51,637
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

868
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:52,797
I see what you mean.

869
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,580
Thank you, Carl.

870
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:03,014
Thank you, Carl.

871
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,154
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

872
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,923
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

873
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:09,183
Thank you very much.

874
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:12,123
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

875
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:14,160
...and a third glass.

876
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,322
At last the day's came!

877
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,333
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

878
01:04:19,503 --> 01:04:22,370
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

879
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:24,200
A very nice idea.

880
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,769
To America.

881
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:27,532
To America.

882
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:36,517
What watch?

883
01:04:37,387 --> 01:04:40,379
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

884
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:44,357
You will get along beautifully in America.

885
01:04:45,362 --> 01:04:47,125
How is lady luck treating you?

886
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,161
Oh, too bad.

887
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:51,364
You'll find him over there.

888
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:59,131
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

889
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:02,540
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

890
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:05,044
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

891
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:06,546
My husband is with me too.

892
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,480
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

893
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:10,642
Have a drink?

894
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:13,517
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

895
01:05:14,124 --> 01:05:15,182
Monsieur Rick...

896
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:19,487
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

897
01:05:19,663 --> 01:05:20,652
No, I mean...

898
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:22,658
...is he trustworthy?
Is his word--?

899
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:26,969
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

900
01:05:27,137 --> 01:05:29,196
I thought so. Where's your husband?

901
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:33,739
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

902
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:35,707
Oh, of course he's losing.

903
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:38,847
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

904
01:05:39,883 --> 01:05:41,510
We come from Bulgaria.

905
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:44,348
Things are very bad there.

906
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:46,716
The devil has the people
by the throat.

907
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:49,648
So Jan and I, we...

908
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:52,522
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

909
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:55,095
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

910
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:57,665
But we haven't much money...

911
01:05:57,834 --> 01:06:00,302
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

912
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:02,729
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

913
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:05,271
And then Captain Renault sees us...

914
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:08,444
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.

915
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:11,805
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

916
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:13,614
But we have no money.

917
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:15,509
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

918
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:18,017
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

919
01:06:18,188 --> 01:06:21,157
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

920
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:23,351
He always has.

921
01:06:28,532 --> 01:06:30,557
You are a man.

922
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:33,396
If someone loved you very much...

923
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:37,835
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

924
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:41,275
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

925
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:44,872
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

926
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:48,882
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

927
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:50,849
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

928
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,148
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

929
01:06:53,657 --> 01:06:54,749
Go back to Bulgaria.

930
01:06:54,991 --> 01:06:59,223
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

931
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:04,559
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

932
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:08,170
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

933
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:10,738
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

934
01:07:10,941 --> 01:07:14,069
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

935
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:24,083
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

936
01:07:24,254 --> 01:07:27,781
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

937
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:31,189
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

938
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,924
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

939
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:37,463
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

940
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:40,292
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

941
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,233
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:44,202
Right this way, if you please.

943
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:48,140
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

944
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,640
Thank you.

945
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:01,683
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

946
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:27,341
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

947
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:29,613
No. No, I guess not.

948
01:08:29,786 --> 01:08:31,651
Have you tried 22 tonight?

949
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:34,622
I said 22.

950
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:52,305
Leave it there.

951
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,155
Cash it in and don't come back.

952
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:13,919
Are you sure this place is honest?

953
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:18,331
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

954
01:09:21,271 --> 01:09:22,602
How are we doing tonight?

955
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:25,601
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

956
01:09:29,312 --> 01:09:31,280
Monsieur Rick...

957
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,946
He's just a lucky guy.

958
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:43,558
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

959
01:09:43,727 --> 01:09:45,786
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

960
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:50,789
Captain Renault, may I--?

961
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:54,926
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

962
01:09:55,105 --> 01:09:57,835
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

963
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:59,872
I'm very happy for both of you.

964
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:02,136
Still, it's very strange that you won.

965
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:04,576
Well, maybe not so strange.

966
01:10:04,748 --> 01:10:07,581
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

967
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:09,576
No!

968
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,192
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

969
01:10:18,962 --> 01:10:21,396
Go away, you crazy Russian.

970
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:35,107
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

971
01:10:35,278 --> 01:10:37,473
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

972
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,511
Put it down as a gesture to love.

973
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,206
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

974
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:44,250
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

975
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,615
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

976
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:53,821
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

977
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,622
Well, isn't there some other place?

978
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:58,323
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

979
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:02,533
- In my office.
- Right.

980
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,268
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

981
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:09,434
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

982
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:11,375
You know what I've been doing.

983
01:11:11,548 --> 01:11:15,484
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

984
01:11:15,652 --> 01:11:17,916
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

985
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:19,520
I'm not interested in politics.

986
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:22,180
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

987
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:23,550
I'm a saloonkeeper.

988
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:27,454
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

989
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,154
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

990
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:32,199
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

991
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:35,531
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

992
01:11:35,738 --> 01:11:37,672
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

993
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:40,104
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

994
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:43,643
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

995
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:46,680
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

996
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,575
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

997
01:11:49,786 --> 01:11:51,583
My answer would still be the same.

998
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,915
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

999
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:55,249
There is.

1000
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:57,852
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1001
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:00,789
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1002
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:03,564
- My wife?
- Yes.

1003
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:45,964
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1004
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:06,011
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1005
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:08,657
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1006
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:10,816
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1007
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:14,063
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1008
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,424
The place is to be closed.

1009
01:14:15,598 --> 01:14:18,658
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1010
01:14:23,573 --> 01:14:25,200
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1011
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:27,671
This café is closed until further notice.

1012
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,502
Clear the room at once.

1013
01:14:32,949 --> 01:14:34,314
How can you close me up?

1014
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:37,975
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1015
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,054
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1016
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:41,485
Everybody out at once.

1017
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:49,864
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1018
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:52,831
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1019
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:55,937
That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France.

1020
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:59,040
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1021
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:00,264
Of what value is that?

1022
01:15:00,443 --> 01:15:03,469
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1023
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:06,911
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1024
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:11,383
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1025
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:12,646
The other alternative?

1026
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:17,589
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1027
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,091
Good night, mademoiselle.

1028
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:33,298
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1029
01:15:56,232 --> 01:15:58,223
Our faithful friend is still there.

1030
01:15:58,768 --> 01:16:01,293
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1031
01:16:01,537 --> 01:16:02,629
I must.

1032
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:06,263
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1033
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:09,775
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1034
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,810
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1035
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:14,415
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1036
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,244
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1037
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:19,314
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1038
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:23,124
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1039
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,658
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1040
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,386
But no intention of selling them.

1041
01:16:27,563 --> 01:16:31,260
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1042
01:16:31,434 --> 01:16:32,992
Did he give any reason?

1043
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:36,467
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1044
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:38,833
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1045
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,572
I don't know why he said that.

1046
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:56,853
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1047
01:16:58,227 --> 01:17:00,058
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1048
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:04,622
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1049
01:17:05,902 --> 01:17:08,166
When I was in the concentration camp...

1050
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:11,263
...were you lonely in Paris?

1051
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:14,733
Yes, Victor, I was.

1052
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:18,680
I know how it is to be lonely.

1053
01:17:19,749 --> 01:17:22,081
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1054
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:26,077
No, Victor, there isn't.

1055
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:33,251
I love you very much, my dear.

1056
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:38,590
Yes, I know.

1057
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:41,869
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1058
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:44,734
You don't even have to say it.

1059
01:17:44,907 --> 01:17:46,670
I'll believe.

1060
01:17:48,778 --> 01:17:50,109
Good night, dear.

1061
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:53,445
Good night.

1062
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:03,151
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1063
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:09,829
Be careful.

1064
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:12,992
Of course I'll be careful.

1065
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:59,542
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1066
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:01,512
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1067
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:03,481
Two weeks, maybe three.

1068
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:05,916
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1069
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:08,352
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1070
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:09,889
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1071
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:13,426
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1072
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:16,829
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1073
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:20,127
- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1074
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:21,497
I won't.

1075
01:19:22,672 --> 01:19:23,730
Good night.

1076
01:19:24,874 --> 01:19:26,466
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1077
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:46,526
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1078
01:19:46,696 --> 01:19:50,029
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1079
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:51,427
Well, won't you sit down?

1080
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:55,536
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1081
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:59,004
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1082
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,904
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1083
01:20:02,078 --> 01:20:04,706
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1084
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,440
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1085
01:20:08,017 --> 01:20:09,746
I know how you feel about me...

1086
01:20:09,919 --> 01:20:12,683
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1087
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:15,323
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1088
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:17,482
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1089
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,991
It was your cause too.

1090
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:21,663
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1091
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:24,794
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1092
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:27,025
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1093
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:37,136
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--

1094
01:20:37,313 --> 01:20:40,248
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1095
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:43,874
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1096
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:46,112
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1097
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:49,314
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1098
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:56,292
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1099
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:59,229
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1100
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:03,965
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1101
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,665
You're a coward and a weakling.

1102
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:12,946
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1103
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:16,985
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1104
01:21:17,153 --> 01:21:19,849
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1105
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:21,078
What of it?

1106
01:21:21,257 --> 01:21:23,919
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1107
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,597
Now, if you'll--

1108
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,267
All right.

1109
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:38,464
I tried to reason with you.

1110
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,871
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1111
01:21:41,277 --> 01:21:44,405
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1112
01:21:45,981 --> 01:21:47,846
Put them on the table.

1113
01:21:49,752 --> 01:21:50,741
No.

1114
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:53,947
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1115
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:59,250
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1116
01:22:00,663 --> 01:22:02,654
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1117
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,797
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1118
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:15,609
Richard...

1119
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:18,144
...I tried to stay away.

1120
01:22:18,514 --> 01:22:21,176
I thought I would never see you again.

1121
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:24,786
That you were out of my life.

1122
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,065
The day you left Paris...

1123
01:22:48,644 --> 01:22:50,635
...if you knew what I went through.

1124
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:54,976
If you knew how much I loved you.

1125
01:22:55,985 --> 01:22:58,818
How much I still love you.

1126
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,725
And then?

1127
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:20,105
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1128
01:23:20,276 --> 01:23:23,803
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1129
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:25,708
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1130
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,509
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1131
01:23:29,685 --> 01:23:32,017
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1132
01:23:32,288 --> 01:23:33,516
Then it came.

1133
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,883
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1134
01:23:37,192 --> 01:23:39,683
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1135
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:42,529
Then I met you.

1136
01:23:42,865 --> 01:23:46,198
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1137
01:23:46,402 --> 01:23:49,462
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1138
01:23:49,672 --> 01:23:52,197
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1139
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:55,610
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1140
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:59,110
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1141
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:00,805
...and for those working with us.

1142
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,782
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1143
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,345
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1144
01:24:07,523 --> 01:24:09,957
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1145
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:13,253
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1146
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:15,587
He was sick. He needed me.

1147
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,794
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1148
01:24:19,969 --> 01:24:23,928
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1149
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:26,703
Well...

1150
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:28,703
...well, you know the rest.

1151
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,740
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1152
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,043
What about now?

1153
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:38,275
Now?

1154
01:24:39,088 --> 01:24:40,612
I don't know.

1155
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:44,316
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1156
01:24:45,527 --> 01:24:46,585
And Laszlo?

1157
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:50,193
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1158
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:53,699
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1159
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,359
All except one.

1160
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:58,272
He won't have you.

1161
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:02,172
I can't fight it anymore.

1162
01:25:03,946 --> 01:25:06,278
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1163
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:12,311
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1164
01:25:12,488 --> 01:25:14,547
You have to think for both of us.

1165
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:16,956
For all of us.

1166
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:23,224
All right. I will.

1167
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:29,064
Here's looking at you, kid.

1168
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:33,967
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1169
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,414
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1170
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:51,753
- I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1171
01:25:56,065 --> 01:26:00,934
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1172
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,933
Thank you.

1173
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:22,550
Carl, what happened?

1174
01:26:22,725 --> 01:26:26,354
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1175
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:28,860
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1176
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:32,330
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1177
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:35,230
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1178
01:26:35,938 --> 01:26:38,168
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1179
01:26:45,848 --> 01:26:49,340
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1180
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:03,457
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1181
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:05,395
This might come in handy.

1182
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:06,693
Thank you.

1183
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:09,529
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1184
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:14,303
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1185
01:27:14,476 --> 01:27:16,410
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1186
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:19,505
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1187
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:21,239
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1188
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,850
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1189
01:27:24,019 --> 01:27:26,283
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1190
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,616
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1191
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:32,955
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1192
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:36,723
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1193
01:27:37,266 --> 01:27:39,791
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1194
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:43,229
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1195
01:27:43,438 --> 01:27:44,996
...and that you'll never succeed.

1196
01:27:45,174 --> 01:27:47,404
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1197
01:27:49,211 --> 01:27:51,805
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1198
01:27:52,181 --> 01:27:54,376
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1199
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,346
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1200
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:59,419
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1201
01:27:59,588 --> 01:28:01,749
The first evening I came into this café...

1202
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:04,290
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1203
01:28:05,093 --> 01:28:06,754
Since no one is to blame...

1204
01:28:07,196 --> 01:28:09,187
...I demand no explanation.

1205
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:12,663
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1206
01:28:12,835 --> 01:28:14,393
All right.

1207
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,504
But I want my wife to be safe.

1208
01:28:16,772 --> 01:28:18,205
I ask you as a favor...

1209
01:28:18,373 --> 01:28:21,308
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1210
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:22,568
You love her that much?

1211
01:28:22,778 --> 01:28:25,542
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1212
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,706
Well, I am also a human being.

1213
01:28:29,551 --> 01:28:31,041
Yes, I love her that much.

1214
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:40,158
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1215
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:42,854
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1216
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:44,020
On what charge?

1217
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:46,394
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1218
01:28:46,568 --> 01:28:49,298
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1219
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:05,247
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1220
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,481
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1221
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:12,684
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1222
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,328
If you were to help him escape--

1223
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,930
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1224
01:29:17,099 --> 01:29:19,567
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1225
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:22,829
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1226
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:26,098
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1227
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:28,140
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1228
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:29,709
They're all excellent reasons.

1229
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:31,812
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1230
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:35,438
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1231
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:40,346
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1232
01:29:40,522 --> 01:29:42,012
Yes, I have the letters.

1233
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:44,021
But I intend using them myself.

1234
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:47,953
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1235
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:51,190
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1236
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,334
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1237
01:29:53,502 --> 01:29:57,097
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1238
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:59,297
The last man I want to see in America.

1239
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:02,738
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1240
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:06,074
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1241
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:08,876
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1242
01:30:09,084 --> 01:30:13,282
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1243
01:30:13,522 --> 01:30:15,490
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1244
01:30:15,657 --> 01:30:19,184
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1245
01:30:19,361 --> 01:30:22,728
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1246
01:30:22,898 --> 01:30:25,594
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1247
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:27,291
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1248
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:30,996
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1249
01:30:31,173 --> 01:30:34,438
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1250
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:37,203
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1251
01:30:37,379 --> 01:30:39,540
Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.

1252
01:30:39,748 --> 01:30:40,772
Then release him.

1253
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:43,577
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1254
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:46,277
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1255
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:49,082
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1256
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:51,656
You get him, and we get away.

1257
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:54,728
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1258
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:57,728
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1259
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,629
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1260
01:31:00,802 --> 01:31:03,134
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1261
01:31:03,305 --> 01:31:05,933
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1262
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,941
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1263
01:31:09,111 --> 01:31:11,978
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1264
01:31:12,147 --> 01:31:16,607
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1265
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:18,147
Oh, thanks.

1266
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:19,879
Go ahead, Ricky.

1267
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:24,457
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1268
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:26,958
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1269
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:37,129
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1270
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:40,570
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1271
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:44,209
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1272
01:31:44,413 --> 01:31:49,817
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1273
01:31:49,985 --> 01:31:52,783
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1274
01:31:52,954 --> 01:31:55,923
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1275
01:31:56,124 --> 01:31:58,558
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1276
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:00,058
Well, so long.

1277
01:32:00,228 --> 01:32:03,254
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1278
01:32:03,432 --> 01:32:05,923
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1279
01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:43,632
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1280
01:32:43,805 --> 01:32:45,102
...so I knew I'd be on time.

1281
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:48,299
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1282
01:32:48,477 --> 01:32:50,570
This place will never be
the same without you.

1283
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:54,306
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1284
01:32:54,483 --> 01:32:57,213
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1285
01:32:57,385 --> 01:32:59,580
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1286
01:32:59,754 --> 01:33:00,914
Sam's piano.

1287
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:03,590
Serves me right for not being musical.

1288
01:33:03,859 --> 01:33:04,883
Here they are.

1289
01:33:05,393 --> 01:33:07,122
You better wait in my office.

1290
01:33:16,838 --> 01:33:19,432
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1291
01:33:19,608 --> 01:33:22,042
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1292
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:23,575
Everything is quite all right.

1293
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:26,771
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1294
01:33:26,948 --> 01:33:28,779
Please trust me.

1295
01:33:30,819 --> 01:33:32,047
Yes, I will.

1296
01:33:37,259 --> 01:33:41,355
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1297
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:46,259
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1298
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:48,568
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1299
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:52,036
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1300
01:33:52,207 --> 01:33:54,539
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1301
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:57,143
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1302
01:33:57,312 --> 01:33:58,711
Victor Laszlo.

1303
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:01,977
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1304
01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:08,579
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1305
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:12,422
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1306
01:34:12,627 --> 01:34:15,596
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--

1307
01:34:16,398 --> 01:34:20,835
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1308
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:22,993
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1309
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:25,298
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1310
01:34:25,473 --> 01:34:27,338
...but I will if you take one more step.

1311
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,273
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1312
01:34:33,515 --> 01:34:37,007
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1313
01:34:37,185 --> 01:34:39,312
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1314
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,079
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1315
01:34:41,256 --> 01:34:43,884
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1316
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:46,459
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1317
01:34:46,628 --> 01:34:48,721
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1318
01:34:56,271 --> 01:34:58,330
Hello? Is that the airport?

1319
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:01,302
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1320
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:04,069
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1321
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:06,043
There's to be no trouble about them.

1322
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:07,470
Good.

1323
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:09,076
Hello?

1324
01:35:14,189 --> 01:35:15,588
My car, quickly!

1325
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:18,351
This is Major Strasser.

1326
01:35:18,526 --> 01:35:20,994
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1327
01:35:21,162 --> 01:35:22,459
At once, do you hear?

1328
01:35:29,604 --> 01:35:31,629
Hello, radio tower?

1329
01:35:31,806 --> 01:35:34,900
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1330
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:37,644
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1331
01:35:37,812 --> 01:35:41,748
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1332
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:44,646
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1333
01:35:57,165 --> 01:35:59,895
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1334
01:36:00,068 --> 01:36:01,831
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1335
01:36:02,037 --> 01:36:05,438
- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:36:05,607 --> 01:36:06,596
This way, please.

1337
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:11,604
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1338
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,805
You think of everything, don't you?

1339
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:16,416
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1340
01:36:16,618 --> 01:36:20,179
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1341
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:21,947
I don't understand.
What about you?

1342
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:24,216
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1343
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:26,383
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

1344
01:36:26,561 --> 01:36:28,358
Last night we said a great many things.

1345
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,430
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1346
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:33,260
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1347
01:36:33,435 --> 01:36:36,097
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1348
01:36:36,271 --> 01:36:38,102
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1349
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:41,174
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1350
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:44,642
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1351
01:36:44,813 --> 01:36:47,077
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1352
01:36:47,248 --> 01:36:50,684
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1353
01:36:50,885 --> 01:36:53,115
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1354
01:36:53,288 --> 01:36:55,654
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1355
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:58,691
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1356
01:36:58,893 --> 01:37:02,385
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1357
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:05,357
But what about us?

1358
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:06,932
We'll always have Paris.

1359
01:37:07,102 --> 01:37:10,094
We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1360
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:12,166
We got it back last night.

1361
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:16,840
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1362
01:37:17,345 --> 01:37:18,835
But I've got a job to do too.

1363
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:22,778
Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1364
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:24,909
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1365
01:37:25,086 --> 01:37:28,544
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1366
01:37:28,723 --> 01:37:31,419
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1367
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:34,118
Someday you'll understand that.

1368
01:37:35,296 --> 01:37:37,059
Now, now.

1369
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,998
Here's looking at you, kid.

1370
01:37:56,151 --> 01:37:58,642
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1371
01:37:58,887 --> 01:38:01,014
There's something you should know.

1372
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:03,053
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1373
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:06,318
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1374
01:38:06,494 --> 01:38:08,359
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1375
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:11,397
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1376
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:15,002
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1377
01:38:15,437 --> 01:38:16,665
Yes.

1378
01:38:16,838 --> 01:38:18,863
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1379
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:22,567
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1380
01:38:22,744 --> 01:38:25,269
But that was all over long ago.

1381
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:28,712
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1382
01:38:29,217 --> 01:38:30,844
I understand.

1383
01:38:31,019 --> 01:38:33,214
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1384
01:38:33,922 --> 01:38:35,719
I appreciate it.

1385
01:38:36,591 --> 01:38:38,354
Welcome back to the fight.

1386
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,085
This time I know our side will win.

1387
01:38:54,809 --> 01:38:56,970
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1388
01:38:58,847 --> 01:39:00,212
Yes, I'm ready.

1389
01:39:03,351 --> 01:39:04,716
Goodbye, Rick.

1390
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:07,487
God bless you.

1391
01:39:08,823 --> 01:39:11,519
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1392
01:39:29,577 --> 01:39:31,511
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1393
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,512
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:39:34,682 --> 01:39:36,013
What you just did for Laszlo.

1395
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:38,584
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1396
01:39:38,753 --> 01:39:41,085
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1397
01:39:41,289 --> 01:39:43,314
But she knew you were lying.

1398
01:39:43,491 --> 01:39:45,425
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1399
01:39:45,593 --> 01:39:49,893
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1400
01:39:50,064 --> 01:39:53,556
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1401
01:40:00,608 --> 01:40:04,942
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1402
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:09,608
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1403
01:40:09,784 --> 01:40:11,809
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1404
01:40:14,122 --> 01:40:16,955
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1405
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:20,423
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1406
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:23,955
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1407
01:40:24,132 --> 01:40:25,997
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1408
01:40:41,049 --> 01:40:42,607
Major Strasser has been shot.

1409
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:50,016
Round up the usual suspects.

1410
01:41:13,748 --> 01:41:17,411
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1411
01:41:17,585 --> 01:41:19,746
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1412
01:41:19,921 --> 01:41:22,151
I think perhaps you're right.

1413
01:41:46,948 --> 01:41:50,645
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1414
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:53,252
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1415
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:57,221
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1416
01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:58,686
I could use a trip.

1417
01:41:58,893 --> 01:42:02,158
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1418
01:42:02,397 --> 01:42:05,298
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1419
01:42:05,466 --> 01:42:06,694
"Our" expenses?

1420
01:42:07,535 --> 01:42:11,733
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
