00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,188
[upbeat rock music playing]

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,130
[PJ] <i>Tonight is</i>
<i>the fucking night, okay?</i>

3
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,467
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

4
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,435
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

5
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,806
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

6
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,173
We're getting out there.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,809
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

8
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,579
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

9
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,113
Man, speak for yourself.

10
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,148
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

11
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,585
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

12
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,153
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,221
I think that it's time.

14
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,623
Oh, really? It's time?

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,592
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

16
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,226
we've all been going
to school together?

17
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,628
I've been building tension.

18
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:01,963
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,096
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,766
And just what would I say?

21
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,036
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,070
How's his penis?

23
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,707
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

24
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,474
They could have broken up,
you never know.

25
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,511
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

26
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,846
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

27
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,249
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

28
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,284
-Mmm.
-Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,486
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

30
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,657
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

31
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,425
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

32
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,293
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,662
It's probably white, okay?

34
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,065
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,132
What the fuck happened to her?

36
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,569
She's washed up.

37
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,538
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

38
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,641
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

39
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,310
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

40
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,046
Josie, tick-tock.

41
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,781
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

42
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,750
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

43
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,151
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

44
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,419
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

45
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,388
I might have a good shot
that way.

46
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,424
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,227
What the fuck are you wearing?

48
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,264
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

49
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,101
I think you wanna be here.

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,736
Who said that?

51
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,671
-Where'd you get that idea?
-I'm just feeling...

52
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,172
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,576
-No. No, no.
-Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,477
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

55
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,713
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

56
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,147
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

57
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,816
You have Munchausen's.

58
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,384
Look, just follow my lead.

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,853
-Hello, ladies.
-[girl 1] Oh.

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,521
[girl 2 chuckles] Oh.
You know what?

61
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,155
-Just keep going.
-[PJ] How was your summer?

62
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,524
-Good to see you.
-Okay, you know what?

63
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,126
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

64
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,560
This school has such
a gay problem.

65
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,030
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

66
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:45,900
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

67
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,835
Like, look at Matthieu.

68
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,469
[boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.

69
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,706
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

70
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,741
-Thanks, bitch.
-[Matthieu and boy chuckle]

71
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,711
-Fuck!
-Yeah.

72
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,311
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

73
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,280
-Every show.
-Yeah.

74
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,750
-[Isabel giggles]
-[PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.

75
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:03,885
Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,255
-[gentle music playing]
-[laughing]

77
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,598
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Hazel.

78
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,867
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

79
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,036
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

80
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,739
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

81
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,108
yeah, it was good.

82
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,475
What are you guys doing here?

83
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,610
You guys never come
to the fair.

84
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,344
What happened to your arm?

85
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,246
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

86
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,682
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

87
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,751
-Mmm.
-Or did you get beat up again?

88
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,519
[Josie] No, I just tripped
and I--

89
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,521
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

90
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,456
Did you go to juvie?

91
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,257
-Yeah, we went to juvie.
-[man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

92
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,194
-Oh, my God, it was juvie?
-... <i>it's time to get ready,</i>

93
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,030
<i>get wild, and get horny</i>
<i>for our very own Vikings!</i>

94
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,099
Oh, my God, what did you do?

95
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,366
-[Josie yelping]
-[man] <i>And the man</i>
<i>who will lead us to victory</i>

96
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,435
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

97
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,939
<i>shit-eating</i>
<i>Huntington Ferrets,</i>

98
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,273
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

99
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,809
[girl 3] Jeff! Have my babies!

100
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,578
[girl 4] Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

101
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,479
-[crowd cheers]
-[PJ groans]

102
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,148
[PJ] I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

103
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,416
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

104
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,018
What's the grossest animal?

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,855
[girl 5] Jeff,
come sign my tits!

106
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
-[whistle blows]
-[girl 6] Eat my pussy!

107
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,026
That's right.

108
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,997
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

109
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,365
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

110
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,768
-Take this.
-[Josie] No.

111
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,368
Really quick.
This is the moment.

112
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,270
Stop yelling at me!

113
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,739
Could you give that back
really quickly?

114
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,674
-Hey, Brittany.
-PJ.

115
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,376
[PJ] I am loving all the...

116
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,179
holes in your pants.

117
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,580
Thanks.

118
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,281
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

119
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,683
[PJ] Thank you.

120
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,685
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

121
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,687
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

122
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,289
-Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
-[Brittany] No, not that.

123
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,159
[PJ] Brittany.

124
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,894
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,996
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

126
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,296
I need to pull trig.

127
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,497
-No, you don't.
-Yeah, I do.

128
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,666
I'm gonna say something crazy.

129
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,335
I think you could eat food,

130
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,006
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

131
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,373
Mmm, gross.

132
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,242
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

133
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,044
-[Brittany] Oh, no.
-Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

134
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,146
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

135
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,614
Oh, I don't know.

136
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,249
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

137
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,984
-No bun. No.
-You gotta get the bun.

138
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,653
-Yes, you could.
-No.

139
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,888
No bun. [clears throat] Okay.

140
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,924
Um, Isabel.

141
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,358
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

142
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,727
I don't think so.

143
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,229
[PJ] I think so.
It was really good.

144
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,831
It was super funny.

145
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,034
[PJ clears throat]

146
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,437
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

147
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,608
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

148
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,409
Yeah, you're skinny--

149
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,978
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

150
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,913
You probably should eat.

151
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,115
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

152
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,952
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

153
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,522
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

154
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,890
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

155
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:00,460
[groans] Fuck! Fuck!

156
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,462
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

157
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,898
You know what? I'm good.

158
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,100
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

159
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,735
If it's not happening here,

160
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,071
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

161
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,439
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

162
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,508
-No.
-I'm packing up my vagina

163
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,177
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

164
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,545
That's the only hope for me.

165
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:18,980
-No.
-It's me and Matthieu, man.

166
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,815
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

167
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,350
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

168
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,751
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

169
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:24,986
We're going to have
to join a church.

170
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,087
He'll be the gay pastor.

171
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,555
My whole life's fucked!

172
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,357
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

173
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,958
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

174
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,493
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

175
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,063
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

176
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,165
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

177
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,134
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

178
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,636
And yeah, guess what?

179
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,338
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

180
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,641
He's fucking the evangelist!

181
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,577
[crying] I don't wanna
live like that.

182
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:52,445
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

183
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,150
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

184
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:59,120
-[Jeff] Isabel.
-[Isabel] Leave me alone!

185
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,588
-Stop following me.
-Wait, shut up.

186
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,023
-What?
-Look.

187
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,691
-[Isabel] Don't touch me.
-Isabel, baby.

188
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,326
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

189
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,161
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

190
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,563
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

191
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,065
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

192
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,034
-Josie, offer her a ride.
-I don't think so.

193
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,101
Yes, come on.

194
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,836
...Irish Catholic.

195
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,672
-And I'm regular Christian!
-[groaning in frustration]

196
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,140
-[PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.
-[Josie] PJ, stop.

197
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,008
[Jeff grunts]
You're hurting my head.

198
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,144
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

199
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,679
And it's giving me PTSD

200
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,780
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

201
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,015
-Just do it now.
-No.

202
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,216
-Just go fucking ask her.
-No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

203
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,185
Isabel.

204
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,988
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my God.

205
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,389
-[Jeff] Isabel...
-[Isabel breathes heavily]

206
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,791
Get out of the car.

207
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,392
You can't tell me what to do.

208
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,961
-Yeah, no, he can't.
-[Jeff] Okay,

209
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,997
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

210
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,299
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

211
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,501
-Move, you prick!
-[groans]

212
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,537
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

213
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,938
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

214
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,274
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

215
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,676
-Hey.
-Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

216
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,279
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

217
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,947
Get out! Come on.

218
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,382
-I feel like
we should just drive.
-Drive.

219
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,917
-Drive.
-Let's just go.

220
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,385
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

221
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,453
-He'll move.
-He's not moving.

222
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,821
[Isabel] He's gonna move.

223
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,656
-[PJ] We're about to drive.
-Isabel.

224
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,257
-Drive. He'll move.
-[PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.

225
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,326
-Three, two one...
-Pedal to the metal. Drive!

-Oh, my God!

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,605
Jeff?

230
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,274
Jeff!

231
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,976
-[Jeff groaning]
-[Josie] Are you...
Are you okay?

232
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,544
When people move cars,
don't people move?

233
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,846
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

234
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,814
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

235
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,483
-Back up! Back up! [screams]
-We didn't even do anything.

236

-No, come here. [grunting]
-[groaning]

237

-Man down! Man down!
-[Jeff] You!

238
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,622
[PJ] Oh, my God.

239
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,957
-I'm... I'm blacking out.
-No, stay with me.

240
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,392
[PJ] We should go. Let's go.

241
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,760
-Let's go.
-Yeah. Okay.

242
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,428
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

243
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,829
-[Josie] Fine.
-What did you do to him?

244
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,765
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

245
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,234
-[Jeff wailing]
-You fucking cowards!

246
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,602
You better fucking run!

247
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,470
[Jeff] I don't understand.

248
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,105
What the fuck? [sobs]

249
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,475
[yelling] They're not gonna
get away with this!

250

[Principal Meyers, over PA]
<i>Attention.</i>

252
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,182
<i>The library</i>
<i>is out of use again.</i>

253
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,284
<i>Huntington shot up</i>
<i>our remaining books,</i>

254
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,854
<i>so there will be no reading</i>
<i>again this year. Thank you.</i>

255
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,791
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

256
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,928
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

257
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,798
I know I won't even digest it.

258
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,132
I have to throw up."

259
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,967
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

260
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,270
She's like, "No, not, just...

261
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,938
Maybe, but not the bun."

262
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,941
Oh, it was just really sweet.

263
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:35,643
You had to be there.

264
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,944
I was there.

265
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,146
Are you serious?

266
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,681
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

267
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,416
You're the sidekick, not me.

'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,654
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

270
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,356
Thanks.

271
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,560
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

272
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,294
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,696
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

274
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,232
Hi.

What? Yeah.

-Why wouldn't we be okay?
-[Mr. G] All right, kiddos.

279
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,941
Welcome back to class.

280
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,843
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

281
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,144
That belongs to the school.

282
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,179
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

283
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,681
[scoffs] Nice try, PJ,

284
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,316
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

285
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,485
All right, check it out.

286
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,019
-Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
-Josie, so, how'd you do it?

287
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,122
Do what?

00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,257
[grunts, pants]

289
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,793

290
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,294
[Mr. G] Hey, you good, man?

-[Jeff groans]
-What the fuck?

292
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,800
-[Mr. G] Yeah, okay, so...
-What the fuck?

293
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:33,968
[Mr. G] Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

294
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,803
Okay, so, did he fight back?

295
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,404
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

296
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,973
-I hope you broke a bone.
-If you need a shoulder

297
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,041
or anything,
just let me know...

298
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,743
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

299
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,245
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

300
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,913
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

301
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,847
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

302
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:47,982
That's how, okay?

303

-God damn it, Jeff.

307
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,924
What the fuck?

00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,253
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

339
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,722
-and killed girls in juvie.
-[PJ] Really?

340
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,091
Um, what did you think
about that?

341
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,726
-[PA chimes]
-[Principal Meyers] <i>Excuse me.</i>

342
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,295
<i>Could the ugly,</i>
<i>untalented gays</i>

343
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,464
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office?</i>

344
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,433
Guess that's you guys.

345
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,969
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

346
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,003
Shut up.
You know why you're here.

347
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,672
I don't, actually...

348
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,240
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

349
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,610
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

350
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,679
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

351
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,746
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

352
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,716
-Shush.
-Okay.

353
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,620
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

354
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,120
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

355
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,955
-Yes.
-Yes. It's everywhere.

356
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,156
-[Josie] Twenty years.
-[PJ] Couldn't be clearer.

357
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,424
[Josie] I think I can explain.

358
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,993
I can explain.

359
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,729
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

360
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,396
[Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.

361
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,699
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

362
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,966
Yeah, actually.

363
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,035
How come you can't buck up

364
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,605
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

365
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:53,941
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

366
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,745
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

367
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,546
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

368
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,515
-Can we just explain ourselves?
-Maybe I should buy a gun.

369
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:02,617
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

370
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,818
-Can we just
calm down, everybody.
-Zip it.

371
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,420
-You know what?
-What?

372
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,023
-I'm gonna expel you both.
-No!

373
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,791
-No! No!
-[Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!

374
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,094
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

375
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,498
-Really?
-We were just practicing...

376
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,801
for...

377
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,508
for our self-defense club.

378
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,444
Self-defense-- What is that?

379
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,013
-[Josie] Uh...
-Is it like a fight club?

380
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,049
-Well, here's the thing--
-Yes! Yes!

381
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,017
-Uh...
-Yes! Yes!

382
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,620
A fight club.

383
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,888
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

384
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:41,955
-No, we don't.
-Yes.

385
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,490
No, we don't. Shut up.

386
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,125
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

387
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,860
-I don't care.
-You're over it, okay.

388
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,362
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

389
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,565
while you perform
<i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

390
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,767
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

391
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,803
Yes, sir.

392
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,904
[Hazel] I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

393
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,206
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

394
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,809
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

395
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:01,975
We're doing it.

396
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,044
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

397
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,281
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

398
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,117
-[Josie groans]
-Also, you heard
the announcements.

399
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,318
Girls are terrified.

400
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,053
It's perfect. They need this.

401
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,557
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

402
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,926
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

403
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,127
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

404
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,495
That's the point of feminism.

405
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,130
That's not the point
of feminism.

406
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,532
You also don't care
about feminism.

407
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,899
Your favorite show
is <i>Entourage.</i>

408
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,635
You're missing the point!

409
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,336
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

410
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,038
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

411
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,807
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

412
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,375
-[grunts frustratedly]
-About juvie?

413
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,076
-[PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?
-Why would you lie to me?

414
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,612
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

415
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,246
I just didn't correct you.

416
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,315
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

417
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,417
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

418
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,754
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

419
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,955
Look, this is how we do this.

420
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,490
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

421
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,058
Which I've got covered.

422
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,893
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

423
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,261
[PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.

424
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,630
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

425
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,030
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

426
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,533
[Josie and PJ]
You know Stella-Rebecca?

427
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,502
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

428
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,169
-in Chicago on the weekends?
-Yeah, we're family friends.

429
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,506
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

430
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,573
[Josie sighs]

431
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,174
-Josie.
-What?

432
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,777
-We're doing this.
-No.

433
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,344
Yeah. Listen to me.

434
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,146
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

435
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,149
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

436
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,885
They are grateful to us.

437
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,521
We build a community, we bond,

438
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,523
we share, we connect.

439
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,726
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

440
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,393
Next thing you know,

441
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,995
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

442
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,463
-[player 1] Jeffrey!
-[PJ] Josie...

443
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,366
Isabel knew your name.

444
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,636
-[player 2] Back from the dead.
-If we do this...

445
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,805
-Mmm-hmm.
-Very big "if,"

446
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,439
we just run the risk
of becoming

447
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,441
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

448
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,544
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

449
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,012
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

450
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,749
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

451
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,183
We're the lowest of the low.

452
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,718
-Okay.
-We have nowhere to go but up.

453
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,420
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

454
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,156
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

455
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,325
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

456
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,728
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

457
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,665
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

458
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,569
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

459
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,572
What's your plan here?

460
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,206
I don't need a plan.

461
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,475
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

462
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,044
[upbeat electronic
music playing]

463
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,279
[PJ sighs]

464
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,716
Okay.

465
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,116
What's up, lads?

466
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,385
What the fuck?

467
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,154
-These girls are ugly.
-[Josie] Okay.

468
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,590
Where is Stella?

469
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,257
She was booked
for a car convention.

470
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,960
What? It's a Monday.

471
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,528
[Josie] Um, maybe we should go

472
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:34,863
-before someone cool shows up?
-[door opens]

473
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,396
Before I die? Pick one.

474
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,999
[Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

475
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,969
I love David Fincher.

476
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,403
-[sighs] Oh, my God. Well...
-See?

477
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,406
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

478
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,075
and stopped huffing paint.

479
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,944
[Josie] She'll never stop
huffing paint.

480
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,078
[Hazel] So, I thought
we'd start...

481
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,346
Um...

482
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,348
-Okay.
-Sorry.

483
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,684
[PJ] All right.

484
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,554
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

485
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,321
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

486
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,190
Um, it's a self-defense club.

487
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,759
It's not really, "Fight."

488
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:08,128
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

489
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,898
and they're picking
on the weak

490
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:12,432
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

491
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,202
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

492
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,337
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

493
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,774
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

494
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,308
Then, punch-bucket,

495
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,310
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

496
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,279
and we punch you
until you bleed.

497
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:29,483
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

498
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,852
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

499
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,954
-Mmm. No. No.
-No.

500
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,822
Juvie was way crazier.

501
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,090
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

502
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,192
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

503
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,863
I get up. I'm blind.

504
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,599
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

505
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:46,500
Broke her fuckin' nose.

506
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,235
Josie?

507
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,604
Care to share?

508
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,307
Yeah, all right.

509
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,143
Juvie was insane.

510
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,013
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

511
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,382
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

512
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,687
So, you killed a girl?

513
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,387
Uh, no.

514
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,525
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

515
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,994
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

516
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:14,762
when she came back
to life, so...

517
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,832
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

518
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,867
She came back to life.

519
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,202
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

520
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,204
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

521
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,340
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

522
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,875
Josie, if you'll step forward.

523
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,444
No, I don't wanna do that.

524
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,145
-What's the problem?
-There's no problem. I just...

525
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,615
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

526
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,516
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

527
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,417
-They don't wanna see it.
-They wanna see. Look at them.

528
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,886
They wanna see the punch.

529
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,954
Who am I gonna punch?

530
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,254
Punch me. Just punch me.

531
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,991
-Punch you?
-Yeah, come on.

532
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,224
I can punch you.

533
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,492
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

534
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,995
Something people
would always say,

535
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,295
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

536
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,329
-Come on up.
-[Josie grunts]

537
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,699
Oh! [groans, thuds]

538
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,500
Oh, fuck!

539
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,804
-[Josie sighs]
-[PJ breathing heavily]

540
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,275
Will there an advisor
for this club?

541
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,811
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

542
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,713
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

543
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,148
where we punch each other
in the face?

544
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,919
The Holocaust. It happened.

545
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,822
Yes, it did.

546
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,357
But how? The seeds were sown
in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>

547
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,494
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

548
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,664
[PJ] I mean, he's perfect.

549
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,699
[Josie] No.

550
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,933
-What?
-No.

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,802
Please.

552
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,904
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

553
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,271
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

554
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,339
Fuck! When did you show up?

555
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,075
Hey, guys. [chuckles]

556
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,376
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

557
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,413
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

558
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,348
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

559
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,351
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

560
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,386
and, like, guns and stuff,

561
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,356
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

562
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,959
-That's so great, Sylvie.
-Okay.

563
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,493
But, unfortunately,

564
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,929
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

565
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,764
What? Why?

566
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,032
I don't know.

567
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,466
Why? It was just
so empowering.

568
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,002
What was empowering?

569
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,671
-Oh, my God, hi. Um...
-[players groaning]

570
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,873
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

571
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,177
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

572
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,813
-[bell rings]
-Isabel, let's go.

573
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,653
[Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.

574
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
-I'm so strong.
-[Isabel giggles]

575
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,489
[whimsical music playing]

576
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:24,892
I mean...

577
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,427
[chuckling mischievously]

578
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,299
-[PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
-[Josie sighs]

579
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,901
Great class today.

580
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,903
Hey, uh, girl.

581
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,304
Thanks for coming in today.

582
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,540
We have to come in.
It's class.

583
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,743
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

584
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,179
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

585
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,647
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

586
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,448
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

587
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,852
[chuckles] Sure, he did.

588
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:55,189
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

589
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,558
-What kind of club is that?
-[PJ] It's a women's club.

590
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,694
We talk about women's issues.

591
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,629
For example,

592
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:02,830
periods,

593
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,899
declining egg count,

594
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,033
skirts...

595
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,400
Skirts?

596
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,937
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

597
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:13,174
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

598
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,442
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

599
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,111
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

600
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,146
-Makes sense.
-[PJ] Yeah.

601
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,714
Listen. I'm kind of,

602
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,916
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

603
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,652
-[PJ] Mmm-hmm.
-Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

604
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,855
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

605
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,791
Back to the club,

606
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,358
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

607
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,960
[Josie] Can I be honest?
You're a man

608
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,662
who's not coping
with what's going on.

609
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,396
-Yeah.
-You know what?

610
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,933
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

611
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
And here's one thing

612
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,769
-my mom's always said to me.
-[PJ] Mmm.

613
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,471
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

614
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,040
-don't show up.
-Yeah.

615
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,242
[Josie] It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

616
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,377
-but you don't even
come to the dang club.
-No.

617
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,479
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

618
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:53,881
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

619
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,817
You just say
you're doing something

620
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,985
and then you don't do
any of those things.

621
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,954
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

622
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,589
Don't come. Yeah.

623
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,526
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

624
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,327
-Amazing.
-What?

625
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,529
-Yeah.
-Really?

626
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,997
-Okay.
-[PJ] So cool.

627
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:11,799
[grunts]

628
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,672
How many girls go
to this school, again?

629
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,474
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

630
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,910
Hey, guys.

631
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,514
[PJ] Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

632
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:29,617
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

633
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,652
[Mr. G] Hey, ladies.

634
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,955
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

635
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,123
All right. Um...

636
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:38,559
Hello, everybody.

637
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,393
Okay, excuse me.

638
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,963
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

639
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,197
Um...

640
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:44,899
[loud thumping]

641
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,569
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

642
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:59,080
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

643
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:03,251
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

644
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:08,022
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

645
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,925
First...

646
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,094
listen.

647
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,795
Second,

648
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,599
be on time.

649
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,902
Yeah.

650
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:22,904
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

651
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,806
What time is it?

652
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,642
-[Annie] 3:30.
-3:30!

653
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,578
Club starts at 3:15.

654
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,047
Not 3:16.

655
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:36,550
[scoffs] Not 3:17,

656
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:41,188
but the doors close at 3:15.

657
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,024
No exceptions.

658
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,927
I don't care if you're like...

659
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:48,428
-[door opens]
-"Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

660
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:52,066
because I... I need
to get a full ride

661
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,801
because my mom
lives in a trailer

662
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,903
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

663
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,239
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

664
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,807
Shut up, okay?

665
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,644
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

666
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,386
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

667
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,955
Nice.

668
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,790
[PJ] Uh, we're just getting
started here.

669
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,525
So, um...

670
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,095
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

671
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,697
We're gonna do wrestling.

672
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:24,932
I think I need a volunteer.

673
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,801
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

674
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,836
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

675
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:31,138
-That's not true. It's about...
-Oh, that's about next week.

676
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,606
-Yeah, next week.
-So, the rules for next week.

677
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,208
Don't be late.

678
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,776
-But this week is good...
-[PJ] Yeah. No worries.

679
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,378
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

680
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:38,813
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

681
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,480
This is a self-defense
class, right?

682
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:41,782
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

683
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,651
against, like,
football players.

684
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,686
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

685
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,022
[chuckles nervously, sighs]
They're gonna pork us.

686
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,291
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

687
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,926
There's a cash prize, right?

688
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,594
[Isabel] I thought this was
to be part of, like,

689
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,097
a local underprivileged
female community.

690
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,767
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

691
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,470
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

692
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:03,604
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

693
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,339
So, uh, you know, like...

694
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:08,709
-Why are we nitpicking reasons?
-Yeah. How about this?

695
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,711
-Let's jump in. Right?
-Yeah. For sure.

696
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,246
-Love that.
-[PJ] Yeah.

697
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:14,515
-I'll go.
-Great. Yeah.

698
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,955
-[Annie grunts]
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

699
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,523
I don't know about this shit.

700
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,725
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

701
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,794
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

702
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,229
-Look.
-[Josie] We can take it slower.

703
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,697
-[PJ] Okay.
-Maybe, yeah, try that.

704
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:31,565
Take that route.
Little slower.

705
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,801
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

706
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,202
Whatever you want, 'kay?

707
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,471
-[PJ grunts]
-Oh, fuck.

708
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,939
-[girls gasp]
-[PJ] Okay.

709
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,108
That's great.
I say that we go again.

710
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,843
-Oh!
-[Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.

711
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,912
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

712
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,714
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

713
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,249
-Are you fine? Are you okay?
-Yeah, she's okay.

714
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:50,017
-She's totally fine.
-Shut this shit down.

715
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:52,019
-[Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.
-Shut this shit down.

716
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,587
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

717
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,489
I know that,

718
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,392
you know, this is
a little messy right now

719
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,428
but, like, the only way

720
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:03,964
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

721
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,034
Huntington is coming.

722
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,003
[inspirational music playing]

723
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,171
We need this.

724
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,575
I know that things
might seem scary,

725
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,944
but that's okay, because...

726
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,047
because...

727
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,850
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

728
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,585
-Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
-Yeah.

729
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:25,920
-Right?
-[Josie] Yes.

-Lucky number seven, okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

733
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,531
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

734
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,199
Yeah, absolutely.

735
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,568

736
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,235

to kill my stepdad.

-Awesome.
-Okay.

738
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,673
[PJ] And if you believe
in yourselves

739
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,074
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

815
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,918
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

816
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,088
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

817
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,823
it means a lot to people,

818
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,092
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

819
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,894
and actually get
to know these girls,

820
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,296
like, it would be
really important,

821
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,865
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

822
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:39,173
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

823
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,841

weirdly horny. It does.

I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

830
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,423
It seems so supportive
of women.

831
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,425
Especially the hot ones.

832
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,227
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

833
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:02,296
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

834
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:07,401
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

835
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,902
I'm just a bit concerned

836
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,572
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

837
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,275
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

838
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,379
Okay.

839
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:24,485
[Josie] So, we know
that the club has been a place

840
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,521
where we can feel
empowered physically,

841
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:29,356
but we also thought
it could be

842
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,092
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

843
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,894
and talk about our feelings.

844
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,498
Okay, so who's been raped?

845
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,601
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

846
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,571
Gray area stuff counts too.

847
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,679
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

848
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,553
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

849
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,657
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

850
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,458
fuck, whatever.

851
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:05,993
You know?

852
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,228
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

853
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,397
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

854
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:12,867
And then the form
tells me to call,

855
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,904
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

856
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,471
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

857
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,339
but that doesn't count.

858
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,509
So, it's just, like, annoying.

859
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,043
Been there.

860
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,479
We've all been there.

861
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,015
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

862
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:30,050
but I'm more annoyed

863
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:34,522
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

864
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,559
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

865
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:41,729
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

866
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,699
See?

867
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:47,267
[Hazel] Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

868
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:50,237
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

869
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,973
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

870
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,709
It's been really, really dark.

871
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,077
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

872
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:01,114
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

873
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:04,117
-I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
-I can go next,

874
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,186
if that's okay.

875
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:11,759
I don't really like talking
about juvie

876
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:14,696
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

877
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:18,031
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

878
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,601
'cause people think
it's so badass.

879
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,070
But, really wasn't.

880
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:28,008
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

881
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,277
like, badass. I mean, um,

882
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,581
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

883
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,650
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

884
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,685
fight people basically
every single night.

885
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,855
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

886
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:44,626
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

887
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,694
and, um, pipes as well.

888
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:49,864
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

889
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,099
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

890
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:55,402
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

891
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,307
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

892
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,176
Like, I don't have
to just let things

893
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:06,648
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

894
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:09,851
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

895
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,520
for what the club
has become and...

896
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,254
Um...

897
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,758
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

898
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,093
Yeah, sorry.

899
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,328
[chuckles] I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

900
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,797
I've never really,

901
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:26,066
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

902
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,869
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

903
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,469
I'm going through a divorce.

904
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,373
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

905
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,976
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

906
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:37,277
men... men need therapy.

907
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,814
[softly] Yeah.

908
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,717
[in normal voice]
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

909
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:54,294
-Hey.
-Hey.

910
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:56,163
Um...

911
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,833
Thank you, um, for that.

912
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,336
Um...

913
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,674
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

914
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:11,178
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

915
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:13,681
if you wanna...

916
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:18,318
Yeah.

917
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,555
Yeah, okay, sure.

918
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:24,157
[man and woman
moaning in pleasure]

919
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,392
Mom?

920
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:29,564
[woman giggles]

921
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,066
[man groans]

922
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,534
Mom?

923
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:38,673
Oh, hi, honey.

924
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,608
What are you doing home
so early?

925
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,212
[grunts, groans]

926
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,446
Uh...

927
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:48,415
Are you kidding me?

928
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,152
I had a long day. [chuckles]

929
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,188
[Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

930
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,826
[Stella-Rebecca]
First club fundraiser.

931
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:01,763
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

932
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,098
Hello, ladies.

933
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:05,833
[Stella-Rebecca]
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

934
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,802
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

935
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,604
It's so weird. [chuckles]

936
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,973
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

937
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,407
Thanks, PJ.

938
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,942
-[Hazel groaning]
-Ah. We're havin' fun.

939
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,711
We're selling panties.

940
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,913
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

941
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,749
Very nice.

942
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,483
[PJ] Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

943
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,786
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

944
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:28,823
Um, I can't. Uh...

945
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,392
Isabel and I have plans, so...

946
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:33,728
[Hazel continues groaning]

947
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:35,763
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

948
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,230
Yep.

949
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:39,167
[PJ] Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

950
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:41,035
I have to keep up.

951
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,436
Hazel, what is wrong?

952
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,604
Are you constipated
or something?

953
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,405
[Hazel] I'm fucking tired.

954
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,340
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

955
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,309
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

956
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,845
-Thanks.
-You know, like, the guy.

957
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,479
He's like the crybaby.

958
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,850
With the balls?

959
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,285
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

960
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,889
He's like the main guy.

961
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,991
[sputters] Jeff?

962
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,661
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

963
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,663
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

964
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,397
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

965
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,499
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

966
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,102
[Stella-Rebecca yelps]

967
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,235
I'm good. [chuckles]

968
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,004
[PJ] Looking good, Stella!

969
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:18,238
[Isabel laughs]

970
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,439
[PJ] Are you gonna tell her?

971
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,645
[Tim] Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

972
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,347
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

973
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,284
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

974
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:32,553
[player] Hit me! Ow!

975
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,356
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

976
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,459
Got it. Thank you.

977
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:41,361
-[players shouting]
-[sighs]

978
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,967
[whistle blows]

979
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,035
Jeff!

980
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,972
[easygoing music playing]

981
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,775
[Josie laughing]

982
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:57,310
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

983
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,913
-Not good.
-That's not the best.

984
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,150
-No. No, not great.
-That's not a great thing.

985
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,818
[Josie and Isabel laughing]

986
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,456
I wanted to...

987
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:11,993
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

988
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,327
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

989
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:16,664
Me too.

990
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:20,802
I think it's really impressive

991
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,971
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

992
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:27,542
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

993
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,310
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

994
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,313
You're really, really brave.

995
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,849
No. [chuckles]

996
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,416
No. No, no.

997
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,654
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl. [chuckles]

998
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,655
You're...

999
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:42,790
Yeah, you're...

1000
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,526
really, really brave.

1001
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:49,831
What?

1002
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,637
Actually, Isabel, uh...

1003
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:59,406
-There's, um...
-Yeah?

1004
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:02,043
There's something
you maybe should know.

1005
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,476
Uh...

1006
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:07,414
I mean it's pretty insane.

1007
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,517
Okay. [chuckles]
What... what is it?

1008
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:12,452
I just, I...

1009
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:17,258
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

Wait, what? [chuckles]

1013
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,005
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

1014
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:36,077
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

1015
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:40,982
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

1016
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:44,752
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

1017
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,454

Fuck.

1187
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,855
You know,
it's been real, guys.

1188
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,924
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1189
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,093
with the goodbyes and...

1190
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,195
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

1191
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,599
[Sylvie] And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1192
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,433
I mean, that was
fucking insane!

1193
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,836
[girls laugh]

1194
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:49,403
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1195
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,205
[PJ] Wait. Stop.

1196
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,440
We don't-- Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1197
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:57,512
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1198
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,280
[PJ] All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1199
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:03,250
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1200
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:05,520
[Isabel] No matter what,

1201
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,288
this club has brought me
so much.

1202
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,390
I feel...

1203
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:14,529
so much more powerful
and, um...

1204
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:16,430
protected.

1205
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:18,800
-Me too.
-[PJ chuckles]

1206
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,234
-Great.
-[Hazel] Oh, my God, PJ.

1207
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,935
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1208
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,303
what you wanted
out of this group,

1209
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,972
but I think
the rest of us did.

1210
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,440
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1211
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:28,909
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1212
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,512
-Accomplished a lot.
-I actually did.

1213
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,781
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1214
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:34,716
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1215
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:36,818
You really think
that you're the reason
that we have this club?

1216
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:38,318
The reason? No.

1217
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:40,020
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1218
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,723
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1219
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,625
You're really ungrateful.

1220
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,426
You're so lucky
that we even let you
be a part of this.

1221
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,294
PJ, you're a liar.

1222
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,432
[PJ scoffs]

1223
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:53,835
Yeah, well,
you have no friends,

1224
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:56,303
and a skank as a mom, so...

1225
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,952
-[Josie] Hazel.
-[PJ scoffs]

1226
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:18,526
[door closes]

1227
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:22,530
[Brittany] PJ...

1228
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,133
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1229
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,173
[mellow music playing]

1230
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,476
[students chattering]

1231
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:36,977
[crying]

1232
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,588
Hazel.

1233
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:47,622
[door closes]

1234
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:51,425
Whoa.

1235
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,396
I love God.

1236
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,700
-Yes, same.
-[chuckles]

1237
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:09,376
Yeah.

1238
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,646
Oh, my God,
I always wanted
one of these.

1239
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,084
But my mom says
they hide your figure
and make you look ugly.

1240
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,186
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1241
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,288
Like, as a joke or...

1242
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:23,423
whatever.

1243
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,559
Thanks.

1244
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:25,560
[Josie] Yeah.

1245
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,134
[Isabel] Wow, you and PJ

1246
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:36,103
really have been
friends forever.

1247
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:39,139
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1248
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,610
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1249
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:45,713
PJ called her Gay Yoda,
but I think she's kind of
like a mentor.

1250
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:49,584
[Josie clears throat]

1251
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:52,687
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1252
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:54,689
She's so, like...

1253
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,124
like...

1254
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,192
[chuckles] You know?

1255
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,460
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-And you're...

1256
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,429
You're so, like...

1257
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,066
[both chuckle]

1258
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,371
-You know what I mean?
-No, yeah, I know.

1259
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,343
Josie...

1260
00:51:17,045 --> 00:51:18,245
[gentle music playing]

1261
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:51,546
[grunts softly]

1262
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:01,488
[Isabel breathing heavily]

1263
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,694
[PJ] I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1264
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,730
-[Brittany] Really?
-[PJ] Yeah.

1265
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,430
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1266
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,202
Wow.

1267
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:19,073
This is, um, a total shithole.

1268
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,340
[Brittany chuckles lightly]

1269
00:52:24,846 --> 00:52:26,179
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1270
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:32,452
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1271
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,154
they give you a tax break.

1272
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,825
[Brittany groans]

1273
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,761
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1274
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:42,195
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1275
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:44,364
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1276
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,768
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1277
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:49,837
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1278
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:52,272
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1279
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:00,313
[Brittany sighs]

1280
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,586
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1281
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:10,858
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1282
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:13,628
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1283
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,830
[whispering] Watch out.

1284
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:27,307
What?

1285
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,377
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1286
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:34,214
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1287
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:39,120
Your wrists are so small,
and the pen is so heavy
that I'm like,

1288
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:41,455
-"Is she getting exhausted?"
-Mmm.

1289
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,423
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1290
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,726
with all the surface area

1291
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:45,993
-that yours are taking up.
-[gasps]

1292
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,361
Wow.

1293
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:49,429
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1294
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,132
Okay, does this hurt?

1295
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,900
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1296
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,635
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1297
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,504
-Can you feel that?
-Can't even feel that.

1298
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:58,305
-Can't feel anything.
-Just like muscles in there.

1299
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,015
Um...

1300
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,684
Uh...

1301
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,354
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1302
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,595
Oh.

1303
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,532
Um...

1304
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:29,737
Yeah. Um...

1305
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:32,840
-I'm... I'm sorry
if you misread anything.
-No, that's all...

1306
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:36,010
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1307
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:42,282
[drums playing]

1308
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,796
[sighs] Um...

1309
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:57,464
I wanted to tell you something.

1310
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,834
What?

1311
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,804
Like, something that happened
last night.

1312
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:05,640
What happened?

1313
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:08,408
[softly] With Isabel.

1314
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:13,681
Wait.

1315
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:17,952
Wait, seriously?

I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1424
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:06,073
The point of the club

1425
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,877
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1426
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:12,980
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

was for sisterhood,

of an amazin' ally.

1444

was a fake hero?

If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1483

then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1484

so upset
