a shark is that?

I don't know.

519

I think it's a mako.

520
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,476
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

521
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,603
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

522
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,813
Tiger shark.

523
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,857

That is a big mouth.

529
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,242
You stuff
your frigging head
in there, man,

530
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,328
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

531
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,835
All I'm saying is
that it may not be
the shark.

532
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,086
It's just a slight...

Nice to meet you.

536
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:55,344
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

537
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,724
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

538
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,018
Hammerheads,
white tips,
blues, makos.

539
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,104
And the chances
that these bozos
got the exact shark...

540
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,106
There are no other
sharks like this here.

541
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,108
It's 100-to-1.

542
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,821
I'm not saying that
this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

543
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,741
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare
for these waters.

544
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,368
But the fact is,
the bite radius
on this animal

545
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,912
is different
than the wounds
on the victim.

546
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,083
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

547
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,710
We all want to
be sure, okay?

548
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,420
What I want to do
is very simple.

549
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,298
The digestive system
of this animal
is very slow.

550
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,507
Let's cut it open.

551
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,509
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

552
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,053
is bound to
still be in there.

553
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,096
And then we'll be sure.

554
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,146
It may be the only way
to confirm it.

555
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,565
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

the time or the place

to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy
on a fish.

558
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,534
And I am not
going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

Yeah, I love them.

612
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,365
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

613
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,200
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

614
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,452
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

615
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,372
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

616
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,082
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

617

He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

He turned an inboard
into an outboard

619

scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

620
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,636
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

621
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,680
and actually saw
my boat being
taken apart.

Ever since then,
I have been
studying sharks

that I'm going to go
to the Institute tomorrow

that you still have
a shark problem here.

to tell them that?

the shark was caught.

I heard it on

not the shark.

Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

knew what they were missing

652

of these attacks
weren't reported?

supply is gone, right?
