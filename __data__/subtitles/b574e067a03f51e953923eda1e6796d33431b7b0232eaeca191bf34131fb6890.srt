1
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,558
Marker.

2
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,928
<i>Stand by. Background action.
Yeah.</i>

3
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,091
<i>Action.</i>

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,367
<i>Action!</i>

5
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,289
Okay, hang on.

6
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:26,035
<i>The shark is networking.</i>

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,995
<i>We're having a little
problem with the shark here.</i>

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,191
Bob, we need you.

9
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,828
<i>The shark is not working.</i>

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,415
<i>Roy?</i>

11
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:38,682
<i>Has anybody seen Roy?</i>

12
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,952
<i>The shark is not working.
Repeat, the shark is not working.</i>

13
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:48,848
<i>Can't get it to work at all.</i>

14
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,642
<i>AH right, let's try this again.</i>

15
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,436
<i>Okay, rolling.
Action!</i>

16
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>The shark is working again.</i>

17
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,610
<i>Joe here, the boat is sinking.</i>

18
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,548
<i>Three decades after the release</i>

19
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,141
<i>of what many consider to be
the original summer blockbuster,</i>

20
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,943
<i>stories of the hardships
experienced during the filming of Jaws</i>

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,484
<i>are the stuff of Hollywood legend.</i>

22
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,635
It filled me up with stories that
I could dine out on for 35 years.

23
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:33,592
<i>If I wanted to, I could just hold
back any but the stories from Jaws.</i>

24
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,677
<i>Through accounts
like Carl Gottlieb's The Jaws Log</i>

25
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:41,798
<i>and numerous television
documentaries, multitudes of movie buffs</i>

26
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:46,339
<i>are familiar with those famous
tales of the shark not working.</i>

27
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:51,874
We were all groping in the
dark for a way to tell the story,

28
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,914
<i>because the shark wasn't
working. It kept breaking down.</i>

29
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:59,179
<i>It is as if God created the devil</i>

30
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,721
<i>and gave him jaws.</i>

31
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,258
<i>Jaws, one of
Hollywood's little movies that couldn't,</i>

32
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,777
<i>emerged as a record-shattering
box office juggernaut,</i>

33
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,798
<i>then an Oscar contender.</i>

34
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,880
<i>And today, stands as a
critically-acclaimed enduring classic</i>

35
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:24,325
<i>that after all this time shows
no sign of losing its bite.</i>

36
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:29,429
What we are dealing with here is a
perfect engine, an eating machine.

37
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,913
Michael, did you hear your
father? Out of the water now!

38
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,820
<i>Opening the beaches on the Fourth
of July is like ringing the dinner bell.</i>

39
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,171
This shark, swallow you whole.

40
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,742
My heart was beating so fast.

41
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:46,761
I didn't know, as an adult, I
could get that soared anymore.

42
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,565
<i>One thing, it's a real thing,
not a monster from outer space.</i>

43
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,651
<i>Sharks are</i> real.

44
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:56,182
<i>The film sparked a
pop cultural obsession with sharks</i>

45
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,342
<i>and heightened public
awareness of real life shark attacks.</i>

46
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,947
<i>And though numerous copycat
pictures have come and gone,</i>

47
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:09,046
<i>Jaws still remains that
singular cinematic experience</i>

48
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,898
<i>that keeps bathers close to the shore.</i>

49
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,107
The movie itself is what
first put the terror into me.

50
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,843
Every time you felt a bit
of seaweed brush your foot,

51
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,476
<i>you would have been thinking about it.</i>

52
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:27,467
I still get a little nervous in water,
being like, "Is there a shark in here?"

53
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,540
<i>Not only did it impact
the way movies are made and marketed,</i>

54
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>but it maintains a legacy
kept alive by legions of fans,</i>

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,699
<i>artists and even successful filmmakers,</i>

56
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,866
<i>who cite this picture
as a defining life experience,</i>

57
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,874
<i>helping to make them who they are today.</i>

58
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,708
Anyone who's around my age,
who is in this movie business,

59
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,896
always cites Jaws as the first movie

60
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,098
<i>that made them want to get into movies.</i>

61
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:58,717
<i>It's therefore no
wonder that after 30 years,</i>

62
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,520
<i>the shark is indeed still working.</i>

63
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,841
<i>When I was writing Jaws,
I knew that it could not be a success.</i>

64
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,497
<i>It couldn't be a success as a novel</i>

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,444
<i>because, first of all, it's a first
novel and nobody reads first novels.</i>

66
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,586
It was a first novel about a fish,
so give me a break, who cares?

67
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,489
I knew they couldn't make a movie about it

68
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,857
because the technology
was nowhere near good enough

69
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:41,455
to make a great white shark, and I
knew you couldn't catch and train one.

70
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,314
<i>So I had no sense that this
was going to be a success</i>

71
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:49,202
beyond just being published, until
the movie had been open for a while

72
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:52,207
and the paperback was
selling millions of copies.

73
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,721
And even then, who would've guessed

74
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,310
that down the road it would
have had any currency?

75
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,826
I wouldn't have.

76
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,845
<i>Making</i> Jaws,
<i>still looking back 30 years ago,</i>

77
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,701
<i>was the toughest film making production</i>

78
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,490
<i>experience I've ever encountered.</i>

79
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:11,488
Nothing's ever come close
to the production difficulties

80
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,639
of shooting an actual
special effects movie,

81
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,592
not a digital effects movie,
that was many, many years later,

82
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,544
but a mechanical effects movie,

83
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,917
<i>not in a tank somewhere in Malta</i>

84
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,241
<i>or some safe tank somewhere in Florida,</i>

85
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,503
<i>but in the actual Atlantic Ocean.</i>

86
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,392
<i>We must've been complete idiots</i>

87
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,238
<i>to have even expected to have an easy ride</i>

88
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>in the middle of the ocean making a movie.</i>

89
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,864
The in gathering

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,133
of all the mystical tribes

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,939
and shamans and crazy
experts that floated in

92
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,356
<i>under the banner of Universal
to make this movie</i>

93
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,777
<i>had overlooked that it was the first
film ever really shot on the ocean.</i>

94
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,728
They hadn't really known that before.

95
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,473
<i>The approach that Spielberg had then,</i>

96
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,907
<i>remember that he was fresh then,</i>

97
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,791
<i>he was new and young,</i>

98
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,160
<i>and he insisted that this
movie be shot on the ocean,</i>

99
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:09,213
and that alone was an innovation,

100
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,765
because Universal at the time

101
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,648
would normally have gone to
a back lake and shot on the lot,

102
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,089
and he wouldn't let them.

103
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:21,505
We all gained a tremendous
respect for the sea, for nature,

104
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,495
for currents and tides, for waves,

105
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,403
<i>for rain and sun and overexposure to both.</i>

106
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:33,656
<i>We started shooting on the first of May,</i>

107
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,735
<i>and we were supposed
to shoot until June 28th.</i>

108
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:42,025
If you're really quiet, you
could hear someone laughing.

109
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:45,096
<i>The movie
went on for</i> a <i>total of seven months,</i>

110
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,934
<i>something like that, almost</i> a year.

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,418
If you figured when
the first crew got there

112
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,176
and the first special effects people,

113
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,055
then the actors came and then
it just went on and on and on.

114
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:58,078
<i>And we thought we were gonna
be there for the rest of our lives.</i>

115
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,433
It's not the time it takes to
take the take that takes the time,

116
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,336
it's the time it takes between the takes

117
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,135
that takes the time that takes the take.

118
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:08,226
If you see, conditions
have been so impossible

119
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,093
that it's really hurt our schedule and

120
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,015
<i>put a general somber note
behind the scenes</i>

121
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:18,180
on the production, 'cause we've
been here 105 shooting days

122
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:21,337
and we were only scheduled
for something like 65 or 70.

123
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,143
<i>And they started the shoot</i>

124
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,339
without a cast, without a
script and without a shark.

125
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,730
<i>And that was after May 1st.</i>

126
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,682
<i>And we're going and we're shooting.</i>

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,167
<i>What are we shooting? I
don't know, what are we doing?</i>

128
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,151
I know because he'll be so energetic,

129
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,263
and he'll be screaming and yelling,

130
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,480
"It's a great white, it's a
great white. I knew it all along."

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,549
And it's only…

132
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,261
<i>It's hard to imagine a world</i>

133
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,862
<i>where Steven Spielberg
isn't a household name.</i>

134
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,126
<i>But in 1974, it was viewed
by some as a roll of the dice</i>

135
00:07:57,193 --> 00:08:00,242
<i>to put the weight of such a
mammoth project on the shoulders</i>

136
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,873
<i>of a 27-year-old relative newcomer.</i>

137
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,509
<i>A director, who had
only just completed work</i>

138
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,661
<i>on his first theatrical release,</i>

139
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,404
The Sugar land Express.

140
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,186
<i>I remember a reporter one time asking me,</i>

141
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:18,163
"Mr. Zanuck, are you trying to
enhance this young director's career?"

142
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,080
And I said, "No, just the opposite.

143
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,948
"I'm trying to enhance my career."

144
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,784
<i>Probably nobody else in
the world knew at that time</i>

145
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:31,521
<i>better than I, who was every
day on The Sugar land Express,</i>

146
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:35,254
how good this guy was
and how he could tell a story.

147
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:39,583
Steven Spielberg story
boarded the actual scenes

148
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,801
and then shot them.

149
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,901
<i>And the studio production department</i>

150
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,487
<i>wanted to know every storyboard there</i> was.

151
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,395
<i>They didn't know every
storyboard there was.</i>

152
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,193
<i>We had a bunch of 'em
that we never told 'em about</i>

153
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,501
<i>that we would sneak and shoot.</i>

154
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,130
It was a guerrilla movie.

155
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,086
I like to think of it
as a big independent movie

156
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,235
masquerading as a big studio movie.

157
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:08,862
<i>It was the film's title
monster, a 12-ton hydraulic shark,</i>

158
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,560
<i>that would become
affectionately known as Bruce,</i>

159
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,786
<i>that plagued Spielberg
and the Jaws production team</i>

160
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,347
<i>with their most daunting set
of complications.</i>

161
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,051
<i>Once the idea
was set that we're gonna build it,</i>

162
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,845
<i>then we had to determine the size,</i>

163
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,530
and I was working off of a scale model

164
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,364
of my research of a shark that
was about 12 and a half feet,

165
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,688
and so I just doubled it

166
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,271
because I felt that as
the sharks got bigger,

167
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,276
<i>they got girthier, and
they weren't so attractive.</i>

168
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:42,292
<i>So, I figured a 25-foot shark
would be the proper size.</i>

169
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,709
<i>Don Chandler was a studio sculptor.</i>

170
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,187
<i>He started on the outside,</i>

171
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,917
a <i>big clay model,
we were gonna make a mold.</i>

172
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,770
<i>And so we were making the
skeleton out of Permali tubing,</i>

173
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,456
<i>both things at once,</i>

174
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:03,196
<i>and hoping that they would fit
together perfectly, which they did.</i>

175
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,637
<i>My part that they gave
me, mostly, was the cosmetics of the thing</i>

176
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,839
<i>and the skin and
the looks of it and all that,</i>

177
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,402
and when something mechanical
would break in the shark,

178
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,790
the shark's head would turn
over, and of course it would rip

179
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,534
and then they would bring it
back to me and say, "Fix it."

180
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,003
<i>Then we'd have to patch the whole shark.</i>

181
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,126
<i>Veteran effects supervisor, Bob Mattey,</i>

182
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,388
<i>who had created the famous squid</i>

183
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,589
<i>from Disney's</i>
20,000 <i>Leagues</i> Under <i>the Sea,</i>

184
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,906
<i>was mastermind of the
shark's mechanical workings.</i>

185
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,576
You got the men down there with the camera

186
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:37,211
over by the end down
by the fin. I'm not sure.

187
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:40,700
<i>Bob Mattey, my
mentor, was the greatest guy in the world.</i>

188
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,504
<i>He loved… I mean, he loved what he did.</i>

189
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,092
I just fell in right behind
Bob. He was like my hero.

190
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,191
<i>There was never ever a down day.</i>

191
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,125
<i>I mean, he was pretty much tireless.</i>

192
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:54,182
<i>And he always looked at the up side.</i>

193
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,250
<i>It was a good thing, too,
as Mattey and his team promptly discovered</i>

194
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,622
<i>that Jaws would produce
technical challenges</i>

195
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,686
<i>unlike any movie previously
attempted by Hollywood.</i>

196
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:08,615
The condition of the shark
was the ultimate story,

197
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,154
that if the shark didn't work,
what do you do?

198
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:16,705
When your lead actor, which is
this 12 ton marvel, is recalcitrant.

199
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:21,208
<i>Well, like any recalcitrant actor,
you shoot around him or her.</i>

200
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,957
<i>Not that a recalcitrant shark</i>

201
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,162
<i>was always to blame for
setbacks during the shoot.</i>

202
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:31,287
<i>For a Hollywood film crew with
little or no maritime experience,</i>

203
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,656
<i>finding their sea legs
didn't always come easily.</i>

204
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,414
<i>It didn't take long for one
thing to become perfectly clear.</i>

205
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,401
<i>Making Jaws, whether
by land or sea or foam,</i>

206
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,497
<i>would be no day at the beach.</i>

207
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,626
<i>We were starting
to shoot all of the land scenes</i>

208
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,571
<i>and running out of them very quickly.</i>

209
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:59,784
<i>And Carl Gottlieb and Roy,
David and Dick, producers,</i>

210
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,686
<i>Steven, myself and
Verna Fields and her son,</i>

211
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,590
<i>would meet every day at Steven's bungalow</i>

212
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:12,541
<i>and try to make sense of the
next day's work or the days after.</i>

213
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:17,843
<i>With no shark to
shoot and an ever inflating budget,</i>

214
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>they made the very most of these meetings.</i>

215
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,233
<i>The logistical setbacks
allowed Spielberg and his actors</i>

216
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:29,339
<i>to become a little repertory
company, free to invent and improvise.</i>

217
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,885
The thing I remember most
is, Steven, obviously,

218
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,081
allowing the actors to ad lib,
because a lot of this was ad lib.

219
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,624
The, "You wanna get drunk and
fool around?" The "coffee."

220
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:43,993
<i>I mean, all these… "Dead
doll's eyes," that's my favorite.</i>

221
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>I think that's one of the things
that was so extraordinary.</i>

222
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,086
<i>The scene with
the little boy at the table,</i>

223
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,998
<i>after Roy's had a particularly hard day,</i>

224
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,201
we were in between shots

225
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,643
and I was like this at the table,

226
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,214
<i>and then that little kid was like this.</i>

227
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:05,626
Just started with our hands
underneath our chin.

228
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,966
Then he'd do this and I'd do that.

229
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,580
Then I went… And he went…

230
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,119
And he made a monster face
and I kind of went like that…

231
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,764
And I went out to the kitchen in
the house and I said to Steven,

232
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,017
"Come here. Come here.
Watch this."

233
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,201
And I went through all the motions

234
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,989
and the little guy copied right after me.

235
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,555
He said, "Okay," and he brought
the camera in and we did that scene.

236
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,728
Hello?
Get out of here.

237
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:36,407
<i>With the summer season fully upon them,</i>

238
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,419
<i>frustration began to mount
amidst the already exhausted crew</i>

239
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,320
<i>as discouraging reports of the
film's malfunctioning antagonist</i>

240
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,791
<i>continued to spread across the island.</i>

241
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,474
<i>It's not the
first movie with the radio mics,</i>

242
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,378
<i>it was the first one that I was aware of</i>

243
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,533
<i>that had all these radio mics
all over the island.</i>

244
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,099
So every day, you could hear this.

245
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,808
The shark is not working.

246
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,684
Repeat. The shark is not
working.

247
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,822
Repeat. The shark…
Not working.

248
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,077
<i>And that was the constant refrain,</i>

249
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,061
<i>because every time they tried
to test the shark,</i>

250
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,513
<i>it would come up like…</i>

251
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,249
Or its eye would fall out.

252
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,772
I have a saying in films that

253
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,722
film companies import their problems,

254
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,663
they don't find them where they go.

255
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:31,044
And in our case, we imported
our problem and that was the shark,

256
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,367
<i>and we didn't have enough
testing time on Bob Mattey's behalf.</i>

257
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,570
<i>If we'd given him
the 15 weeks that it took</i>

258
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,726
<i>to work the bugs out of the shark,</i>

259
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,891
<i>it would've worked on cue.</i>

260
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,674
We were pioneers. That's
the best word I can think of,

261
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,947
because nobody had ever taken on

262
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,114
the Atlantic Ocean in small boats.

263
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,122
No one had ever worked with
a mechanical shark

264
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,878
<i>of the sophistication of ours.</i>

265
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,758
<i>We struggled like mad, but
the end justified the means.</i>

266
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,658
Then one day, you heard this…

267
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,114
The shark
is working. Repeat, the shark is working.

268
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,214
Repeat, the shark…

269
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,226
What you see in the finished picture

270
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:16,664
<i>is practically every frame of
usable footage of the shark.</i>

271
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:21,552
And down.

272
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,254
<i>Suits and all.</i>

273
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,328
One more time. Shark comes up,

274
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,579
bites at the masts,

275
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,480
snaps two, three times,
shaking their head,

276
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,114
but always working its way into the masts.

277
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,945
Okay, start it.
Okay, Roy? Action.

278
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,534
Bring it in. Bring it in.

279
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,072
<i>And the last shot, before we all went back</i>

280
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,958
to Long Beach for another
month of shooting in California,

281
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,651
was going to be the shot
of the shark blowing up.

282
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,722
We were rigging the shark
to blow up and blow scrib

283
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,821
and all kinds of stuff up into
the air, and they were loading it.

284
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,559
<i>And finally, the sun went down
and I'm shooting high speed</i>

285
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,570
<i>and I said, "Steven, they're not
ready and I can't shoot high speed."</i>

286
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:15,287
Steven said, "You shoot it
in the morning."

287
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,736
Steven went to the airport,
got onto the airplane,

288
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,996
he was already packed, and left the
island. He was ready to go.

289
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,305
I said, "Goodbye!
I'm going back to L.A."

290
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,158
And I got into a motorboat,
sped back to the mainland.

291
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:30,170
<i>Steven and I were on a flight back to L-A.</i>

292
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:34,318
And I said, "So, who's…
How was the last shot?"

293
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,638
You know, they blow up the…

294
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,648
He saw, "They're doing it right now."

295
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,012
I said, "They're doing it right
now, why aren't you there?"

296
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,181
He goes…

297
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,762
And I said, "Steven?"

298
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,048
<i>He said something like… He got word,</i>

299
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,440
<i>he knew that they were gonna throw him in.</i>

300
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,451
<i>So, he decided to just skip
out and not do the last shot.</i>

301
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,300
Not do the last blowing up
shot, yeah, not do that one,

302
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,307
which became, by the way,
a tradition of Steven's.

303
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,787
He never would do the
last shot of his movies,

304
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,694
because he thought the crew
was always gonna do something.

305
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,772
And he probably was right.

306
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,009
Had I been on his crew, I would've.

307
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:23,053
But it's become a tradition that
Steven never shoots his last shot.

308
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,110
One day, I'm gonna use this information.

309
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,068
<i>With the production of the film completed</i>

310
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,021
<i>and Benchley's book
already a raging success,</i>

311
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,393
<i>the makers of Jaws braced themselves,</i>

312
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,915
<i>hoping the fruit of their labor</i>

313
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,294
<i>would live up to the reputation
of the novel that inspired it.</i>

314
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,738
<i>Little did they realize
that their fish story</i>

315
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,451
<i>was about to change the face of Hollywood.</i>

316
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,089
I couldn't really see beyond

317
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,677
all of the screw ups
that were apparent to me

318
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,263
and were more apparent than anything else.

319
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:09,578
And so in my ignorance,
which is pure ignorance,

320
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,906
<i>I was saying, "This is
gonna be a disaster."</i>

321
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,488
<i>And then we made this movie that</i>

322
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,008
<i>crashed into people like a speeding truck.</i>

323
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,954
<i>The book had become a best seller</i>

324
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,821
<i>while we were shooting the picture.</i>

325
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:34,029
But still, no one had any
thought or even dared to think

326
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,337
that it would become what it became.

327
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,067
<i>Part of it is
that, it was over-ambitious for the budget.</i>

328
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:45,154
The technology was not there, that
they had to use parts of their brain

329
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,084
that you don't normally have to

330
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,991
unless you're in desperate mode,

331
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,439
and when an artist is pushed like that,

332
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:53,824
amazing, one-of-a-kind things happen,

333
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,833
and that's what happened in Jaws.

334
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:00,998
<i>It was just an
extraordinary, perfect creative storm.</i>

335
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:03,419
Who knew? Who knew?

336
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:08,009
But you know, it's like
all of these phenomenons,

337
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,855
they just happen.

338
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,383
If you planned it, it would
never be a phenomenon.

339
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,023
<i>The film's groundbreaking ad campaign</i>

340
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:20,388
<i>was highly instrumental in
its initial box office success.</i>

341
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,222
I think Jaws affected film
making in a lot of ways.

342
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,376
That's when they first
started using television

343
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,915
to really advertise movies.

344
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,962
So, it made this huge opening,
and everybody went out to see it.

345
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,117
The anticipation was
unbelievable. Unbelievable.

346
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:34,714
No one had ever anticipated a movie

347
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,019
much like that that I remember.

348
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,505
<i>I mean, it really did create the
sensation around the planet of,</i>

349
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,387
<i>"All right, here it comes."</i>

350
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,683
<i>There is</i> a <i>creature alive today</i>

351
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,993
<i>who has survived millions
of years of evolution…</i>

352
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,934
<i>Underscoring the TV
spots and theatrical trailers for Jaws</i>

353
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,624
<i>was the familiar, but ominous voice talent</i>

354
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:58,209
<i>of character actor and
voice artist, Percy Rodrigues.</i>

355
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:04,434
They had an idea of doing a
very high, horrifying delivery,

356
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,067
which I disagreed with.

357
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,371
And we discussed it.

358
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:15,431
And finally, they came around
to the idea that I had in mind,

359
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:21,551
that we would do it at a more
level, devastating presentation,

360
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,180
rather than trying to ride over

361
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,034
this terrifying visual that they had.

362
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,088
<i>I felt that I should go underneath
it and let the visual sell.</i>

363
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,949
<i>It is as if God created the devil</i>

364
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,354
<i>and gave him jaws.</i>

365
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,086
<i>The level of
advertising was very high-pitched,</i>

366
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,995
and afterwards, they had people
afraid to go in the water for years.

367
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:54,534
And I like to think that
I contributed to that fear.

368
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,749
<i>See it before you go swimming.</i>

369
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,611
<i>Everyone who grew
up around that period knows the voice.</i>

370
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:07,012
He was the gateway for a lot
of people into the <i>Jaws</i> universe.

371
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:11,383
He was like the weed to what
would become the crack of Jaws.

372
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:14,719
It's just like you had to get through
Percy and Percy's dulcet tones

373
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,559
that drew you into that movie and
then got you hooked in a big, bad way.

374
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,080
Once Jaws premiered,

375
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,128
<i>it demonstrated just how
hooked moviegoers were</i>

376
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,193
<i>and marked a decisive
turning point at the box office.</i>

377
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,568
<i>The buzz generated by advanced screenings</i>

378
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,301
<i>demanded that it
become the first movie ever</i>

379
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,003
<i>to be released in over 400 theaters.</i>

380
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,770
<i>And it could've been even more.</i>

381
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,613
<i>When the screening
in Long Beach, California took place,</i>

382
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:45,245
<i>Lew Wasserman, the chairman
of the board of Universal,</i>

383
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:48,655
asked Hy Martin, who
was the head of distribution,

384
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,269
to cut back on the number of theaters.

385
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:56,008
<i>Hy said, "We've set
a record. We've got 600 theaters.</i>

386
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,800
<i>"Ever since the Dallas preview,</i>

387
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,496
<i>"I cannot stop the phone from ringing."</i>

388
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:02,762
<i>And Lew said,</i>

389
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:04,237
"Cut it in half."

390
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,670
And everybody was kind of
stunned, "Cut it in half? Why?"

391
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,658
He said, "I want people
in Palm Springs, California

392
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,507
"to have to come to Los
Angeles to see the movie."

393
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,514
I don't think we thought
that we were releasing

394
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,715
<i>an "event movie."</i>

395
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,769
<i>We thought we had this
very successful movie,</i>

396
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,890
<i>we thought they should
be waiting to see it.</i>

397
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:29,579
<i>My colleague, Lew Wasserman,
always thought that the best advertising</i>

398
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,161
<i>was people standing in line.</i>

399
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,893
<i>Lew said, "I wanted this to
be something that you couldn't get into."</i>

400
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,688
<i>He wasn't interested
in just taking the weekend.</i>

401
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,386
<i>He wanted to take the summer,
and we took the summer.</i>

402
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,129
When you opened in 400
theaters, it was different.

403
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,314
You could play all summer,
and if you looked at the grosses,

404
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,182
the grosses were constant.

405
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:55,753
Smoking lounge is sold out, seats
downstairs in the first seven rows only.

406
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>When the
movie was out for weeks and months,</i>

407
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,237
I would still be going to the movies.

408
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:03,031
Not to see a new movie,
but to see Jaws again.

409
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:07,399
And, "One for <i>Jaws, "</i> and
he'd look at me like, "Again?"

410
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,028
It's like, "Dude,
just give me the ticket."

411
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:13,191
<i>They began to
see that the film could become an event</i>

412
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,454
<i>and a marketing phenomenon.</i>

413
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,337
Of course, nowadays,
the marketing of a film

414
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,291
is more important than the film itself.

415
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,851
And I think we can attribute a
lot of that to the success of Jaws.

416
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,216
<i>It happened to work
on a very mainstream level</i>

417
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,734
<i>and a mass audience level,</i>

418
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,718
but the movie itself

419
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,444
was so incredibly solid and beyond solid,

420
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,748
just exceptional from end to end,

421
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,792
that when people throw
together their summer movies

422
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,393
and the eye candy stuff,
they just tend to forget that

423
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,972
that movie was a lot more
than just eye candy.

424
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,023
<i>Although it is
credited with having started</i>

425
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,709
<i>the syndrome of summer blockbusters,</i>

426
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:53,225
and mindless movies and all that stuff,

427
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:57,246
the fact is that <i>Jaws,</i> and I
think many critics will agree,

428
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:01,981
was a fine movie of that
genre, which was very rare.

429
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,841
<i>Given its monstrous
success and critical acclaim,</i>

430
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,256
<i>Jaws was roundly expected to receive</i>

431
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,995
<i>the lion's share of Oscar
nominations for that year,</i>

432
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,479
<i>including Best Director
for Steven Spielberg.</i>

433
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:38,824
<i>But unfortunately, those high
expectations came up short.</i>

434
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,864
Oh, I didn't get it.
I didn't get it.

435
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,297
I wasn't nominated.
I got beaten out by Fellini.

436
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,032
<i>Jaws did get
the nomination for Best Picture.</i>

437
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,455
Jaws.

438
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,877
Well, it's about time.

439
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,674
<i>But it was in light of this</i>

440
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,244
<i>that some in the industry
thought it scandalous</i>

441
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,842
<i>that Steven would be
overlooked for Best Director.</i>

442
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,296
Who made the picture?
Somebody's mother?

443
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,486
The director.

444
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,636
This man made Jaws.

445
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,085
Are you kidding? Who's
kidding who around here?

446
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,208
It's the biggest disappointment
for me, the whole Oscars.

447
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:17,271
I thought Steven did a
brilliant job directing <i>Jaws,</i>

448
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,215
and I have no idea what happened.

449
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,537
It's the one thing
that I cannot comprehend yet

450
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,062
in my head, how a best
picture can be nominated,

451
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,366
and yet the director, who is
basically responsible for it,

452
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,173
does not get the nomination.

453
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:33,743
<i>But for the
27-year-old wunderkind director,</i>

454
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,750
<i>there was no choice but to take his lumps.</i>

455
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,377
I'm suffering enough.
All right.

456
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,818
We're suffering with you.
I'm suffering.

457
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,252
We're suffering with you.
Cancel my day.

458
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:41,355
Right, we're getting to it…

459
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,922
<i>Although Jaws did
not receive the Oscar for Best Picture,</i>

460
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:48,657
<i>it did bring home awards for
its remaining three nominations.</i>

461
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:53,441
<i>Best Sound, Best Editing
and Best Musical Score.</i>

462
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:56,619
<i>Throughout the rest of the year,</i>

463
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,033
<i>Jaws continued to reel in
numerous other industry awards,</i>

464
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,056
<i>even as the record books
were being re-written.</i>

465
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,167
<i>In hindsight, one wonders
if the Academy would rethink</i>

466
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,260
<i>overlooking Spielberg's
masterful work on</i> Jaws,

467
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,022
<i>if they knew then what
they certainly know now.</i>

468
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,816
<i>Of course, a much decorated
career still lay ahead for Steven.</i>

469
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,220
<i>A now legendary career
that encompasses, perhaps,</i>

470
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,567
<i>the most popular and diverse body of work</i>

471
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,289
<i>ever created by an individual director,</i>

472
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,339
<i>making Steven Spielberg one
of the most influential figures</i>

473
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:38,027
<i>in the entire film industry.</i>

474
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,227
<i>And it was all jump-started by Jaws.</i>

475
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:53,878
<i>Audience fascination with Jaws
was by no means limited to the U. S.</i>

476
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:56,163
<i>Shortly after its domestic release,</i>

477
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,331
<i>Jaws swam its way into
theaters across the globe.</i>

478
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,697
<i>And moviegoers couldn't get enough.</i>

479
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,961
<i>The biggest thing I remember about Jaws</i>

480
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,121
is traveling around the world,
promoting it.

481
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:14,159
<i>And whether it was in South
Africa or Australia or Latin America,</i>

482
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,066
<i>every culture in the world embraced Jaws.</i>

483
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:23,648
<i>Peter Benchley's book,
which was the start of it all,</i>

484
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,352
<i>was a sensation.</i>

485
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,658
<i>Somehow the idea of this
creature attacking mankind</i>

486
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,509
<i>caught on everywhere.</i>

487
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,836
<i>I've been to many places in the world,</i>

488
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,038
<i>and Jaws has reached almost
every place I've ever been.</i>

489
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:40,598
At first, I thought maybe
it'll do okay in cities

490
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:43,088
near great bodies of water.

491
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,970
But it turned out
some of our best business

492
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,776
were in tremendous desert countries.

493
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:50,158
<i>I think the reason it went
around the world so quickly was that</i>

494
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,896
you don't even need dialogue.

495
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,689
I mean, you just see the situation there,

496
00:27:54,756 --> 00:28:00,638
and your own primal fear about
something you can't see into

497
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,665
is enough to hold your
interest in that movie.

498
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,862
It's a universal movie.

499
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,320
Not just Universal Studios,
but it really has a global impact.

500
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,875
<i>I really think it
works like a silent movie.</i>

501
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,126
<i>You're responding to the visuals</i>

502
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,127
<i>instinctively and in a visceral</i> way.

503
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:24,776
The coincidence of that, plus
Steven's innate talent as a filmmaker,

504
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,987
made a film that will live.

505
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:28,500
It has to live.

506
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,573
It's not going away anywhere.

507
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,305
There's no culture on Earth that
does not have that film and show it.

508
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,584
<i>It was shown in 40
countries in 17 different languages.</i>

509
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:45,589
<i>If you forgot what terror is
like, the original Jaws is back.</i>

510
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,737
<i>And then there
was the merchandising blitz.</i>

511
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,523
<i>Almost overnight, Jaws
became a cottage industry.</i>

512
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,635
<i>And suddenly sharks meant big business.</i>

513
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:05,387
<i>When we realized what we
had, Merchandising was licking their lips,</i>

514
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,488
<i>and it just was such an
easy one to merchandise.</i>

515
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:13,668
<i>It started obviously with what
everybody does with the T-shirts,</i>

516
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:15,282
<i>but it went from there.</i>

517
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:19,915
<i>Everything kind of mushroomed
with the release of the picture.</i>

518
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:23,251
I even had a toilet seat,

519
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:27,048
that when you open it up, it
was a big shark facing you.

520
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:32,269
<i>So, everything, lunch
pails to barbeque sets…</i>

521
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,396
<i>It was incredible,</i>

522
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:39,477
<i>and one of the first
big merchandising events</i>

523
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,479
<i>to take place in
connection with the movie.</i>

524
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,728
<i>Though three decades have come and gone</i>

525
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,951
<i>since the Jaws merchandising frenzy,</i>

526
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,903
<i>for some voracious collectors,
the summer of the shark never ends.</i>

527
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:09,937
<i>In recent years,</i>

528
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,670
<i>the picture's enduring popularity has seen</i>

529
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,406
<i>a resurgence of
Jaws-related paraphernalia,</i>

530
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:19,515
<i>from children's toys,
to high-end collectibles,</i>

531
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,144
<i>to video games.</i>

532
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,162
<i>Another milestone in the
evolution of entertainment</i>

533
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,432
<i>was the commercialization
of the making of Jaws.</i>

534
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,116
<i>Though commonplace today,</i>

535
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:40,428
<i>capitalizing on a picture's
behind-the-scenes accounts</i>

536
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,588
<i>was rarely, if ever, seen in the mid-'70s.</i>

537
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,585
I'd always been interested in movies

538
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,369
as something more than just sitting
there and passively observing them.

539
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:53,712
<i>The Jaws Log, by Carl
Gottlieb, and Edith Blake's book</i>

540
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,253
<i>called</i> The Making of the Movie Jaws.

541
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,973
<i>Both of those were inspiration
for making me interested in films.</i>

542
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,454
Jaws as a film to me

543
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,303
is first of all, my favorite
film. I watch it once a year.

544
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,340
And when you examine the film
in its finished state,

545
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,408
and you look at the process
of making the film,

546
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,834
and you read Carl Gottlieb's Jaws <i>Log,</i>

547
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,417
<i>or you just read the other histories,</i>

548
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,622
<i>or as I remember reading
about it even as a kid,</i>

549
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,152
<i>it's almost like film school in a movie.</i>

550
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:20,422
I remember in film school reading

551
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,570
an interview with Steven Soderbergh,

552
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,728
who said that he was Jaws-obsessed,

553
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,381
and that his favorite
book was The <i>Jaws</i> Log

554
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,009
<i>and that he carried it
with him everywhere.</i>

555
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,554
And I thought,
"Okay, I'm on the right track."

556
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,791
That book became my Bible, and I
read that book over and over and over.

557
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,237
<i>In the beginning,
when the book was first conceived,</i>

558
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:41,478
it was kind of a hasty
afterthought to the marketing plan.

559
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,497
The original intent was for
there to be a three-parter.

560
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,235
The book would be written

561
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,399
from Steven Spielberg's point of
view, he would contribute a third,

562
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,875
<i>from Peter Benchley's view,
he would contribute a third,</i>

563
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,776
<i>and Zanuck and Brown would
contribute a third as producers.</i>

564
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,709
<i>And as we got closer and
closer to the release date,</i>

565
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,228
it became evident that nobody
was gonna be able to write their third.

566
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,145
I had already agreed with Steven

567
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,418
to kind of ghostwrite or author
his third of it from what I knew,

568
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,766
'cause we had shared a house and I knew

569
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,085
what Steven's perspective
on the movie was.

570
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,380
So then nobody was available.

571
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,894
<i>Steven was immersed in post-production.</i>

572
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,470
<i>Zanuck and Brown were onto something else.</i>

573
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:22,164
<i>So they said to me at the end of March,</i>

574
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,268
<i>"Can you do a book by the end of
May?" And with the folly of youth,</i>

575
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,745
<i>I said, "Yeah, I can
write a book that quickly."</i>

576
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,179
<i>So I wrote the book in a very short time.</i>

577
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,717
<i>Probably less than a month.</i>

578
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,810
<i>And the original paperback
got favorable reviews.</i>

579
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:37,903
<i>And the word of mouth was terrific,</i>

580
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,714
<i>and the book went through 17 printings</i>

581
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,600
<i>and sold a couple of million copies.</i>

582
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:44,810
<i>And then of course, many years later,</i>

583
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,872
<i>Laurent Bouzereau did his
behind-the scenes documentary</i>

584
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:49,348
<i>on the same subject matter.</i>

585
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,295
<i>Universal came out with what
they called the Signature series</i>

586
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,712
<i>back in the LaserDisc days.</i>

587
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,937
And the Jaws box set that included
the Laurent Bouzereau documentary

588
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:02,014
was something that every
Jaws fan just had to have.

589
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:03,747
They went out and bought LaserDisc players

590
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,465
just so they could have that documentary.

591
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:09,562
<i>When I got to the
Jaws documentary for the LaserDisc,</i>

592
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:16,123
I felt that I'm gonna try to do a
Bible or some kind of a reference

593
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,664
to that particular movie.
Because how many times

594
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,911
<i>do we get to sit across Steven
Spielberg or Peter Benchley</i>

595
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,668
<i>and the cast members, but you want to get</i>

596
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,403
<i>all of their different perspectives.</i>

597
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,030
<i>And I think for the true fans,</i>

598
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,955
<i>you're just looking at those people</i>

599
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:31,754
<i>as if they were talking to you.</i>

600
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:37,289
<i>I had seen all those pictures of
Brody's son in the arms of the stuntman,</i>

601
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,144
and I always wondered like,
"That's not even in the movie."

602
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:42,027
And yet that picture was
used to promote the picture.

603
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:46,618
And I was always wondering, "What
is that sequence? What is that scene?"

604
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,819
<i>And finding the footage
of that was amazing.</i>

605
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:55,474
<i>Seeing that when the shark
comes into the estuary, it's just a fin.</i>

606
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,296
<i>I thought that was pretty amazing.</i>

607
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,271
<i>Finding that footage of
the building of the shark,</i>

608
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,685
<i>doing all the tests, dry,</i>

609
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,227
<i>and then getting the big surprise
that it doesn't work in water,</i>

610
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,428
I mean, it was just amazing.

611
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:15,163
I felt like I was doing what I
had been sent on Earth to do.

612
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:19,269
To discover all that stuff and
to make sure it was preserved.

613
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:21,753
Because a lot of it, I think that

614
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,238
if there had not been DVDs today,

615
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,139
I think a lot of that
stuff would be totally lost.

616
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:33,550
<i>Always an important step
in advancing public awareness of a movie,</i>

617
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:37,820
<i>both during and after its theatrical
run, is the film's poster design.</i>

618
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,251
<i>And in the case of Jaws,</i>

619
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:44,407
<i>few images have become more
emblazoned on pop culture than this one.</i>

620
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,301
<i>That image is iconic and was responsible</i>

621
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,783
<i>for getting a lot of people
into the theaters to see Jaws.</i>

622
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,473
What kid wouldn't wanna go see that movie?

623
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,159
It's almost like a bullet
before it hits somebody.

624
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,492
<i>And the fact that it leaves
it all to your imagination</i>

625
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,693
<i>is why the poster of Jaws did so well.</i>

626
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:10,073
It conveyed all the emotion
that is aroused by the fear.

627
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,270
And you just got it. The minute
you look at that image, you got it.

628
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:17,906
<i>Jaws' poster is the Bible of how to do it.</i>

629
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,758
That's all you need to know.

630
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:23,327
You don't need to know about
the main characters and their arcs

631
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,622
or anything like that.

632
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,159
Big shark, pretty girl, bad situation.

633
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,519
One of the things that happens
when you do an iconic film

634
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,724
is it becomes a touchstone for
other artists and other comments.

635
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,446
<i>The Jaws artwork became an element</i>

636
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,681
<i>of political cartoons for years.</i>

637
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,691
<i>In fact, the shark and swimmer</i>

638
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,619
<i>were used to represent virtually</i>

639
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,493
<i>every issue in the political spectrum.</i>

640
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,924
<i>And it wasn't just politics
getting in on the action.</i>

641
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,079
<i>Over the years, even up to this day,</i>

642
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,834
<i>the Jaws motif has served as fodder</i>

643
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,547
<i>for a variety of more
off-beat applications.</i>

644
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,416
<i>But what today has
become a pop culture icon,</i>

645
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,046
<i>actually had very humble beginnings.</i>

646
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:37,106
<i>The art of the swimmer
swimming above the great white shark</i>

647
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:40,477
<i>originated on the cover of the paperback</i>

648
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,210
<i>edition of Peter Benchley's novel,</i> Jaws,

649
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,695
published by Bantam Books,

650
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:48,387
and Oscar Dystel, who was
the chairman of the company,

651
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,439
always regretted that he
didn't put… He didn't sell it to us.

652
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,694
He could've sold us the artwork.

653
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:57,539
<i>But he gave it to us as a publicity thing.</i>

654
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,118
<i>So I kid him about it to this day.</i>

655
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:04,971
<i>One name that is not as
well known in the annals of Jaws history</i>

656
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,658
<i>is Roger Kastel, the artist who
created the legendary image.</i>

657
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,438
<i>Kastel was a seasoned paperback</i>

658
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:14,812
<i>and magazine illustrator
working in New York</i>

659
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:17,784
<i>whose skills were increasingly
in demand at the time.</i>

660
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,354
<i>And the assignment
was simply one among many.</i>

661
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:25,883
Oscar Dystel said, "Have
I got a great book for you!

662
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,873
"You'll love it. You can
read it over the weekend."

663
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,113
<i>They felt the hardcover version</i>

664
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,275
<i>wouldn't work on the paperback.</i>

665
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:37,532
<i>I did a very rough sketch
and they said, "That's great.</i>

666
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,691
"Just make the shark realistic and
bigger. Make him very much bigger."

667
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:48,372
<i>I had gone to the Museum of Natural
History, and I had my camera with me</i>

668
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,550
<i>and I said, "Do you have a
shark exhibit in the building?"</i>

669
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,386
<i>And she said, "Yes, they do." But it
was all down and they were refurbishing.</i>

670
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,588
<i>They were cleaning them.</i>

671
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:05,941
All the sharks were laying on easels.

672
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:11,666
They were plaster. And
so, I had my camera with me.

673
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,155
<i>Well, I knew what position
I wanted the shark in,</i>

674
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,164
<i>and this is the great white that
they had laying on a easel being…</i>

675
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:24,930
<i>I guess they were dusting it.
And that's what I worked from.</i>

676
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:30,937
<i>The girl was photographed
in the studio in New York.</i>

677
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,494
<i>She was a great model. I used her
for</i> a <i>Good Housekeeping painting</i>

678
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:40,017
<i>and asked if she would stay
another half hour</i>

679
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:44,396
and just swim for this
paperback. I told her it was Jaws.

680
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,499
I don't think anyone knew
what Jaws was then.

681
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,955
But she was swimming on a stool.

682
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,277
<i>Last summer, I was painting in the studio</i>

683
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:56,829
<i>and my grandson, Luke, came in.</i>

684
00:38:56,935 --> 00:39:02,521
And he says, "Grandpa, did you
ever do a Mona Lisa?"And he's seven.

685
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:06,304
<i>And that really threw me.
And I thought and I said,</i>

686
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:09,255
<i>"I don't think I've done
the Mona</i> Lisa, <i>Luke."</i>

687
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,166
And he said, "Well, the shark
will just have to be your Mona Lisa."

688
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:35,589
I can't…

689
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,319
Did I say it right?

690
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,360
The theme song of Jaws.

691
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,078
That's the first impression
that comes to my mind.

692
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,246
<i>And it just sticks in there.
You know what I mean?</i>

693
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:57,088
I think <i>Jaws</i> was the first film that I did

694
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,993
where I was really crazy about the film.

695
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,713
<i>I thought it was a marvelous film.</i>

696
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,725
<i>I remember the first day I played,</i>

697
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,200
<i>Steven said, "What do
we do for the shark?"</i>

698
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,204
And I just played
an octave E on the piano,

699
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,115
and then E and an F and repeated them

700
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,902
and accelerated them and so on.

701
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,642
And he said something like,
"You think that'll work."

702
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:14,104
"You gotta be kidding.
It's so simple."

703
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,590
All he did was…

704
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:18,109
And Steven said, "That's all?"

705
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,173
And John said, "Yeah, that's it."

706
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,751
<i>Well, I think, John, who's prescient</i>

707
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,652
<i>about all the movies he scores,</i>

708
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,015
<i>he sees deeper than we do
about our own work.</i>

709
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,853
<i>And I think he saw something
deeply primal about Jaws,</i>

710
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,140
and he decided that it
needed a primal response.

711
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:40,819
It needed a primal sound.
Something that was atavistic.

712
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:43,766
Something that was extremely basic.

713
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,559
And something that was unforgettable

714
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,563
and would be almost a kind of a siren

715
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,883
to warn you that something
was coming to get you.

716
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,578
When you associate the image
of that shark coming in for the kill,

717
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,473
and you hear that John Williams score,

718
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,723
It's that perfect storm again.

719
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,527
It's the right image for the right music.

720
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,226
It doesn't happen all the time.

721
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:16,113
<i>But, boy, when it does, you never
forget it for generations, obviously.</i>

722
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:23,709
<i>The Jaws theme was so
provocative and symbolic of the shark</i>

723
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,343
that he saved us, really, because

724
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:30,086
the many times that
we didn't have the shark,

725
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:35,251
all we had to do was point the
camera out to sea and play his score

726
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:36,820
and everybody screamed.

727
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,443
And for half the film you don't
see the shark. You don't have to.

728
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,722
You hear that theme and it puts it,

729
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,534
"Oh, my God, he's out there somewhere

730
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,829
<i>"and he's gonna get somebody."</i>

731
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,314
<i>I just think it was
the most brilliant couple of notes</i>

732
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,619
<i>that he's ever written, because
it's lived beyond the movie.</i>

733
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:52,371
<i>And it's become the thing</i>

734
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,737
<i>that kids do with each other
when they're playing in the pool.</i>

735
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,575
You can always creep up on
somebody and go…

736
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,210
And in the post-Jaws world,
it means something.

737
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,971
In Australia, they use the shark theme

738
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:09,806
as a warning sound on the beaches.

739
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,754
I love that in the loudspeakers.

740
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:19,479
"I'm outta here!" No one would stay
in the water listening to that music.

741
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,722
Every movie after that, whenever
you saw any kind of a monster beast,

742
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:25,771
especially sea stuff like a
shark, octopus, whatever,

743
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:27,975
it was like the pounding…

744
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,494
Don't!

745
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,417
Don't!

746
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,516
That song gives me the creeps.

747
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,772
What do you mean, it's our theme song.

748
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:43,151
It's very flattering. You think,
"Oh, great, whatever I've written

749
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,642
"has made it to that level." That's
one reaction that I think is natural.

750
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:49,797
<i>I'm always pleased about it.</i>

751
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:53,070
<i>The fact that it gets up off the
paper into the orchestra's hands,</i>

752
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,236
<i>out through the microphone
and around the world,</i>

753
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:58,015
back into my own living room,
which is my own studio,

754
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:00,743
where I'll be working
sometimes years later,

755
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:04,806
it's quite a miraculous electronic trip

756
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,209
that composers in preceding centuries

757
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:10,619
would never have had
the pleasure of experiencing,

758
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:14,333
so we're lucky that
film and recorded music

759
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:16,809
and so on has the reach that it does.

760
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:25,142
<i>While the digital effects revolution,</i>

761
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,204
<i>which took hold in the early '90s,</i>

762
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,989
<i>promised to offer filmmakers
tremendous creative freedom,</i>

763
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,527
<i>the legacy of Jaws reminds us that</i>

764
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:35,403
<i>being unable to show everything you want</i>

765
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,571
<i>really can be a blessing in disguise.</i>

766
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:44,571
<i>We've complained about
the shark not being able to perform.</i>

767
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,256
<i>Because it couldn't.
It was never ready.</i>

768
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:52,051
That was what saved us.
That was the artistry of the film.

769
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:56,525
<i>If Jaws never
existed, except in the year 2005,</i>

770
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,747
I would have had the digital tools

771
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,767
to have much more of
the shark in the movie.

772
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:05,082
Therefore, I would have ruined
much more of the movie.

773
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,358
Had we been able to computerize the shark,

774
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:12,360
a lot of the wonderful elements
of the picture, like the barrels,

775
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,342
<i>would never have been thought of.</i>

776
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,131
That was an idea that
came during the production

777
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:21,687
and out of frustration
of not having the shark,

778
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:24,188
we didn't have anything else to shoot.

779
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,044
<i>In the very first scene, with the
girl being pulled back and forth,</i>

780
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:34,532
<i>the shark was supposed to
be there in the picture that time.</i>

781
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,200
<i>We only showed it later,
because we didn't have it earlier.</i>

782
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:46,764
<i>They began Jaws in
the opening scene by not seeing the shark.</i>

783
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:50,595
And I think it was more terrifying.

784
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:54,537
Not seeing something, I
really believe, is more terrifying

785
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,192
<i>'cause visually, you're all right with it.</i>

786
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,923
<i>But if your imagination runs wild,</i>

787
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,230
<i>then it can be anything.</i>

788
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,875
Oh, God, help!

789
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:15,046
<i>I did that because
the shark kept breaking down.</i>

790
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,774
<i>And today, a visual shark
would not break down.</i>

791
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,476
There'd be some nice
interactive water explosions

792
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,633
to marry the digital shark
with the actual water.

793
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:25,832
That's all it would be. There would
not have been a full-size shark.

794
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:31,521
<i>Or probably even any segment
of the shark in a 2005 Jaws today.</i>

795
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,428
<i>And therefore, the film would
have been only half as effective.</i>

796
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:39,698
<i>So I was saved by the breakdown
in technology 30 years ago.</i>

797
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:44,221
I think if I'm correct about this,

798
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:46,659
it was 55 minutes into the movie

799
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:48,855
before you actually saw the shark.

800
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:56,499
<i>One of the things that
makes the picture more believable</i>

801
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,915
is that you can't do many
things with that shark.

802
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:01,973
<i>You have one shark that goes right,</i>

803
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:04,341
<i>one that goes left, and
one that goes straight ahead.</i>

804
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:06,779
<i>Almost made it more believable.</i>

805
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,080
<i>Because you couldn't do
any fancy stuff with it.</i>

806
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,414
And I can't help but
think that filmmakers today

807
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,431
would wanna do a lot more with that shark.

808
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:18,083
In today's movies, everybody's
trying to top themselves,

809
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,422
and they're trying to top others

810
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,541
and they're just trying
to do it bigger and better,

811
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:24,422
and sometimes, bigger
isn't better necessarily.

812
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,276
Sometimes, bigger is too much.

813
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:30,184
It's hard to create something
new that surprises people.

814
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,450
In this day and age,
they've seen so much already.

815
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,905
There's so many movies now.

816
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:35,022
<i>What's great about that, I think,</i>

817
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,924
<i>the expectations for what a movie</i>

818
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,757
<i>could be weren't what they are today.</i>

819
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:43,391
<i>So when a great movie like that came
out back then, it just floored people.</i>

820
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:52,459
I cannot tell you how many
people have come to me and said,

821
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:56,144
"Because of Jaws, I will not
go in the water to this day."

822
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,514
It is staggering.

823
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:59,559
Come on in the water!

824
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,458
Take it easy.

825
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,585
I mean, <i>Jaws</i> essentially did for swimming

826
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:06,407
what the movie Psycho did
for showering in motel rooms.

827
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:08,420
<i>The shower scene in Psycho,</i>

828
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,427
<i>where women especially
weren't taking showers,</i>

829
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,530
I didn't go in the ocean after <i>Jaws.</i>

830
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:17,146
I was at the beach one day
and a woman came over to me,

831
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:20,381
and she had her little child in hand.

832
00:47:20,488 --> 00:47:22,820
He was about five years old,
and he was crying.

833
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,759
And she said, "Are you Steven Spielberg?"

834
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:27,954
And I said, "Yes, I am."

835
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,162
And she began screaming at me
with a very thick New York accent.

836
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:35,032
"You tell him, you tell him
it's safe to go out there.

837
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,065
"You tell him it's safe to go out there.

838
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:39,038
"Look at him, look what
you've done to him."

839
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:42,036
And this kid was crying his eyes
out. And I said, "What happened?"

840
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:43,821
She said, "My husband showed him <i>Jaws</i>

841
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,612
"and now look, he won't go into the water.

842
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,097
"You tell him it's okay. You
tell him it's all make-believe."

843
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,817
And she gave me such a piece
of her mind, I sat the boy down,

844
00:47:51,886 --> 00:47:53,718
I looked him in the eye,
and I couldn't lie to him,

845
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,005
it is dangerous out there.

846
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:59,304
I couldn't just say to him, "Yes, go
out there, go out beyond the waves."

847
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,470
It's all psychological.

848
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:05,425
You yell, "Barracuda!" and
everybody says, "Huh? What?"

849
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,211
You yell, "Shark!"

850
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,517
We've got a panic on our
hands on the Fourth of July.

851
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,845
<i>The structure of Jaws is just so perfect.</i>

852
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:30,016
<i>It just breaks up into
these beautiful acts.</i>

853
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:33,504
And it's like problem, finding the answer,

854
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,888
and then the third act of,
"We're gonna go get the shark."

855
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,982
<i>It's such a beautiful,
mythological structure.</i>

856
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,451
<i>Is this monster about things in them?</i>

857
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,889
Ain't got no spit.

858
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,588
As all great storytelling
is that the characters

859
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,236
learn something about themselves,

860
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:54,725
their phobias, the things
that they're lacking.

861
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:58,481
Why are they chasing
this thing, the white whale?

862
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:02,318
<i>It's Melville, it's Hemingway,</i>

863
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:04,881
<i>it's the ancient prophet, Jonah.</i>

864
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,803
<i>These are the mythological parallels</i>

865
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:10,859
that bubble up from below
the surface in Jaws

866
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:13,081
that make it a timeless classic,

867
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:17,872
that make it last long after the
technological aspects of the film

868
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:19,349
are old hat.

869
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,269
<i>It's a very classic,
hero's journey kind of a story.</i>

870
00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:28,077
<i>If you subscribe to the
mythmaking nature of screenwriting,</i>

871
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,249
it has all the ingredients that are not

872
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,311
culturally specific
to a generation's views.

873
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,159
It's not Depression-America,
it's not Vietnam-America.

874
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:46,016
<i>It's a little timeless island with only
the human values of fear, jealousy,</i>

875
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,967
<i>or heroism or shark obsession.</i>

876
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,563
Part of what succeeds about <i>Jaws</i>

877
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,108
is the simplicity of
the way the story was told.

878
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,533
<i>And the fact that it's
just three men and a boat,</i>

879
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,590
<i>when you come right down to it,</i>

880
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:02,792
<i>three survivors who all have
problems with each other.</i>

881
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:06,481
You got city hands,
Mr. Hooper.

882
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:08,454
You been counting money all your life.

883
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:12,015
I don't need this. I don't need
this working-class-hero crap.

884
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,606
They have huge, personal
issues with each other.

885
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,556
But those are all cast aside as
they have to become partners

886
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,594
in order to help each other live

887
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,567
and get through the experience.

888
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:26,055
And the shark becomes less
important than those three characters.

889
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,256
<i>And I have to give Peter
Benchley total credit for that.</i>

890
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,359
<i>That was in the book.</i>

891
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:32,772
<i>The characters in
Jaws are composites. All of them are.</i>

892
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:36,058
I, in Jaws, am two people.

893
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,983
I am Hooper from the
environmental point of view,

894
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,350
<i>I am the guy who says,</i>

895
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:42,799
<i>"He doesn't wanna hurt you,
he just wants to eat you."</i>

896
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,786
<i>On the other hand, I'm
also the character of Brody,</i>

897
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:48,885
in that every book I've written
has been an everyman kind of book,

898
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:54,549
of what would happen if a normal
Joe gets himself into a position

899
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,286
that is way beyond his capacity to handle.

900
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,755
And here's Brody who doesn't swim,

901
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:02,084
<i>who's never been in the ocean in his life,</i>

902
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:03,974
<i>who's a retired New York City policeman,</i>

903
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:06,376
<i>who's out in the boondocks and suddenly,</i>

904
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:08,779
<i>he's cast into having to be a seaman.</i>

905
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,865
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

906
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:15,820
After watching a stumblebum like Brody

907
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:18,881
save his neck by just doing

908
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,462
what almost anybody would
do in that situation,

909
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,775
<i>you get a gun, you get out of the boat,</i>

910
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,043
<i>you try to save yourself,
you get up on the mast,</i>

911
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,892
<i>you shoot the thing.
You do what you have to do.</i>

912
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,517
<i>So much so that you
feel like you have done it.</i>

913
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,671
<i>Everybody sitting in the audience did it,</i>

914
00:51:34,742 --> 00:51:36,756
<i>because I certainly did not show</i>

915
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:40,439
any courageous aspect
of myself up till that point.

916
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:42,798
And the characters drive you so forward

917
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,427
that by the time the
shark is flapping its mouth,

918
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:47,800
jumping onto the boat,

919
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,022
all you can think of is, "Quint,

920
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,706
"get your feet away from its mouth.

921
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,859
"Just kick it. Get it away.
Stab it, get it away.

922
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:58,444
"Oh, no, no,
no, no, no. Ah! Shit!"

923
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,187
<i>You've got the
family unit in the first half of the film,</i>

924
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:07,241
where Brody has a very, very
personable family that you just,

925
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:09,140
right away you love them when
they wake up in the morning,

926
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,233
and you're there with them.

927
00:52:10,411 --> 00:52:14,393
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."

928
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:18,346
How's that?

929
00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:19,534
Like you're from New York.

930
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,904
I always said that the characters in
the movie reminded me of relatives.

931
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:26,272
That's how… I felt I knew them.

932
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,256
He had such a great handle

933
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:34,951
on depicting suburban, middle
class, everyday American life.

934
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:37,953
And what he put up there
was almost documentary-like.

935
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:39,864
<i>I mean, it was just so real.</i>

936
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:44,344
<i>One of the things that Jaws did</i>

937
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:46,920
<i>that I wish movies still did more of</i>

938
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:50,808
is invade a community and
use actual locals in the movie.

939
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:53,546
<i>It brings the movie to
life in such a real</i> way.

940
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:58,087
<i>Islander, Lee Fierro, who portrayed</i>

941
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,354
<i>the grieving mother
of doomed Alex Kintner,</i>

942
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,291
<i>still lives on the Vineyard today.</i>

943
00:53:02,363 --> 00:53:05,822
<i>Her now infamous confrontation
scene with Chief Martin Brody</i>

944
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:09,142
<i>has become a favorite sequence
among Jaws fans.</i>

945
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,251
Chief Brody?

946
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:12,352
Yes?

947
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,139
<i>It's been accurately recorded that</i>

948
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:17,109
<i>she had to slap the chief many, many times</i>

949
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:19,271
<i>in order to get just the right take.</i>

950
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:23,311
<i>Little did she know then that
her slapping days had just begun.</i>

951
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,732
<i>How many times
have I been asked to slap somebody?</i>

952
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,658
I've never counted them
and so I can't tell you.

953
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:38,190
But it happens a lot
and it is mostly young men.

954
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:47,233
I do it to please the fans, but
last year, I decided that is it.

955
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,776
I've slapped my last slap.

956
00:53:51,512 --> 00:53:54,129
<i>Meeting Steve Spielberg
was a wonderful memory.</i>

957
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:58,346
He asked me if I could
improvise and I said, "Yes, I can."

958
00:53:58,419 --> 00:54:03,186
And so we did… Shari Rhodes,
the casting director, and I

959
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:07,785
improvised the beach scene,
but I had simply been told

960
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:11,041
<i>keep my son out of the water,
so that's what I was doing.</i>

961
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:14,266
And Steve stopped me and said, "Lee,

962
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,266
"you gotta let him go in the
water or we don't have a movie."

963
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:26,540
They had a raft that was cut in
half, and they take my raft away

964
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:28,331
and they put this half a raft over this.

965
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,026
It was like that round
that they filled up with blood

966
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,069
<i>and all this stuff. He goes,</i>

967
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,036
<i>"Now, lie on the half
a raft on top of this,</i>

968
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:38,552
<i>"it's gonna blow up. When
it blows up, go underwater</i>

969
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:41,454
"and stay under there as long as you can."

970
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:44,537
So you're 12 years old, lying
on this and they're saying,

971
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:46,565
<i>"It's full of blood." They're
saying, "It's gonna blow up."</i>

972
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:49,762
<i>And it's like I'm lying there and all
of a sudden…</i>

973
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:51,987
<i>This thing blows up, and there's blood</i>

974
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:54,137
<i>going up all over the place in your face</i>

975
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,109
<i>and I just went under water and I hear,</i>

976
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,374
"Cut. Okay, your leg was out
of the water," and they had to…

977
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:04,691
It took over an hour for all the
blood to clear out of the water

978
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,429
before they could do it again.

979
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:09,734
<i>I'd get to go inside one of
these warm little dressing rooms.</i>

980
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:13,056
<i>My friends were all freezing
cold outside, but I screwed up</i>

981
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,595
<i>so I get to go stay warm.</i>

982
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:19,840
<i>And after about four times of
doing this, they finally said, "No.</i>

983
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:21,844
<i>"We're gonna try this a different way."</i>

984
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,336
And if you noticed in the movie,

985
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,969
I go up and down 'cause these
guys in the wet suits started…

986
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,271
They grabbed me and they were
pulling me under, lifting me up,

987
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:32,608
<i>and then they pulled me under
and gave me their air.</i>

988
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,757
And that's how they finally did it.

989
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:38,665
They gave up on a 12-year-old

990
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,888
<i>For the insert shot
needed of Bruce biting down on little Alex,</i>

991
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:48,605
<i>the dangers of interacting with
a multi-ton mechanical shark</i>

992
00:55:48,695 --> 00:55:52,097
<i>required that Jeffrey be
replaced with a stunt double.</i>

993
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:56,580
<i>In this case, a common store
mannequin. And a female one at that.</i>

994
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,618
<i>It was to be one of the very
last shots done on the Vineyard.</i>

995
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:04,053
<i>Steven Spielberg had
already departed the island.</i>

996
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,004
<i>And filming was left in the capable hands</i>

997
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,956
<i>of Joe Alves in the second unit.</i>

998
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:15,483
<i>In true Jaws fashion, the scene
proved extremely difficult to coordinate.</i>

999
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,641
<i>But in the end, the shot
would provide audiences</i>

1000
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:22,457
<i>with the now famous
frightening first glimpse of Bruce.</i>

1001
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:31,031
Your folks were born here, right?

1002
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:32,230
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

1003
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,400
<i>Vineyard native, Jonathan Filley,</i>

1004
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,568
<i>who played Tom Cassidy in the film,</i>

1005
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,823
<i>parleyed his one and only acting job</i>

1006
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:42,024
<i>into a solid career in the
motion picture industry.</i>

1007
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,057
<i>I had done a lot of acting in high school</i>

1008
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,415
<i>and really thought that I wanted
to pursue an acting career,</i>

1009
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,783
<i>and there I was on the Vineyard</i>

1010
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,472
<i>and saw an ad in the paper
that they wanted extras for Jaws.</i>

1011
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,933
So I sent in a snapshot of me at the beach

1012
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,842
the summer before with some friends,

1013
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:58,916
and I think I circled that,
"That's me," and they cast me.

1014
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:02,276
<i>There was so much stuff that
they didn't need that was shot.</i>

1015
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:04,013
<i>I was in and out of the production</i>

1016
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,089
<i>and around it quite a bit.
There's a piece in the picture</i>

1017
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,222
<i>where this guy is
complaining to the chief that,</i>

1018
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:11,226
<i>"Chief, the kids are
karate-chopping my fences,"</i>

1019
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,774
<i>but, yeah, of course, they
didn't need the actual coverage</i>

1020
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,144
<i>of the kids karate-chopping fences.</i>

1021
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,765
<i>And what I really
cherish about this movie,</i>

1022
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,384
<i>having grown up on Chappaquiddick,</i>

1023
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:24,504
is that wonderful scene
where they come over

1024
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,076
on the Chappaquiddick ferry

1025
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,503
and the guy running the ferry
is this old fellow, Dick Huard,

1026
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,206
<i>who passed away 15 years, 20 years ago.</i>

1027
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,943
<i>And Dick was an integral part
of my childhood.</i>

1028
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,828
And just seeing Dick, it
brings back so many memories.

1029
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,625
<i>For some fans, no pilgrimage to Amity</i>

1030
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,090
<i>is complete without looking up some</i>

1031
00:57:43,176 --> 00:57:45,577
<i>of the many un-credited Vineyard residents</i>

1032
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:47,159
<i>who make appearances in the film,</i>

1033
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:49,813
<i>regardless of how miniscule their parts.</i>

1034
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:55,746
Richard Dreyfuss yells at me,
"Ahoy, sloop, you got a paddle?"

1035
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,096
And I say, "Yeah, I got a paddle."

1036
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:58,274
You got a paddle on the boat?

1037
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,291
I got a paddle.

1038
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,184
And that was my one big line.

1039
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,654
I quit, Mr. Quint. I quit.

1040
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:08,958
<i>My part was Quint's
mate. There was a boat named</i> Skip Bucket

1041
00:58:09,036 --> 00:58:11,516
<i>that had all the camera crew
who were coming home.</i>

1042
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:15,724
Spielberg says, "Will you do
me a favor?" And I said, "I'll try to."

1043
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,136
And he says, "Will you take up
a speaking part with the dog?"

1044
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:19,211
And I said, "Yes."

1045
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,900
<i>So, I went to get cleaned up a little bit,</i>

1046
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,049
<i>and they told me I had to get dirty again,</i>

1047
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:30,369
so I couldn't shave anymore.

1048
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:33,766
<i>I'm Henry Carreiro,</i>

1049
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,685
<i>I was one of the two guys</i>

1050
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,269
that claim we caught this tiger shark,

1051
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:39,895
which was shot right on this spot.

1052
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,594
And, of course, it turned out
to be the wrong shark.

1053
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:46,219
<i>Right in this area, we had a
shark here hanging by the tail,</i>

1054
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:50,874
<i>which was a real one that
we were told cost $10,000,</i>

1055
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:55,028
<i>to have it caught off Florida
and flown up here special in a box.</i>

1056
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,274
<i>And they called him Oscar.</i>

1057
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,250
They got a lot of use out of that thing.

1058
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:00,770
But the smell!

1059
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,817
<i>That tiger shark really got ripe.</i>

1060
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,917
<i>I didn't know who, Dick, my partner
was, till I met him that morning.</i>

1061
00:59:07,994 --> 00:59:09,234
<i>We hit it off very well.</i>

1062
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:12,145
He's funny, he's a
character in his own right.

1063
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:15,219
I immediately just clicked with this guy,

1064
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:19,887
and we started cracking each
other up and making jokes.

1065
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:23,518
Henry is a very, very quick
fellow. And he ad libs very well.

1066
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:25,789
We played very well off of one another.

1067
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,044
Gentlemen, the officer
asked me to tell you

1068
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:30,106
that you're overloading that boat!

1069
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,941
Go on, get out of here.

1070
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:34,897
Dreyfuss, he said, "Where's a
good restaurant around here?"

1071
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:36,063
Whatever his line was.

1072
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,904
And I turned around and I
said, "Go straight ahead."

1073
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,806
Big laugh,
right. Yeah. Yeah.

1074
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,027
And he left it in.

1075
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:46,399
Can you tell me if there's a good
restaurant or hotel on the island?

1076
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,343
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

1077
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,219
They're all going to die.

1078
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:53,873
<i>Spielberg said, "Just
say what comes into your head."</i>

1079
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,753
You stuff your frigging
head in there, man,

1080
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,554
and find out if it's a man-eater.

1081
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,560
<i>We had this guy who did an article</i>

1082
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,496
<i>in the local paper on Cape Cod.</i>

1083
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:04,630
And he talked to Shari Rhodes and he said,

1084
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:08,177
"Boy, you must have an
Abbott and Costello going here."

1085
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:10,235
She says, "No, I just have two Costellos."

1086
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,741
It's got a deep throat, Frank.

1087
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,503
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

1088
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:15,204
Tiger shark.

1089
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,108
A what?

1090
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:20,482
<i>There's one guy
that pesters the hell out of me,</i>

1091
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:25,169
every time he sees me, he walks
up behind me and says, "A what?"

1092
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,734
That's probably going to be

1093
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:29,526
<i>the most famous thing
I've ever said in my life.</i>

1094
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:30,888
A what?

1095
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:34,690
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.

1096
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,431
<i>Then 12-year-old Chris Rebello,</i>

1097
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,811
<i>who played Chief Brody's
elder son, Michael,</i>

1098
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:42,133
<i>remained on the Vineyard</i>

1099
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,142
<i>until his untimely passing from
a heart attack in the year 2000.</i>

1100
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:50,880
<i>Chris was a friend.
We grew up together on the island.</i>

1101
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,612
Working with Chris in the movie,

1102
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:57,130
he was a brother,
another brother to my family.

1103
01:00:57,204 --> 01:01:00,686
<i>On set, we used to fool around and play,</i>

1104
01:01:00,774 --> 01:01:03,618
<i>sometimes Steven would say,
"Okay, that's enough.</i>

1105
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,162
<i>"It's time to get back to
work. Let's do our thing."</i>

1106
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:09,107
<i>And after the movie was done,
he didn't do any more acting.</i>

1107
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:10,843
<i>He went on to work
for the Steamship Authority</i>

1108
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:12,459
<i>with my brother, Tommy.</i>

1109
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:15,311
And that's where he worked
until his passing.

1110
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,209
<i>We really miss him.
We really miss him.</i>

1111
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:29,058
<i>Perhaps no islander gained
more notoriety for his involvement in Jaws</i>

1112
01:01:29,135 --> 01:01:31,035
<i>than the late Craig Kings bury.</i>

1113
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:33,601
<i>Craig's gruff and blustery demeanor</i>

1114
01:01:33,673 --> 01:01:36,392
<i>had made him a local legend
in his own right.</i>

1115
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:41,192
<i>And his portrayal of fisherman Ben
Gardner, a favorite among Jaws fans.</i>

1116
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:46,759
<i>They advertised for
some person who was a fisherman, a local,</i>

1117
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,715
<i>who could help Robert Shaw
with his accent.</i>

1118
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:53,771
<i>Robert was a refined British
actor until he met my father,</i>

1119
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,471
<i>and then my father told him stories about</i>

1120
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,140
<i>this island and the people that live here,</i>

1121
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:03,300
and, unfortunately, I think
Robert Shaw believed them.

1122
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,271
He fell hook, line and sinker,
and he began to repeat them.

1123
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,267
<i>He was interviewed on the air,</i>

1124
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,383
<i>telling these totally outrageous stories</i>

1125
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,854
<i>about the local community.</i>

1126
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,043
…the rich people here.

1127
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:15,389
There's a lot of skeletons in
the cupboard here, you know.

1128
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,530
There's more incest going on
in Martha's Vineyard

1129
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:21,286
than probably any state
in the United States.

1130
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:24,898
They were mostly lies, which
is what my father was best at.

1131
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,758
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers…

1132
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:32,407
My mother, when I took her
to see the movie in Boston,

1133
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,547
we came out of the theater and she said,

1134
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,665
<i>"That Spielberg, he's a genius.</i>

1135
01:02:36,736 --> 01:02:40,548
<i>"Finally, somebody has found a
use for your father's empty head."</i>

1136
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:45,026
<i>Of course, Craig's most
memorable scene did involve his head,</i>

1137
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,627
<i>but not the rest of him.</i>

1138
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,028
<i>In fact, it didn't even
take place at the Vineyard.</i>

1139
01:02:49,215 --> 01:02:52,560
<i>Three thousand miles away
in Van Nuys, California,</i>

1140
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:55,195
<i>Spielberg resourcefully created that</i>

1141
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,831
<i>most shocking moment as an insert shot,</i>

1142
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:01,204
<i>and he used little more than
a foam life-cast of Kings bury</i>

1143
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:02,642
<i>and a swimming pool.</i>

1144
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:05,643
<i>Steven had just
come from the answer print with Verna</i>

1145
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:07,899
at Universal and had signed off on it,

1146
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:10,551
and here we were on that very eve,

1147
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:14,454
doing an extra shot that we were
gonna try to get in the next day.

1148
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,316
That scene had already been shot.

1149
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:18,655
<i>But it wasn't done to shock the audience,</i>

1150
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:20,105
<i>and so I went to Verna Fields',</i>

1151
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,454
<i>my film editor's swimming pool,</i>

1152
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,448
borrowed her pool,
'cause I didn't have one,

1153
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:25,541
I didn't have enough money to
have a swimming pool in those days,

1154
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,029
because <i>Jaws</i> hadn't come out yet,

1155
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,514
and I was a poor director then.

1156
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:31,403
We had a small replica of a hull

1157
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,840
that I put together
in Joe Alves' driveway.

1158
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,305
<i>And I basically held my breath underwater</i>

1159
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:39,474
and put the head of Ben
Gardner through that hull

1160
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,978
when Frankie Sparks came up
with the flashlight.

1161
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:50,199
<i>I remember, I timed it
to get maximum shock effect.</i>

1162
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,157
<i>This is the pool where Steven Spielberg</i>

1163
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,326
<i>filmed the Ben Gardner sequence.</i>

1164
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,154
And that was done right here.
Very famous.

1165
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:04,236
Scary. Scary moment.

1166
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,867
<i>What was the most
satisfying edit you did in</i> Jaws?

1167
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,440
The most satisfying edit, I have to say,

1168
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,594
was the face coming out of the boat.

1169
01:04:11,664 --> 01:04:13,154
Because when I went to that preview,

1170
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:15,884
and that audience just
went six feet off their seats

1171
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:20,623
and let out this incredible
scream, that was really satisfying.

1172
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:24,433
When we found this place, it was
still full of her reels just sitting there,

1173
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,412
<i>but it was amazing treasure to find.</i>

1174
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:31,663
These are some footlockers
that we found at the house.

1175
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:35,204
These came back from Martha's
Vineyard, from the shoot there,

1176
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:39,105
and as you can see, "Verna
Fields, editorial <i>Jaws, "</i>

1177
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,007
on the cover of this one.

1178
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,637
And inside, there are several film reels

1179
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:47,308
of Verna's work still
kept in these boxes here.

1180
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,682
This is full of different
films that she made.

1181
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:53,999
Yeah, she had set up
her editing facility here

1182
01:04:54,074 --> 01:04:57,806
<i>and edited all of her films
in this building right here.</i>

1183
01:04:57,911 --> 01:05:00,380
<i>It's kind of cool
that this humble, simple room</i>

1184
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,974
<i>is where one of the greatest
movies ever was put together.</i>

1185
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:05,968
What are we looking for?

1186
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,764
We're looking for a nice place to show

1187
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:10,533
that Quint refuses to slow down the boat.

1188
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:17,680
And here we have the Moviola
that Verna Fields used to edit Jaws.

1189
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:21,558
Every second of the Jaws film
passed through this machine

1190
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:24,353
by the hands of Verna Fields.
That's special.

1191
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:28,413
Doesn't look very pretty now,
but maybe someday, it will again.

1192
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,511
<i>Verna and I worked in her pool house</i>

1193
01:05:31,578 --> 01:05:34,354
<i>shoulder to shoulder for a
long time on that Moviola.</i>

1194
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:37,940
And Verna did a great job
with her biorhythms.

1195
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:42,796
Creating a biorhythm for Jaws that
was just the right kind of tautness,

1196
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:45,750
like a violin string to play
a very, very high note.

1197
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,443
It can't take that much pressure.

1198
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,491
That's the spot, Steve.

1199
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,534
<i>My husband tells me you're in sharks.</i>

1200
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:07,655
Excuse me. Yes. I've never
heard it quite put that way.

1201
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,141
But yes, I am.

1202
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:10,710
I love sharks.

1203
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:12,459
<i>Yeah, I love them.</i>

1204
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:17,769
<i>I think the fascination
with sharks comes from many things.</i>

1205
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:21,402
<i>One, they are the last surviving predator</i>

1206
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,503
<i>that poses a genuine threat to man</i>

1207
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,561
<i>in an environment
in which he chooses to go.</i>

1208
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:32,219
E. O. Wilson said, "We
don't just fear our predators,

1209
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,023
"we are transfixed by them."

1210
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,838
<i>Prone to weave stories and fables</i>

1211
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:42,109
<i>because fascination breeds
preparedness, and preparedness, survival.</i>

1212
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:46,402
<i>In a deeply tribal sense, he
said, "We love our monsters."</i>

1213
01:06:48,488 --> 01:06:53,221
<i>I believe that worldwide, young
children, all male children at least,</i>

1214
01:06:53,326 --> 01:06:56,193
<i>have a fascination with
either sharks or dinosaurs.</i>

1215
01:06:56,296 --> 01:06:57,878
Very big shark.

1216
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,823
<i>And in my case, I was
able to grow up around here</i>

1217
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,960
<i>in Nantucket where
sharks were in proliferation.</i>

1218
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,421
<i>So I was able to fix my
fascination on sharks.</i>

1219
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,462
<i>One couple whose fixed fascination</i>

1220
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:17,194
<i>led to their preeminence in the
field of great white shark research</i>

1221
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:21,534
<i>was husband and wife team
Ron and Valerie Taylor of Australia.</i>

1222
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:25,106
<i>Their combined experience
throughout the '60s and '70s</i>

1223
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,688
<i>documenting these elusive animals</i>

1224
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,128
<i>made them the perfect fit
for the Jaws creative team.</i>

1225
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:34,007
<i>They were commissioned
to shoot live shark footage</i>

1226
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,428
<i>for the picture's climactic cage sequence.</i>

1227
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:40,063
<i>The assignment would prove
to be almost as harrowing</i>

1228
01:07:40,173 --> 01:07:41,720
<i>as anything in the film itself.</i>

1229
01:07:42,909 --> 01:07:44,399
<i>I told them that there's a problem,</i>

1230
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:48,806
because our sharks on average
are only about 13 feet in length,

1231
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:52,328
and yet your mechanical shark
is 26 feet in length.

1232
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,018
And they said, "Well, there's no problem.

1233
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:57,915
"We'll send you a small man
and small cages."

1234
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:03,625
We built a scaled down cage, and
we tried a dummy and that didn't work,

1235
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:08,725
so we found a small person that
said that they could scuba dive.

1236
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,395
<i>Carl wasn't an experienced diver.</i>

1237
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:15,633
<i>So we gave him an introduction to
diving just down on the waterfront</i>

1238
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:18,427
<i>and took him out to Dangerous Reef.</i>

1239
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:23,332
<i>And when he saw his first great
white shark, he was terrified.</i>

1240
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:27,478
But to give him his credit, Carl
actually did get into the cage

1241
01:08:27,587 --> 01:08:30,534
with these great, big, dangerous looking

1242
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,950
<i>great white sharks swimming around.</i>

1243
01:08:32,058 --> 01:08:35,005
<i>Dangerous looking because we
had put a lot of bait in the water</i>

1244
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,024
<i>to attract them to our cages.</i>

1245
01:08:38,498 --> 01:08:41,183
Joe Alves came into my office one day

1246
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,811
with his hand behind his back and
he said, "Bill, we've screwed up."

1247
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,869
And he held up the tanks
that had been miniaturized.

1248
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:52,878
He said, "That little guy
only has eight minutes of air."

1249
01:08:53,146 --> 01:08:54,557
What we were not thinking

1250
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:59,296
is that a small person still sucks
up as much air as a large person,

1251
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,417
and the tanks were very small.

1252
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:03,740
So, immediately, when he sort of panicked,

1253
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,685
<i>he sucked up all the air out of the tank.</i>

1254
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:10,252
<i>Carl was very
reluctant. He was afraid. Very afraid.</i>

1255
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:14,573
The production manager was
calling out to him to get in the cage,

1256
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,804
and he was very slow about it,
and just as he was about to climb in,

1257
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,647
a <i>large shark tried to swim over it</i>

1258
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,438
<i>and got its head stuck in the bridle,</i>

1259
01:09:24,544 --> 01:09:28,128
<i>and of course, it was
trapped and it went crazy.</i>

1260
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:31,599
<i>And the tail went into the
back part of the little boat</i>

1261
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,399
<i>and tore out all the hydraulic cables</i>

1262
01:09:34,487 --> 01:09:37,184
that took fuel and fluid to the motors.

1263
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:40,191
And it started to run across
the deck, and as it did that,

1264
01:09:40,293 --> 01:09:43,627
<i>the tail flicked Carl's</i> face.

1265
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,461
<i>And Carl just stood there,
and he looked up and he said,</i>

1266
01:09:46,566 --> 01:09:51,367
"Is that my blood?" And it
was actually the hydraulic fluid.

1267
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:53,667
And we never got him in the water again.

1268
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,938
<i>If Carl had been in that
cage, he would have lost his life.</i>

1269
01:09:59,045 --> 01:10:02,629
There wasn't much I
could've done to get over there.

1270
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,997
The shark was still tangled,
and thrashing around

1271
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,912
<i>and tangled in the cage on the bottom.</i>

1272
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:10,314
<i>Carl would have been in there and drowned.</i>

1273
01:10:10,423 --> 01:10:12,790
<i>So his reluctance saved his life.</i>

1274
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:22,127
1,100 men went into the water.

1275
01:10:22,235 --> 01:10:24,397
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

1276
01:10:26,606 --> 01:10:30,292
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour. Tiger…

1277
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,600
<i>A very little credited writer who made</i>

1278
01:10:32,712 --> 01:10:34,191
<i>the biggest breakthrough on</i> Jaws,

1279
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,777
<i>which was a writer named Howard Sackler,</i>

1280
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:39,978
<i>whose idea it was to give
Quint the Indianapolis speech,</i>

1281
01:10:40,086 --> 01:10:42,828
even though it was John
Milius who wrote the speech,

1282
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,624
I mean, Howard Sackler wrote
like two paragraphs this big,

1283
01:10:45,725 --> 01:10:50,470
<i>John Milius wrote a nine page
monologue for Quint to say.</i>

1284
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:53,112
<i>And then when Robert Shaw,
who himself was a writer,</i>

1285
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,067
<i>of The Man in the</i> Glass <i>Booth
read Milius' 10 pages,</i>

1286
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,901
he says, "I can't go on for 10, 15 minutes

1287
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,748
"just talking.
Let me have a crack at it."

1288
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:07,757
Shaw took the speech and
himself edited it down to five pages.

1289
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,646
And that was the whole evolution
of how that speech was told,

1290
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,549
but it did come from the mind
of Howard Sackler,

1291
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:15,917
who remembered the actual
Indianapolis incident

1292
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,535
and suggested that Quint…

1293
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,292
That that become a Rosetta
stone for Quint's entire character.

1294
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:22,612
Steven said, "Oh, my God."

1295
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:27,366
That's the whole impetus,
that's the whole spine of Quint.

1296
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:33,918
He's not really just crazy, but he
has a case out for these sharks.

1297
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,038
You know, by the end of that first dawn…

1298
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,519
we lost 100 men.

1299
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,640
I don't know how many
sharks. Maybe 1,000.

1300
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,384
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

1301
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:51,390
<i>The USS Indianapolis was top
secret when Peter wrote the book.</i>

1302
01:11:51,491 --> 01:11:55,906
So it wasn't in it. He
would've used it, I think.

1303
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,288
And then, before the making of the film,

1304
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,657
it had been unclassified
and Steven used it.

1305
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,232
<i>The world learned of the
USS Indianapolis through Jaws</i>

1306
01:12:04,337 --> 01:12:09,025
<i>and it was a perfectly accurate
depiction insofar as I know.</i>

1307
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:12,607
<i>Peter's domestic housekeeper
called in the day after the movie opened</i>

1308
01:12:12,712 --> 01:12:16,444
and she said that she wasn't
coming in to work the next day.

1309
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:17,983
And when he said, "Why," she said,

1310
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,246
<i>"My son was on the USS Indianapolis,</i>

1311
01:12:20,353 --> 01:12:22,447
"and I never knew how he died until now."

1312
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:28,209
He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.

1313
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,141
<i>The U. S.
naval cruiser which delivered</i>

1314
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:35,264
<i>the atomic bomb used on Hiroshima</i>

1315
01:12:35,368 --> 01:12:36,802
<i>completed her mission,</i>

1316
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:39,736
<i>but was then sunk by a Japanese submarine.</i>

1317
01:12:41,307 --> 01:12:45,687
<i>Out of her complement
of 1,196 sailors and Marines,</i>

1318
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,742
<i>an estimated 300 died upon impact.</i>

1319
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:52,183
<i>And the rest spent five days
in shark infested waters</i>

1320
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,117
<i>before they were finally rescued.</i>

1321
01:12:55,655 --> 01:12:58,920
<i>Only 317 survived.</i>

1322
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:05,290
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

1323
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:14,132
<i>Robert was a pretty Promethean
character. Truly bigger than life.</i>

1324
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,199
<i>A man who intimidated me, who scared me,</i>

1325
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:22,361
who exhilarated me, and I
liked him and I hated him and…

1326
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:29,389
He had my number. He could
get me and he always did.

1327
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:32,635
He really thought Dreyfuss
needed a slapping down.

1328
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,758
Young punk with no stage experience.

1329
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:39,588
He made me doubt that I
could do things I knew I could do,

1330
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:45,388
like one day he said, "You
couldn't dive off the top of the Orca."

1331
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,453
"Yes, I can."
"No, you couldn't."

1332
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:52,543
"Can do." And I couldn't.

1333
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,864
Shaw would say, "Look at you, Dreyfuss.

1334
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:59,141
"You eat, you drink,
you're fat and you're sloppy.

1335
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:02,421
"At your age, it's criminal.

1336
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:05,452
"You couldn't even do 10 good push-ups."

1337
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:08,383
He'd say, "I can do 20."

1338
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:12,758
And Shaw would say, "You
can do 20 good push-ups?"

1339
01:14:13,466 --> 01:14:15,730
<i>He'd say, "Okay, Roy, you're the referee.</i>

1340
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:20,636
"Tomorrow morning, we're
gonna see if Dreyfuss can do 20…"

1341
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,003
As soon as Shaw left, I said,

1342
01:14:22,108 --> 01:14:27,057
"Dreyfuss, you know how many
people can do 20 good push-ups?

1343
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:28,697
"You are not one of them."

1344
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,426
Couldn't do it. He psyched me

1345
01:14:32,118 --> 01:14:35,804
and because he psyched me,
I was always like on guard.

1346
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:40,823
But I also really worshipped
him as Robert Shaw.

1347
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:45,564
<i>He was a grand artist as an
actor, he was a wonderful writer.</i>

1348
01:14:45,665 --> 01:14:49,192
<i>I think, in those years, I was very
much appreciative of those things.</i>

1349
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:54,553
And had circumstances been different,

1350
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,399
we might have worked together again.

1351
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:02,710
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1352
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:06,774
<i>Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain</i>

1353
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:11,772
<i>On August 28th, 1978, at the age of 51,</i>

1354
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:16,859
<i>Robert Shaw died from a heart
attack. But his legacy lives on.</i>

1355
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,222
<i>His now mythic portrayal of Quint</i>

1356
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,579
<i>continues to be remembered by celebrities…</i>

1357
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:26,486
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1358
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,737
<i>…and fans alike.</i>

1359
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,738
Ho open you idiot,
starboard! Ain't you watching it!

1360
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,387
Bad fish.

1361
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,448
Not like going down to the pond

1362
01:15:36,549 --> 01:15:38,426
and chasing bluegills or Tommy cods.

1363
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,868
This shark, swallow you whole.

1364
01:15:42,722 --> 01:15:45,669
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

1365
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,083
ladies and gentlemen.

1366
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,808
<i>Commemorations of
the film's central characters and scenes</i>

1367
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,569
<i>show up in the fine arts, as well.</i>

1368
01:15:57,837 --> 01:16:01,523
<i>Exquisite depictions from
sculptors, painters, craftsmen,</i>

1369
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,615
<i>all fans from around the globe,</i>

1370
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:06,206
<i>reflect the creative
excellence of the film itself.</i>

1371
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:18,585
<i>I have</i> a <i>tremendous
appreciation for fans of Jaws</i>

1372
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:21,272
<i>that understand it even better than I do.</i>

1373
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:23,387
<i>That have spent more time with it.</i>

1374
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:27,376
<i>Having sites out there like Jawsmovie.com,</i>

1375
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,181
<i>it confirms your identity to a generation</i>

1376
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,755
that doesn't believe anything
is real if it's not on the net.

1377
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:36,338
<i>I love and
appreciate the fact that the fans get it,</i>

1378
01:16:36,442 --> 01:16:40,857
<i>and not only get it as
a cultural phenomenon,</i>

1379
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,298
but they get the ingredients, and
how the ingredients were mixed

1380
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,199
and how they were combined
to fashion this entertainment.

1381
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,512
And I really love the fans
for being so insightful.

1382
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:59,631
<i>At this time, I'd like to
present the key to the town of Amity</i>

1383
01:16:59,799 --> 01:17:01,164
<i>to Mr. Peter Benchley.</i>

1384
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:08,333
<i>It was amazing to me
to discover what JAWSFEST became.</i>

1385
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,337
When I first heard about it,
I thought it was gonna be

1386
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:14,545
some rinky-dink gimmick by the Chamber
of Commerce of Martha's Vineyard,

1387
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,809
and they did it so well,

1388
01:17:17,016 --> 01:17:20,964
<i>it brought, I guess, 2,000, 3,000
people from all over the world.</i>

1389
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,164
<i>I was enormously impressed.</i>

1390
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,980
<i>This is the first time</i>

1391
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,872
<i>we've all been standing together,</i>

1392
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:29,826
<i>and that includes the making
of the movie 30 years ago.</i>

1393
01:17:29,929 --> 01:17:31,545
<i>There was no wrap party.</i>

1394
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:35,915
<i>We never were all in the same
place at the same time, until now.</i>

1395
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:39,000
<i>So this is a more historic
moment than you can imagine,</i>

1396
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,396
<i>and we thank you for it.</i>

1397
01:17:40,506 --> 01:17:41,769
<i>So much interest in this movie,</i>

1398
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:44,741
<i>I had no idea that it had this
national and international attention,</i>

1399
01:17:44,844 --> 01:17:46,460
and this is the Star Trek convention

1400
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,463
for people who love the movie Jaws.

1401
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:54,787
Is that $3,000 bounty on
the shark in cash or check?

1402
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,651
<i>You yell, "Shark!"</i>

1403
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:59,754
<i>We've got a panic on our
hands on the Fourth of July.</i>

1404
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:01,793
<i>Chief, Polly sent me to find you.</i>

1405
01:18:01,894 --> 01:18:03,942
<i>There's a bunch of Boy
Scouts out in Avril Bay</i>

1406
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,573
<i>doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.</i>

1407
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:08,481
<i>People come from all over the world,</i>

1408
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:13,318
who are from Dublin and Edinburgh
and New Zealand and Australia,

1409
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,800
and it's just stunning.

1410
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:17,239
I think that to me really shows the bones

1411
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,777
and the fan base of the movie.

1412
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:21,870
<i>I mean, 30 years on, it's an
achievement to have us all together.</i>

1413
01:18:23,883 --> 01:18:25,658
Yeah, I saw that.
I've got one at home.

1414
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:26,985
Much larger version of it.

1415
01:18:27,086 --> 01:18:28,349
Much larger of course.

1416
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,033
Came to see the big shark.
Take some pictures.

1417
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,259
You can literally sit in there.

1418
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,306
He will literally swallow you whole.

1419
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:47,155
<i>Do you know the Muffin Man?
Well, say hello.</i>

1420
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:51,205
Being called the Muffin Man, I
haven't been called that for years.

1421
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:54,714
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the cast of Jaws.</i>

1422
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:59,007
<i>This is the first time I
saw Jaws on a wide screen in 26 years.</i>

1423
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,262
<i>The audience, of course, was so into it.</i>

1424
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:04,113
What a great way to
set up watching the film.

1425
01:19:04,223 --> 01:19:06,487
<i>You've got the ferry going by
behind the screen,</i>

1426
01:19:06,592 --> 01:19:08,538
<i>salt air is filling your lungs.</i>

1427
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:11,655
To see about 3,000 people sitting
there watching the giant screen,

1428
01:19:11,764 --> 01:19:15,291
<i>it</i> was the Jaws version of
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1429
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:18,329
<i>Smile, you son of a bitch!</i>

1430
01:19:31,784 --> 01:19:33,582
<i>Jaws is really unique in the way</i>

1431
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,484
<i>that it was filmed in this specific place.</i>

1432
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:38,051
<i>Other movies are filmed in
all kinds of obscure locations.</i>

1433
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:40,034
Most people don't have a clue
where they were filmed.

1434
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,692
<i>Jaws was right here all over this island.</i>

1435
01:19:42,795 --> 01:19:45,639
<i>And you can't really get away
from it, even if you wanted to.</i>

1436
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:47,839
<i>Coming up on the left,</i>

1437
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:51,449
<i>you'll see the house that was used
for the Brody residence in the film.</i>

1438
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:53,812
<i>If you wanted to go see a film location,</i>

1439
01:19:54,073 --> 01:19:56,235
things change, houses get painted,

1440
01:19:56,342 --> 01:19:59,027
and most of the time,
they're even on a sound stage.

1441
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:01,660
<i>With Jaws, you can take a ferry ride,</i>

1442
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:04,290
<i>and you'll step off the ferry
and you are in Amity.</i>

1443
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,233
<i>It has really not changed in 30 years.</i>

1444
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:20,255
<i>I do know that
people come here on a regular basis.</i>

1445
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:23,518
<i>Jaws questions are probably
some of the top questions we get</i>

1446
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:25,211
<i>in our visitor information centers.</i>

1447
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,936
They ask us quite often

1448
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,040
if they can still see
some of the locations

1449
01:20:29,108 --> 01:20:31,622
where scenes from the movie were filmed.

1450
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:32,843
<i>The answer is yes.</i>

1451
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,161
<i>Some of the scenes include South Beach,</i>

1452
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,005
<i>where the opening bonfire was done.</i>

1453
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:40,264
<i>Amity Town Hall, which is
actually Edgar town Town Hall,</i>

1454
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,145
<i>right on Main Street in Edgar town.</i>

1455
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,697
<i>Also the Chappaquiddick ferry.</i>

1456
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:48,066
<i>It is a very small
ferry that takes you between</i>

1457
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,073
<i>Edgar town and its island,
which is Chappaquiddick.</i>

1458
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:55,813
<i>At the Grange Hall in West Tisbury,</i>

1459
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,285
<i>the JAWSFEST Behind The Screams exhibit</i>

1460
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,721
<i>is drawing hundreds of islanders and fans.</i>

1461
01:21:02,408 --> 01:21:04,035
<i>Contributed by private collectors,</i>

1462
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:06,828
<i>these artifacts of Jaws
have returned to the island</i>

1463
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:09,193
<i>for the first time in decades.</i>

1464
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:11,847
Prop collecting has become a
really big business in recent years,

1465
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:12,934
thanks to the Internet.

1466
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,095
It's easy for people to find props

1467
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:17,201
<i>from recent films all over the place.</i>

1468
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,469
<i>It's very difficult to find
props from classic films,</i>

1469
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,158
<i>especially a film like Jaws.</i>

1470
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,204
<i>I got into Jaws
when I was about five years old.</i>

1471
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,830
<i>One of the first props I
ever had was a harpoon gun.</i>

1472
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:32,049
And if you're five years old
and you have the harpoon gun,

1473
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,853
of course, you need the barrels and
the tank and the list goes on and on.

1474
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,703
<i>I spent 30 years of my life
tracking this stuff down.</i>

1475
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,122
<i>And I think I did a pretty good
job, considering I found out</i>

1476
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,075
<i>that I probably have one of the
largest collections in the world.</i>

1477
01:21:52,858 --> 01:21:55,134
<i>And whatever
happened to the ultimate Jaws prop?</i>

1478
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,777
<i>Quint's trusty fishing boat, the</i> Orca,

1479
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:02,315
<i>which served as a floating set for
nearly four months of shooting at sea.</i>

1480
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,717
<i>Well, I had</i> a <i>good
souvenir. I had the</i> Orca <i>for a while.</i>

1481
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,200
<i>I had the Orca shipped back
to Universal Studios.</i>

1482
01:22:08,307 --> 01:22:10,036
<i>We put it on the tour, in the back lot.</i>

1483
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:12,270
<i>And every once in a while,
|'cl go up in my little electric cart,</i>

1484
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,954
<i>and I'd visit the Orca, by myself.</i>

1485
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:15,461
I'd look around and make sure
no tourists are around,

1486
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:16,646
and nobody can see me.

1487
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:19,895
And I would just sit
inside the pilot house,

1488
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:22,050
or I would sit in one
of the cabins, right.

1489
01:22:22,154 --> 01:22:25,283
<i>Walk down those few steps to
where all the life jackets were</i>

1490
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,957
<i>just hanging, dripping,
when the boat began to sink.</i>

1491
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,609
<i>And I would just kind of reminisce
and kind of give thanks that</i>

1492
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,612
<i>that movie sort of launched my career,</i>

1493
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:35,661
<i>but I would go there alone,
and spend time on it</i>

1494
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:36,751
<i>and didn't tell anybody.</i>

1495
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:39,038
Then one day, about six months later,

1496
01:22:39,138 --> 01:22:41,914
I went for another journey
back in time, down memory lane.

1497
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,651
The boat was gone.

1498
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,285
And I called up the head of the back lot,

1499
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:47,658
and I said, "What happened to the Orca?"

1500
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,458
He said, "Well, it was just rotting there.

1501
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,865
"So, we took an ax and took
a couple of chainsaws,

1502
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:56,462
"and we cut it up for timber.
We shipped it out."

1503
01:22:57,089 --> 01:23:00,605
And I went nuts.
I went nuts.

1504
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:02,303
I feel very bad about
all the things I said

1505
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,936
to that poor man who took my phone call.

1506
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:07,380
But I was just beside myself.
They had destroyed this.

1507
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:11,386
This piece of wood, originally
called the Warlock, by the way.

1508
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,046
<i>It was a real boat called the Warlock,</i>

1509
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:15,419
<i>and we painted that over it, a weird omen,</i>

1510
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,368
<i>and called it the</i> Orca.

1511
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,754
And the fact that the boat
was no longer in existence,

1512
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:22,228
it had died, you know?

1513
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:25,527
And it was just
the strangest feeling for me,

1514
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,228
but in a way it was good for me,

1515
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:28,912
because it cut the umbilical cord

1516
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:31,706
that was joining me
to some of my worst memories

1517
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:34,014
about filming that movie.

1518
01:23:34,193 --> 01:23:36,992
And it kind of freed me when they
broke the boat into many pieces.

1519
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:39,912
But I did recover both twin screws,

1520
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:42,781
I got the propeller blades back,

1521
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:46,051
and I got the pilot wheel.

1522
01:23:48,874 --> 01:23:50,456
The Orca <i>is a cast</i> member.

1523
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,461
And what a lot of
people don't realize is that

1524
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:59,343
Joe Alves built an exact
replica on pontoons,

1525
01:24:00,152 --> 01:24:03,144
<i>which was affectionately
called the Orca II.</i>

1526
01:24:04,356 --> 01:24:07,223
<i>The</i> Orca <i>II,</i> a <i>fiberglass stunt double,</i>

1527
01:24:07,326 --> 01:24:10,011
<i>that was designed to sink
and re-emerge on command,</i>

1528
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,705
<i>has remained on the Vineyard.</i>

1529
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,997
<i>Islander and Jaws boat wrangler,</i>

1530
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,802
<i>Lynn Murphy, has kept her
on a shoreline in Menemsha</i>

1531
01:24:17,903 --> 01:24:19,598
<i>since filming completed.</i>

1532
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,864
<i>When they clean up after a movie,</i>

1533
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,022
<i>they gotta pick up
their junk and clear it out.</i>

1534
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,288
<i>They said, "Well, we
gotta get rid of this stuff."</i>

1535
01:24:26,378 --> 01:24:28,187
<i>So, I bought the</i> Orca.

1536
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,095
I looked it over and there was lumber

1537
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:32,826
and things in the special effects barge,

1538
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:34,380
and I wasn't sure just exactly how

1539
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:35,868
<i>I was gonna use it at the time,</i>

1540
01:24:35,938 --> 01:24:37,656
<i>but I wasn't gonna let it go to the dump.</i>

1541
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:43,604
<i>Yeah, you can see the
mechanism that was under the</i> Orca.

1542
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,841
<i>You see all that?
That was never</i> a boat.

1543
01:24:46,298 --> 01:24:47,413
<i>There was never a bottom.</i>

1544
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:50,884
<i>The</i> Orca <i>||'s resting site has served</i>

1545
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:53,365
<i>as sort of a holy grail destination</i>

1546
01:24:53,472 --> 01:24:55,463
<i>for fans who've made pilgrimages</i>

1547
01:24:55,574 --> 01:24:57,520
<i>to the Vineyard throughout the years.</i>

1548
01:24:58,043 --> 01:25:02,162
<i>Unfortunately, three decades of
weather, tide and souvenir hunters</i>

1549
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,417
<i>have stripped the boat down to
little more than its fiberglass hull.</i>

1550
01:25:06,585 --> 01:25:09,532
<i>People started
to realize what all this stuff was,</i>

1551
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:13,769
and over the years,
there'd be a porthole missing.

1552
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:19,711
<i>We had several of the balsa
wood stems and they'd disappear,</i>

1553
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,331
<i>and then the flying bridge
came off, and so on and so forth.</i>

1554
01:25:23,435 --> 01:25:26,985
<i>As if the sand wasn't bad
enough, guys, I got pricker bushes now.</i>

1555
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:28,664
<i>I'm a real fan, huh?</i>

1556
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:30,655
<i>Trespassing is forbidden,</i>

1557
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:33,969
<i>and the marshy terrain
surrounding it is quite hazardous.</i>

1558
01:25:35,347 --> 01:25:38,874
<i>But none of that has deterred the
more tenacious and adventurous fans</i>

1559
01:25:38,984 --> 01:25:40,884
<i>from seeking to get an up close look.</i>

1560
01:25:40,986 --> 01:25:44,513
I've watched this boat sink
more times than I could tell you.

1561
01:25:44,623 --> 01:25:47,456
It's kind of nice to see it,
but we gotta get out of here.

1562
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:49,257
This is private property.

1563
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:50,675
Explain what we're doing here.

1564
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,625
I am one of three complete idiots.

1565
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:58,428
Out here freezing in the middle
of the night looking for the Orca II.

1566
01:25:58,637 --> 01:26:00,856
This is it.
Look at this thing.

1567
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:06,584
<i>Today virtually
nothing remains of the Orca II.</i>

1568
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,494
This is the end of the Orca.

1569
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:10,827
And this is the only thing
that we have left of her.

1570
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,197
We decided we'd take her home
before she was all gone.

1571
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:18,567
<i>They were selling her for
$100 a six-inch square on eBay.</i>

1572
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,489
<i>Finally, whatever
became of Bruce, himself?</i>

1573
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,775
<i>AH of the mechanical sharks used for Jaws</i>

1574
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,251
<i>were returned to the back lot of
Universal Studios in Hollywood,</i>

1575
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,835
<i>where they were stored and
eventually succumbed to the elements.</i>

1576
01:26:36,425 --> 01:26:39,110
<i>Throughout the span of the Jaws franchise,</i>

1577
01:26:39,211 --> 01:26:41,578
<i>there have been four distinct incarnations</i>

1578
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,772
<i>of the mechanical shark.</i>

1579
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:45,165
<i>Each one aiming to improve on looks</i>

1580
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,315
<i>and functionality over its predecessor.</i>

1581
01:26:48,053 --> 01:26:50,420
<i>But for the truest fans,
it is the original</i>

1582
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,008
<i>with its trademark jowls that remains</i>

1583
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:55,487
<i>the only true embodiment of Jaws.</i>

1584
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:58,154
<i>What happened is that we needed a hinge,</i>

1585
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,128
so you got this jowl kind
of thing that happens,

1586
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:06,444
which I sort of hated, but
I guess Jaws fans love it.

1587
01:27:06,872 --> 01:27:10,809
<i>I guess the shark had a character
that people got familiar with.</i>

1588
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:16,188
<i>Though he's been replaced
by a dissimilar shark in recent years,</i>

1589
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:19,609
<i>Universal Studios, Hollywood,
once showcased this casting</i>

1590
01:27:19,718 --> 01:27:24,269
<i>from the original Bruce mold as
a photo op for visitors to the park.</i>

1591
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:28,322
<i>Today, he remains the
last copy from that mold,</i>

1592
01:27:28,427 --> 01:27:32,989
<i>but has since been relegated to a
junkyard in San Fernando Valley.</i>

1593
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:37,525
<i>Universal Studios, with
locations in Hollywood,</i>

1594
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:40,048
<i>Orlando and Osaka, Japan,</i>

1595
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:43,103
<i>has kept their attractions up
to date throughout the years.</i>

1596
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:44,804
<i>How many of you saw the film</i> Jaws?

1597
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:48,369
<i>But the lasting popularity
of Hollywood's model blockbuster</i>

1598
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,858
<i>has assured it an enduring place</i>

1599
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,299
<i>in all three theme parks to this day.</i>

1600
01:27:58,457 --> 01:28:01,438
<i>Our shark, which
has been here since the mid-'70s,</i>

1601
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:05,094
<i>works a heck of a lot better than
the shark in the movie ever worked.</i>

1602
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:08,758
But the reason I think it
rates so highly still to this day

1603
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:12,132
is because Steven was so good
at using the camera as the shark.

1604
01:28:12,237 --> 01:28:15,787
So, 40 minutes into the movie
when you finally see the shark,

1605
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,456
<i>you're so terrified of it.</i>

1606
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,187
<i>And I think that's still in people's minds</i>

1607
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:20,843
<i>when they come here
and ride this attraction,</i>

1608
01:28:20,946 --> 01:28:23,040
they're terrified of the
shark before they ever see it.

1609
01:28:23,148 --> 01:28:26,140
So, we don't have to do a
whole lot to make people scream.

1610
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:27,251
So, it's great.

1611
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,652
<i>The back lot
shark itself has even made cameos</i>

1612
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:34,687
<i>in other Universal productions
throughout the years,</i>

1613
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:37,228
<i>usually being played for laughs.</i>

1614
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:39,548
<i>But whether for humor or for screams,</i>

1615
01:28:39,631 --> 01:28:42,544
<i>one thing is certain,
at Universal Studios,</i>

1616
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:47,117
<i>even after 30 years, the
shark is definitely still working.</i>

1617
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:58,767
<i>For a brief moment
in time, life seemed to imitate art.</i>

1618
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,734
<i>As the waters of Martha's Vineyard</i>

1619
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,396
<i>once again hosted the
presence of a great white.</i>

1620
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:07,785
<i>Only this time, the shark wasn't
constructed from rubber and steel.</i>

1621
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:11,996
September 21 st, I'll
never forget that date, 2004.

1622
01:29:12,063 --> 01:29:15,294
<i>The big why is, is why that shark
swam not only in shallow waters,</i>

1623
01:29:15,367 --> 01:29:19,144
but way up into a very tight,
shallow estuarine system.

1624
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:22,372
What motivated that shark to
get in there, we'll never know.

1625
01:29:22,474 --> 01:29:24,806
Shark! A shark!

1626
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:28,105
<i>When the great white surfaced in</i> Jaws,

1627
01:29:28,179 --> 01:29:32,423
<i>Amity Island had to call in Richard
Dreyfuss, as ichthyologist Matt Hooper.</i>

1628
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:34,796
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

1629
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:38,683
<i>But the Vineyard has its own
resident shark expert</i>

1630
01:29:38,757 --> 01:29:42,637
<i>in Greg Skomal of the Massachusetts
Division of Marine Fisheries.</i>

1631
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:47,545
So many differences between 1975 and 2004.

1632
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:50,925
And that's the fact that instead
of all the townspeople going out

1633
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:55,336
<i>and trying to kill it with dynamite
explosives and shotguns,</i>

1634
01:29:55,407 --> 01:29:59,037
<i>spear guns, you name it, the
public kind of embraced this animal.</i>

1635
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,579
<i>And the cry I got, that far
outweighed the negative,</i>

1636
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,923
<i>was this positive, "Quit messing
around and save that shark."</i>

1637
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:14,791
That we can learn to be concerned for
this animal that Jaws taught us to dread

1638
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:18,159
and get past that mythology,
to look behind the Jaws

1639
01:30:18,229 --> 01:30:20,072
<i>and look at this wild animal
that's in need of help,</i>

1640
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,213
<i>and draw on our humanity to rescue it,</i>

1641
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:24,285
<i>I think is a step in the right direction.</i>

1642
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,581
<i>And that step is no small one.</i>

1643
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,775
<i>Despite infrequent, but highly
publicized shark attacks in recent years,</i>

1644
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:35,695
<i>the general public's
attitude towards sharks</i>

1645
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,613
<i>has indeed come a long way since the '70s.</i>

1646
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:41,981
<i>One of the problems of
creating a perfect villain,</i>

1647
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,937
<i>a machine that kills and
eats and makes little sharks,</i>

1648
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,066
is that the public quickly subscribes

1649
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:52,995
<i>to that easy view of the
shark as dreadful enemies.</i>

1650
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:58,713
<i>Jaws and the sequels, unfortunately,
made them easy to dislike.</i>

1651
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:01,436
It made people very conscious of sharks,

1652
01:31:01,906 --> 01:31:07,094
and we then realized that
we had to put the facts right,

1653
01:31:07,178 --> 01:31:11,160
<i>to really convince people
that sharks are to be respected,</i>

1654
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:14,013
<i>and we must learn to
live with them in the ocean.</i>

1655
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:15,786
<i>The great white shark, for instance,</i>

1656
01:31:15,854 --> 01:31:18,539
<i>has been protected for several years now,</i>

1657
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,268
<i>and the numbers are slowly coming back.</i>

1658
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,294
Over the last 30 years,
the science has evolved,

1659
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,923
so we understand that sharks
have a place in the ocean,

1660
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:29,596
and it's an important place.

1661
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,962
<i>Environmental groups like
Environmental Defense,</i>

1662
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:35,154
<i>the New England Aquarium
and others with whom I work,</i>

1663
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,834
have found that the association with Jaws

1664
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:42,311
draws people to at least
listen to what I have to say.

1665
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:45,882
<i>So, it has given me the
opportunity to have a third career,</i>

1666
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,248
<i>in the sense of being a spokesman</i>

1667
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:51,766
<i>for the environment and for the oceans.</i>

1668
01:31:52,957 --> 01:31:55,585
<i>Look at that animal, will you, please?</i>

1669
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,669
<i>He is just magnificent.</i>

1670
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:01,744
<i>One of the great
freedoms that Jaws gave me was to</i>

1671
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,376
<i>learn about the ocean
that I had written about,</i>

1672
01:32:04,486 --> 01:32:06,545
<i>so that for the past 30 years,</i>

1673
01:32:06,638 --> 01:32:09,437
<i>Wendy and the kids and I have
been able to go around the world,</i>

1674
01:32:09,507 --> 01:32:12,340
<i>diving with all of these
animals of different kinds,</i>

1675
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:15,960
<i>learning the problems that
they face, the truth about them,</i>

1676
01:32:16,064 --> 01:32:18,544
<i>having to do with sharks, for instance.</i>

1677
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:21,711
If we can harness all
the interest in <i>Jaws,</i>

1678
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:24,716
and from the fans of Jaws,
to the enthusiasts of <i>Jaws,</i>

1679
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:28,253
to the people who see it and who
learn from it and who are liking it,

1680
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:30,509
into a protection movement for the oceans,

1681
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,706
we'd have a massive force going.

1682
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:45,744
<i>The gilt-edged bite of Jaws
on so many of today's pop culture artisans</i>

1683
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:49,104
<i>speaks powerfully to the
stamina of this single film.</i>

1684
01:32:49,581 --> 01:32:52,141
<i>Its extraordinary shelf life
has allowed it to function</i>

1685
01:32:52,217 --> 01:32:54,413
<i>as sort of a creative well</i>

1686
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:58,480
<i>from which filmmakers may
draw inspiration and innovation.</i>

1687
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:01,551
<i>A well that never seems to run dry.</i>

1688
01:33:03,845 --> 01:33:07,475
Anyone who's around my age,
who's in this movie business,

1689
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:11,379
always kind of cites Jaws <i>as</i> the
first movie they remember seeing,

1690
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:14,217
or the movie that made
them want to get into movies,

1691
01:33:14,305 --> 01:33:16,501
or started their love affair with movies.

1692
01:33:16,608 --> 01:33:17,939
I still remember the first time

1693
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:20,568
that I saw Jaws in the
theater and how it affected me.

1694
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:21,975
<i>I walked away thinking,</i>

1695
01:33:22,046 --> 01:33:25,129
<i>"I wanna learn how to
do that when I get older."</i>

1696
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:30,682
And it absolutely changed the
direction of my life in one night.

1697
01:33:30,789 --> 01:33:33,668
I'm always really grateful

1698
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:36,517
when anybody, especially a young
director, comes over to me and tells me

1699
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:40,155
that they were in some way
strangely influenced by <i>Jaws,</i>

1700
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:42,330
and I say, "Oh, great.
You're part of our club, then.

1701
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,797
<i>"You got it."</i>

1702
01:33:43,885 --> 01:33:48,334
<i>I aggressively pursued
Jaws as a way to learn from the master.</i>

1703
01:33:48,439 --> 01:33:51,249
I saw the light, I saw Jaws and I saw

1704
01:33:51,643 --> 01:33:54,385
that's the promised land up there.

1705
01:33:54,496 --> 01:33:55,496
That's what you have to aim for.

1706
01:33:55,597 --> 01:33:56,940
It affected me in film making

1707
01:33:57,015 --> 01:33:59,757
in just wanting to make movies
that were larger than life.

1708
01:33:59,868 --> 01:34:02,644
Certainly, I think it was one
of those big films of my life

1709
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,167
that inspired me eventually to
wanna go on to be a filmmaker.

1710
01:34:06,357 --> 01:34:08,075
I think that anyone that wants to make

1711
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:11,237
big Hollywood blockbuster
movies is certainly inspired by Jaws.

1712
01:34:11,346 --> 01:34:14,714
Probably every film I make, I'm always
evoking Jaws, one way or another.

1713
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:18,025
It's like one of the basic films
that drives me as a filmmaker.

1714
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:21,197
I've worked with Steven on three projects,

1715
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:23,769
and I still stand next to him
and every time I look at him, I go,

1716
01:34:23,842 --> 01:34:25,571
"That's the guy that did <i>Jaws.</i>

1717
01:34:25,643 --> 01:34:27,327
"That's the reason why I'm here."

1718
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:31,781
I hope the picture has
inspired a lot of filmmakers.

1719
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,200
I mean, that's another added
benefit to this whole miraculous event.

1720
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,416
<i>The hardest thing in the film business</i>

1721
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:44,337
is not so much to do something
that's usually successful.

1722
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:48,115
Harder than that is to create
something that has longevity.

1723
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:50,651
There've been a lot
of great pictures made.

1724
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:53,767
But one of the tests is the test of time.

1725
01:34:53,872 --> 01:34:58,673
The fact that that film and
the music that went with it

1726
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,710
lingers in people's minds

1727
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:04,009
is a lot of things. It's a
great compliment to me,

1728
01:35:04,082 --> 01:35:07,074
and to Steven Spielberg, and the people
who wrote it and acted it and all of that.

1729
01:35:07,151 --> 01:35:09,984
It's quite an amazing thing for an actor,

1730
01:35:10,054 --> 01:35:14,423
who was really an insignificant
player in the scheme of things,

1731
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:21,145
to have a lifelong tale,
of a fishtail behind me.

1732
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:24,264
Those first instincts that David and I had

1733
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:29,006
<i>when we read the manuscript
by Peter Benchley proved correct.</i>

1734
01:35:29,073 --> 01:35:33,169
<i>And it feels good to know
that it has lasted all this time.</i>

1735
01:35:33,444 --> 01:35:36,527
Almost every week or month,

1736
01:35:36,631 --> 01:35:40,215
somebody who knows that I
was connected with the production

1737
01:35:40,285 --> 01:35:42,162
will tell me where they were.

1738
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:46,537
<i>It's like the beginning of World
War II, the death of Kennedy.</i>

1739
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,276
<i>The emotional experience provided by Jaws</i>

1740
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:54,225
will go on and on and on and on forever.

1741
01:35:54,299 --> 01:35:56,347
I mean, who doesn't like Bambi?

1742
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,910
<i>Bambi goes on forever.
Snow White goes on forever.</i>

1743
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:01,830
Jaws goes on forever.

1744
01:36:20,742 --> 01:36:24,269
<i>I certainly think that all of us
went through a survival adventure together,</i>

1745
01:36:24,412 --> 01:36:26,471
<i>the entire crew and cast and myself.</i>

1746
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:30,791
<i>And I have very good memories in
many respects to the making of Jaws,</i>

1747
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,761
<i>but I have many more bad memories.</i>

1748
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:36,703
<i>Memories that still haunt my
nightmares, still wake me up sweating,</i>

1749
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:39,323
but the bottom line is I'm grateful.

1750
01:36:39,594 --> 01:36:42,825
Because I went through
a kind of baptism of water.

1751
01:36:42,914 --> 01:36:48,398
And I came out of it, not only
alive, which was my main goal,

1752
01:36:48,503 --> 01:36:51,347
and getting through <i>Jaws</i> was
to come out of it in one piece,

1753
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:53,248
but I came out of it with a career.

1754
01:36:53,524 --> 01:36:55,549
And I will forever be grateful,

1755
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:58,994
no matter what I tell you
about those nightmares,

1756
01:36:59,163 --> 01:37:01,825
<i>to the fact that the dream
from the nightmare was</i>

1757
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:04,777
<i>that I got a chance to make
any movie I wanted to make.</i>

1758
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,899
<i>And that has continued to this day.</i>

1759
01:37:10,808 --> 01:37:16,326
Time will only tell when Jaws will
fade from the collective memory.

1760
01:37:16,848 --> 01:37:19,362
But I think as long <i>as</i>
there are sharks in the sea,

1761
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:22,994
and as long as there are
oceans and bodies of water,

1762
01:37:23,187 --> 01:37:26,532
as long as there are kids with imagination

1763
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:29,110
who like to torture and scare each other,

1764
01:37:29,193 --> 01:37:32,493
Jaws is going to be probably
around for a long time.

1765
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:58,375
The shark is working.
Repeat. The shark is still working.

1766
01:40:58,486 --> 01:41:01,012
<i>Repeat.
The shark is still working.</i>
