00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,622
Jane, you say it's all over

5
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,375
for you and me, girl

6
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,587
there's a time for love

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,633
and a time for
letting it be, baby

8
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,557
Jane, you're playing
a game called...

9
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,725
Whoo!

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,228
(Grunting, whooping wildly)

11
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,523
Making believe that
you just don't feel the same

12
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,733
(grunts) Yeah!

13
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,319
Oh, Jane

14
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,072
(alarm buzzing)

15
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,241
(Laughs excitedly)

16
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,118
Whoo!

17
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,749
Mmm, mmm.

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,170
Whoo!

19
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,762
Whoa, Jane,
you're playing a game

20
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,306
called hide-and-go-seek

21
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,015
whoo!

22
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,018
Mwah.

23
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,228
Jane, you're playing for fun...

24
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,564
Whoo! (Clan k)

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,763
Olaf: You know
the first thing I thought

26
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,681
when I saw you?

27
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,519
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

28
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,605
(Olaf and Elsa chuckle)

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,149
Elsa: What if it's a her?

30
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,984
What would you call her?

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,237
Olaf: Ragni, maybe.

32
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,781
Elsa: Sorry? (Chuckles)

33
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,574
Olaf: Ragnl

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,203
Elsa: Uh, let me think about
that for a second. (Laughs)

35
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,829
Ragnl you hate it.

36
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,374
Uh, boy's name? Texas.

37
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,667
(Olaf laughing)

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,293
(Elsa chuckles)
Olaf: You kidding me?

39
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,629
Texas is, like, a state,
you know? I know.

40
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,924
Olaf: There's about
three or four hours

41
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,007
till we reach the peak.

42
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,176
Elsa: Ah, great.

43
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,096
(Indistinct chatter)

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,852
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

45
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,563
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,149
Of course. It's about the band.

47
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,652
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

48
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,113
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

49
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,115
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,117
to use your brother's band.

51
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,576
Why not? Honey...

52
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,203
He's super, super good.

53
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,122
He works super hard. Yeah.

54
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,290
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

55
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,374
Yeah, I know this.

56
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,294
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,798
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

58
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,259
His singing is like shit.

59
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,432
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

60
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,725
Olaf!

61
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,061
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.

62
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,563
Wait for me.

63
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,231
Why are you so sensitive?

64
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,156
Told you I could get us here.

65
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,241
(Both chuckle)

66
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,410
(Olaf sighs)

67
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,873
It's beautiful.

68
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,916
Thank you. I love you.

69
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,755
(Chuckles)

70
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,258
(Sighs)

71
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,012
(Rustling nearby)

72
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,346
(Whispering) Elsa.

73
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,475
Look. Look.
What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

74
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,935
Look. (Gasps)

75
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,688
(Elsa gasping) (Bear groans)

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,899
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

77
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,943
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

78
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

79
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,865
We have such good luck
in nature.

80
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,325
(Elsa chuckles)

81
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,534
(Camera clicks)

82
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,746
(Grumbung)

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,959
Elsa: What do you see?

84
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,252
(Birds screeching)

85
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,340
It's demented or something.

86
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,632
What?

87
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,156
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. Yeah.

88
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,807
(Scoffs) Demented?

89
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,767
I-I-I think we should leave it.

90
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,644
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

91
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,770
Comeon_ Elsa: Ah!

92
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,105
Olaf: Shh. Come on.
Elsa: It's so cute.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,026
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, kristoffer.

94
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,362
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

95
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,865
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

96
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
Olaf: Oh, fuck.

97
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,540
Don't panic.

98
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
What do we do?

99
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,501
"If it's black, fight back.

100
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,503
"If it's brown, lay down."

101
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,088
Elsa: But is it black
or is it brown?

102
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,506
I mean, it looks brown to me.

103
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,258
Olaf: We're in appalachia.
It's black.

104
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,884
We have to fight it.
How do you know?

105
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,553
You're not a bear expert.

106
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,679
(Bear growls)

107
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,722
Whatever you do, don't...

108
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,724
Run! Where are we going?
Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

109
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,568
I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
Uphill. Uphill.

110
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,395
(Growling) (Indistinct shouting)

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,021
Olaf: Run! Where do we go?

112
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,566
Run, Elsa! Run! Where do we go?

113
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,651
Olaf: Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

114
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,695
Run! (Elsa screaming)

115
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,030
He's coming! Come on!

116
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,323
Elsa: No! It's following...

117
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,534
(Screams, grunts)

118
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,327
(Groans, gasps)

119
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,830
(Growling)

120
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,582
Olaf! No!

121
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,916
God!

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,751
(Screaming)

123
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,461
(Whimpering)

124
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,380
(Continues screaming)
(Bear growling)

125
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,631
(Whimpering)

126
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,717
(Screams, gasps)

127
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,218
(Yelling)

128
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,511
Elsa: Hemrna comeonlcomeon!

129
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,430
Olaf! (Screams)

130
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,639
(Screams)

131
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,516
(Elsa screaming) (Bear snarling)

132
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,101
(Yells)

133
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,438
(Groaning)

134
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,231
(Bear grumbles) (Gasps)

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,902
(Gasps)

136
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,403
(Whimpering)

137
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,905
(Roars)

138
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,202
(Moans softly)

139
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,579
(Snarls)

140
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,164
Narrator: (On TV) This is drugs.

141
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,582
(Sizzling)

142
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,626
This is your brain on drugs.

143
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,213
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

144
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,549
The thrill can kill.

145
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,387
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

146
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,642
And pulling the trigger.

147
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,981
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

148
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,318
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

149
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,001
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

150
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,322
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

151
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,324
when his parachute
failed to open.

152
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,159
(Siren wailing)

153
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,079
Jones: The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

154
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,790
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

155
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,792
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

156
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,877
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

157
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,879
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

158
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,715
Jones: Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

159
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,176
wrapped in
football-size packages

160
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,553
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

161
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,313
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, isuppose.

162
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,316
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

163
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,734
Nothing.

164
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,111
Here's the ID.

165
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,905
I know who that is.

166
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,617
Full name,
Andrew c. Thornton ii.

167
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,452
Man was out of his mind.

168
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,541
What's the "c" stand for? Hmm?

169
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,669
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

170
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,943
Bob: Thornton was one of
Syd white's guys out of Missouri.

171
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,928
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

172
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,848
Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.

173
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,768
And there's more of this
out there.

174
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,812
They dumped it somewhere.

175
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,734
Hey, reba,
you have a dog, right?

176
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,818
Had.

177
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,696
Border collie. Barry.

178
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,364
Sorry for your loss.

179
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,366
Border collie, huh?

180
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,326
That's a cool dog.

181
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,495
Did he play fetch and stuff?

182
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,705
He loved fetch.

183
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,665
What?

184
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,960
Nothing. I just...

185
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,171
That's just awesome.

186
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,429
(Panting)

187
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,098
(Sighs)

188
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,642
(The warrior playing)

189
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,772
(Squishing)

190
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,942
Damn it, Gabe.

191
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,152
Hi, daveed.

192
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,029
(Sighs, clears throat)

193
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,823
Uh, mind if I order first?

194
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,700
This won't take long.

195
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,455
(Grunts)

196
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,000
Damn, I just bought these.

197
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,342
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

198
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,677
Did you hear about Thornton?

199
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,721
It's a tough way to go.

200
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,015
He only had 30 kilos on him.

201
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,725
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

202
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,269
Chattahoochee.

203
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,437
Georgia?

204
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,439
There's an area
called blood mountain.

205
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,274
When the plane's going down,

206
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,276
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

207
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,028
And then we just go and get it.

208
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,281
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

209
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,117
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

210
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,576
Eddie's in mourning.

211
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,370
Joanie just died.

212
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,704
And he quit.

213
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,623
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

214
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,291
She's not here anymore.

215
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,502
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

216
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,546
Syd, I-I just don't...

217
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,922
Stop.

218
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,883
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

219
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,137
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

220
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,472
Grandpa Syd, watch.

221
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,517
Yeah, that's great.

222
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,522
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

223
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,526
Tomorrow's lunch is in the
fridge, and the chicken's...

224
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,278
(Music playing quietly
over headphones)

225
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,864
Chicken's in the microwave.
Just hit "start."

226
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,742
Thought you were off tonight.

227
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,661
We talked about this, remember?

228
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,454
Me picking up some extra shifts?

229
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,640
You said you were okay with it.

230
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,791
I was okay with it
until I realized

231
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,459
why you want those extra shifts.

232
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,380
So you could go and do
overtime with ray the pediatrician.

233
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,301
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

234
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,346
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

235
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,056
this weekend
to see his band play.

236
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,893
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

237
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,686
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

238
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,289
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

239
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,064
It's Nashville.

240
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,734
He's a good guy, deirdra.

241
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,278
Just_

242
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,696
Both: Give him a chance.

243
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,656
Please don't do that.

244
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,158
Do what?

245
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,578
You know what.

246
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,873
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

247
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,628
(Sighs) Close my door.

248
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,508
(Trail of tears playing quietly)

249
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,221
Bartender:
That's enough for today.

250
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,389
Wait, what?

251
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,934
Hey, Eddie.

252
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,146
They spelled
her name wrong, daveed.

253
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,067
Itsays"johnfi oh.

254
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,444
Yeah. Says"johnfi

255
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,655
her name is fucking Joan.
Look, we...

256
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,865
We could get it fixed.

257
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,867
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

258
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
I got seven more days of "John."

259
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,083
Jones: (Over TV) The
chutist has been identified

260
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,831
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

261
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,251
Wait, is that us? Hey.

262
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,004
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

263
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,507
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

264
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,509
(Crying)

265
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,011
I'm so sad, man.

266
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,681
I'm so fucking sad.

267
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,057
Okay?

268
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,144
(Sniffles, whimpers)

269
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,233
Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?

270
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,070
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

271
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,822
It's just plain.

272
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,377
I knew you'd be late.

273
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,587
It finally came in.
Check it out.

274
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,464
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

275
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
Like a thousand, but worth it.

276
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,343
Uh, no. Can I use the toilet?

277
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,679
My mom is gonna be home soon.

278
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,308
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

279
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,560
Why by lunch?

280
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,186
The light, Henry.

281
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,356
But I got to go pee.

282
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,858
Go outside.

283
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,776
Why do I skip school with you?

284
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,154
You're bossier than
the teachers.

285
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,905
Now, the adoption people...

286
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,074
I'm not sure who I
talked to over there,

287
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,327
told me I was supposed
to be getting me a lab.

288
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,080
A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.

289
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,790
I don't know
if there was an error,

290
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,543
because the one I got
is just kind of...

291
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,337
Reba: Bob? ...I don't know,

292
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,963
just kind of fancy.

293
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,591
Bob, captain says
it's time to go. Got it.

294
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,968
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

295
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,386
(Hangs up phone)

296
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
Hey, reba.

297
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,848
You got plans for tonight?

298
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,852
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

299
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,063
I just don't...
Mind looking after rosette?

300
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,065
(Rosette whines)

301
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,524
Oh. I have to go to Georgia

302
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,859
for the Thornton case,

303
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,486
and you said
you were good at dogs.

304
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,488
I said I had a dog.

305
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,199
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

306
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,825
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

307
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,452
talking at a bar last night.

308
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,246
I'll tell you in the car.
No, no, no.

309
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,956
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

310
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,918
Oh, come on. You got to
be sort of good with them.

311
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,003
I only had her for a day.

312
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,546
Please?

313
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

314
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,718
(Sighs)

315
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,928
Just go.

316
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,554
We'll be fine.

317
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,973
Thanks.

318
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,309
(Whining)

319
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,228
Henry: Can't believe
I left the backpack.

320
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,063
Dee Dee: I can. I know the way.

321
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,856
Henry: School's
gonna call, you know.

322
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,858
You know what? Let 'em.

323
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,902
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

324
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,821
So's your dad.

325
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,572
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

326
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,467
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

327
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,992
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

328
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,678
Dee Dee: Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

329
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,062
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

330
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
Henry: Admit it.

331
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,165
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

332
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,270
(Sighs)

333
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,690
(Inhales deeply)

334
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,108
(Exhales)

335
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
(Phone ringing) Jesuleuck!

336
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,159
Coral, it's sari.

337
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,660
Is Dee Dee over there?

338
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
School just called.

339
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,207
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

340
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,387
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

341
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,629
so can you please
just put him on?

342
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,217
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

343
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,136
What the hell is wrong with him?

344
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,306
Never mind.

345
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,487
(Love song of the waterfall
playing)

346
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,491
(Laughs)

347
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,994
(Sighs)

348
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,748
A love song of the waterfall

349
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,796
I hear through
virgin timbertop...

350
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,632
(Jingling)

351
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,300
(Door bangs shut)

352
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,809
50 cents.

353
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

354
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,737
on the ground, now, am I?
No, ma'am.

355
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,031
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

356
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,200
What? Empty your pockets.

357
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,577
Vest pocket. Come on.

358
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,580
(Sniffs)

359
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,832
Is that perfume?

360
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,626
That's none of your business.

361
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,087
Well, it smells really nice.

362
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,506
Yeah, well, it's European.

363
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,384
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

364
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,261
Is it too much?

365
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,387
Not at all.

366
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,805
Smells expensive.

367
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,599
(Chuckling) Well, it is.

368
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,143
You want a sucker?

369
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,353
Sure.

370
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,355
I like the green one.

371
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,731
This is a red one.

372
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,693
Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh.

373
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,446
Oh, shit. He's here.

374
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,492
(Gasps, coughs)

375
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,247
(Humming nervously)
(Car door closes)

376
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,707
(Bell jingling)

377
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,592
Peter: (Goofy voice)
Am I in the right place?

378
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,169
(Liz and Peter laughing)

379
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,255
(Normal voice) Oh! Right.

380
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,798
Told you it was big.

381
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,425
(Laughing) Oh, it's big.

382
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,468
What's that smell?

383
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,970
It's European.

384
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,221
(Sighs)

385
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,431
(Liz chuckles)

386
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,433
Someone been smoking?

387
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,184
Um, he was.

388
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,352
Can you believe it? What?

389
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,229
Liz: You know,
cigarettes kill people.

390
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,772
Yeah, but... and animals.

391
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,900
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

392
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,986
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

393
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,447
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

394
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,865
(Whispers) Just get out of here.

395
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,409
(Bell jingling) Get out.

396
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,536
Unbelievable.

397
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,079
(Peter chuckles)

398
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,914
You got a dusty
beaver here, rangen

399
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,000
yeah, well, I'm working on that.

400
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,815
Hey, Henry!

401
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,986
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

402
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,488
Henry: Hold on.

403
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,284
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

404
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,203
Marking our territory.

405
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,038
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

406
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm not shitting. (Sighs)

407
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,631
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

408
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,092
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

409
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,677
Dee Dee: Hey, Henry.

410
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,605
Check it out.

411
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,568
It's drugs, I think.

412
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,362
It's drugs?

413
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,572
Remember that guy from assembly?

414
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,784
He showed us pictures of
stuff that looked just like this.

415
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,469
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

416
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,248
This is definitely cocaine.

417
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,208
Yeah. Of course.

418
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,961
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

419
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,923
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

420
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,093
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

421
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,302
When I do it.

422
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,429
Oh, yeah?

423
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,555
With who?

424
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,098
With faqu.

425
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,558
After church.

426
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,518
Faulk does not
do cocaine after church.

427
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,061
Are you friends with faulk?

428
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,271
No. He's a pervert.

429
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,564
Then you wouldn't know.

430
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,898
Liar.

431
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,234
You're just mad
you're never invited.

432
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,278
I don't care I'm not invited.

433
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,071
Sounds like you care.

434
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,116
Do some, then.

435
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,745
What?

436
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,872
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

437
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,751
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

438
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,670
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

439
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,172
That wouldn't be good.

440
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,298
Fine.

441
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,883
Knife me.

442
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,436
Okay, so how do I do it?

443
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,730
You eat it.

444
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,773
How much?

445
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,401
Like a tablespoon's worth.

446
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh!

447
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,083
(Spits) Son of a bitch! (Laughs)

448
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,045
Oh, what the hell?

449
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,881
(Spitting) Rookie.

450
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,841
(Gagging)

451
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,468
You do it, then.

452
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,719
Ugh.

453
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,232
(Sputtering exhale)

454
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,569
Ah, shit! (Laughing)

455
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,655
What the hell?

456
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,824
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

457
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,247
(Sniffs)

458
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,582
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

459
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,626
Let's sell drugs together.

460
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,754
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and faulk.

461
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,714
There's more.

462
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,637
(Groans)

463
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,681
Something got into it.

464
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,183
A deer, maybe.

465
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,144
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

466
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,521
It'd be like this.

467
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,815
Yeah, it'd be, like, going
into trees hke, bang!

468
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,525
Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
Bang!

469
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,777
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

470
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,072
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

471
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,992
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

472
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,577
(Clears throat)

473
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,705
(Clears throat)
My throat's really runny.

474
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,416
(Continues clearing throat)

475
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,626
Stop that.

476
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,548
(Clearing throat)
(Bear grunting)

477
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,013
(Growling)

478
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,974
Did it do the cocaine?

479
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,311
Don't move a muscle.

480
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,438
(Sneezes)

481
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,107
(Both screaming) (Bear roars)

482
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,235
Syd: (Over phone) Listen to me.

483
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,322
You were supposed to grab
Eddie, not run your mouth.

484
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,449
Now we have trouble.
You understand? Got it.

485
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,701
I'll take care of it.
(Glass breaks over phone)

486
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,870
Syd: Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

487
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,039
Gabe: Grandpa Syd!
Syd: Gabe, driving me nuts.

488
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,457
Little...

489
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,666
Fuck.

490
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,005
(Sighs)

491
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,467
(Engine starts)

492
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,218
(On the wings of love playing)

493
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,597
Is on the wings of love

494
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,141
on the wings of love

495
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,435
only the two of us

496
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,273
together flying high

497
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:06,612
flying high
up on the wings of love...

498
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,656
Joan loved this song.

499
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,491
(Sniffles)

500
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,911
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year—old man.

501
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,042
Um, Eddie, listen.

502
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,462
Uh, when joanie died,

503
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,966
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

504
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,802
It's fine.

505
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,595
No, I could've did more.

506
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,763
It's fine.

507
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,888
I should've been there.

508
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,099
I didn't need you there.

509
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,785
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

510
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,185
It's against my constitution.

511
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,104
I'm more than a drug dealer.

512
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,481
No, you're not. Come on, Eddie.

513
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,816
We're friends, right?

514
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
Fine.

515
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,197
I think he's happy she's dead.

516
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,824
He's not happy she died.

517
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,159
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

518
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,744
if we can call it that.

519
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,205
Sometimes...

520
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,208
I wonder if he did it to her.
What?

521
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,876
No, joanie died of cancer.

522
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,169
I know.

523
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,296
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

524
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,756
You can't give no one cancer.

525
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,425
Yes, you can. With stress.

526
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,301
Stop protecting him.

527
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,355
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

528
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,098
(Sighs) (Whimpering)

529
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,308
Running free, traveling

530
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,310
on the wings of love

531
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,062
(Eddie sobbing)

532
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,232
Okay.

533
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,153
On the wings of love,
up and above...

534
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,822
Okay, so we start...

535
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,866
Did you notice my nails?
Those are beautiful.

536
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,077
Thank you. We start...
Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

537
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,288
I'm wearing the stuff.

538
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,124
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

539
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,917
13, come through here?
My daughter...

540
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,961
You lost your daughter
in the park.

541
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,547
Well, she came here on her
own, heading to the waterfall.

542
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,550
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must
be accompanied by an adult.

543
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,385
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

544
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,179
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

545
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,015
bad apples, youngsters
who aren't too happy

546
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,433
with the way things are at home.

547
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,559
She's not a runaway.

548
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,852
She just came to paint the...

549
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,257
Can someone just please point me

550
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,713
in the direction
of blood mountain?

551
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,274
(Laughs) This is blood mountain.

552
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,776
Sorry. I-I'm Peter. Sari: Oh.

553
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,378
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

554
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,488
We're about to
head up there ourselves.

555
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,989
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

556
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,474
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

557
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,909
is a very important process.

558
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,327
We wouldn't want you distracted

559
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,788
by our little
damsel in distress here.

560
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,057
Peter: Nothing can distract me

561
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,458
from making sure the
entire biological community

562
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,627
is safe for all our friends.

563
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,711
Fhends?

564
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,005
He means animals.
I don't like that word.

565
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,299
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

566
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,134
Well, I won't be a burden.

567
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,138
I'll get my hat.

568
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,933
(Chuckling) Okay.

569
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,980
Peter: Shoes okay for hiking?

570
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,857
Sari: Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

571
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,734
Liz: I have on boots. Yep.

572
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,277
Daveed: Come on, Eddie.

573
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,946
I'm done playing this game.

574
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,239
Eddie: You-you wanted...

575
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,990
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

576
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,909
You still have
three more questions.

577
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,994
Daveed: Listen. Eddie: What?

578
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,474
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

579
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,218
No, you're not. You
just don't want to lose.

580
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,752
I'm-a go in here and
take a piss, all right?

581
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,426
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

582
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,971
Park rangers are peace officers.

583
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,098
Which means we can shoot people.

584
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,684
Forest is a dangerous place.

585
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,769
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

586
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,229
"Gang of pubes"?

587
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,689
Teens. Delinquents.

588
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,858
(Laughing, whooping)

589
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,110
They've been attacking hikers.

590
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,778
They hurt anyone?

591
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,697
They cut them with a knife.

592
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,325
Call themselves the doochamps.

593
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,286
Watch your back.

594
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,998
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

595
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,499
(Whispers) Out of nowhere.

596
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,140
Daveed: Fuck is this?

597
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,227
He's afraid, buds.

598
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,937
Empty your pockets.

599
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,480
(Chuckles) No.

600
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,941
Empty your pockets, please.

601
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
(Laughing)

602
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,404
Since you asked so nicely.

603
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,408
You think this is a joke?

604
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,535
I do.

605
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,245
Get him, buds.

606
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,724
Stache: I'm shaking a
fucking knife, man. Come on.

607
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,350
Just stab him. Come on,
man. It's a fucking knife!

608
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,918
Go on! (Yells)

609
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,712
(Grunting and groaning)

610
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,172
Oh!

611
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,216
Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.

612
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,926
Come on, rocky. Ah! Banzai!

613
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,969
(Yelling and grunting)

614
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,055
Daveed: Give me
this fucking board!

615
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,642
You're going down, man!
(Laughs wildly)

616
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,101
(Yells)

617
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,437
(Grunting and groaning)

618
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,317
Submit! Submit!

619
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,568
What the...

620
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,240
Daveed: Hold this!

621
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,617
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

622
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,120
(Screams)

623
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,792
(Grunts)

624
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,961
(Panting)

625
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,589
(Groaning) Oh, my.

626
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,341
(Daveed grunts)

627
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,802
(Daveed panting, groaning)

628
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,978
(Groans)

629
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,522
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

630
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,148
Shit!

631
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,693
Liz: I love this road.

632
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,403
Peter: Ah, love it up there.

633
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,339
So, wait, where is it that
you wanted to go again?

634
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,698
What? The falls.

635
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,509
The secret falls. Right,
well, we can go up this way

636
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,969
or take the loop.
Liz: I love the loop.

637
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,412
Well, you can see the top of
the... this is a more direct...

638
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,331
All right. We're going this way.

639
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,125
Well, crap.

640
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,127
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

641
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,754
Just distracting you completely.

642
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,339
Peter: She can hear you.

643
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,591
Liz: I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

644
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,304
What's taking you so long?
(Sighs)

645
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,763
What'd you do?

646
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,651
Please tell me
you found them like this.

647
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,776
They attacked me.

648
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,903
Are they dead?

649
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,196
Well, one might be.

650
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,157
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

651
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,912
Jesus chr... they're kids.

652
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,040
Iloved this fucking Jersey, man.

653
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,624
Okay, they're fine.

654
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,084
Thank god.

655
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,378
No fucking way.

656
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,673
Daveed?

657
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,222
(Gasping)

658
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,557
What happened?

659
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
Hey.

660
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,976
Wake up. (G roans)

661
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,353
Where'd you find this?

662
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,520
Whoa.

663
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,482
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

664
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,150
You tried to fucking kill me.

665
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,486
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

666
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,987
Itell him that all the time.

667
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,615
Where did you find this?

668
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,325
Up on the mountain.

669
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,450
Where's the rest of it?

670
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,536
I don't know.

671
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,123
Listen, I just took out the
three of you in 15 seconds.

672
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,833
What do you think
I'll do to just you

673
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,835
when you're already
on the floor?

674
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,212
Okay. Okay.

675
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,548
We stashed it under a gazebo.

676
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,425
Going back for it later tonight.

677
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,386
A gazebo?

678
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,555
It's a pavilion-type structure.

679
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,307
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

680
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,517
I didn't.

681
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,185
(Groans)

682
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,229
Are my buds dead?

683
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,772
Show us where. Oh, god.

684
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,982
You know, i-i'm
feeling kind of tired.

685
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,401
I think I should rest.

686
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,403
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

687
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,904
Eddie, go get the gun.

688
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,072
It's in the glove.

689
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,615
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

690
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,534
Yeah. Same.

691
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,620
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

692
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,456
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

693
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,666
Okay.

694
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,876
Okay.

695
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,003
All right, all right.

696
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,547
All right, I'm coming.

697
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,882
Relax.

698
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,810
It's getting real cold out.

699
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,439
(Sighs)

700
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,161
(Groans) Daveed: Let's go.

701
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,665
So, where you guys from?

702
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,542
Shut up. Keep walking.

703
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,044
Gonna be a long hike if
we can't talk to each other.

704
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,046
It better not be a long hike.

705
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,607
Stache: Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

706
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,151
Eddie: Well, I don't
think he's too happy

707
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,676
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

708
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,886
Well, it wasn't me.

709
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,096
Eh, ldont blame him, though.

710
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,473
Getting stabbed sucks.

711
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,016
Daveed: Hey, shut the fuck up.

712
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,642
(Too hot ta trot playing)

713
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,479
Well, you're too hot ta trot,
now, baby

714
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,190
well, you're too hot ta stop

715
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,816
whoo, baby

716
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,820
well, you're too hot ta trot,
now, baby

717
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,906
well, you're too hot ta stop

718
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,365
(squeaking) Whoo...

719
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,159
Bob: Yeah, reba, it's Bob.

720
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,995
I was wondering
how rosette is doing.

721
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

722
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,586
I don't know if dogs think
about that sort of thing, but, uh...

723
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,923
Anyway, I... (Sighs)

724
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,135
Thanks again for helping out.

725
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,432
Peter: Look at this.

726
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,892
Liz: Oh, no.

727
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,228
Peter: Look at
this mess. (Groans)

728
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,230
Liz: People don't have
any respect.

729
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,315
Peter: This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

730
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,608
Liz: I... let me pick that up.

731
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,902
All right. Thank you, ranger.
Dee Dee!

732
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,755
Peter: That is sticking.
I got some oil in the car.

733
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,947
Sari: Dee Dee! Henry!

734
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,573
Peter:
'Cause if that stays open,

735
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,426
critters can get in there.
Oh, yeah, critters.

736
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,452
What kind of critters? Huh?

737
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,137
Squirrels?
Squirrels could get in there.

738
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,248
Liz: Chipmunks?
Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

739
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,791
Dee Dee! Peter: Uh, skunks.

740
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,292
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

741
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,169
That's right.
Got his own little mask on.

742
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,313
Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. I think they're cute.

743
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,463
Peter: Uh, skunks.

744
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,631
Liz: Skunks. Hmm.

745
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,840
Possums. Peter: Possums.

746
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,092
Definitely possums. Possum.

747
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,177
Hey, possum.

748
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,388
Henry: Mrs. Mckinndry!
(Peter and Liz chuckling)

749
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,597
Henry?

750
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,349
Henry: Here! Hello?

751
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,600
Henry?

752
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,102
Henry: Up here!

753
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,356
Liz: Hey. Whoa. Peter: Oh.

754
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,316
Sari: Henry, what are you
doing up there?

755
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,194
No, that's not safe at all.
Liz: No.

756
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,113
Peter: It's too high.
You got to come down.

757
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,239
Get down here.

758
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,242
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

759
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,035
No shit, Henry. Liz: It's high.

760
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,453
But there was a bear.

761
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,871
A really terrible bear.

762
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,456
A bear? Yeah, I know.

763
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,333
It was fucked! Liz: Hey!

764
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
That's inappropriate.

765
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,589
Sorry for cussing, but it
attacked me and Dee Dee.

766
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,090
It attacked you?

767
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,134
Henry, where is Dee Dee?
Peter: No, no.

768
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,177
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

769
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,903
You must have done
something to upset it.

770
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,723
Yeah, did you feed it?
What did you do?

771
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,850
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

772
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,644
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

773
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,646
You have to listen to me!

774
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,523
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

775
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,233
The monster took her.

776
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,986
Liz: Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

777
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,155
Get down here now.

778
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,532
A... (Branch snaps, bird caws)

779
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,743
(Bear grunting) I...

780
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,369
Dee Dee!

781
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,509
(Gasps) (Bear growls)

782
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,678
(Sari and Liz scream)

783
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,555
Sari: Whoa!
(Liz continues screaming)

784
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,725
Liz: Peter!

785
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,602
(Gasps) No! Peter!

786
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,812
(Screaming)

787
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,067
Peter: Oh! Oh, no!

788
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,402
It let me go! He ran off!

789
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,155
Henry, jump down. It's too high.

790
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,490
Liz: Is it gone?

791
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,116
Do you see it?

792
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,954
(Rustling)

793
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,123
(Screams)

794
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,376
Yeah.

795
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,503
Why are you shooting at me?

796
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,754
Get your ass down!

797
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,255
This is your fault.

798
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,799
Right behind you. I saw it.

799
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,134
Stay down.

800
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,432
(Panting)

801
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,937
What? (Gasps)

802
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,611
(Liz panting)

803
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,244
(Bear roars) (Liz screaming)

804
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,039
Help me!

805
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,875
(Screams) Help!

806
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,130
(Bullet ricochets) (Yelps)

807
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,882
Peter: Ranger! Ranger!

808
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,384
Did it get you?

809
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,261
Liz: That asshole!

810
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,138
I'm gonna get him.

811
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,597
I'm gonna get that asshole.

812
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,100
(Groaning)

813
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,352
I'll get help.

814
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,729
Sari: Where are you going?

815
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,147
(Groans) God almighty.

816
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,149
Hey. What...

817
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,068
Where is it?

818
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,447
Sari: Hey!

819
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,617
What should I do?

820
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,244
Liz: Motherfucker!

821
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,537
Come back! Help us!

822
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,833
Peter: Oh, fuck!

823
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,294
(Frightened quavering)

824
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,590
There's something wrong with it.

825
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,008
Yeah, I told you there was.

826
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,302
Why is it acting like this?

827
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
Did you feed it cocaine?

828
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,598
No. But you're safe.

829
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,516
Bears can't climb trees.

830
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,851
Of course they can!

831
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,853
Then why are you up here?

832
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,772
(Panting)

833
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,066
(Whimpers)

834
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,044
(Shuddering breaths)

835
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,462
(Gasps)

836
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,173
It's okay. It's okay.

837
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,474
(Trembling breaths)

838
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,817
Okay.

839
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,487
(Gasps)

840
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,656
(Bear sniffing)

841
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,289
(Whimpers)

842
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,131
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

843
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,551
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

844
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,094
Climb. Sari: Go, Henry!

845
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,430
Henry, move! Go higher!

846
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,100
(Whimpering)

847
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,434
Peter: Go up! (Roaring)

848
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,311
Sari: Henry, go!

849
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,230
Oh, god.

850
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,817
Sari: Go, Henry! No! Whoa!

851
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,026
Sari:

852
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,112
Oh, god. Henry!

853
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,864
(Growling) (Henry grunts)

854
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,575
(Growls)

855
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,326
(Whimpers)

856
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,955
(Growls)

857
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,749
(Sniffing)

858
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,920
Oh, god.

859
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,589
(Growls)

860
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,464
Oh, shit.

861
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,221
(Yelps) No, no, no, no!

862
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,640
(Screaming)

863
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,393
Get offof me! No, no!

864
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,562
(Screams)
Get off! Get off of me!

865
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,231
(Screaming)

866
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,776
(Bones crunching) (Bear grunts)

867
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,820
Henry, jump! Jump down!

868
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,947
(Whimpers) Move, Henry!

869
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,408
(Peter continues screaming)

870
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,537
(Weak, gasping breaths)

871
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,831
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

872
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,334
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

873
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,461
(Grunts) Come on. Let's go.

874
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,504
Come on.

875
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,393
(Growls)

876
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,270
(Snorts, growls)

877
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,273
(Both panting)

878
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,734
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

879
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,529
(Gasping)

880
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,282
That was so messed up.

881
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,036
That little man
was an expert on bears

882
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,747
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

883
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,582
Wait. What did you say?

884
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,459
We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.

885
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,103
There was cocaine in the
forest, and the bear ate it

886
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,380
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

887
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,674
and now on that guy back there.

888
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,592
Did you hear him scream?

889
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,386
He's so dead.

890
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,514
Pdloveto not remember that.

891
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,516
But it kind of seems like

892
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,143
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

893
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,147
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

894
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
Alive? Yeah.

895
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,859
It chased her that way.

896
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,821
We got to go. Let's go.

897
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,365
(Bell jingling) (Panting)

898
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,242
He get at you, too?

899
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,036
Fucking beast.
Yeah, you can say that again.

900
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,497
Call an ambulance.
I already did.

901
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,501
Liz: Keep him awake.

902
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,003
Yeah, I've been trying.

903
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,521
You piles of shit!

904
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,940
You're the doochamps!
Hey, that's-that's not ours.

905
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,525
We found it.

906
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,361
(Panting)

907
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,946
"It's not ours."

908
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,033
I'm a park ranger.

909
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,201
I'm notdumb. I know.

910
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,746
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

911
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,456
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

912
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,332
I'd have been
at yellowstone by now

913
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,578
if it weren't for you shits!

914
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,793
Buds. Liz: Huh?

915
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,296
There's someone outside.

916
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,632
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

917
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,925
(Groaning) Yeah.

918
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,846
Now, uh, open it
when m count to three.

919
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,866
Wait, wait. But you're
gonna shoot him?

920
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,141
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

921
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,768
He took a bite out of my ass!

922
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,520
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

923
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,607
Now, open itwhen I say so.

924
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,195
Now.

925
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,238
(Panting)

926
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,365
That's a fucking bear.

927
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,245
(Screams)

928
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,248
What the fuck?

929
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,543
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

930
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,426
You're sorry? I'm sorry.

931
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,136
Where'd the bear go?
You killed him.

932
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,304
Where's the bear?

933
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,223
I don't know! Close the door!

934
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,018
Close the motherfucking door.
(Voice shaking) Jesus Christ.

935
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,436
Liz (whispers) Close the door.

936
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,233
Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.

937
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,155
(Bell jingling)

938
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,033
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

939
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,965
(Thumping)

940
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,183
Shh.

941
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,352
(Wood creaking)

942
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,355
(Whispering) He's up there.

943
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,773
He's up there.

944
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,319
(Panting quietly)

945
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,488
(Wind whistling)

946
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,243
(Thumping)

947
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,557
I got it. I got it.

948
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,856
(Panting)

949
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,649
(Bear growls) (Screams)

950
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,984
(Bird cawing)

951
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,527
Eddie: Maybe the kid
can help you.

952
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,821
Daveed: Look, I'm done
playing this game.

953
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,656
What game? 20 questions.

954
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,201
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

955
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,620
What did he ask so far?
He just keeps guessing.

956
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,747
Like, "is it a spider?

957
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,749
"Is it an arrow?" (Laughing)

958
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,001
What are you, new?

959
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,147
Stache: Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

960
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,464
Everybody knows that.

961
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,132
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

962
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,842
Is that one of your questions?

963
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,510
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

964
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,095
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

965
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,058
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

966
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,728
Is it bigger than a bread box?

967
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,231
Yes. Whoo!

968
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,607
(Chuckles) Yeah!

969
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,317
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

970
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,569
What? No.

971
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,822
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

972
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,866
You have one question left.

973
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,849
(Engine shuts off)
(Keys jingling)

974
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,533
(Slurping)

975
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,758
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

976
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,302
You sure this is the way?

977
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,220
Pretty sure.

978
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,519
Dee Dee! It's okay.

979
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,146
It's mama.

980
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,402
Thank god.

981
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,321
(Chuckles) Ew! What the heck?

982
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,656
It's paint. It's just red paint.

983
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,034
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

984
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,036
I'm a nurse, Henry.

985
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,287
Good point.

986
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,206
Come on.

987
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,963
Oh, smartgirl.

988
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,468
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

989
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,512
Mrs. Mckinndry, have
you ever done cocaine?

990
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,056
What?

991
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,600
Why do you ask?

992
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,894
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects,

993
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,272
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

994
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,609
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

995
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,195
What if they never want
to do it again?

996
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,739
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

997
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,617
But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry

998
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,911
because drugs,
especially cocaine,

999
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,121
are very, very bad.

1000
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,831
What if they would
never find out?

1001
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,375
Oh, Henry.

1002
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,627
We always find out.

1003
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,462
Dee Dee!

1004
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,757
No more words

1005
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,303
you're telling me you love me
while you're looking away

1006
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,430
no more words

1007
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,431
(back-up alarm beeping)

1008
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,641
No more...

1009
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,975
(Engine and music stop)

1010
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,406
Medic! (Knocking)

1011
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,811
Just open it.
(Doorknob rattling)

1012
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,283
Tom: Yeah, open it. You think?

1013
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,452
Beth: Canyou just
push? Harder. (Jingling)

1014
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,888
I'm doing it as hard as...
Just let...

1015
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,139
All right. You go. Let me do it.

1016
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,163
You go. Yeah.

1017
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,433
Please, show me how it's done.

1018
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,210
(Beth grunting, straining)

1019
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,775
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

1020
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,880
(Straining) Oh, yes,
I am. Let me see.

1021
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,924
What is that?

1022
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,926
See anything? Just, can you...

1023
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,511
Can you help?
Can you help? Yeah.

1024
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,239
What happened to
feminism, huh? Is that dead?

1025
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,074
(Grunting) Come on.
Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1026
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,683
(Jingling)

1027
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,227
Oh, fuck.

1028
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,512
Come on. (Phone line beeping)

1029
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,272
Beth: (Straining)
God, I'm trying.

1030
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,857
Come on, push. (Grunting)

1031
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,275
I'm trying.

1032
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,110
You said they called in
a concussion.

1033
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,738
They did.

1034
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,703
Jesus.

1035
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,288
This guy's been shot.

1036
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,123
Yeah. Obviously.

1037
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,000
(Liz wheezing weakly)

1038
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,668
Beth: Holy shit.

1039
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,878
It's the ranger.

1040
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,296
Tom. (Coughing)

1041
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,089
Come here. She's got a gun.

1042
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,093
Tom! Hello?

1043
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,098
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

1044
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,266
It's okay.

1045
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,977
B... did you shoot that guy?

1046
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,273
"Buh"?

1047
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,332
(Amplified heartbeat)

1048
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,132
Beth?

1049
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,010
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

1050
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,654
(Growls)

1051
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,410
(Door creaking)

1052
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,041
Beth, we should go.

1053
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,877
Beth: Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

1054
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,549
(Gasping) (Amplified heartbeat)

1055
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,012
Bean

1056
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,723
(gasps) Bear.

1057
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,770
Let's go. (Grunting)

1058
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,689
Tom, get up!

1059
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,650
(Grunting)

1060
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,360
(Yells, strains)

1061
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,987
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

1062
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,661
Hang on. Push.

1063
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,833
(Bear roars)

1064
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,167
Oh, shit.

1065
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,128
(Liz groaning) Sorry. Sorry.

1066
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,046
(Growling)

1067
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,424
(Tom grunting)

1068
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,052
Come on. Come on.
(Engine starts)

1069
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,572
Dj: (Over radio)
Anybody else surprised by

1070
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,948
that rain this morning?
I know! Was.

1071
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,307
Leave him!

1072
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,183
(Roaring)

1073
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,602

1080
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,168
Tom, get in! Wait! Wait!

1081
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,170
Wait! Oh, god.

1082
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,716
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

1084
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,138
What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?

1085
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,265
(Tires squealing)

1086
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,309
What the hell
have you got a gun for?

1087
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,810
Hey, move! Move!

1088
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,935
Put that away!

1089
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,355
I go out of my head

1090
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,440
and I just can't getenough“.

1091
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1092
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,903
(Straining)

1093
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,363
Oh, shit! Tom: Kill it!

1094
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,572
Not the tree!

1095
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,199
The big fucking bear! Shut up!

1096
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,825
Beth: Why is it chasing us?

1097
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,261
We slip and slide
as we fall in love...

1098
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,329
Tom, try to shut
the fucking door!

1099
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,748
Close the fucking door,
you dumb-ass!

1100
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,333
Guys, you got to stop
yelling at me!

1101
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,585
(Straining)

1102
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,710
(Tires squealing)

1103
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,838
(Screams) Oh, shit.

1104
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,468
Beth, speed up! (Gasping)

1105
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,136
(Pants, growls)

1106
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,971
(Whimpers)

1107
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,391
I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough

1108
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,934
(screams)

1109
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,937
I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough

1110
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,188
I just can't get enough

1111
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,690
(yelping, groaning)

1112
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,400
I just can't get enough...

1113
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,652
(Tires squealing)

1114
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,696
(Grunts) (Bear growling)

1115
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,115
You're like an angel
and you give me your love

1116
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,741
(both screaming)

1117
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,911
And I just can't seem
to get enough of

1118
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,116
(engine revs, tires squeal)

1119
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,288
(Screaming)

1120
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,918
(Screaming) (Bear snarling)

1121
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,923
(Screams)

1122
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,472
I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough

1123
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,474
I just can't get enough

1124
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,101
I just can't get enough

1125
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,270
I just can't get enough

1126
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,355
I just can't get enough

1127
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,816
I just can't get enough

1128
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,484
I just can't get enough

1129
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,695
I just can't get enough,
I just can't...

1130
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,614
Eddie: I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

1131
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,702
Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

1132
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,914
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

1133
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,583
And what a man you are.

1134
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,418
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

1135
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,544
Can you not?

1136
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm sorry. Justconfinue.

1137
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,923
Well, when my daddy died,

1138
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,384
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

1139
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,303
(Chuckling) Itwas
the coolest little thing.

1140
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,513
It had all these
green scales on it.

1141
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,807
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

1142
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,684
I thought that was so awesome.

1143
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,312
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

1144
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,272
but I practiced
conversation starters

1145
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,940
on that lizard every day.

1146
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,860
(Chuckles) And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.

1147
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,361
(Sighs)

1148
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,030
That's my team, man.

1149
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:46,116
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

1150
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,204
(Sighs) Those are my buds, man.

1151
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,706
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

1152
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,000
Well, you know what?

1153
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,836
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

1154
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,672
but people...

1155
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,509
People are good at hearing.

1156
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,763
(Eddie sniffling)

1157
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,974
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

1158
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,810
Can we... it's okay.

1159
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,686
Daveed: Y'all are hugging.
(Eddie sobs)

1160
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,146
It's okay.

1161
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,860
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

1162
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,029
(Birds chirping)

1163
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,789
(Panting)

1164
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,503
(Breathing deeply)

1165
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,432
(Panting)

1166
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,187
Can I say something without
you getting angry with me?

1167
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,733
I'm already angry with you.

1168
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,613
It's gone.

1169
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,324
What the actual...

1170
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,010
(Screams) No! Please,
please! Daveed, stop.

1171
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:53,469
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

1172
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,804
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

1173
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,468
I-I promise. I-I don't
know where it went.

1174
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,623
It's just gone.

1175
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,083
Okay, well, duffel
bags don't have legs.

1176
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,128
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

1177
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,421
I'm-a give you one more chance.

1178
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,131
Where's the ba...

1179
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,676
Put the gun down and
move away from the teenager.

1180
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:15,349
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

1181
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,809
All right, listen. Just
calm down, all right?

1182
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,186
I ain't fucking around.

1183
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,480
Just do it.

1184
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,733
Fuck.

1185
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,820
You don't want to do this.
Shut up!

1186
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,280
I'm coming down there.

1187
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,588
Uhm(groans)

1188
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,009
(Daveed and Eddie mouthing)
Uh...

1189
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,134
Shh!

1190
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:53,971
I'm just trying to...

1191
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,056
Find a safe spot to hop down.

1192
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,599
How did you get up there?

1193
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,185
Well, ijumped from
that tree over there, but...

1194
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,812
I hurt my hip a little.

1195
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,981
I can try to catch you
if you want.

1196
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,400
No, no! You stay
right where you are!

1197
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,987
Lets, uh, see, uh_.

1198
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,321
(Whispers) Get it.

1199
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,323
(Stache whimpering)
(Daveed groans)

1200
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,659
Fuck! (Yells)

1201
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,202
Fuck!

1202
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,662
(Groaning)

1203
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,306
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

1204
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,000
Oh, yeah? I shot
my own fucking fingers?

1205
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,668
I told you not to move.

1206
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,754
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

1207
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,548
They're not even
next to each other.

1208
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,425
(Groaning)

1209
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,968
Fuck you!

1210
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,344
(Stache gasping, whimpering)

1211
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,762
Bob: Come out of there!

1212
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,514
Shit! Come on out!

1213
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,807
No fucking way!

1214
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:40,975
(Stache screams)

1215
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,686
God! Goddamn it!

1216
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,023
You two, on your bellies.

1217
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,150
Now! And no more moving.

1218
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,153
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

1219
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,529
Can you grab them for me?

1220
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,822
Can I grab his fingers?

1221
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,407
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

1222
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,493
Slow. Slow.

1223
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,413
(Shuddering groan)

1224
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,664
Easy.

1225
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,082
Eddie: Ugh, god.

1226
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,627
All right.

1227
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,171
Now, you get back on your belly.

1228
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,006
I'll hold on to these.

1229
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,382
(Groans)

1230
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,680
Bob: Now, where you at?

1231
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,140
(Panting)

1232
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,266
Shit.

1233
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,519
Sari: What?

1234
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,854
Henry: Oh, no. The river.

1235
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,190
(Sarigasps)

1236
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,483
Henry, look.

1237
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,069
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

1238
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,362
Come on. So we're crossing?

1239
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,114
Sari: We're on the right track.

1240
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,449
I can feel it.

1241
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,791
(Dee Dee groans)

1242
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,959
(Panting)

1243
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,588
(Groans)

1244
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,258
(Crying) Mama?

1245
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,178
Fuck.

1246
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,722
Fuck, man.

1247
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,517
My fucking Jersey, man.

1248
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,687
Stache: How long are
you gonna keep us like this?

1249
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,523
Until that guy in the gazebo

1250
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,191
throws his weapon
into the woods.

1251
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,943
Well, then
we'll be here forever.

1252
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,779
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1253
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,115
We don't need to die
because of this.

1254
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,909
Eddie, I got this.
Eddie: Do you?

1255
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,745
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1256
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,288
You're all gonna get arrested.

1257
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,666
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1258
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,377
so get ready for 10 to 15 years

1259
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,462
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1260
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,381
and supervised shower time.

1261
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,050
Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1262
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,468
I've never even done coke.

1263
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,555
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1264
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,807
I can't go tojail.
You're not going to jail.

1265
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,535
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1266
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,203
I've never been able
to shit in front of people.

1267
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,020
I like to shit in peace.

1268
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,653
Nobody move.

1269
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,614
It's a bear.

1270
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,158
Bob: (Chuckling) Yeah.

1271
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,118
No, no.

1272
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,370
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1273
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,924
(Grunting softly)

1274
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,145
Oh, fuck.

1275
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,147
Hey, y'all just stay
still. Don't move.

1276
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,481
(Whispers) Just play dead.

1277
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,198
(Bear panting)

1278
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,123
(Bear moans)

1279
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,674
(Spits, whimpers)

1280
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,051
Eddie: Shh.

1281
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,446
(Bear sniffing)

1282
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:25,283
(Bear moans)

1283
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,702
(Eddie yelps)

1284
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,870
Oh, fuck.

1285
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,957
(Muffled grunting)

1286
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,002
(Stache shudders)

1287
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,256
Oh, man. You fucked.

1288
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,465
Eddie, can you breathe?

1289
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,342
Eddie: (Muffled) What the fuck?

1290
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,927
I think that's a yes.

1291
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,513
Eddie: Can someone do something?

1292
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,056
Maybe your boy can do something.

1293
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,810
Can you just, like... move it?

1294
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,187
Eddie: Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1295
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,524
(Muffled grunt)

1296
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,151
Sari: Dee Dee!

1297
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,154
Henry, stay close. I
haven't seen paint in a while.

1298
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,033
(Sobbing) Oh, god.

1299
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,994
Look.

1300
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,328
Hello.

1301
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,625
Is he okay?
(Olaf muttering, crying)

1302
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,461
Help me, please.

1303
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,046
Does he have food?

1304
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,924
Her name was Elsa,

1305
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,135
and she was so beautiful.

1306
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,594
(Sobbing)

1307
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,930
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1308
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,682
Were you attacked?

1309
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,434
Devil bear.

1310
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,704
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1311
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:35,955
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1312
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:36,979
Have you seen her?

1313
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,606
You have?

1314
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,317
Was she alive? Olaf: Yes.

1315
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,628
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1316
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,297
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1317
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,321
I haven't...

1318
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,363
Henry!

1319
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,628
I'll show you.

1320
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,797
I'll show you. Come.

1321
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,180
It's not moving.

1322
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,681
(Sighs)

1323
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,683
I think it died.

1324
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,769
Eddie: Itdied on top of me?

1325
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,062
Check its pulse.

1326
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,564
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1327
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,066
Eddie: I'm not sure.

1328
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,904
Uh, hey, guy?

1329
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,072
Detective.

1330
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,365
Can we call a truce

1331
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,116
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1332
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,409
Yeah.

1333
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,040
Fuck.

1334
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,088
You okay?

1335
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,006
Eddie: What do you think?

1336
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,012
(Grunts)

1337
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,814
(Sniffing)

1338
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,235
S-Still breathing.

1339
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,528
(Whispering) We should go.

1340
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,864
He'll probably be all right.

1341
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,950
Eddie: What the hell, man?

1342
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,410
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1343
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,286
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1344
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,579
Eddie: "She."

1345
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,705
What?

1346
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,791
Eddie: The bear is a girl.

1347
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,501
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1348
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,421
Eddie: Because its
vagina is on my ear.

1349
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,258
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1350
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,759
She's awake.

1351
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,011
Oh, shit. Well, stay
back. Stay back.

1352
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,597
(Grunts) Okay.

1353
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:37,767
(Grunts, gasps)

1354
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:39,519
(Whimpering)

1355
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,788
Daveed: Chill out.
Just chill out!

1356
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,647
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1357
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,357
Stay back. (Bear moaning)

1358
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,071
What the hell?

1359
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,615
Daveed: Okay. Okay.

1360
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,620
No, no, no, no. Don't
eat that. Don't eat that.

1361
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,665
I will be goddamned.

1362
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,250
Should we shoot her?

1363
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,587
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1364
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,255
(Moaning)

1365
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,466
(Whispers) What the fuck?

1366
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,095
(Exhales sharply)

1367
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,898
(Roars) No, no, no, no, no, no!

1368
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,774
Eddie! Eddie: Daveed, help.

1369
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,319
(Grunts) What is this?

1370
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,487
No, no. (Groans)

1371
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,572
Ooh! Okay, I have...
Eddie: What is it doing?

1372
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,240
I-I don't like this.

1373
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,492
Please stop.

1374
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,869
Just go limp! Slide down!
I'm limp already.

1375
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,829
(Screams)

1376
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,831
Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Eddie: Don't shoot!

1377
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,042
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1378
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,311
Eddie, you got to
fight back, all right?

1379
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,395
It's-it's playing with you.

1380
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,712
I'd stay still if I were you.

1381
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,964
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1382
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,175
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1383
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,551
Daveed!

1384
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,512
All we've been through! Come on!

1385
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,679
Come on, help him!

1386
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,723
Get lower. You're not listening!

1387
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,142
(Growling viciously) Eddie.

1388
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,852
Oh, my god. He's gonna die.

1389
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,063
(Screaming) (Bear snarling)

1390
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,649
Bob: Hey, girl.

1391
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,361
(Whimpering)

1392
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,741
(Bear moaning)

1393
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,451
Bob: There you go, girl.

1394
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,037
There you go.

1395
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,290
There you go.

1396
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,585
Stache: It's like
cocaine Christmas.

1397
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,213
(Moaning)

1398
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,384
(Eddie panting)

1399
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,221
(Chuckung)

1400
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,230
Don't have to tell me
twice. (Whimpers)

1401
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,317
Come on!

1402
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,443
Daveed!

1403
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,237
That bag's worth $14 million.

1404
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,198
We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.

1405
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,702
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1406
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,620
I need that bag.

1407
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,706
Eddie: Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1408
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,958
Daveed: We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1409
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,218
(Gunshot)

1410
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,928
(Bobwgroanwg) Shot_

1411
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,890
No. I didn't.

1412
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,436
(Roaring)

1413
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,063
Daveed: Run! Go, go!

1414
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,025
Oh, shit!

1415
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,321
(Panting)

1416
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,494
(Bear moans)

1417
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,873
(Both panting, grunting)

1418
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,708
Holy shit.

1419
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,210
Dad. What are you doing here?
Daveed: Oh, shit.

1420
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,214
Where's Gabe? You didn't
bring him here, did you?

1421
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,756
Calm down. (Daveed groaning)

1422
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,924
He's safe at home watching TV.

1423
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,760
What? How long
has he been alone?

1424
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,511
You left him with me!

1425
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,306
Do I look like "daddy
day care center" to you?

1426
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,142
Huh? (Daveed continues groaning)

1427
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,520
The fuck happened to you? A lot.

1428
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,482
Did you get the coke? A little.

1429
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,609
The bear ate most of it.

1430
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,611
What? The bear.

1431
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,571
It fucking did cocaine.

1432
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,198
A fucking...

1433
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,325
A bear did cocaine, dad!

1434
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,660
Fuck this!

1435
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,579
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1436
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,498
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1437
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,084
Look at me. Look at me.

1438
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,544
I'm on the hook here.

1439
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:38,299
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1440
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,134
And the people that I deal with,

1441
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,512
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1442
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,639
And look at me.

1443
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,059
They're gonna come
after me, my family

1444
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,978
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1445
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,356
You hear what I'm saying?

1446
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,274
It's you and Gabe.

1447
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,111
You understand?

1448
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,031
We don't have a choice.

1449
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,662
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1450
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,163
over at the pavilion structure.

1451
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,542
Come on.

1452
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,380
Come on, son. Come on.

1453
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,514
Bob: Who's there?

1454
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,308
Syd: Easy. Bob: Stay away.

1455
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,852
Where's the duffel?

1456
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,520
I gave it to the bear.

1457
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,522
You gave it to the bear?

1458
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,649
Bob: Yeah. The bear.

1459
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,068
It loves coke.

1460
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,155
Wh-which way did it go?

1461
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,157
I'm not fucking around here.

1462
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,825
Syd white.

1463
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,203
Man, I've been
following you for years.

1464
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,955
They all have.

1465
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,583
(Indistinct
police radio chatter)

1466
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,546
Reba. (Chuckles)

1467
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,048
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1468
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,341
I got you now.

1469
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,719
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1470
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:05,887
They're kind of shifty.

1471
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,684
What...

1472
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,145
What are you doing?

1473
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,234
I'm sorry, Bob.
(Mimics) I'm sorry, Bob.

1474
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,028
Reba: You shot him?

1475
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,237
I told you not to hurt him.

1476
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,906
I don't work for you.

1477
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,699
The department trusted you.

1478
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,827
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1479
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:34,999
The United States ofamerica,
it trusted you.

1480
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,834
I know.

1481
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,128
I trusted you with rosette.
I know.

1482
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,047
Who's rosette?

1483
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,340
The dog in my car.

1484
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,758
You left a dog in the car?

1485
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,718
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1486
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,303
How is she?

1487
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,436
(Smacking lips)

1488
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,522
She being a good girl?

1489
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,982
Reba: Yeah.
She's such a good girl.

1490
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,400
Syd: E-enough.

1491
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,569
Tell me which way the bear went,

1492
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,155
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1493
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,741
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1494
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,868
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1495
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,703
but that's just me.

1496
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,622
Well, what do you guys say?

1497
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,749
(Bob chuckling)
Syd: What's so funny?

1498
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,043
(Panting)

1499
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,420
Apex predator,

1500
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,632
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1501
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,844
(Bob chuckling)

1502
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,391
Dead north, man.

1503
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,309
(Bob chuckles) Yes, we will.

1504
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,062
Bob: Dead... dead north.

1505
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:39,689
Syd: Let's go.

1506
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,609
(Bob breathing heavily)

1507
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,513
(Moans)

1508
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,816
Olaf: The devil bear
is in there.

1509
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,485
You can't go in there.

1510
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,863
Do you have kids?

1511
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,531
We would have.

1512
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,199
I have to go find mine.

1513
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,368
And his name would be Texas.

1514
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,954
Do you have a flashlight? Yeah.

1515
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:43,669
Here.

1516
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:45,880
Thank you.

1517
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,466
Bye, lady and little man.

1518
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,842
Bye, you both.

1519
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,304
Okay.

1520
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,265
Olaf: Wait. What about me?

1521
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,740
(Breathing heavily)

1522
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,205
Sari: Watch where you step.

1523
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,668
I got you. Stay close.
(Henry gasps)

1524
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,588
Henry: What's that?

1525
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,470
Don't move.

1526
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,013
Stay still, Henry.

1527
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,851
(Moaning, growling)

1528
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,230
They look like polar bears.

1529
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,649
Dee Dee: Henry? Dee Dee?

1530
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:47,984
Mama! Henry: Deedee?

1531
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,628
Don't move. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

1532
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,946
No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. Dee Dee!

1533
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,406
Mama, uufl_. Baby!

1534
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,569
Henry: Dee Dee, you're okay.

1535
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,910
Sari: Are you hurt?

1536
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,262
It's just my leg.
Your leg? (Gasps)

1537
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,705
Henry: That looks really deep.

1538
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,748
Sari: Here. Don't touch it.
Ow! Ow! Henry!

1539
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,333
Let's keep you warm.

1540
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,778
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1541
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,169
You smart girl.

1542
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,796
Yeah. You left us clues.

1543
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,256
We found you.

1544
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,841
Put that on.

1545
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,635
Mom, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love you so much.

1546
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,262
Oh, my god.

1547
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,847
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

1548
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,212
I'm sorry. I just... it's okay.
Henry told me everything.

1549
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,600
Everything?

1550
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:22,995
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1551
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,520
You told her? Henry: No.

1552
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,439
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1553
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,816
I'm just so glad I found
you and you're okay.

1554
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,695
(Distant screaming)
Um, what was that?

1555
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,572
Cocaine bear's back.

1556
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,283
Can you walk? Uh, a little.

1557
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:38,701
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1558
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,870
Go that way. Go ahead.

1559
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,039
(Bear cubs sniffing, whining)

1560
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,207
It's okay. Come on.

1561
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,959
Henry: Look. It's a way out.

1562
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,462
(Water rushing)

1563
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:53,007
Dee Dee: It's the falls.
Henry: Oh, wow.

1564
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,894
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1565
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,395
Oh, god.

1566
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,626
(Panting)

1567
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,363
This is it.

1568
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,535
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1569
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,412
All right? Let's just
deal with the fallout.

1570
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,957
You saw what that
bear did to that hiker.

1571
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,084
(Grunts)

1572
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,671
Daveed: What is that?

1573
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,882
(Reba screams) Oh, fuck!

1574
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,051
Reba: What the fuck?
What the fuck?

1575
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,638
Syd: (Sighs) Come on.

1576
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,020
Eddie.

1577
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,313
Take this.

1578
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,318
(Sighs, shudders)

1579
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,195
Fuck.

1580
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,200
(Groaning, panting)

1581
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:46,162
Thank you.

1582
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,627
(Chuckles)

1583
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,548
Goddamn bear.

1584
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,009
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1585
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,640
(Bag zipping)

1586
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,395
Reba: You got what you wanted?

1587
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,521
Let's go.

1588
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,736
There's-there's a
lot more out there.

1589
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,614
We got to keep looking,
understand?

1590
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,910
We're not whole yet.

1591
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:27,912
I'm leaving, Syd.

1592
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,713
(Gun clicks)

1593
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,928
(Panting softly)

1594
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,401
Give me the bag.

1595
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,989
When did you all get so soft?

1596
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,867
All got sand in your pussies.

1597
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,912
(Bear cubs grunting)

1598
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,539
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1599
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,583
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1600
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,252
Stay away from the bears.

1601
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:20,714
Syd: This way.

1602
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,300
Come on. There's an opening.

1603
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,010
Henry, come here.

1604
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,846
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1605
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,475
(Gasps) He has a gun.

1606
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,731
No! (Yells)

1607
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:38,899
Come on!

1608
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,069
The hell is this?

1609
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,446
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1610
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,323
Dad. Who are you?

1611
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,158
I'm a mom.

1612
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,120
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1613
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,414
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1614
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,667
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1615
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,127
You understand?

1616
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,214
Eddie: Go.

1617
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,859
Syd: Come on. Help him out!
Yeah, yeah.

1618
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:07,678
(Straining)

1619
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,096
Eddie: It's stuck.

1620
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,140
Fuck!

1621
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,308
(Grunts)

1622
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,059
Who are these guys?

1623
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,978
(Grunting)

1624
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,354
We're going home.

1625
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,874
W-We're not gonna say
anything, but we're going home.

1626
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,233
Nobody's going anywhere!

1627
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,778
Dad. Shut up, Eddie.

1628
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,530
Shut_

1629
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,990
(Bear cubs grunting, growling)

1630
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,367
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1631
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,952
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1632
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,912
(Bear cubs squealing) Fuck.

1633
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,123
Get back! Get... fuckers!

1634
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,374
(Whimpers) Stay away.

1635
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,499
Whoa. Syd: Stay away.

1636
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,668
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1637
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,045
Eddie: Just give 'em the bag.

1638
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,838
Shoot the fucking bears!

1639
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,441
Get over here.
Dee Dee and Henry: Whoa!

1640
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,067
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1641
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,971
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1642
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,636
The fuck's the matter with you?

1643
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:53,724
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1644
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,267
Get 'em off me!

1645
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,061
Fuck him. Syd: Help me out!

1646
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,145
Ow. Eddie!

1647
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:01,982
Coward. Daveed!

1648
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,193
Here, catch.

1649
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:10,532
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1650
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:12,868
Mama!

1651
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:15,204
Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.

1652
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:16,997
Look around, dad.

1653
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,166
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1654
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,919
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1655
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,128
People are dead.

1656
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,255
You are no son of mine.

1657
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,548
Hey, you!

1658
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,841
You did this.

1659
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:29,635
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1660
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,012
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1661
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,014
because you're
a piece of crap person

1662
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,183
and a bad dad!

1663
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,601
Who the fuck are you?

1664
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,311
I'm Henry,

1665
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,439
and I am so fucking tired!

1666
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,649
Daveed: Yeah, me, too.

1667
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,234
(Bear cubs bellowing)

1668
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,238

1671
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,884
(Panting)

1672
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,594
Syd: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1673
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,596
Sari: She's protecting the cubs.

1674
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,764
Daveed: Oh, shit!

1675
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,349
We need to jump. Wait, what?

1676
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,576
What? I'll be fine!
Sari: It's gonna be okay.

1677
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,810
We're gonna be okay.

1678
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,061
Here, here, here.

1679
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,604
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1680
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,207
Get out of here!
It's not that far, you guys.

1681
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,900
We're gonna be all right.
(Snarling)

1682
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,485
Ready? Dee Dee: Mm-hmm.

1683
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,780
Three, two, one. Jump!

1684
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,408
(All screaming)

1685
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,245
Oh, shit. (Panting)

1686
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:43,500
(All gasping)

1687
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,502
(Growling)

1688
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:50,632
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1689
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,301
(Growling continues)

1690
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,012
Let's go!

1691
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,015
(Roars)

1692
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,517

(Grunting)

1696
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,962
Come on. It's okay.
(All panting, whimpering)

1697
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,883
Daveed: Eddie. Help.
Eddie: We made it.

1698
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,636
(Whining)

1699
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,137

1703
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,384
(Gasping)

1704
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,135
(Roars)

1705
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:25,227
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1706
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,357
(Whimpering)

1707
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,234
(Bear bellowing) (Groaning)

1709
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,496
(Pained yelling)

1710
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,293
(Gasps weakly)

1711
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,845
(All roaring)

1712
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,225
(Coughs) Oh, shit. He shot you.

1713
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,561
Help! Help!

1714
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,440
(Pained grunting)

1715
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,152
S-Six more days of John.

1716
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,320
Okay.

1717
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,447
Six more days...

1718
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,325
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1719
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,548
You're more than a
drug dealer, all right?

1720
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,329
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1721
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,539
All right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1722
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,293
Hey, hey, I...

1723
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,253
I got my last question.

1724
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,379
What?

1725
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,173
It's 20 questions.

1726
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,008
I got my last one.

1727
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,677
What? All right. Sure.

1728
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,473
Is it joanie?

1729
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,600
It's joanie, right?

1730
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,185
Yeah. Yeah.

1731
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,437
How'd you guess?

1732
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,815
You're so fucking
obvious. (Coughs)

1733
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,776
I just didn't want to guess it

1734
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,611
to have you crying
on me all day.

1735
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,363
(Chuckung)

1736
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,327
(Panting)

1737
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,081
She's a nurse!

1738
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,249
Eddie: He-he got
grazed by a bullet.

1739
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,459
Sari: He's in shock.

1740
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,336
Put pressure on him.

1741
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,338
(Henry breathing heavily)

1742
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:17,631
(Dee Dee sighs)

1743
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,792
(Whining)

1744
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,048
(Sighs)

1745
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:13,687
Reba: I've called backup.

1746
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,898
Her name's rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1747
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,192
You should get going.

1748
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,361
Take care of yourself.

1749
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,287
(Chuckung) Hi. Hi.

1750
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,165
Rosefie.

1751
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,301
(Eddie sighs)

1752
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:46,386
Whose dog is this?

1753
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,804
I think it's mine.

1754
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,514
Mine and Gabe's.

1755
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:50,932
Is it on cocaine?

1756
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,854
That's a good dog.

1757
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,776
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1758
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:01,943
Yeah.

1759
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,738
(Engine starts)

1760
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,824
I knew you'd be okay.

1761
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,228
You're the toughest person
I know.

1762
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,204
I think you get that
from your mom.

1763
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,539
I think you're right.

1764
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,541
Thanks for coming to get me.

1765
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,835
I'm your mom. I love you.

1766
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,629
You, too, Henry.

1767
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,049
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed
ray on you too soon.

1768
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,551
No. You deserve to be happy.

1769
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,888
Henry, let's walk over here.

1770
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,098
Stay away from that. Come on.
Henry: I want to look.

1771
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,642
I also don't want to look.

1772
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,268
Dee Dee: Ugh. Sari: Don't look.

1773
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,646
Let's just cruise on by.
(Sirens approaching)

1774
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,106
Henry: Oh, here come the po-po.

1775
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,566
Dee Dee: Hey, mom.

1776
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,902
I want to go to Nashville
with you and ray.

1777
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,738
Maybe we can go after me
and Henry get out of rehab.

1778
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,198
Sari: Rehab?

1779
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,825
Dee Dee: We're cokeheads now.

1780
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,117
You know?

1781
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:52,762
Henry: We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1782
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,204
Mrs. Mckinndry. Dee Dee: Mm-hmm.

1783
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,414
Sari: Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1784
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,346
(Moans) (Cubs yelping)

1785
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,367
Carol: Rodney,
are you getting it?

1786
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,809
Rodney: I swear to god, Carol.

1787
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,310
Carot well, then zoom in.

1788
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,729
Is the red light on?
No, I got it.

1789
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,524
Carol: Oh, they're so cute.

1790
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,025
Rodney: Oh, this is
gonna be good.

1791
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,318
(Growling) Carol: Wait.

1792
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:26,883
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1793
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:27,988
Rodney: Oh.

1794
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:29,698
Carol: Oh, shit.

1795
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,741
(White I/nes (rerecord) Playing)

1796
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:32,868
Bass

1797
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,536
ooh, white

1798
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,705
white

1799
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,166
ooh, white lines

1800
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,085
vision, dreams of passion

1801
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,254
blowing through my mind

1802
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,548
and all the while I think of you

1803
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,466
high price

1804
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,510
a very strange reaction

1805
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:52,721
for us to unwind

1806
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,723
the more I see, the more I do

1807
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,266
something like a phenomenon

1808
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,227
telling your body to come along

1809
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,187
but white lines

1810
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,272
(sheep bleating)

1811
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,066
Blow away

1812
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,443
stache: Hey.

1813
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,070
Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hey.

1814
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,200
Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang

1815
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,827
rang dang diggedy dang di-dang

1816
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,537
rang dang diggedy dang di-dang

1817
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,539
diggedy dang di-dang,
diggedy dang di-dang

1818
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,207
freeze

1819
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,293
rock

1820
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:25,294
freeze

1821
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:27,422
rock

1822
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:29,132
blow

1823
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,134
higher, baby

1824
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:32,886
get higher, baby

1825
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,431
get higher, baby, come on!

1826
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,642
A million magic crystals

1827
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,644
painted pure and white

1828
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,812
a multimillion dollars

1829
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,023
almost overnight

1830
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:49,069
twice as sweet as sugar,
twice as bitter as salt

1831
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,071
and if you get hooked, baby

1832
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,615
it's nobody else's fault,
so don't do it...

1833
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:55,533
Gabe: Daddy!

1834
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,328
(Chuckles, sniffles)

1835
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,622
(Rosette whimpers)

1836
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,958
Gabe: Is that for me?
Eddie: (Chuckling) Hey.

1837
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,335
Yeah, what do you think?

1838
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,671
Rang dang diggedy
dang di-dang...

1839
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:08,797
What's it eating?

1840
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,298
Diggedy dang di-dang

1841
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:13,093
rang dang diggedy
dang di-dang...

1842
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:14,302
Daveed: Oh, my god.

1843
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,429
They're weren't gonna
put 'em back on.

1844
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:17,597
Freeze

1845
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:19,683
rock

1846
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,810
freeze

1847
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:23,645
rock

1848
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,105
and blow

1849
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,148
higher, baby

1850
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:29,109
get higher, baby

1851
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,195
get higher, baby,
and don't ever come down

1852
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,446
freebase

1853
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,496
(Song fades)

1854
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:26,304

(Music fades)

1855
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:27,680
