1
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:27,064
Forget it,
too risky.

2
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,271
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:31,463
You say that every time.

4
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:34,664
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:36,544
I always say it,
and I'm right.

6
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,828
But then you forget
about it.

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,428
The days of forgetting are over,
remembering has begun.

8
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,509
You know what
you sound like?

9
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,306
- A sensible man.
- A duck.

10
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,467
Quack, quack!

11
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,828
You won't hear
it again.

12
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:54,349
I won't, so you won't hear
me quack again.

13
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:55,826
After tonight?

14
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:58,063
Correct. I got all
night to quack.

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,752
- More coffee for anyone?
- Yes.

16
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,661
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:10,828
The way it is now, it's the
same risk as with a bank.

18
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,822
It's more.
Banks are easier.

19
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,830
Federal banks aren't supposed
to stop a robbery.

20
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:20,508
They're insured, don't give a fuck.
You don't even need a gun.

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,631
This bloke hands
the teller...

22
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,351
a portable phone.

23
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,350
The bloke on the other
end of the phone says:

24
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,669
"We've got his little girl. Give
him the money or we kill her."

25
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:32,550
- It worked?
- Fuckin' way, it works.

26
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,824
Knucklehead walks into a
bank with a telephone...

27
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:39,304
not a pistol, not a shotgun,
a fucking phone!

28
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:41,628
He robs them, they
don't lift a finger.

29
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:43,425
They hurt the girl?

30
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,981
There probably never was one.
That's not the point.

31
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:50,105
The point is, they robbed the
bank with a telephone.

32
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,780
You want to rob banks?

33
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:55,542
I'm illustrating that it'd be
easier than what we do.

34
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:56,901
No more liquor stores?

35
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:59,581
What did I say?
No more liquor stores.

36
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,625
It's not a giggle anymore.
Too many foreigners.

37
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,785
Vietnamese, Koreans...

38
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,428
You say: "Empty the register",
they don't understand.

39
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,509
We'll end up
killing one

40
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:13,989
- I won't kill anybody.
- I don't want to either.

41
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:16,871
They'll put us in a situation
where it's us or them.

42
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:21,584
If not, it's these fucking Jews
had the store for 15 generations.

43
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:22,463
Granpa Irvin...

44
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,264
behind the counter
with a Magnum...

45
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,666
in his hand.

46
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,380
Try that with a phone,
see how far you get.

47
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,261
- Fuck it, we're out of it...
- What then, day jobs?

48
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,588
- Not in this life.
- What then?

49
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,025
"Garçon"! Coffee!

50
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:39,781
This place.

51
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,223
"Garçon" means boy.

52
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,428
Here?

53
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,071
A coffee shot?

54
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,671
What's wrong with it?

55
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,102
Nobody ever robs restaurants.

56
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:57,461
Why not?

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,741
Bars,
liquor stores...

58
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:02,021
gas stations...

59
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,063
you get your head blown off.

60
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,782
But restaurants, you catch
with their pants down.

61
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,829
They don't expect to be robbed.

62
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,585
Not as much, anyway.

63
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:14,949
I bet you could cut down
on the hero factor here.

64
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,028
Correct.

65
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,105
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

66
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,542
Manager don't give a fuck.

67
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,266
He want's you out before
you plug the diners.

68
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,987
Waitresses, take a bullet
for the register? No way.

69
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,264
Wetbacks paid
$1.50 an hour...

70
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,662
don't give a fuck if
you steal from the owner.

71
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,632
Customers don't know
what's going on.

72
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:40,541
They're eating, then someone
sticks a gun in their face.

73
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:45,629
I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up. Remember?

74
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,385
Customers kept coming in.

75
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:52,502
You thought of taking their
wallets? That was a good idea.

76
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:53,668
Thank you.

77
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:56,267
- Wallets paid more than the
register. -They did.

78
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,144
Lots of people
in restaurants.

79
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,666
A lot of wallets.

80
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:01,785
Pretty smart, huh?

81
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:03,741
Pretty smart.

82
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,101
I'm ready.
Let's do it, now, here.

83
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,031
- Come on.
- Alright.

84
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:12,511
Same as the last time.

85
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:13,463
You're crowd control...

86
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,105
I handle employees.

87
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,100
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

88
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,982
Everybody,
this is a robbery!

89
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:29,865
Any of you fucking
pricks move...

90
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:33,787
I'll execute every motherfucking
last one of you!

91
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,182
- Tell me about the hash bars.
- What about them?

92
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,906
- Hash is legal?
- It's legal, but not 100%.

93
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:56,031
You can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffing.

94
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:59,549
You can smoke at home
or designated places.

95
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:00,941
Those are has bars?

96
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,507
I'll break it down.
It's legal to buy...

97
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:06,465
it's legal to own and,
if you own a hash bar...

98
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:09,550
it's legal to sell.
It's legal to carry...

99
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:11,823
but, get a
load of this:

100
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,911
If a cop stops you, it's
illegal for him to search you.

101
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,542
Amsterdam cops don't
have that right.

102
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:22,222
That's all there is to it?
I'm fucking going.

103
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,150
I knew you'd dig it the most.

104
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,060
You know what's funny
about Europe?

105
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,870
The little differences.

106
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:34,065
They got the same shit we got,
but it's a little different.

107
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,626
Example?

108
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,466
You can buy a beer at
the movies in Amsterdam.

109
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:42,307
No paper cup. I' talking
about a glass of beer.

110
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,264
In Paris, McDonald's
sells beer.

111
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:46,067
You know what they call...

112
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:49,389
a Quarter-Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

113
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:51,583
"Quarter-Pounder with Cheese"?

114
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,392
They don't know pounds,
they got the metric system.

115
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,025
What do they call it?

116
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,230
"Royale" with Cheese.

117
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:01,589
"Royale" with Cheese?
How about a Big Mac?

118
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,870
Big Mac. But they
call it "Le Big Mac".

119
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,300
"Le Big Mac".

120
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,983
- What's a Whopper?
- I don't go to Burger King.

121
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:14,790
Know what they put
on French fries in Holland?

122
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:17,222
- Mayonnaise!
- Goddam!

123
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:21,264
I've seen it. They drown
them in that shit.

124
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,824
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

125
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,182
- How many up there?
- 3 or 4.

126
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:36,506
- Counting our guy?
- I'm not sure.

127
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:40,550
- Could be up to 5 guys?
- It's possible.

128
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,109
We should have
fucking shotguns.

129
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:44,422
What's her name?

130
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:45,742
Mia.

131
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:48,668
How did Marsellus and her meet?

132
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,340
I don't know. However
people meet people.

133
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,150
She used to be an actress.

134
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,547
Really? She do anything
I've seen?

135
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,260
Her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

136
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,110
What's a pilot?

137
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:03,190
- You know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

138
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,706
You know there's an invention
called television...

139
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:08,749
with shows shows?

140
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:14,144
They pick TV shows by making
one they call a "pilot".

141
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:16,627
Then they show it to
the people who pick shows...

142
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:19,790
and on the strength of that,
they decide.

143
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,381
Some get chosen and become
TV programs.

144
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,389
Some become nothing.

145
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,540
She starred in one of those
that became nothing.

146
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,184
Remember
Antwan Rockamora?

147
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:33,782
Half-black, half-Samoan,
called him "Tony Rocky Horror".

148
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,590
Maybe. Fat, right?

149
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,589
No, he's got a
weight problem.

150
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,027
What can he do?
He's Samoan.

151
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,109
I know him. What about him?

152
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,548
Marsellus fucked him up good.

153
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,142
Word around is it was on account
of Marsellus's wife.

154
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,224
What'd he do, fuck her?

155
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,070
Nothing that bad.

156
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,584
- What then?
- Gave her a foot massage.

157
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,430
A foot massage?

158
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,181
That's it?

159
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,909
What did Marsellus do?

160
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:15,150
Sent some cats to take him
out on his patio...

161
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:19,061
threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell 4 stories.

162
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:23,100
They had a garden at the bottom,
like a greenhouse.

163
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,189
Nigger fell through that.

164
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:28,151
Since then, he has a
speech impediment.

165
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,303
That's a damn shame.

166
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,983
Still, you play with matches,
you get burned.

167
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:41,221
What?

168
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,629
You don't give Marsellus's
new bride a foot massage.

169
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,390
You don't think he overreacted?

170
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,982
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react that way, but...

171
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,830
he had to expect
a reaction.

172
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:55,502
A foot massage is nothing.
I give my mother one.

173
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:59,068
It's laying hands in a familiar
way on de Marsellus's new wife.

174
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,464
Is it as bad as eating
her pussy out? No.

175
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,145
But same fucking ballpark.

176
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:08,550
Eating a bitch and giving her
a foot massage isn't the same.

177
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,062
- No, but same ballpark.
- It's no ballpark.

178
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:15,390
Maybe your massages
differ from mine...

179
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,184
but touching her feet...

180
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:20,304
and sticking your tongue
in her ain't the same.

181
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,066
It ain't even the same
fucking sport.

182
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:25,388
Foot massages don't
mean shit.

183
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,150
Ever given one?

184
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,542
Don't tell me. I'm the
foot fucking master.

185
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,305
- Given a lot?
- Shit, yeah!

186
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:36,185
Got my technique down.
I don't tickle or nothing.

187
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,907
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

188
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,780
Fuck you!

189
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,740
- Given them a lot?
- Fuck you!

190
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,786
I'm kind of tired.
I could use one myself.

191
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,870
You'd best back off.
I'm getting a little pissed.

192
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,508
- That is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

193
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,026
What time you got?

194
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:03,945
7:22 in the a.m.

195
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:06,666
It's not quite time yet.
Come on, let's hang back.

196
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,263
I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage...

197
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:20,265
but that don't make it right
to throw Antwan of a building...

198
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,345
fucking up the way
the nigger talks.

199
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:27,187
He do that to me, he better
paralyze me or I'd kill him.

200
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,348
I didn't say
it's right.

201
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,749
But you said it means nothing,
and I say it does.

202
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,706
I've given foot massages to ladies,
they all meant something.

203
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,587
We act like they don't, but they
do. That's what's so cool.

204
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:44,228
There's a sensuous thing,
but you don't talk about it.

205
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,509
But you and she know it.
Marsellus knew...

206
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,181
and Antwan should have
fucking known better.

207
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:54,626
She's his fucking wife. He won't
have no sense of humor about it.

208
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:56,505
You know what I'm saying?

209
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,510
It's an interesting point.

210
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:01,988
Come on, let's get
into character!

211
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,224
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

212
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:12,907
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

213
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,268
She's going to Florida
and he asked me...

214
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:18,032
if I'd take care of her
while he's gone.

215
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,542
- Take care of her?
- No, man!

216
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,431
Just take her out,
show her a good time.

217
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,390
Make sure she don't get lonely.

218
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,987
You're taking Mia Wallace
on a date?

219
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:29,745
It's not a date.

220
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:34,425
It's just taking your buddy's wife
to a movie, or something.

221
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,583
It's good company,
that's all.

222
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,100
It's not a date.

223
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,463
It's definitely not
a date.

224
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:53,427
Hey, kids.

225
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,871
How you boys doing?

226
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:57,905
Hey, keep chilling.

227
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,507
You know us?

228
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:08,862
We're associates...

229
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,546
of your business partner
Marsellus Wallace.

230
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,226
You do remember your
business partner?

231
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,829
Let me take a wild guess.

232
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,661
You're Brett.

233
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:26,981
I thought so.

234
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,865
Remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace?

235
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,227
I remember him.

236
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,268
Good.

237
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,470
Looks like we caught you at
breakfast. Sorry about that.

238
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,106
What you having?

239
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:40,948
Hamburgers.

240
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:44,940
Hamburgers. The cornerstone
of my nutritious breakfast.

241
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,421
What kind of hamburgers?

242
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,225
Cheeseburgers.

243
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,305
From where? McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box?

244
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,026
Big Kahuna.

245
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:59,030
Big Kahuna Burger,
the Hawaiian burger joint.

246
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,861
I hear they're tasty. Never had
one myself. How are they?

247
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,267
They're good.

248
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,145
Mind if I try one?

249
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,224
This is yours here, right?

250
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:23,344
This is a tasty burger.
Vincent!

251
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,709
Ever had a Big Kahuna Burger?

252
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,429
Want a bite?
They're tasty.

253
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,587
- Ain't hungry.
- Lf you like burgers, try them.

254
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,507
I can't get them 'cause my
girlfriend's a vegetarian...

255
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,220
so I got to be one
too, but...

256
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,181
I do love the taste
of a good burger.

257
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:46,510
Know what a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese is in French?

258
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,062
Tell him, Vincent.

259
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,229
"Royale" with Cheese.

260
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,945
"Royale" with Cheese.

261
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,187
You know why?

262
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,344
'Cause of the metric system?

263
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,025
Check out the big
brain on Brett.

264
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:06,704
A smart motherfucker!
Right, the metric system.

265
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:10,027
What's in this?

266
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,663
- Sprite.
- Sprite? Good.

267
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:16,668
Could I have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down?

268
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,587
Go right ahead.

269
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,865
That hit the spot.

270
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,066
You! Flock of Seagulls!
Know why we're here?

271
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:39,791
Tell my man where you
got the shit hid.

272
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:40,749
There.

273
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:43,944
I don't remember asking
you a goddamn thing!

274
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,502
So?

275
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,471
It's in the cupboard.

276
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,269
No, the one by your knees.

277
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:17,982
We happy?

278
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:20,427
Vincent!

279
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,307
We happy?

280
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:24,582
We happy.

281
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:30,911
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

282
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:34,070
I got yours. Vincent.
But I never got yours.

283
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:37,861
My name's Pitt, and your ass isn't
taking you out of this shit.

284
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,944
I just want you to know...

285
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:49,751
how sorry we are things got
so fucked up with us...

286
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:53,945
and Mr. Wallace. We got into
this with the best intentions.

287
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:54,868
Really.

288
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:59,186
Oh, sorry, did I break
your concentration?

289
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,789
I didn't mean to do that.
Please...

290
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,107
continue.

291
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,783
You were saying something
about "best intentions".

292
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,311
What's the matter?

293
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:11,870
Oh, you were finished.

294
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:14,302
Well, allow me
to retort.

295
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:20,705
What does Marsellus
Wallace look like?

296
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:22,309
What?

297
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:24,702
What country you from?

298
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:25,822
What?

299
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:28,906
Never heard of it.
They speak English in "What"?

300
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:30,382
What?

301
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,026
English, motherfucker.
Do you speak it?

302
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:34,751
Then you know what I'm saying.

303
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:38,103
Describe what Marsellus
Wallace looks like.

304
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:40,663
Say "what" again!

305
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,391
Say "what" again!

306
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:45,948
I doubledare you, motherfucker.
Say "what" once more!

307
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,262
He's black.

308
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,427
Go on.

309
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:50,582
Bald.

310
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:52,265
Looks like a bitch?

311
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:53,262
What?

312
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,188
Does he look...

313
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:58,871
like a bitch?

314
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,264
Why you try to
fuck him like a bitch?

315
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:05,509
Yes, you did, Brett.
You did.

316
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:07,788
You tried to fuck him and...

317
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,381
Marsellus Wallace doesn't
like to be fucked by anyone...

318
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,071
except Mrs. Wallace.

319
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:14,106
You read the Bible?

320
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:15,902
Yes.

321
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:16,862
There's this...

322
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:20,309
passage I got memorized,
sort of fits this occasion:

323
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,622
Ezekiel, 25, 17.

324
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:24,581
"The path...

325
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,222
of the righteous man is
beset on all sides...

326
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:32,260
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

327
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:37,349
Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and goodwill...

328
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,704
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness...

329
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,107
for he is his brother's
keeper...

330
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,986
and the finder
of lost children.

331
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:50,791
And I will strike down...

332
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,266
with vengeance and furious anger...

333
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:56,790
upon those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

334
00:19:57,032 --> 00:20:00,149
And you will know his
name is the Lord...

335
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:03,823
when I let my vengeance
upon thee!"

336
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,710
I think you'll find...

337
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,022
when all this is
over and done...

338
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:31,428
you'll find yourself one
smiling motherfucker.

339
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,225
Thing is, Butch...

340
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,106
right now you
got ability...

341
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,102
but, painful as
it may be...

342
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,787
ability doesn't
last, and...

343
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,622
your days are just about over.

344
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:55,588
That's a hard motherfucking
fact of life...

345
00:20:56,552 --> 00:21:00,261
but it's a fact your ass will
have to get realistic about.

346
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:07,464
This business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers.

347
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,341
Motherfuckers who thought their
ass would age like wine.

348
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,427
If you mean it turns
to vinegar...

349
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,060
it does.

350
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:22,068
If you mean it gets better
with age, it don't.

351
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,985
Besides, Butch...

352
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,545
how many fights you
think you got in you?

353
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:34,628
Two?

354
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,670
Boxers don't have
an old timers' day.

355
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:44,065
You came close, but
never made it.

356
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:48,428
If you were going to,
you'd have made it before.

357
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,266
You my nigger?

358
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:13,389
It certainly appears so.

359
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:23,583
The night of the fight you
may feel a slight sting.

360
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,460
That's pride
fucking with you.

361
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:32,751
Fuck pride!

362
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,711
Pride only hurts.

363
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,745
It never helps.

364
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:43,270
Fight through that shit...

365
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:46,584
'cause a year from now...

366
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,741
when you're kicking it
in the Caribbean...

367
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:53,911
you'll say to yourself:
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

368
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:58,387
I've got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace.

369
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:03,584
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

370
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,187
Say it.

371
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:14,382
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

372
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:19,826
Vincent Vega, our man
in Amsterdam.

373
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:23,542
Jules Wingfield, our man in
Inglewood. Get your asses in here.

374
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,706
Nigger, what's
with them clothes?

375
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:27,901
You don't want to know.

376
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:33,149
- Where's the big man?
- There, taking care of business.

377
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,665
Hang back a second.
You see the white boy leave...

378
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:38,066
go on over.

379
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:42,226
How you been?

380
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:45,826
- Pretty good. And you?
- Alright.

381
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,190
I hear you're taking Mia out?

382
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:56,147
At Marsellus's request.

383
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,347
- Have you met her?
- Not yet.

384
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,792
- What's so fucking funny?
- Not a thing.

385
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,540
I got to piss.

386
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,750
I'm no idiot. It's
the big man's wife.

387
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:12,591
I'll sit across from her,
chew with my mouth closed...

388
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,384
and laugh at her jokes.

389
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,465
My name's Paul, and this
shit's between y'all.

390
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,902
Then, why'd you
ask me about it?

391
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,307
Asshole.

392
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:30,942
- A pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

393
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:39,227
- Looking at something, friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

394
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:44,463
- What was that?
- You heard me fine, Punchy.

395
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,023
Vincent Vega's in the house?

396
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:50,344
My nigger, get your
ass over here!

397
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,062
Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

398
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:09,185
And some matches.

399
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:20,790
It's as if it turns every part of
your body into the tip of a penis.

400
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,549
There's a great book
on piercing.

401
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,028
They use that gun
to pierce your ears.

402
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:29,183
For your nipples as well?

403
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:32,947
That gun goes against the
entire idea behind piercing.

404
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,381
All my piercing...

405
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:37,868
18 places on my body, every
one done with a needle.

406
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:41,149
5 in each year. One trough
the nipple of my left breast.

407
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:44,151
2 in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

408
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,025
One in my belly,
my lip and my clit.

409
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,064
And I wear a stud
in my tongue.

410
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:53,062
Excuse me, I was
just curious.

411
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,101
Why wear a stud
in your tongue?

412
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:57,820
Sex thing.

413
00:25:58,152 --> 00:25:59,505
Helps fellatio.

414
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,021
Vincenzo.

415
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,266
Step into my office.

416
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:10,986
This is Panda...

417
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,745
from Mexico. Very good stuff.

418
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:15,751
That's Bava. Different,
but equally good.

419
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:17,626
Choco, from the Hartz Mountains...

420
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:18,981
of Germany.

421
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:20,705
The first 2 are the same.

422
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,347
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

423
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,306
But this one is a
little more expensive.

424
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,582
This is 500 a gram.

425
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:31,869
When you shoot it, you'll
know where that money went.

426
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:35,508
These 2 are just fine.
It's real good shit.

427
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,671
But this one is a
fucking madman.

428
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:42,020
Remember, I just got
back from Amsterdam.

429
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,946
Am I a nigger? Are we in
Inglewood? No.

430
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,546
You're in my home.

431
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,700
Whites who can tell good shit
from bad shit come here.

432
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:54,503
I'll take the Challenger with
that Amsterdam shit...

433
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,191
any day of the week.

434
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:57,984
That's a bold statement.

435
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:01,185
This ain't Amsterdam.
This is a seller's market.

436
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,782
Coke is fucking
dead as...

437
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:05,542
dead.

438
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:08,425
Heroin's coming back in
a big fucking way.

439
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:13,306
Alright, give me 3 grams
of madman.

440
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,710
If it's good as you say,
I'll buy another $1.000.

441
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:19,467
I just hope I have some
left for you.

442
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:23,661
I'm giving you some out of
my own private stash.

443
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,829
That's what a nice guy I am.

444
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,910
I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie alright?

445
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:31,101
Yeah, that's cool.

446
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,469
I'll get one for you. Honey...

447
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,901
get me some baggies and
twisties from the kitchen!

448
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:41,622
What do you think about Trudi?

449
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:45,063
She has no boyfriend. You want
to hand out, get high?

450
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,389
Which one's Trudy? One
with the shit in her face?

451
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:51,902
No, that's Jody.
That's my wife.

452
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:56,425
That one hurt, man.

453
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,902
- I must be someplace.
- No problemo.

454
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,340
I'll take a rain check.

455
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:07,106
"Thank you, Jody."

456
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,225
Still got your Malibu?

457
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:13,629
You know what some fucker
did the other day?

458
00:28:13,832 --> 00:28:15,390
- What?
- Fucking keyed it.

459
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,549
Oh, man, that's fucked up!

460
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,986
Tell me.

461
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:21,188
I had it stored for 3 years.

462
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,110
It was out 5 days...

463
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,826
and some piece of shit
fucked with it.

464
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:29,627
They should be executed.
No trial, no jury.

465
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:32,348
I'd have given anything...

466
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:34,702
to have caught that
asshole doing it.

467
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:37,671
It'd be worth him doing it
if I could catch him.

468
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:39,021
Fucker.

469
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:42,151
What's more chickenshit than
fucking a man's car?

470
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,707
- You don't do that.
- You don't.

471
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:46,709
It's just against the rules.

472
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,227
Thank you.

473
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:52,589
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Mi casa, su casa.

474
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:35,666
Hi, Vincent.

475
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,988
I'm getting dressed.
The door's open.

476
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:41,224
Come in and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

477
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:51,862
Hello?

478
00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:05,504
I'm on the intercom.

479
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:08,023
Where's the intercom?

480
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:11,305
On the wall, by the
two African fellas.

481
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:12,706
To your right.

482
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:17,426
Warm.

483
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:19,706
Warmer.

484
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,501
Disco.

485
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:23,267
Hello.

486
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,347
Push the button
if you want to talk.

487
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:29,987
Hello.

488
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:34,022
Get a drink.
I'll be down in 2 shakes.

489
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:36,748
The bar's by
the fireplace.

490
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:43,301
Let's go.

491
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,550
What the fuck is this place?

492
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:53,421
It's Jackrabbit Slim's.

493
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,303
An Elvis man
should love it.

494
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,304
Let's go get a steak.

495
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:00,707
You can get one here, daddy-o.

496
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:01,941
Don't be a...

497
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:05,743
After you, kitty-cat.

498
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:28,867
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.
How may I help you?

499
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,182
There's a reservation
under Wallace.

500
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:35,821
- We reserved a car.
- Oh, a car!

501
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:37,546
You seat them...

502
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,026
in the Chrysler.

503
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,023
Let's hear it for
Ricky Nelson.

504
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:46,149
Ricky Nelson!
Fantastic job!

505
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:55,991
Ricky will be back in the 2nd
half of our show.

506
00:34:56,312 --> 00:34:59,861
We hope you enjoy your meal
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

507
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:01,107
Thank you.

508
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:05,663
Call for Phillip Morris!

509
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,111
What do you think?

510
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:13,910
It's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

511
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,584
I'm Buddy. What'll you have?

512
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:24,870
Let's see. Steak. I'll have
this Douglas Sirk steak.

513
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:27,581
- I'll have that.
- How do you want it?

514
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,430
Burnt or bloody?

515
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:32,385
Bloody as hell. And look
at this, vanilla coke.

516
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,591
How about you, Peggy Sue?

517
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,548
I'll have the...

518
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:40,982
Durward Kirby burger...

519
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,466
bloody...

520
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:44,950
and...

521
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,105
a $5 shake.

522
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,587
Martin and Lewis or
Amos 'N' Andy?

523
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:50,907
Martin and Lewis.

524
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:53,623
Did you just order
a $5 shake?

525
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:58,432
That's a shake? That's
milk and ice cream?

526
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:01,311
- Last I heard.
- It costs $5?

527
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,031
No bourbon in it, nothing?

528
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,022
No.

529
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:06,422
- Just checking.
- I'll be right back.

530
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:16,308
Could you...

531
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,222
roll me one of those,
cowboy?

532
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,144
Have this one, cowgirl.

533
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:23,862
Thanks.

534
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,070
Think nothing of it.

535
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:37,747
So...

536
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:40,747
Marsellus said you were
in Amsterdam.

537
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:43,507
- Sure did.
- How long?

538
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,265
Just over 3 years.

539
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:51,470
I go once a year to
chill out for a month.

540
00:36:52,032 --> 00:36:54,705
No kidding? I didn't know that.

541
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:57,507
Why should you?

542
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:03,864
I heard you did
a pilot.

543
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:07,468
That was
my 15 minutes.

544
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,101
What was it?

545
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:13,670
A team of female secret agents
called "Fox Force Five".

546
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:14,742
What?

547
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:18,549
Fax, as in a bunch
of foxy chicks.

548
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,425
Force: A force to
be reckoned with.

549
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:23,782
And 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of us.

550
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
The blonde, Sommerset O'Neal,
was the leader.

551
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:30,505
The Japanese fox was
a Kung Fu master.

552
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:33,863
The black girl was a
demolition expert.

553
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:37,032
The French fox's
specialty was sex.

554
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:38,621
What was yours?

555
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:40,422
Knives.

556
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:43,503
My character, Raven McCoy...

557
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:47,148
had grown up raised
by circus performers.

558
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,420
She was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

559
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:54,148
And knew a zillion old jokes.

560
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:57,509
Her grandfather, an old
vaudevillian, taught her.

561
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,109
If we'd got picked up...

562
00:38:00,352 --> 00:38:02,468
they'd have had a gimmick.
So, in every show...

563
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:04,947
I'd have told an
old joke.

564
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,785
You know any of them?

565
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:12,309
I only told one 'cause we
only did one show.

566
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:13,702
Tell me.

567
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:15,067
It's corny.

568
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:17,585
Don't be that way. Tell me.

569
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:21,701
- No, I'd be embarrassed.
- Embarrassed?

570
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,465
You told 50 million
people...

571
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:25,225
and you can't tell me?

572
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:27,351
I promise I won't laugh.

573
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,304
That's what I'm afraid of.

574
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:31,624
You know I didn't
mean that.

575
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:34,949
I won't tell you. It's been
built up too much.

576
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,501
What a gyp.

577
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:40,911
Martin and Lewis.

578
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:45,231
Vanilla Coke.

579
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,627
Yummy.

580
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,505
Could I have a sip?

581
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,066
Be my guest.

582
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,740
I got to know what a
$5 shake tastes like.

583
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,750
Use my straw.
I don't have kooties.

584
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:07,341
Maybe I do.

585
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:08,701
Kooties I can handle.

586
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:11,388
Alright.

587
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:21,587
That's a pretty fucking
good milkshake.

588
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,868
Told you.

589
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:25,382
Maybe not worth $5,
but good.

590
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,261
Don't you hate that?

591
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:02,347
Hate what?

592
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:04,469
Uncomfortable silences.

593
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:08,948
Why do we have to
yak about bullshit...

594
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,864
in order to be comfortable?

595
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,028
I don't know.
That's a good question.

596
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
Then you know you found
somebody special.

597
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:22,186
When you shut the fuck
up for a minute...

598
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:23,984
and comfortably share silence.

599
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:27,702
We're not there yet, but
we just met each other.

600
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,627
I'll tell you what.

601
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:35,027
I'll go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

602
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:38,790
You sit here and think
of something to say.

603
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:40,941
I'll do that.

604
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:12,023
I said goddamn!

605
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,631
Goddamn!

606
00:41:27,872 --> 00:41:30,306
Don't you love coming
back from the bathroom...

607
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:32,150
to find your food waiting?

608
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:34,349
We're lucky we
got everything.

609
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:36,543
Buddy Holly's not
much of a waiter.

610
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:38,548
We should have sat in...

611
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:39,867
Marilyn Monroe's section.

612
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,624
- There's 2 Monroes.
- No.

613
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,627
That's Marilyn Monroe.

614
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:47,663
That's Mammie...

615
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:48,742
Van Doren.

616
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:50,463
I don't see...

617
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:53,061
Jayne Mansfield.
She must have the night off.

618
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:54,621
Pretty smart.

619
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:56,542
I got my moments.

620
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:58,551
Did you think of something?

621
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:00,267
Yes, I did.

622
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:03,462
However...

623
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,830
you seem like a nice person.

624
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:10,790
I don't want to offend you.

625
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:16,708
Doesn't sound like the usual, boring
getting-to-know-you chit-chat.

626
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,142
Sounds like you have
something to say.

627
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:19,829
Well...

628
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:21,829
I do.

629
00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:26,582
- But promise not to be offended.
- No, no...

630
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:30,701
I can't. I've got no idea
what you're going to ask me.

631
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:32,504
Say you asked me...

632
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:35,465
and my natural response
was to get offended.

633
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,822
Then I'd have broken
my promise.

634
00:42:38,352 --> 00:42:40,422
- Forget it.
- Impossible.

635
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:44,387
Forgetting anything this intriguing
is an exercise in futility.

636
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:46,628
- Is that a fact?
- And besides...

637
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:49,983
isn't it more exciting when
you don't have permission?

638
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,420
Alright.

639
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:53,230
Well, here goes.

640
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:57,150
What do you think about
what happened to Antwan?

641
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:58,228
Who's Antwan?

642
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:00,349
Tony Rocky Horror.
You know him.

643
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:02,067
He fell out of a window.

644
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:05,624
That's one way to say it.

645
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:07,868
Another would be that
he was thrown out.

646
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:11,349
Another would be that Marsellus
threw him out.

647
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:12,871
And yet another way...

648
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:16,428
is that Marsellus threw him
out because of you.

649
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,151
Is that a fact?

650
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,865
No, it's not. It's just
what I heard.

651
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,502
- Who told you?
- They.

652
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:27,185
"They" talk a lot.

653
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:31,791
They certainly do.

654
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:33,789
Don't be shy.
What else they say?

655
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,550
I'm not shy.

656
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:37,188
Did it involve...

657
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:38,461
the F-word?

658
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:42,351
Just that Antwan had
given you a foot massage.

659
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:45,066
- And?
- And...

660
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:47,382
And nothing. That's it.

661
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:51,351
You heard Marsellus...

662
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:55,147
threw Tony out a 4th-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

663
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:57,461
You believed that?

664
00:43:58,912 --> 00:44:01,949
At the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

665
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:04,905
Marsellus throwing Tony
out the window...

666
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,751
for massaging my feet,
reasonable?

667
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,188
No. But that doesn't
mean it didn't happen.

668
00:44:10,712 --> 00:44:13,943
I understand Marsellus
is very protective of you.

669
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:17,983
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

670
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:22,027
Almost killing a man for touching
his wife's feet is another.

671
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:24,709
- Did it happen?
- Only thing...

672
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,267
Antwan touched was my
hand when he shook it...

673
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,506
at my wedding.

674
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:31,508
Really?

675
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:35,423
Nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

676
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,224
except Marsellus and Tony.

677
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:41,103
But when you scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

678
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:43,021
Ladies and gentlemen...

679
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:45,348
the moment you've
been waiting for.

680
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:50,143
The world famous Jackrabbit
Slim's twist contest...

681
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:54,908
where...

682
00:44:55,512 --> 00:44:56,945
one lucky couple...

683
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,065
will win the handsome trophy
Marilyn is holding.

684
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:02,865
Now, who will be...

685
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:04,869
our first
contestants?

686
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:05,663
Here.

687
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:08,662
I wanna dance.

688
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:14,990
I believe Marsellus,
my husband, your boss...

689
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:17,752
told you to take me out
and do what I want.

690
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:21,746
Now I want to dance.
I want to win that trophy.

691
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:22,941
So, dance good.

692
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:24,267
You asked for it.

693
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,302
Let's hear it for them.

694
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:34,186
Let's meet our first
contestants this evening.

695
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:35,871
Young lady, what is your name?

696
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:38,145
Mia Wallace.

697
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,628
How about your fella here?

698
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:42,461
Vincent Vega.

699
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,552
Let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

700
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:25,987
Is this what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

701
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:29,147
I don't know what
you call that.

702
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:32,990
Drinks! Music!

703
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:35,105
I'm going to take a piss.

704
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:40,584
That's a bit more information
than I needed but, go ahead.

705
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,224
One drink and that's it.

706
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:37,382
Don't be rude. Drink your
drink, but do it quickly.

707
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:41,382
Say "good night"
and go home.

708
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:18,663
See, this is moral
test of ourselves...

709
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:21,261
whether you can maintain
loyalty...

710
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:22,588
because...

711
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,868
being loyal is very important.

712
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:17,380
So, you say "Good night, I've
had a very lovely evening"...

713
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:20,868
walk out the door,
get in the car...

714
00:51:21,472 --> 00:51:23,747
go home, jerk off,
and that's all.

715
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:11,071
Alright, Mia.

716
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,509
Listen, I must go.

717
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:14,862
Alright?

718
00:52:18,112 --> 00:52:20,421
Jesus fucking Christ!

719
00:52:21,592 --> 00:52:23,822
Jesus Christ!

720
00:52:24,032 --> 00:52:26,421
Fuck me! Fuck me!

721
00:52:26,712 --> 00:52:29,988
Come on, we're getting out of
here. We must walk now.

722
00:52:40,712 --> 00:52:41,428
Don't fucking...

723
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:42,747
die on me!

724
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:44,581
Silly fuck!

725
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:53,387
Answer!

726
00:52:53,752 --> 00:52:56,630
- Have you got the ring?
- Certainly.

727
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:59,630
Join hand, you love birds.
Come on.

728
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,783
Hold hands, love birds!

729
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:12,823
Fuck you, Lance,
answer!

730
00:53:18,352 --> 00:53:20,991
- What do you say?
- Okay, I'll marry you.

731
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:27,351
Lance, the goddamn
phone is ringing!

732
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:29,980
I can hear it!

733
00:53:30,392 --> 00:53:33,702
Thought you told them
not to call this late!

734
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:34,788
I told them...

735
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:38,223
and that's exactly what I'll
tell this fucking asshole.

736
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,143
Hello?

737
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:44,990
Lance, Vincent.

738
00:53:45,552 --> 00:53:48,225
I'm in big fucking trouble.
I'm coming over.

739
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:52,265
Hold your horses.
What's the problem?

740
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:54,428
I've got a chick
O.D. Ing on me.

741
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:55,462
Don't bring her here.

742
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:57,424
I'm not joking.

743
00:53:57,632 --> 00:53:59,702
Don't bring a pooh-butt
to my house.

744
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:00,469
No choice!

745
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:01,702
She's O.D. Ing?

746
00:54:02,032 --> 00:54:03,704
She's dying on me.

747
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:08,951
Bite the bullet, take her to a
hospital and call a lawyer.

748
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:09,704
Negative.

749
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,550
It's not my fucking problem!

750
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,788
You fucked her up.
Fucking deal with it!

751
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,541
Are you talking on
a cellular phone?

752
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:22,425
Who is this? I'm hanging up.
Prank caller!

753
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:34,151
What the hell was that?

754
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:38,023
Have you lost your mind?

755
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:40,223
Talking about drugs
on a cellular!

756
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,582
- You crashed my house!
- Grab her feet.

757
00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:46,949
You deaf? You're not bringing
that fucked-up bitch into my house.

758
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:51,307
The bitch is Marsellus Wallace's
wife. Know who he is?

759
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:53,982
If she croaks on me,
I'm a grease spot.

760
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:57,065
I'll be forced to
tell him...

761
00:54:57,272 --> 00:55:00,389
you didn't help and you let
her die on your fucking lawn.

762
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,423
Help me. Pick her up.

763
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:04,908
Shit!

764
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:08,822
Lance!

765
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:11,182
Shit!

766
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:16,261
It's 1:30 in the morning. What
the fuck's going on out here?

767
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,141
Who's she?

768
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:22,430
Go to the fridge and
get the adrenaline shot.

769
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:24,623
- What's with her?
- She's O.D. Ing!

770
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:26,948
- Get her out!
- Get the shot!

771
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:28,744
Fuck you! Fuck you too!

772
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:31,671
- Fucking bitch!
- Keep talking to her.

773
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:35,547
- I'll get my black medical book.
- Why do you need that?

774
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,983
- To tell me what to do.
- Never given an adrenaline shot?

775
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:42,104
Never had to. My friends
handle their highs!

776
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:43,984
- Get the shot!
- Just let me!

777
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:46,786
- I'm not stopping you!
- Not to me, talk to her!

778
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:48,107
- Get the shot!
- Alright!

779
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,583
- We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

780
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:58,989
- What's he looking for?
- Some book.

781
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,831
- What are you looking for?
- My black medical book.

782
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:03,067
What?

783
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:06,708
My medical book. It's like a
textbook they give to nurses.

784
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:10,265
- I never saw it.
- Trust me, I have one.

785
00:56:10,472 --> 00:56:12,463
Why not keep it
with the shot?

786
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:14,151
Stop bothering me!

787
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,946
While you look, she'll
die on your carpet.

788
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:20,303
- You'll never find it here.
- Lf you don't shut up, honey...

789
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:21,865
Lance, get in here!

790
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:25,311
Get the fuck out of my way.

791
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:26,707
Pig!

792
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:28,231
Quit fucking around.
Give her the shot.

793
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:31,868
Take off her skirt and
find her heart.

794
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:34,871
Must it be exact?

795
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:37,108
For a shot in the heart,
I guess so.

796
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,382
I'm not sure.
Maybe here?

797
00:56:39,592 --> 00:56:43,141
- That's it.
- I need a big Magic Marker.

798
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:44,822
You got it?

799
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:46,351
- What?
- A Magic Marker!

800
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:49,143
A felt pen!
A Magic Marker!

801
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:52,344
- Come on, hurry up.
- Fuck!

802
00:56:52,552 --> 00:56:55,385
Okay.
I think it's ready.

803
00:56:58,592 --> 00:56:59,820
Hurry up, man.

804
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:00,828
I'll tell you.

805
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:03,102
I ain't doing it,
you are.

806
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:05,064
- I ain't doing it.
- Me either.

807
00:57:05,272 --> 00:57:07,740
- I've never done this.
- Me either, and I won't now.

808
00:57:07,952 --> 00:57:09,670
You brought her here.

809
00:57:09,872 --> 00:57:12,830
If I ever bring an O.D. Ing bitch
to you, I'll do it.

810
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:14,624
- Give it to me.
- Here.

811
00:57:16,472 --> 00:57:17,541
Tell me what to do.

812
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:20,591
You're giving her adrenaline
to the heart.

813
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:23,465
But you must pierce
through the breast plate.

814
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:26,664
Bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

815
00:57:26,872 --> 00:57:30,262
- I stab her 3 times?
- Not 3 times, just once...

816
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:33,032
but hard enough to get
through her breast plate.

817
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:35,666
Then you press down
on the plunger.

818
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,146
Then what happens?

819
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:40,785
- I'm curious myself.
- It's no joke. Will I kill her?

820
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:43,062
She'll come out of it.

821
00:57:43,512 --> 00:57:44,627
Count to 3.

822
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,345
- Ready?
- One.

823
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:53,107
Two.

824
00:58:01,832 --> 00:58:02,344
Three!

825
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:18,301
If you're alright...

826
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:20,026
say something.

827
00:58:21,152 --> 00:58:22,062
Something.

828
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:25,469
That was fucking trippy.

829
00:58:28,432 --> 00:58:29,660
Oh, man!

830
00:58:54,392 --> 00:58:56,189
Mia. Mia.

831
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:02,671
What's your thoughts...

832
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:05,024
on how to handle this?

833
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:06,981
What's yours?

834
00:59:10,432 --> 00:59:12,468
I'm of the opinion...

835
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:16,864
that if Marsellus lived long, he
doesn't have to know anything.

836
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:22,551
If Marsellus knew about this,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

837
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:24,505
I seriously doubt that.

838
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:27,623
I can keep a secret,
if you can.

839
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:31,301
Shake on it?

840
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:38,741
Mum's the word.

841
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:40,661
Cool.

842
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:44,220
Now I'll go home to
have a heart attack.

843
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:48,704
Vincent!

844
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,026
Want to hear my
"Fox Force Five" joke?

845
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,547
Sure...

846
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:00,469
except I'm still too
petrified to laugh.

847
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:01,184
You won't...

848
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:02,586
'cause it's not funny...

849
01:00:03,112 --> 01:00:05,307
but if you want to hear
it, I'll tell you.

850
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:07,426
I can't wait.

851
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,824
3 tomatoes are walking.

852
01:00:11,032 --> 01:00:12,943
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

853
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:17,783
Baby starts lagging behind
and Papa gets real angry.

854
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:20,666
He goes back, squishes
him, and says:

855
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:21,748
"Catch up."

856
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:26,462
Ketchup.

857
01:00:31,512 --> 01:00:32,547
See you around.

858
01:00:54,072 --> 01:00:57,189
That Paddlefoot, he funny,
silly dog.

859
01:00:57,392 --> 01:01:00,031
He think totem pole alive,

860
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:02,988
He arctic tenderfoot.

861
01:01:04,632 --> 01:01:07,624
That totem pole
been here forever.

862
01:01:11,152 --> 01:01:12,744
Butch, stop watching TV.

863
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:15,310
- Yeah?
- We got a special visitor.

864
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:23,545
Remember I told you daddy
died in a POW camp?

865
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:28,224
This is Captain Koons.

866
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:30,628
He was in that camp with daddy.

867
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:39,546
Hello, little man. Boy...

868
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:41,344
I sure heard a bunch about you!

869
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:44,668
I was a good friend
of your dad's.

870
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:49,824
We were in that Hanoi pit of
hell together over five years.

871
01:01:51,032 --> 01:01:52,021
Hopefully...

872
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:56,146
you won't have to experience
this, but when...

873
01:01:56,352 --> 01:02:00,868
Two men are in a situation like
me and your dad so long...

874
01:02:02,072 --> 01:02:04,711
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

875
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:07,664
If it had been me who'd...

876
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:10,701
not made it...

877
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:13,905
Major Coolidge would be
talking now to my son...

878
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:15,068
Jim.

879
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,343
But, as it turned out,
I'm talking to you...

880
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:21,102
Butch.

881
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:24,667
I got something for you.

882
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,743
This watch I got here...

883
01:02:33,952 --> 01:02:37,706
was purchased by our great grand-
father during the 1st World War.

884
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:42,145
He bought it in a little general
store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

885
01:02:42,832 --> 01:02:46,029
Made by the 1st company
to make wristwatches.

886
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:49,469
Till then, people used
to carry pocket watches.

887
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:52,630
It was bought by private
doughboy Erine Coolidge...

888
01:02:52,832 --> 01:02:54,504
the day he set sail for Paris.

889
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,627
That was your great-grandfather's
war watch.

890
01:02:57,832 --> 01:03:00,107
He wore it every day in that war.

891
01:03:01,312 --> 01:03:04,304
After his duty, he went home
to your great-grandmother...

892
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:05,786
took the watch off...

893
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:08,580
put it in a coffee can,
and there it stayed...

894
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:13,550
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called by his country...

895
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:16,545
to go overseas and fight
the Germans.

896
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,629
That was the Second
World War.

897
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:23,901
Your great-grandfather gave this
to your granddad for good lick.

898
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:28,224
Dane's luck wasn't as good
as his old man's.

899
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:30,150
Dane was a Marine,
and was killed...

900
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:33,510
with the other Marines,
at Wake Island.

901
01:03:34,272 --> 01:03:36,422
Your granddad was
facing death.

902
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:38,547
He knew it.

903
01:03:39,432 --> 01:03:44,028
None of them had any illusions
about leaving that island alive.

904
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:48,345
3 days before the Japanese took the
island, your granddad asked a gunner

905
01:03:48,552 --> 01:03:50,986
of the Air Force,
named Winocki...

906
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,948
a man he'd never met before...

907
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:56,627
to deliver to his
infant son...

908
01:03:57,392 --> 01:03:59,383
who he never saw in the flesh...

909
01:03:59,632 --> 01:04:00,985
his gold watch.

910
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:05,785
3 days later your granddad died,
but Winocki kept his word.

911
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:10,029
After the war was over,
he visited your grandmother...

912
01:04:10,352 --> 01:04:14,231
delivering to your infant
father his dad's gold watch.

913
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:15,627
This watch.

914
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:26,662
It was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

915
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:30,502
He was captured, put in a
Vietnamese prison camp.

916
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:34,341
He knew that fit the
gooks saw the watch...

917
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:35,747
they'd confiscate it...

918
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:37,307
take it away.

919
01:04:38,032 --> 01:04:41,581
As your dad saw it, this
watch was your birthright.

920
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:45,068
He'd be damned if they'd put their
yellow hands on his son's birthright.

921
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:49,026
He hid it the one place he
knew he could: His ass.

922
01:04:49,312 --> 01:04:53,225
5 years he wore this watch
up his ass and...

923
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:56,188
when he died of dysentery,
he gave it to me.

924
01:04:56,752 --> 01:05:00,950
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of
metal up my ass 2 years. Then...

925
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:05,344
after 7 years, I was sent
home to my family.

926
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:07,428
Now...

927
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:13,181
little man, I give the
watch to you.

928
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:36,707
It's time, Butch.

929
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:02,262
It's official. Wilson is dead.

930
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:06,306
That was the bloodiest,
most brutal fight the city's seen.

931
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:10,300
Coolidge left faster than any
winner I've seen. Think he knew...

932
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,389
- Wilson was dead?
- I guess.

933
01:06:12,632 --> 01:06:14,668
I saw the frenzy in his eyes...

934
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:18,547
give way to the realization
he was doing.

935
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:21,585
- This affect the world of boxing?
- Richard...

936
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:25,580
a tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing.

937
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:28,022
But paramount importance
is that now...

938
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:29,341
the W.B.A. Will remain...

939
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:06,387
Marsellus.

940
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,223
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't do it.

941
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:10,621
How you doing?

942
01:07:11,352 --> 01:07:14,344
Great. I never thanked
you for dinner.

943
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:18,424
- What you got?
- He booked.

944
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:21,744
- His trainer?
- Knows nothing. I believe him.

945
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:26,184
- Butch surprised his ass.
- Forget "think". We want to know.

946
01:07:26,392 --> 01:07:28,781
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

947
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:31,062
We'll find out what he knows.

948
01:07:31,272 --> 01:07:32,830
How do you want the search?

949
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:36,071
I'll scour the earth for
that motherfucker.

950
01:07:36,312 --> 01:07:37,950
If Butch goes to Indochina...

951
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:41,144
I want a nigger hiding,
ready to cap his ass.

952
01:07:42,112 --> 01:07:43,591
I'll take care of it.

953
01:07:59,352 --> 01:08:01,627
Hey, mister?

954
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:03,425
You were in that fight?

955
01:08:03,832 --> 01:08:05,231
The fight on the radio.

956
01:08:06,472 --> 01:08:07,700
You're the fighter?

957
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:09,665
What gave you that idea?

958
01:08:10,272 --> 01:08:11,944
No, come on!

959
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:14,307
You're him.

960
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:16,626
I know you're him.

961
01:08:18,912 --> 01:08:20,186
Tell me you're him.

962
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:21,867
I'm him.

963
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,109
You killed the other boxing man.

964
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:30,302
He's dead?

965
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:32,830
The radio said he was.

966
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:37,944
Sorry, Floyd.

967
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:41,030
What does it feel like?

968
01:08:41,752 --> 01:08:43,344
What does what feel like?

969
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:45,026
Killing a man.

970
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:51,061
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

971
01:08:51,992 --> 01:08:53,220
Are you a weirdo?

972
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:57,671
It's a subject I have
much interest in.

973
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:03,308
You're the 1st person I've met
who's killed somebody.

974
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:07,307
So?

975
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,101
What's it feel like
to kill a man?

976
01:09:12,672 --> 01:09:13,866
I'll tell you what.

977
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:17,470
Give me a cigarette and
I'll tell you about it.

978
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:36,428
So...

979
01:09:37,392 --> 01:09:38,711
Esmarelda...

980
01:09:40,032 --> 01:09:41,351
Villalobos.

981
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:43,021
That Mexican?

982
01:09:43,272 --> 01:09:46,184
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

983
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,831
That's some handle you got.

984
01:09:48,112 --> 01:09:49,101
Thank you.

985
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,381
What is your name?

986
01:09:52,352 --> 01:09:53,068
Butch.

987
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:54,303
Butch.

988
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:56,822
What does it mean?

989
01:09:57,032 --> 01:09:59,262
American names don't
mean shit.

990
01:10:01,872 --> 01:10:06,343
Moving right along, what
is it you want to know?

991
01:10:07,432 --> 01:10:11,471
- What's it feel like to kill a man?
- Couldn't tell you.

992
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,867
I didn't know he was dead
till you told me.

993
01:10:21,872 --> 01:10:24,432
Not that I know, you
want to know how I feel?

994
01:10:30,032 --> 01:10:32,023
I don't feel the least
bad about it.

995
01:10:43,632 --> 01:10:45,623
What the fuck I tell you?

996
01:10:45,952 --> 01:10:48,750
Once they knew the fix was
in, the odds went sky high.

997
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:51,462
I know. Unbelievable.

998
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:54,825
Fuck him. If he were better
he'd still be alive.

999
01:10:55,152 --> 01:10:59,304
If he'd never laced his glove in
the first place, he still be alive.

1000
01:11:01,032 --> 01:11:04,581
Who gives a fuck?
It's over.

1001
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,785
Enough about poor,
unfortunate Floyd.

1002
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:10,187
Let's discuss the rich
and prosperous Butch.

1003
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:13,104
How many bookies are in?

1004
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:15,142
All eight?

1005
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,900
How long to collect?

1006
01:11:18,432 --> 01:11:19,945
You'll have it tomorrow night?

1007
01:11:20,312 --> 01:11:22,189
Okay, besides a
few stragglers.

1008
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:26,063
Fuck, that is good news!
It's great news!

1009
01:11:28,032 --> 01:11:29,909
Me and Fabienne
leave in the morning.

1010
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,141
It'll take a couple of days
to get to Knoxville.

1011
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,191
Okay, my brother.

1012
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:39,186
You're right,
you're goddamn right.

1013
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:43,149
Next time I see you we'll
be on Tennessee time.

1014
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:44,507
Be cool, brother.

1015
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,870
Forty-five sixty.

1016
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:10,670
Here's a little something
for the effort.

1017
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,910
If anybody asks about your
fare, what'll you say?

1018
01:12:15,112 --> 01:12:15,988
The truth.

1019
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:20,191
3 well-dressed, slightly
toasted Mexicans.

1020
01:12:22,112 --> 01:12:24,307
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1021
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:42,386
Keep the light off.

1022
01:12:43,232 --> 01:12:44,711
Is that better, sugar pop?

1023
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:52,710
- Hard day at the office?
- Pretty hard.

1024
01:12:53,632 --> 01:12:54,747
I got in a fight.

1025
01:12:55,912 --> 01:12:57,231
Poor baby.

1026
01:12:58,112 --> 01:12:59,704
Can we make spoons?

1027
01:13:00,712 --> 01:13:03,749
I was going to shower.
I stink like a dog.

1028
01:13:04,632 --> 01:13:06,111
I like the way you stink.

1029
01:13:07,392 --> 01:13:08,871
Let me take my jacket off.

1030
01:13:11,672 --> 01:13:13,867
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1031
01:13:15,072 --> 01:13:16,630
I wish I had a pot.

1032
01:13:18,672 --> 01:13:21,505
Looking at yourself, you
wished you had a pot?

1033
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:24,630
A pot.
A pot belly.

1034
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:27,029
Pot bellies are sexy.

1035
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:29,588
You should be happy...

1036
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:34,950
- 'cause you have one.
- Shut up, Fatso! I don't have one.

1037
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:36,625
I have a bit of a tummy...

1038
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:40,142
like Madonna when she did
"Lucky Star". It's not the same.

1039
01:13:40,432 --> 01:13:43,344
There's a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy?

1040
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,463
The difference is huge.

1041
01:13:47,592 --> 01:13:49,742
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1042
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:55,181
Pot bellies make a man look
either oafish or like a gorilla.

1043
01:13:55,872 --> 01:13:58,545
But on a woman,
it's very sexy.

1044
01:13:59,032 --> 01:14:00,750
The rest of you
is normal.

1045
01:14:00,952 --> 01:14:04,547
Normal face, legs,
hips, ass...

1046
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:08,262
but with a big, perfectly
round pot belly.

1047
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:12,705
If I had one, I'd wear my T-shirt
too small to accentuate it.

1048
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:14,868
Would men find that
attractive?

1049
01:14:15,632 --> 01:14:17,987
I don't give a damn what
men find attractive.

1050
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:22,188
Unfortunately, what pleases
the touch and the eye...

1051
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:23,586
is seldom the same.

1052
01:14:27,192 --> 01:14:28,591
If you had a pot belly...

1053
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,631
I'd punch you in it.

1054
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:33,346
- You'd punch my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1055
01:14:34,072 --> 01:14:35,551
I'd smother you.

1056
01:14:35,752 --> 01:14:39,028
I'd drop it on your face till
you couldn't breathe.

1057
01:14:39,232 --> 01:14:40,665
You'd do that?

1058
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:57,982
Get everything?

1059
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:00,941
- I did.
- Good job, sugar pop.

1060
01:15:01,552 --> 01:15:02,826
Everything go as planned?

1061
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:05,264
You didn't listen to...

1062
01:15:06,352 --> 01:15:07,467
the radio?

1063
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,145
I never listen to your fights.

1064
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:10,702
Did you win?

1065
01:15:11,432 --> 01:15:12,660
I won, alright.

1066
01:15:13,112 --> 01:15:14,431
Are you still retiring?

1067
01:15:14,632 --> 01:15:15,701
Sure am.

1068
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,225
It worked out in the finish?

1069
01:15:19,752 --> 01:15:21,424
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1070
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,828
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1071
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:37,307
If they find us, they'll
kill us, won't they?

1072
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:41,629
But they won't find us,
will they?

1073
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:47,348
Still want me to
go with you?

1074
01:15:49,472 --> 01:15:53,511
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's...

1075
01:15:59,512 --> 01:16:00,706
Say it.

1076
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:06,144
I want you to be with me.

1077
01:16:07,472 --> 01:16:10,145
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1078
01:16:12,392 --> 01:16:13,666
Do you love me?

1079
01:16:14,392 --> 01:16:15,666
Very, very much.

1080
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:24,149
- Butch.
- Yes.

1081
01:16:25,632 --> 01:16:28,021
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1082
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:30,701
Will you kiss it?

1083
01:16:33,312 --> 01:16:34,586
But you first.

1084
01:16:35,752 --> 01:16:37,424
- Okay.
- Good.

1085
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:53,110
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1086
01:17:08,472 --> 01:17:10,144
I think I cracked a rib.

1087
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:12,509
Giving me oral pleasure?

1088
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,624
- No, retard, from the fight.
- Don't call me retard.

1089
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:19,984
"My name is Fabby."
"My name is Fabienne."

1090
01:17:20,232 --> 01:17:24,544
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1091
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:26,745
Sorry, sorry.

1092
01:17:28,152 --> 01:17:29,221
I take it back.

1093
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:35,384
Hand me a towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

1094
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:38,902
I like that. I like
being called a tulip.

1095
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:41,103
It's much better
than mongoloid.

1096
01:17:41,312 --> 01:17:44,065
I didn't call you mongoloid.
I called you retard...

1097
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:45,381
and I took it back.

1098
01:17:48,592 --> 01:17:49,866
Yes, lemon pie.

1099
01:17:50,392 --> 01:17:53,145
- Where will we go?
- I'm not sure yet.

1100
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:55,181
Wherever you want.

1101
01:17:56,032 --> 01:17:58,500
We'll get a lot of money
from this...

1102
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:03,064
but it won't be money we can
live like hogs in the fat house.

1103
01:18:04,072 --> 01:18:05,790
Maybe we can go down...

1104
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:07,551
someplace in the South Pacific.

1105
01:18:08,312 --> 01:18:11,429
That money will get us
far down there.

1106
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:14,021
- We could live in Bora Bora?
- You bet.

1107
01:18:14,312 --> 01:18:16,109
And if you get tired of that...

1108
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:19,709
we go somewhere else.
Maybe Tahiti or Mexico.

1109
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:24,304
- But I don't speak Spanish.
- Nor Bora Boran either.

1110
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:26,544
Besides, Mexican is easy.

1111
01:18:28,712 --> 01:18:31,431
- What does that mean?
- Where's the shoe store?

1112
01:18:32,592 --> 01:18:33,627
Spit first.

1113
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:38,988
Excellent pronunciation.

1114
01:18:40,912 --> 01:18:42,868
You'll be my little
"mamacita" in no time.

1115
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:48,548
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1116
01:18:48,752 --> 01:18:49,787
Time for bed.

1117
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:52,785
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1118
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:09,101
Never mind.

1119
01:19:19,272 --> 01:19:19,863
Merde!

1120
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:22,825
You startled me.
You had a ban dream?

1121
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:34,431
What are you watching?

1122
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:38,544
A motorcycle movie,
I'm not sure of the name.

1123
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:41,861
You watching it?

1124
01:19:42,832 --> 01:19:43,867
In a way.

1125
01:19:46,232 --> 01:19:48,666
It's a bit early for
explosions and war.

1126
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:53,745
- What was it about?
- I don't know.

1127
01:19:53,992 --> 01:19:55,789
You were the one
watching it.

1128
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,389
No, imbecile! The dream.

1129
01:19:58,792 --> 01:19:59,747
I don't know.

1130
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:01,627
I don't remember.

1131
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:05,022
I rarely remember
my dreams.

1132
01:20:05,232 --> 01:20:07,507
Look at the grumpy
man in the morning.

1133
01:20:10,392 --> 01:20:14,226
- Let's have breakfast.
- One more kiss and I'll get up.

1134
01:20:17,552 --> 01:20:18,541
Satisfied?

1135
01:20:20,792 --> 01:20:23,909
Then get up,
lazy bones.

1136
01:20:26,032 --> 01:20:26,987
Oh, God!

1137
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:29,142
What time is it?

1138
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:31,305
Almost 9 in the morning.

1139
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:34,750
- What time's our train arrive?
- 11.

1140
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:38,385
- Know what I'm having?
- What, lemon pie?

1141
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,265
I'll order...

1142
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,862
a big plate of blueberry
pancakes with maple syrup...

1143
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,863
eggs over easy and
five sausages.

1144
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:50,786
Anything to drink?

1145
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:53,310
That looks nice.

1146
01:20:54,712 --> 01:20:57,988
To drink, a tall glass
of orange juice...

1147
01:20:58,192 --> 01:20:59,910
and a black cup of coffee.

1148
01:21:00,512 --> 01:21:02,582
Then I'll have a
slice of pie.

1149
01:21:02,912 --> 01:21:04,345
Pie for breakfast?

1150
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:07,825
Any time of the day
is good for pie.

1151
01:21:08,472 --> 01:21:10,747
Blueberry pie to go
with the pancakes.

1152
01:21:10,952 --> 01:21:14,262
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1153
01:21:14,512 --> 01:21:15,661
Where's my watch?

1154
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:21,748
It's there.

1155
01:21:22,952 --> 01:21:23,941
No, it's not.

1156
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,981
You looked?

1157
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,467
What do you think I'm doing?

1158
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:30,951
You sure you got it?

1159
01:21:32,112 --> 01:21:33,830
Yes, bedside table drawer.

1160
01:21:34,072 --> 01:21:35,346
On the little kangaroo?

1161
01:21:35,592 --> 01:21:36,866
It was in it.

1162
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:39,183
Well, it's not here now.

1163
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:42,420
Well, it should be.

1164
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:46,547
It should, but it isn't.
Where the fuck is it?

1165
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:52,902
Fabienne...

1166
01:21:53,632 --> 01:21:55,065
it was my father's fucking watch.

1167
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:00,226
Know what he did to
get me that watch?

1168
01:22:00,992 --> 01:22:03,222
Too long to explain,
but a lot.

1169
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:06,390
You could have set all
this shit on fire, but...

1170
01:22:06,592 --> 01:22:08,867
I told you not to forget
the fucking watch.

1171
01:22:09,712 --> 01:22:10,428
Think!

1172
01:22:11,232 --> 01:22:12,108
Did you get it?

1173
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:13,907
I believe so.

1174
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:17,070
Either you did,
or you didn't!

1175
01:22:19,152 --> 01:22:20,141
Then I did.

1176
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,347
Are you sure?

1177
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:30,270
Fuck! Fuck!

1178
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,581
Motherfucker!

1179
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,340
Do you know how fucking stupid...

1180
01:22:35,552 --> 01:22:36,871
you fucking are?

1181
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:42,782
It's not your fault...

1182
01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:49,950
you left it at the apartment.

1183
01:22:55,992 --> 01:22:58,062
You left it,
it's not your fault.

1184
01:23:01,112 --> 01:23:02,704
I had to bring a
bunch of stuff.

1185
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:07,990
I reminded you about it, but...

1186
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:11,345
I didn't illustrate how
personal it was.

1187
01:23:12,712 --> 01:23:15,272
I should have told you
it's all I give a fuck about.

1188
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:18,260
You're not a mind reader...

1189
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:20,342
are you?

1190
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:32,421
I'm sorry.

1191
01:23:32,952 --> 01:23:35,910
Don't be, but I can't
have breakfast with you.

1192
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,586
What does that mean?

1193
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:44,226
I must go back to
get my watch.

1194
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:47,868
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you?

1195
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:50,872
I'll find out.

1196
01:23:52,072 --> 01:23:55,030
If they are and
I can't handle it...

1197
01:23:55,352 --> 01:23:59,027
- I'll split.
- I thought I brought it.

1198
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,226
I'm so sorry.

1199
01:24:07,152 --> 01:24:08,107
Here's some money.

1200
01:24:08,352 --> 01:24:10,741
Go get pancakes and
have a nice breakfast.

1201
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:13,940
I'll be back before you can
say blueberry pie.

1202
01:24:14,152 --> 01:24:15,187
Blueberry pie.

1203
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,426
Maybe not that fast...

1204
01:24:19,432 --> 01:24:20,626
but pretty fast.

1205
01:24:24,752 --> 01:24:28,745
Of all things, she forgets
my father's watch!

1206
01:24:29,072 --> 01:24:30,551
I specifically reminded her:

1207
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,346
"Bedside table.
On the kangaroo."

1208
01:24:33,632 --> 01:24:36,305
I said it: "Don't forget
my father's watch."

1209
01:27:06,994 --> 01:27:08,791
Looking good, Butch.

1210
01:30:10,354 --> 01:30:12,265
That's how you'll
beat them.

1211
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,509
They underestimate you.

1212
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:47,868
Motherfucker!

1213
01:31:01,274 --> 01:31:02,389
He's dead.

1214
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,823
I'll help you in court.

1215
01:31:15,034 --> 01:31:18,026
He's a maniac. He hit you, then
he crashed into that car.

1216
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:19,470
Who?

1217
01:31:20,034 --> 01:31:20,625
Him.

1218
01:31:24,794 --> 01:31:26,113
I'll be damned!

1219
01:32:05,714 --> 01:32:08,103
- Can I help you?
- Shut the fuck up!

1220
01:32:09,234 --> 01:32:13,113
Wait a goddamn minute.
What the fuck you up to?

1221
01:32:13,674 --> 01:32:14,868
Come here, motherfucker!

1222
01:32:17,714 --> 01:32:20,148
Feel the sting?
That's pride...

1223
01:32:20,354 --> 01:32:21,025
fucking you.

1224
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:22,104
You must fight through this.

1225
01:32:24,634 --> 01:32:25,589
Better kill me.

1226
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,469
Somebody'll get their
motherfucking head...

1227
01:32:28,714 --> 01:32:29,863
blown off.

1228
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:31,384
Hold it right there...

1229
01:32:31,594 --> 01:32:33,983
- goddamn it!
- This ain't none of your business.

1230
01:32:34,354 --> 01:32:36,993
I'm making it mine.
Toss the weapon.

1231
01:32:37,554 --> 01:32:38,703
You don't understand!

1232
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:40,149
Toss the weapon.

1233
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:50,430
Your foot off the nigger,
hands behind your head...

1234
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:53,672
- approach the counter.
- This fucker's trying...

1235
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:56,306
- to kill me!
- Shut up!

1236
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:59,304
Keep it coming. Come on.

1237
01:33:23,274 --> 01:33:25,105
Zed? It's Maynard.

1238
01:33:26,274 --> 01:33:28,629
The spider just caught
a couple of flies.

1239
01:34:14,834 --> 01:34:18,349
Nobody kills anybody in
my place, except Zed or me.

1240
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:23,784
That's Zed.

1241
01:34:37,274 --> 01:34:39,469
- You said you waited for me.
- I did.

1242
01:34:45,154 --> 01:34:46,553
How come they're all beat up?

1243
01:34:48,394 --> 01:34:50,669
They did that.
They came in fighting.

1244
01:34:51,674 --> 01:34:53,346
This one here...

1245
01:34:53,674 --> 01:34:55,107
wanted to shoot that one.

1246
01:34:55,434 --> 01:34:55,911
That right?

1247
01:34:57,074 --> 01:34:58,427
You going to shoot him?

1248
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,150
Grace all right
out there?

1249
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:09,146
- It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- It's Thursday.

1250
01:35:09,354 --> 01:35:10,423
She'll be fine.

1251
01:35:14,034 --> 01:35:14,944
Well...

1252
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,227
bring out The Gimp.

1253
01:35:18,514 --> 01:35:19,867
I think The Gimp's sleeping.

1254
01:35:21,074 --> 01:35:23,542
Then wake him up,
will you?

1255
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:03,350
Get up!

1256
01:36:17,114 --> 01:36:18,069
Get down.

1257
01:36:28,714 --> 01:36:30,227
Which one you want to do first?

1258
01:36:32,514 --> 01:36:34,072
I ain't sure yet.

1259
01:36:38,314 --> 01:36:39,144
Eenie...

1260
01:36:39,354 --> 01:36:40,707
meenie minie mo.

1261
01:37:11,234 --> 01:37:12,587
That means you, big boy.

1262
01:37:18,514 --> 01:37:19,424
Here?

1263
01:37:19,954 --> 01:37:22,627
Let's do it back there,
in Russell's old room.

1264
01:37:23,634 --> 01:37:24,749
Sounds good to me.

1265
01:37:48,354 --> 01:37:49,628
Keep an eye on this one.

1266
01:40:32,634 --> 01:40:33,749
Shut the fuck up!

1267
01:41:19,834 --> 01:41:21,506
You want the gun?

1268
01:41:26,474 --> 01:41:27,702
Go on, pick it up.

1269
01:41:30,394 --> 01:41:31,349
Pick it up.

1270
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:36,825
Come on, atta boy!

1271
01:41:38,754 --> 01:41:40,028
I want you to pick it up.

1272
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,946
Step aside, Butch.

1273
01:42:01,674 --> 01:42:02,663
Fuck!

1274
01:42:07,034 --> 01:42:07,910
You okay?

1275
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:12,228
No, I'm not.

1276
01:42:13,634 --> 01:42:16,307
I'm pretty fucking
far from okay.

1277
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:28,224
What now?

1278
01:42:31,834 --> 01:42:32,949
What now?

1279
01:42:34,714 --> 01:42:36,352
Let me tell you what now.

1280
01:42:38,314 --> 01:42:42,944
I'll call some pipe-hitting niggers
to go work on the homes...

1281
01:42:43,794 --> 01:42:46,024
with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.

1282
01:42:48,674 --> 01:42:51,063
You hear me, Hillbilly Boy?

1283
01:42:52,514 --> 01:42:54,789
I'm not done with you
by a damn sight!

1284
01:42:55,034 --> 01:42:56,911
I'll get medieval
on your ass.

1285
01:43:01,234 --> 01:43:03,350
I meant "what now
between me and you"?

1286
01:43:08,754 --> 01:43:10,233
Oh, that "what now"!

1287
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:14,788
I'll tell you what now
between us.

1288
01:43:17,594 --> 01:43:20,028
There is no me and you.

1289
01:43:21,714 --> 01:43:22,863
Not no more.

1290
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:27,829
So we're cool?

1291
01:43:29,674 --> 01:43:30,993
Yeah, we're cool.

1292
01:43:32,514 --> 01:43:33,629
Two things:

1293
01:43:35,674 --> 01:43:37,790
Don't tell anybody
about this.

1294
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:42,553
This shit is between
me, you and...

1295
01:43:43,314 --> 01:43:46,545
Mr. Soon-To-Be-Living-His-
Short-Ass-Life...

1296
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:48,949
in Agonizing-Pain
Rapist, here.

1297
01:43:50,914 --> 01:43:52,825
It ain't nobody else's business.

1298
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:54,584
Two:

1299
01:43:55,514 --> 01:43:57,266
You leave town
tonight...

1300
01:43:57,994 --> 01:43:58,949
right now.

1301
01:44:00,074 --> 01:44:01,393
And when you're gone...

1302
01:44:02,114 --> 01:44:03,229
you stay gone...

1303
01:44:03,714 --> 01:44:05,193
or you be gone.

1304
01:44:06,594 --> 01:44:09,188
You lost the L.A.
Privileges. Deal?

1305
01:44:14,514 --> 01:44:16,106
Get your ass out of here.

1306
01:45:24,354 --> 01:45:26,993
Get your shit.
We must go right now.

1307
01:45:27,234 --> 01:45:28,587
What about our bags?

1308
01:45:28,794 --> 01:45:32,104
Fuck the bags! We'll miss
the train. I'll be downstairs.

1309
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:35,266
- Everything well?
- Come on, no talking now.

1310
01:45:35,514 --> 01:45:37,072
Are we in danger?

1311
01:45:40,794 --> 01:45:41,909
Come on!

1312
01:45:45,354 --> 01:45:46,946
Where did you get
this motorcycle

1313
01:45:47,354 --> 01:45:49,424
Not motorcycle.
It's a chopper.

1314
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:51,352
- Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1315
01:45:51,674 --> 01:45:55,064
I'm sorry, I had to crash that
Honda. Come on, please?

1316
01:45:55,794 --> 01:45:57,910
Come on, let's go.

1317
01:46:01,994 --> 01:46:02,824
You're hurt?

1318
01:46:03,034 --> 01:46:05,912
I might've broken my nose.
No biggie. Hop on.

1319
01:46:06,634 --> 01:46:10,422
Please, honey, we have to hit
the fucking road. Get on!

1320
01:46:13,594 --> 01:46:16,791
I'm sorry. Come here.
I'm sorry.

1321
01:46:17,874 --> 01:46:19,148
I'm so sorry.

1322
01:46:19,394 --> 01:46:21,828
You were gone so long,
I was scared.

1323
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:25,390
I didn't mean to worry you.
How was breakfast?

1324
01:46:25,594 --> 01:46:27,983
- Good.
- Get your blueberry pancakes?

1325
01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:31,311
No, I had to get buttermilk.
You sure you're okay?

1326
01:46:31,514 --> 01:46:32,788
Honey, since I left you...

1327
01:46:32,994 --> 01:46:36,145
this has been the weirdest
fucking day of my life.

1328
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:39,949
Hop on and I'll tell you
about it. We got to go.

1329
01:46:40,754 --> 01:46:42,585
Whose motorcycle is this?

1330
01:46:42,994 --> 01:46:45,224
- It's a chopper.
- Whose chopper is it?

1331
01:46:45,434 --> 01:46:47,072
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1332
01:46:47,274 --> 01:46:50,152
Zed's dead, baby.
He's dead.

1333
01:47:05,274 --> 01:47:07,344
Yes, you did, Brett!

1334
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:08,623
You tried to fuck him!

1335
01:47:09,234 --> 01:47:10,826
And Marsellus only likes...

1336
01:47:11,034 --> 01:47:14,026
to be fucked by
Mrs. Wallace.

1337
01:47:14,234 --> 01:47:16,304
- I don't want to die.
- You read the Bible?

1338
01:47:17,554 --> 01:47:20,705
I memorized a passage that
sort of fits this occasion.

1339
01:47:21,754 --> 01:47:24,393
Ezechiel, 25, 17

1340
01:47:25,234 --> 01:47:28,351
"The path of righteous
man is beset...

1341
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:30,510
on all sides by
the inequities...

1342
01:47:30,714 --> 01:47:33,751
of the selfish and the
tyranny of evil men.

1343
01:47:34,434 --> 01:47:39,110
Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and goodwill...

1344
01:47:39,314 --> 01:47:42,112
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness...

1345
01:47:42,314 --> 01:47:44,623
for he is his brother's
keeper...

1346
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:47,223
and the finder of
lost children.

1347
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:50,062
And I will strike down...

1348
01:47:50,274 --> 01:47:53,425
with great vengeance
and furious anger...

1349
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:57,832
upon those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

1350
01:47:58,194 --> 01:48:01,584
And you will know
my name is the Lord...

1351
01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:04,866
when I lay my vengeance
upon thee!"

1352
01:48:13,314 --> 01:48:16,431
- Fuck! Fuck!
- He a friend of yours?

1353
01:48:18,314 --> 01:48:20,270
Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

1354
01:48:20,474 --> 01:48:22,704
Shut him up, he's
getting on my nerves.

1355
01:48:23,154 --> 01:48:24,633
Marvin. Marvin!

1356
01:48:25,394 --> 01:48:27,350
Marvin, I don't knock
that shit off.

1357
01:48:27,914 --> 01:48:30,508
Die, you motherfuckers!
Die!

1358
01:48:58,274 --> 01:49:00,834
Why didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1359
01:49:01,074 --> 01:49:02,109
Slip your mind?

1360
01:49:02,434 --> 01:49:05,790
You forgot someone was in there
with a hand-cannon?

1361
01:49:06,114 --> 01:49:09,072
See the size of the gun?
It was bigger than mine.

1362
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:16,505
We should be fucking dead, man.

1363
01:49:17,194 --> 01:49:18,513
I know. We was lucky.

1364
01:49:18,914 --> 01:49:21,382
No, that shit
wasn't luck.

1365
01:49:22,114 --> 01:49:23,024
Maybe.

1366
01:49:23,834 --> 01:49:25,665
This was divine intervention.

1367
01:49:26,074 --> 01:49:27,951
You know what that is?

1368
01:49:34,194 --> 01:49:35,149
I think so.

1369
01:49:35,874 --> 01:49:38,752
God came down from heaven
and stopped the bullets?

1370
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:39,784
That's right.

1371
01:49:39,994 --> 01:49:44,067
God came down and stopped
the motherfucking bullets.

1372
01:49:45,434 --> 01:49:47,152
It's time for us to leave.

1373
01:49:47,354 --> 01:49:49,504
Don't fucking blow
this shit off!

1374
01:49:49,754 --> 01:49:50,743
What happened...

1375
01:49:50,954 --> 01:49:52,023
was a fucking miracle.

1376
01:49:52,394 --> 01:49:53,383
Shit happens.

1377
01:49:53,594 --> 01:49:56,154
Wrong, this shit doesn't
just happen.

1378
01:49:56,754 --> 01:49:59,473
You want to continue this
discussion in the car...

1379
01:50:00,194 --> 01:50:01,673
or in jail with the cops?

1380
01:50:01,874 --> 01:50:03,546
We should be fucking dead.

1381
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:05,429
What happened...

1382
01:50:05,634 --> 01:50:08,592
was a miracle.
Acknowledge it!

1383
01:50:08,834 --> 01:50:10,711
Alright,
it was a miracle.

1384
01:50:11,634 --> 01:50:12,828
Can we go now?

1385
01:50:20,074 --> 01:50:21,302
Let's go, nigger.

1386
01:50:22,194 --> 01:50:22,990
Shit!

1387
01:50:25,834 --> 01:50:27,108
You know that show "COPS"?

1388
01:50:27,314 --> 01:50:30,431
There was this cop and he
was talking...

1389
01:50:30,634 --> 01:50:33,228
about this gunfight
he had with this guy.

1390
01:50:33,434 --> 01:50:36,824
He unloaded on him and nothing
happened. Not even hit him.

1391
01:50:37,194 --> 01:50:38,912
It was him and this guy.

1392
01:50:39,274 --> 01:50:40,389
I mean, you know...

1393
01:50:40,874 --> 01:50:42,944
it's freaky but,
it happens.

1394
01:50:43,194 --> 01:50:45,549
You want to be blind,
go walk with the shepherd.

1395
01:50:45,754 --> 01:50:47,426
But my eyes are
wide open.

1396
01:50:47,994 --> 01:50:49,188
What does that mean?

1397
01:50:49,714 --> 01:50:53,263
That's it for me. As of now,
consider my ass retired.

1398
01:50:53,474 --> 01:50:54,270
Jesus Christ!

1399
01:50:54,474 --> 01:50:55,463
- Don't blaspheme!
- Goddamn it!

1400
01:50:55,674 --> 01:50:56,663
Don't do that!

1401
01:50:57,114 --> 01:50:58,467
Why are you freaking out?

1402
01:50:58,674 --> 01:51:01,268
I'm telling Marsellus
today I'm through.

1403
01:51:01,674 --> 01:51:03,073
Tell him why, too.

1404
01:51:03,274 --> 01:51:06,630
- I will.
- Bet you $10.000 he laughs.

1405
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:07,983
I don't give a damn if he does.

1406
01:51:10,274 --> 01:51:11,673
What do you make of all this?

1407
01:51:12,154 --> 01:51:13,746
I have no opinion.

1408
01:51:13,954 --> 01:51:17,788
Don't you think God came down
from heaven and stopped?

1409
01:51:18,954 --> 01:51:21,149
What the fuck's happening, man?
Shit!

1410
01:51:21,794 --> 01:51:24,831
- I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why?

1411
01:51:25,034 --> 01:51:28,549
- It was an accident.
- I've seen some crazy-ass shit...

1412
01:51:28,754 --> 01:51:32,030
Chill, it was an accident. You
probably went over a bump.

1413
01:51:32,234 --> 01:51:33,952
The car didn't hit no bump!

1414
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:37,669
I didn't mean to shoot the
sonofabitch. The gun went off.

1415
01:51:37,874 --> 01:51:40,752
We're on a city street,
in broad daylight.

1416
01:51:40,954 --> 01:51:42,751
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it now!

1417
01:51:42,954 --> 01:51:47,345
Off the road. Cops notice if
your car's drenched in blood.

1418
01:51:47,554 --> 01:51:49,385
Go to a friendly place.

1419
01:51:49,594 --> 01:51:53,303
- Marsellus got no friendly place.
- This ain't my fucking town!

1420
01:51:53,514 --> 01:51:54,310
Shit!

1421
01:51:54,954 --> 01:51:57,309
- What you doing?
- Calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1422
01:51:57,514 --> 01:52:00,665
- Where's that?
- Over the hill, by Burbank.

1423
01:52:01,234 --> 01:52:03,953
LfJimmie's not home,
I don't know what to do.

1424
01:52:04,154 --> 01:52:06,065
I got no other partners
in 818.

1425
01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:08,346
Jimmie, how you doing?

1426
01:52:09,194 --> 01:52:12,584
Me and my homeboy are in
serious fucking shit.

1427
01:52:12,834 --> 01:52:16,190
We must get off the road.
I need your garage.

1428
01:52:17,754 --> 01:52:20,746
We must be delicate
with this.

1429
01:52:20,954 --> 01:52:22,706
He's one remark away from
kicking our ass out.

1430
01:52:22,954 --> 01:52:24,069
Then what?

1431
01:52:24,914 --> 01:52:28,145
We won't leave till we make
some calls, but I don't want to.

1432
01:52:28,354 --> 01:52:31,903
You don't come to a friend's house
and tell him what's what.

1433
01:52:32,114 --> 01:52:33,911
Tell him not to abuse,
that's all.

1434
01:52:34,354 --> 01:52:36,788
He freaked out when
he saw Marvin.

1435
01:52:36,994 --> 01:52:39,030
Put yourself in his place.
It's 8 a.m.

1436
01:52:39,234 --> 01:52:41,031
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this.

1437
01:52:41,234 --> 01:52:44,146
Remember who's doing
who a favor.

1438
01:52:44,354 --> 01:52:48,108
If I must take shit, then he can
stick his favor up his ass.

1439
01:52:48,314 --> 01:52:52,273
- What did you do to this?
- I was drying my hands.

1440
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:54,430
- Wash them first.
- You saw me.

1441
01:52:54,634 --> 01:52:55,828
You wet them.

1442
01:52:56,034 --> 01:53:00,630
I washed them. It's hard to get off.
If I had Lava, it'd be better.

1443
01:53:00,834 --> 01:53:04,383
I used the same soap and my towel
doesn't look like no Maxie pad.

1444
01:53:04,754 --> 01:53:06,472
What if he sees his towel?

1445
01:53:06,674 --> 01:53:10,428
This shit will bring this
situation to a head, man!

1446
01:53:12,234 --> 01:53:13,030
Look...

1447
01:53:14,194 --> 01:53:17,106
I'm not threatening you.
I respect you...

1448
01:53:17,514 --> 01:53:20,153
but don't put me in
this position, alright?

1449
01:53:20,354 --> 01:53:22,345
Alright, fine.

1450
01:53:22,634 --> 01:53:24,590
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1451
01:53:25,594 --> 01:53:28,062
Go handle your friend.
I don't care.

1452
01:53:31,314 --> 01:53:34,670
Goddamn, Jimmie, this is
serious gourmet shit!

1453
01:53:35,154 --> 01:53:38,544
We'd have been satisfied with
freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1454
01:53:39,834 --> 01:53:43,622
And he springs this gourmet shit
on us. What flavor is this?

1455
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,269
Knock it off, Julie.

1456
01:53:46,074 --> 01:53:47,189
- What?
- I don't need you to...

1457
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:49,390
tell me how good
my coffee is.

1458
01:53:49,594 --> 01:53:51,585
I buy it, I know
how good it is.

1459
01:53:51,794 --> 01:53:53,705
When Bonnie shops,
she buys shit.

1460
01:53:54,154 --> 01:53:56,349
I buy the expensive stuff because...

1461
01:53:56,554 --> 01:54:01,184
I want to taste it. But what's on
my mind now ain't the coffee.

1462
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:03,265
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1463
01:54:03,794 --> 01:54:04,988
Jimmie, don't worry.

1464
01:54:05,194 --> 01:54:07,424
Just one question.

1465
01:54:07,634 --> 01:54:08,669
When you pulled in here...

1466
01:54:08,874 --> 01:54:11,513
did you notice a sign:
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1467
01:54:11,874 --> 01:54:13,387
You know I didn't...

1468
01:54:13,594 --> 01:54:16,825
Did you notice a sign:
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1469
01:54:17,794 --> 01:54:19,830
No, I didn't.

1470
01:54:20,034 --> 01:54:22,502
- You know why you didn't?
- Why?

1471
01:54:22,714 --> 01:54:26,912
Because storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

1472
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:28,309
- We won't store...
- No, no.

1473
01:54:28,514 --> 01:54:31,472
Don't you realize if
Bonnie comes home...

1474
01:54:31,674 --> 01:54:34,188
and finds a dead body,
I'll get divorced?

1475
01:54:34,394 --> 01:54:37,352
No lawyers, no trial.
Just fucking divorced.

1476
01:54:37,554 --> 01:54:40,068
And I don't want to
get fucking divorced.

1477
01:54:41,034 --> 01:54:45,471
I want to help you, but I don't
want to lose my wife doing it.

1478
01:54:45,674 --> 01:54:47,551
- She won't leave...
- Look...

1479
01:54:47,754 --> 01:54:51,747
don't fucking "Jimmie"
me, okay?

1480
01:54:51,954 --> 01:54:55,310
Nothing will make me forget
that I love my wife, will it?

1481
01:54:58,394 --> 01:55:02,387
She comes home from work in
about an hour and a half.

1482
01:55:02,994 --> 01:55:05,428
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1483
01:55:05,634 --> 01:55:07,067
You gotta make some calls?

1484
01:55:07,274 --> 01:55:09,663
Call some people?
Then do it...

1485
01:55:10,314 --> 01:55:12,623
and get the fuck out
before she gets here.

1486
01:55:13,154 --> 01:55:15,748
That's cool. We won't
fuck your shit up.

1487
01:55:15,994 --> 01:55:18,383
I'll call and my people'll
bring us in.

1488
01:55:18,674 --> 01:55:20,983
You already are fucking
my shit up!

1489
01:55:21,394 --> 01:55:23,624
You'll fuck it up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

1490
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:27,747
Do me that favor? The phone
is in my bedroom. Get going.

1491
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:29,673
Well, say she comes home.

1492
01:55:30,874 --> 01:55:32,193
What'll she do?

1493
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:36,425
No fucking shit,
she'll freak.

1494
01:55:36,994 --> 01:55:38,552
That is no answer.

1495
01:55:39,154 --> 01:55:42,032
You know her. How much,
a lot or a little?

1496
01:55:42,554 --> 01:55:46,706
Appreciate what an explosive
element this Bonnie situation is.

1497
01:55:47,354 --> 01:55:50,710
If she comes home and
finds some gangsters...

1498
01:55:50,914 --> 01:55:54,270
doing gangster shit, no
telling what she might do.

1499
01:55:57,994 --> 01:55:59,712
I've grasped that.

1500
01:55:59,954 --> 01:56:01,990
I'm contemplating
the "ifs".

1501
01:56:02,234 --> 01:56:04,145
I don't need to hear no "ifs".

1502
01:56:04,394 --> 01:56:08,467
I want to hear: "No problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

1503
01:56:08,674 --> 01:56:12,747
Chill them niggers and wait for
the cavalry, which is coming now."

1504
01:56:13,154 --> 01:56:15,349
You have no problems,
Jules.

1505
01:56:15,874 --> 01:56:17,592
I'm on the motherfucker.

1506
01:56:18,034 --> 01:56:20,184
Chill them niggers
out...

1507
01:56:20,674 --> 01:56:22,869
and wait for The Wolf,
who's coming now.

1508
01:56:24,194 --> 01:56:25,309
You're sending The Wolf?

1509
01:56:25,834 --> 01:56:27,506
Feel better, motherfucker?

1510
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:29,712
Shit, negro!

1511
01:56:29,954 --> 01:56:31,672
That all you
had to say.

1512
01:56:33,074 --> 01:56:34,473
Is she the hysterical type?

1513
01:56:36,034 --> 01:56:37,103
When is she due?

1514
01:56:41,074 --> 01:56:42,427
Give me the principals' names.

1515
01:57:06,154 --> 01:57:07,143
30 minutes away.

1516
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:08,150
I'll be there in 10.

1517
01:57:25,314 --> 01:57:27,953
You're Jimmie, right?
This your house?

1518
01:57:28,154 --> 01:57:29,826
- Sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf.

1519
01:57:30,354 --> 01:57:31,503
I solve problems.

1520
01:57:31,794 --> 01:57:34,262
- Good, we got one.
- I heard. May I come in?

1521
01:57:34,474 --> 01:57:35,463
Please.

1522
01:57:36,514 --> 01:57:37,833
You must be Jules...

1523
01:57:38,114 --> 01:57:39,945
which would make you Vincent.

1524
01:57:40,154 --> 01:57:44,227
Let's get down to brass tacks.
The clock is ticking, right?

1525
01:57:44,954 --> 01:57:46,023
100%.

1526
01:57:46,234 --> 01:57:46,950
Your wife...

1527
01:57:47,234 --> 01:57:49,953
Bonnie comes home at

1528
01:57:51,034 --> 01:57:53,548
I was told if she comes
and finds us here...

1529
01:57:53,754 --> 01:57:55,107
she won't appreciate it?

1530
01:57:55,314 --> 01:57:57,305
- She won't at that.
- Right, then give us...

1531
01:57:57,674 --> 01:57:59,471
40 minutes to get out of Dodge.

1532
01:57:59,794 --> 01:58:02,513
If you do what I say,
it's plenty.

1533
01:58:02,754 --> 01:58:07,111
You got a corpse in a car, minus a
head, in the garage. Take me there.

1534
01:58:14,594 --> 01:58:16,186
- Jimmie.
- Uh-hum.

1535
01:58:16,674 --> 01:58:18,073
Do me a favor?

1536
01:58:18,274 --> 01:58:20,230
I smell coffee.
Can I have a cup?

1537
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,109
Yeah, sure.

1538
01:58:25,034 --> 01:58:27,229
How do you take it?

1539
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:28,947
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.

1540
01:58:32,354 --> 01:58:34,072
How about the car?

1541
01:58:34,274 --> 01:58:37,744
Does it stall, smoke, make
noise? Got gas?

1542
01:58:37,954 --> 01:58:39,592
Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.

1543
01:58:40,354 --> 01:58:41,469
Positive?

1544
01:58:41,674 --> 01:58:44,029
The brake lights
better work.

1545
01:58:44,234 --> 01:58:46,589
Far as I know, the
motherfucker is tip-top.

1546
01:58:47,474 --> 01:58:48,384
Good enough.

1547
01:58:49,394 --> 01:58:50,747
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1548
01:58:56,314 --> 01:58:58,350
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1549
01:59:06,354 --> 01:59:08,788
Okay, first thing.
You two...

1550
01:59:09,114 --> 01:59:10,752
stick the body
in the trunk.

1551
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:14,229
This house looks
domesticated, so...

1552
01:59:14,434 --> 01:59:17,028
I guess you have cleaners
and cleaners.

1553
01:59:17,234 --> 01:59:18,747
- Under the sink.
- Good.

1554
01:59:19,154 --> 01:59:22,669
Take those products and
clean the inside of the car.

1555
01:59:22,874 --> 01:59:25,342
I'm talking fast, fast.
You need to...

1556
01:59:25,554 --> 01:59:30,105
scoop up those little pieces of
brain and skull in the back seat.

1557
01:59:30,474 --> 01:59:33,591
The upholstery don't
need to be perfect.

1558
01:59:33,794 --> 01:59:36,308
You don't need to eat off it.
Just a good once over.

1559
01:59:36,554 --> 01:59:39,193
You need to take care
of the messy parts.

1560
01:59:39,474 --> 01:59:42,352
Soak up the pools of
blood that've collected.

1561
01:59:43,914 --> 01:59:47,668
We need your linen. Blankets,
comforters, quilts...

1562
01:59:47,874 --> 01:59:50,183
bedspreads.
Thin ones. Dark ones.

1563
01:59:50,394 --> 01:59:52,988
Can't use whites.
We need to camouflage...

1564
01:59:53,194 --> 01:59:57,187
the interior. We'll line the
seats and the floor boards...

1565
01:59:57,394 --> 01:59:58,190
with quilts and blankets.

1566
01:59:58,834 --> 02:00:02,907
If a cop stops us and looks,
the subterfuge won't last...

1567
02:00:03,114 --> 02:00:04,945
but the car'll look normal.

1568
02:00:05,834 --> 02:00:07,790
Lead the way.
Boys, get to work!

1569
02:00:08,634 --> 02:00:09,544
"Please".

1570
02:00:10,914 --> 02:00:11,790
Come again?

1571
02:00:12,234 --> 02:00:13,747
"Please" would be nice.

1572
02:00:15,634 --> 02:00:18,831
I'm not here to say "please",
but to tell you what to do.

1573
02:00:21,154 --> 02:00:24,908
If you have an instinct for
self-preservation, do it quick.

1574
02:00:26,234 --> 02:00:29,988
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen!

1575
02:00:30,234 --> 02:00:31,587
It's not like that!

1576
02:00:31,794 --> 02:00:33,432
- Your help is appreciated.
- Listen...

1577
02:00:33,634 --> 02:00:36,626
I don't mean disrespect.
I respect you.

1578
02:00:36,834 --> 02:00:38,950
I don't like people barking
orders at me.

1579
02:00:39,314 --> 02:00:41,748
I'm curt because
time is a factor.

1580
02:00:41,954 --> 02:00:43,592
I think fast,
talk fast...

1581
02:00:43,794 --> 02:00:46,262
and you must act fast
if you want out.

1582
02:00:46,674 --> 02:00:49,711
So, pretty please,
clean the fucking car.

1583
02:00:54,274 --> 02:00:57,107
Don't look at me like that.
I can feel your look.

1584
02:01:00,474 --> 02:01:02,465
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1585
02:01:04,794 --> 02:01:05,590
Green.

1586
02:01:08,314 --> 02:01:09,986
Nothing except for the mess inside.

1587
02:01:13,634 --> 02:01:15,226
About 20 minutes.

1588
02:01:16,914 --> 02:01:18,427
Nobody who'll
be missed.

1589
02:01:20,794 --> 02:01:23,433
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1590
02:01:24,794 --> 02:01:27,627
- How we coming?
- Good. I got it all here.

1591
02:01:27,954 --> 02:01:28,830
But...

1592
02:01:29,634 --> 02:01:33,388
- Mr. Wolf, you must understand...
- Winston, please.

1593
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:36,104
Understand something, Winston.

1594
02:01:36,954 --> 02:01:38,228
No, thank you.

1595
02:01:39,274 --> 02:01:41,390
This is our best
linen here.

1596
02:01:41,634 --> 02:01:43,113
And it's a...

1597
02:01:43,314 --> 02:01:46,545
wedding gift from Uncle
Conrad and Aunt Ginny.

1598
02:01:46,754 --> 02:01:50,269
- They died. I want to help...
- One question...

1599
02:01:51,394 --> 02:01:53,544
- if you don't mind.
- Please, go ahead.

1600
02:01:55,554 --> 02:01:58,352
Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny.

1601
02:01:58,874 --> 02:02:00,148
Were they millionaires?

1602
02:02:02,674 --> 02:02:04,505
Your Uncle Marsellus is...

1603
02:02:05,594 --> 02:02:08,791
and I'm positive if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1604
02:02:09,074 --> 02:02:12,271
- Ginny.
- Ginny, were here, they'd...

1605
02:02:12,474 --> 02:02:14,783
furnish you with a
whole bedroom set...

1606
02:02:15,594 --> 02:02:17,949
which Uncle Marsellus
is happy to do.

1607
02:02:22,474 --> 02:02:24,704
I like oak,
that's what I have...

1608
02:02:25,074 --> 02:02:26,109
in my bedroom.

1609
02:02:27,194 --> 02:02:28,309
How about you?

1610
02:02:30,354 --> 02:02:31,423
You an oak man?

1611
02:02:33,034 --> 02:02:34,262
Oak's nice.

1612
02:02:40,794 --> 02:02:44,548
Man, I'll never forget
your ass for this shit.

1613
02:02:44,754 --> 02:02:46,585
This is some repugnant shit.

1614
02:02:46,794 --> 02:02:49,786
You know the philosophy.
Once a man is wrong...

1615
02:02:49,994 --> 02:02:53,111
he's forgiven for all
the wrongdoings.

1616
02:02:53,314 --> 02:02:54,952
Get the fuck out of my face!

1617
02:02:55,154 --> 02:02:59,272
Who said that never had to pick up
pieces of skull for your dumb ass.

1618
02:02:59,474 --> 02:03:02,386
I got a threshold for
the abuse I will take.

1619
02:03:02,594 --> 02:03:04,505
I'm a fucking
race car.

1620
02:03:04,714 --> 02:03:06,944
You got me in the red.
And it's fucking dangerous...

1621
02:03:07,154 --> 02:03:09,429
to have a race car
in the red.

1622
02:03:09,634 --> 02:03:11,386
That's all.
It could blow.

1623
02:03:11,594 --> 02:03:13,312
- You ready to blow?
- I'm ready.

1624
02:03:13,514 --> 02:03:15,630
I'm a mushroom-cloud-
laying-motherfucker!

1625
02:03:15,914 --> 02:03:19,111
My fingers touch a brain and
I'm Superfly T.N.T....

1626
02:03:19,314 --> 02:03:20,588
"The Guns of Navaronne".

1627
02:03:20,914 --> 02:03:23,144
In fact, what am
I doing in the back?

1628
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:25,424
You should be on
brain detail.

1629
02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:28,990
We switch. I wash the windows,
you pick up the nigger's skull.

1630
02:03:38,714 --> 02:03:40,193
Fine job, gentlemen.

1631
02:03:41,634 --> 02:03:43,192
We may get out of this.

1632
02:03:43,434 --> 02:03:45,345
I can't believe it's
the same car.

1633
02:03:46,234 --> 02:03:49,032
Let's not start sucking each
other's dicks quite yet.

1634
02:03:49,674 --> 02:03:51,232
Phase 1 is done.

1635
02:03:51,434 --> 02:03:53,868
Now, phase 2:
Clean you two.

1636
02:03:57,194 --> 02:03:58,070
Strip.

1637
02:03:58,634 --> 02:04:00,943
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1638
02:04:02,314 --> 02:04:03,633
Quickly, gentlemen.

1639
02:04:04,034 --> 02:04:07,743
15 minutes before Jimmie's better
half pulls into the driveway.

1640
02:04:07,994 --> 02:04:10,383
Damn, this morning
air is chilly.

1641
02:04:10,594 --> 02:04:12,312
Is this absolutely necessary?

1642
02:04:12,554 --> 02:04:14,590
- Know what you look like?
- What?

1643
02:04:14,794 --> 02:04:16,944
Like you just blew off
somebody's head.

1644
02:04:18,114 --> 02:04:19,593
Stripping off those bloody rags...

1645
02:04:19,794 --> 02:04:21,352
is absolutely necessary.

1646
02:04:25,634 --> 02:04:27,864
- Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.
- Don't do nothing...

1647
02:04:28,074 --> 02:04:30,110
stupid like leave
this out front...

1648
02:04:30,314 --> 02:04:33,545
- for the garbage man.
- We'll take it with us.

1649
02:04:34,954 --> 02:04:35,909
The soap.

1650
02:04:38,634 --> 02:04:39,544
Okay, gentlemen...

1651
02:04:39,994 --> 02:04:42,952
you've been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1652
02:04:43,194 --> 02:04:47,153
- That water's fucking cold!
- Better you than me, gentlemen!

1653
02:04:49,434 --> 02:04:52,744
- Spread the soap around.
- Up there a little bit.

1654
02:04:53,034 --> 02:04:55,673
Spray some on my hair.
Do it!

1655
02:04:56,154 --> 02:04:56,870
Damn, do it!

1656
02:04:58,554 --> 02:04:59,589
Towel them.

1657
02:05:10,834 --> 02:05:12,552
Dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

1658
02:05:15,354 --> 02:05:16,309
Perfect.

1659
02:05:16,954 --> 02:05:19,229
We couldn't have
planned this better.

1660
02:05:20,314 --> 02:05:21,508
You look like...

1661
02:05:22,434 --> 02:05:23,753
What we look like?

1662
02:05:24,674 --> 02:05:25,550
Dorks.

1663
02:05:26,634 --> 02:05:28,192
They look like two dorks.

1664
02:05:29,714 --> 02:05:31,386
They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

1665
02:05:31,594 --> 02:05:34,028
We're laughing our way
to prison.

1666
02:05:34,234 --> 02:05:35,349
Don't make me beg.

1667
02:05:39,034 --> 02:05:41,912
Let's get our rules
of the road straight.

1668
02:05:42,274 --> 02:05:44,629
We're going to
Monster Joe's Truck & Tow.

1669
02:05:45,154 --> 02:05:48,590
Monster Joe and his daughter
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1670
02:05:49,114 --> 02:05:50,433
It's in North Hollywood.

1671
02:05:50,714 --> 02:05:53,786
A few twists and turns aside,
we'll go up Hollywood Way.

1672
02:05:54,514 --> 02:05:57,665
I drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1673
02:05:59,074 --> 02:06:00,871
You follow in my Acura.

1674
02:06:01,074 --> 02:06:04,623
If we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

1675
02:06:04,834 --> 02:06:07,746
do nothing till I do something.
What did I say?

1676
02:06:08,914 --> 02:06:11,508
- Don't do shit unless...
- Unless what?

1677
02:06:11,714 --> 02:06:12,863
Unless you do it.

1678
02:06:13,154 --> 02:06:14,826
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1679
02:06:15,314 --> 02:06:16,349
How about you?

1680
02:06:16,554 --> 02:06:18,829
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling?

1681
02:06:19,034 --> 02:06:21,150
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

1682
02:06:21,354 --> 02:06:22,628
I'm cool, I promise.

1683
02:06:22,834 --> 02:06:25,826
Now, I drive real fast,
so keep up.

1684
02:06:26,034 --> 02:06:28,070
If I get my car back
different...

1685
02:06:28,274 --> 02:06:30,504
Monster Joe'll dispose
of two bodies.

1686
02:06:37,714 --> 02:06:39,147
- We cool?
- Like it never...

1687
02:06:39,354 --> 02:06:39,991
happened.

1688
02:06:41,594 --> 02:06:42,231
Boys, this is...

1689
02:06:42,434 --> 02:06:43,264
Raquel.

1690
02:06:43,714 --> 02:06:46,069
Some day all this
will be hers.

1691
02:06:47,514 --> 02:06:48,993
What's with the outfits?

1692
02:06:49,554 --> 02:06:51,670
Going to a volleyball
game or something?

1693
02:06:53,634 --> 02:06:55,511
I'm taking milady to
breakfast.

1694
02:06:55,794 --> 02:06:57,546
I might drop you off.
Where do you live?

1695
02:06:57,754 --> 02:06:58,948
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1696
02:07:00,234 --> 02:07:01,713
It's your future.

1697
02:07:02,354 --> 02:07:03,389
I see...

1698
02:07:03,634 --> 02:07:04,589
a cab ride.

1699
02:07:05,234 --> 02:07:06,792
Get out of the sticks, fellas.

1700
02:07:07,114 --> 02:07:09,184
- Say good night, Raquel.
- Good night, Raquel.

1701
02:07:09,394 --> 02:07:12,306
Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

1702
02:07:12,554 --> 02:07:13,384
Mr. Wolf?

1703
02:07:13,754 --> 02:07:16,507
It was a pleasure
watching you work.

1704
02:07:16,714 --> 02:07:18,591
Really. Thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

1705
02:07:20,234 --> 02:07:21,508
Call me Winston.

1706
02:07:23,314 --> 02:07:25,703
You see that, young lady?
Respect.

1707
02:07:26,474 --> 02:07:30,103
- Respect shows character.
- I have character.

1708
02:07:30,554 --> 02:07:34,149
Because you're a character doesn't
mean you have character.

1709
02:07:41,914 --> 02:07:42,983
Want to share a cab?

1710
02:07:43,994 --> 02:07:46,906
I'd go for breakfast. Want
to have breakfast with me?

1711
02:07:47,634 --> 02:07:48,510
Cool.

1712
02:07:54,074 --> 02:07:56,872
I thought he'd be
European or something.

1713
02:07:57,074 --> 02:08:00,032
- As much as English Bob.
- I know now, but...

1714
02:08:00,234 --> 02:08:01,792
- was he cool or what.
- Thank you.

1715
02:08:02,034 --> 02:08:04,628
Totally fucking cool.
In control.

1716
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:08,988
Didn't even get pissed when you
fucked with him. I'm amazed.

1717
02:08:10,554 --> 02:08:13,466
- Want some bacon?
- No, I don't eat pork.

1718
02:08:13,754 --> 02:08:17,030
- Are you Jewish?
- No, I just don't dig on swine.

1719
02:08:17,234 --> 02:08:17,950
Why not?

1720
02:08:18,554 --> 02:08:21,466
Pigs are filthy.
I don't eat filthy animals.

1721
02:08:21,674 --> 02:08:23,232
But bacon tastes good.

1722
02:08:23,514 --> 02:08:25,152
Pork chops taste good.

1723
02:08:25,394 --> 02:08:29,672
A sewer rat may taste good,
but I'd never eat one.

1724
02:08:30,754 --> 02:08:33,826
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1725
02:08:34,074 --> 02:08:36,986
I ain't eating nothing that don't
disregard its own feces.

1726
02:08:37,194 --> 02:08:39,549
A dog eats his
own feces.

1727
02:08:39,834 --> 02:08:41,028
I don't eat dog either.

1728
02:08:41,954 --> 02:08:44,263
You consider a dog
a filthy animal?

1729
02:08:45,194 --> 02:08:48,664
I wouldn't say filthy, but
they're definitely dirty.

1730
02:08:49,154 --> 02:08:52,590
A dog's got personality,
which goes a long way.

1731
02:08:52,794 --> 02:08:57,310
If a pig had a better personality,
he wouldn't be filthy.

1732
02:08:57,514 --> 02:09:01,109
- True?
- He'd have to be one charming pig.

1733
02:09:01,314 --> 02:09:05,023
Ten times more charming than
Arnold on "Green Acres".

1734
02:09:10,594 --> 02:09:12,152
Man, that's good.

1735
02:09:12,594 --> 02:09:15,347
That's good. You're
starting to lighten up.

1736
02:09:16,074 --> 02:09:18,952
- You're there, so serious.
- Yeah, I've just...

1737
02:09:19,154 --> 02:09:21,190
- been thinking.
- About what?

1738
02:09:21,514 --> 02:09:22,788
About that miracle.

1739
02:09:23,114 --> 02:09:26,106
You saw a miracle.
I saw a freak occurrence.

1740
02:09:26,314 --> 02:09:27,383
What's a miracle?

1741
02:09:29,394 --> 02:09:30,668
Act of God.

1742
02:09:30,874 --> 02:09:31,989
What's an "Act of God"?

1743
02:09:35,954 --> 02:09:36,830
When...

1744
02:09:37,514 --> 02:09:39,345
God make the impossible
possible.

1745
02:09:40,514 --> 02:09:44,143
But this morning, I
don't think, qualifies.

1746
02:09:45,314 --> 02:09:48,465
That shit don't matter.
You judge this wrong.

1747
02:09:48,954 --> 02:09:51,024
It could be God
stopped the bullets...

1748
02:09:51,234 --> 02:09:52,587
or changed
Coke to Pepsi...

1749
02:09:52,794 --> 02:09:56,184
or he found my car keys.
Don't judge based on merit.

1750
02:09:56,554 --> 02:09:58,226
Whether or not what we...

1751
02:09:58,434 --> 02:10:01,631
experiences was a miracle
is insignificant.

1752
02:10:02,154 --> 02:10:03,473
What is significant...

1753
02:10:03,914 --> 02:10:07,350
is I felt the touch of God.
God got involved.

1754
02:10:08,234 --> 02:10:09,064
But why?

1755
02:10:09,794 --> 02:10:13,230
I don't know. But I
can't go back to sleep.

1756
02:10:14,034 --> 02:10:16,867
You're serious?
You're thinking about quitting?

1757
02:10:17,394 --> 02:10:18,543
- The life?
- Yeah.

1758
02:10:18,754 --> 02:10:19,504
Definitely.

1759
02:10:19,714 --> 02:10:20,430
Fuck!

1760
02:10:21,834 --> 02:10:22,789
Then what?

1761
02:10:24,034 --> 02:10:24,944
Well...

1762
02:10:25,354 --> 02:10:27,584
that's what I've been
contemplating here.

1763
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:31,226
First, I'm going to deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1764
02:10:31,914 --> 02:10:34,667
Then I'll just
walk the earth.

1765
02:10:34,914 --> 02:10:36,063
Walk the earth?

1766
02:10:36,274 --> 02:10:38,151
Like Caine in "Kung Fu".

1767
02:10:38,354 --> 02:10:40,948
Go from place to place, meet
people, have adventures.

1768
02:10:41,154 --> 02:10:43,190
How long do you
intend to walk?

1769
02:10:43,394 --> 02:10:45,271
Till God puts me
where he wants.

1770
02:10:45,474 --> 02:10:46,429
What if he doesn't?

1771
02:10:46,634 --> 02:10:48,784
If he takes forever,
I'll walk forever.

1772
02:10:49,634 --> 02:10:51,226
You decided to
be a bum?

1773
02:10:51,634 --> 02:10:54,831
I'll just be Jules.
No more, no less.

1774
02:10:55,034 --> 02:10:56,786
No, you decided to be a bum.

1775
02:10:57,034 --> 02:11:00,026
Like those pieces of shit
who beg for change.

1776
02:11:00,234 --> 02:11:02,828
Sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1777
02:11:03,034 --> 02:11:05,832
They got a name for that:
Bum.

1778
02:11:06,034 --> 02:11:07,228
Without a job...

1779
02:11:07,474 --> 02:11:11,262
without a residence.
You'll be a fucking bum.

1780
02:11:11,474 --> 02:11:14,113
This is just where
you and I differ.

1781
02:11:14,314 --> 02:11:15,064
Garçon.

1782
02:11:16,314 --> 02:11:16,951
Coffee!

1783
02:11:17,354 --> 02:11:21,108
- What happened was peculiar...
- "Garçon" means boy.

1784
02:11:21,314 --> 02:11:22,986
...but water into
wine, I...

1785
02:11:23,194 --> 02:11:24,388
All shapes and sizes.

1786
02:11:24,594 --> 02:11:26,266
Don't talk to me that way!

1787
02:11:26,634 --> 02:11:29,990
If my answers scare you,
cease asking scary questions.

1788
02:11:33,114 --> 02:11:34,627
I'm going to take a shit.

1789
02:11:38,914 --> 02:11:39,824
Let me ask:

1790
02:11:40,314 --> 02:11:40,871
When did you...

1791
02:11:41,074 --> 02:11:43,144
make that decision, while
eating that muffin?

1792
02:11:44,514 --> 02:11:48,826
I was eating, drinking, replaying
the incident in my head...

1793
02:11:49,034 --> 02:11:52,583
when I had what alcoholics
call a "moment of clarity".

1794
02:11:53,474 --> 02:11:54,350
Fuck!

1795
02:11:54,634 --> 02:11:55,703
To be continued.

1796
02:12:07,354 --> 02:12:10,107
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1797
02:12:11,594 --> 02:12:13,471
Everybody,
this is a robbery!

1798
02:12:13,674 --> 02:12:16,188
Any of you fucking
pricks move...

1799
02:12:16,714 --> 02:12:19,467
I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1800
02:12:19,674 --> 02:12:22,586
- Waitresses, on the floor!
- You just be quiet!

1801
02:12:22,794 --> 02:12:25,592
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

1802
02:12:25,874 --> 02:12:26,863
You're in a blind spot!

1803
02:12:27,074 --> 02:12:30,225
Take your dames over there
on the count of ten.

1804
02:12:30,434 --> 02:12:31,708
Mexicans, out of the kitchen!

1805
02:12:34,834 --> 02:12:37,394
You fucking yuppie!
Get down!

1806
02:12:38,914 --> 02:12:40,142
Throw those bags!

1807
02:12:40,954 --> 02:12:43,991
Move!
What the fuck you doing?

1808
02:12:46,274 --> 02:12:47,787
Get on the fucking floor!

1809
02:12:47,994 --> 02:12:48,744
Grandpa...

1810
02:12:48,954 --> 02:12:49,750
down!

1811
02:12:49,954 --> 02:12:52,343
I'm the manager here and
there's no problem.

1812
02:12:53,034 --> 02:12:54,103
You're going to give me a problem

1813
02:12:55,114 --> 02:12:59,027
You're gonna give me
a problem?

1814
02:13:01,154 --> 02:13:02,428
We got a hero here!

1815
02:13:02,834 --> 02:13:04,347
Just execute him!

1816
02:13:05,474 --> 02:13:09,262
- I'm no hero. I'm just a...
- Get the fuck down!

1817
02:13:09,674 --> 02:13:11,027
The restaurant's ours!

1818
02:13:11,234 --> 02:13:12,906
Just take whatever you want.

1819
02:13:14,194 --> 02:13:15,707
Talk to the customers.

1820
02:13:15,914 --> 02:13:17,711
Tell them to be cool...

1821
02:13:17,914 --> 02:13:20,109
and everything will be
over. Understand?

1822
02:13:23,114 --> 02:13:24,308
Listen, everybody...

1823
02:13:25,114 --> 02:13:26,069
be calm...

1824
02:13:26,354 --> 02:13:29,790
cooperate and this'll be
over in a minute.

1825
02:13:30,114 --> 02:13:31,672
Down! Well done.

1826
02:13:43,634 --> 02:13:44,828
Alright, people...

1827
02:13:45,074 --> 02:13:47,907
I'll collect your wallets.
Don't fucking talk.

1828
02:13:48,114 --> 02:13:51,823
Throw them in the bag.
Are we fucking clear?

1829
02:13:52,434 --> 02:13:53,992
Good. Now, wallets out.

1830
02:13:56,674 --> 02:14:00,269
That's it, get the fuck down.
In the bag.

1831
02:14:00,474 --> 02:14:02,749
- I have nothing on me.
- In the bag.

1832
02:14:04,474 --> 02:14:06,351
What you waiting for?
In the bag.

1833
02:14:06,674 --> 02:14:08,505
Laura, tips.

1834
02:14:08,794 --> 02:14:09,590
In the bag.

1835
02:14:10,554 --> 02:14:12,909
A cellular phone?
In the fucking bag!

1836
02:14:15,034 --> 02:14:17,912
Tidy up, that's it.
Now, get down on the floor.

1837
02:14:18,434 --> 02:14:19,310
In the bag.

1838
02:14:19,874 --> 02:14:20,704
In the bag.

1839
02:14:32,914 --> 02:14:33,790
In the bag.

1840
02:14:49,114 --> 02:14:49,944
What's in the case?

1841
02:14:50,154 --> 02:14:51,507
My boss's dirty laundry.

1842
02:14:51,714 --> 02:14:52,942
You do his laundry?

1843
02:14:53,154 --> 02:14:54,951
- When he wants it clean.
- Shit job.

1844
02:14:55,194 --> 02:14:56,673
I thought the same thing.

1845
02:14:56,954 --> 02:14:57,670
Open it.

1846
02:14:58,234 --> 02:14:59,383
Afraid I can't.

1847
02:15:01,474 --> 02:15:02,384
I didn't hear.

1848
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:03,549
Yes you did.

1849
02:15:04,914 --> 02:15:06,029
What's going on?

1850
02:15:07,034 --> 02:15:08,786
We got a vigilante in our midst.

1851
02:15:09,114 --> 02:15:10,467
Shoot him!

1852
02:15:10,674 --> 02:15:14,064
Hat to shutter your ego, but
I've been pointed at before.

1853
02:15:14,274 --> 02:15:16,344
Open the case or
it'll be your last.

1854
02:15:16,634 --> 02:15:20,149
You'll get us all killed!
Just give it to them!

1855
02:15:20,354 --> 02:15:22,663
Shut up, fat man.
Ain't your business.

1856
02:15:24,634 --> 02:15:26,192
Be cool, Honey Bunny.

1857
02:15:26,754 --> 02:15:28,392
It's all under control.

1858
02:15:30,154 --> 02:15:31,712
I'm going to count to 3.

1859
02:15:33,714 --> 02:15:36,990
If you don't open it, I'll
unload in your fucking face.

1860
02:15:41,674 --> 02:15:42,470
We clear?

1861
02:15:46,594 --> 02:15:47,265
One.

1862
02:15:50,874 --> 02:15:51,750
Two.

1863
02:15:53,274 --> 02:15:54,468
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1864
02:15:54,914 --> 02:15:55,710
You win.

1865
02:15:56,634 --> 02:15:57,623
It's yours.

1866
02:16:03,314 --> 02:16:04,190
Open it.

1867
02:16:08,754 --> 02:16:09,903
What is it?

1868
02:16:11,234 --> 02:16:12,223
What is it?

1869
02:16:14,514 --> 02:16:15,708
Is that what I think?

1870
02:16:20,154 --> 02:16:21,428
It's beautiful.

1871
02:16:22,034 --> 02:16:23,990
Goddamn it, what is it?

1872
02:16:26,114 --> 02:16:28,582
Let him go! Let him go!

1873
02:16:28,994 --> 02:16:29,585
Let go!

1874
02:16:29,794 --> 02:16:30,590
Be cool.

1875
02:16:30,794 --> 02:16:31,544
I'm gonna kill you!

1876
02:16:31,754 --> 02:16:32,869
Say: "Bitch, be cool!"

1877
02:16:33,114 --> 02:16:36,026
Say: "Bitch, be cool!"
Tell the bitch!

1878
02:16:37,314 --> 02:16:39,908
- Tell her to chill!
- Be cool, honey pot!

1879
02:16:40,154 --> 02:16:41,712
- Chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1880
02:16:41,914 --> 02:16:43,791
- Say it'll be alright.
- It'll be alright.

1881
02:16:43,994 --> 02:16:45,063
- Promise her!
- I promise.

1882
02:16:45,274 --> 02:16:46,912
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out!

1883
02:16:47,114 --> 02:16:47,910
Tell me her name.

1884
02:16:48,114 --> 02:16:49,342
- Yolanda.
- Okay, Yolanda.

1885
02:16:50,194 --> 02:16:53,027
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Don't hurt him!

1886
02:16:53,514 --> 02:16:57,029
Nobody'll hurt anybody. We'll
be like 3 little Fonzies.

1887
02:16:57,234 --> 02:16:58,110
What's Fonzie like?

1888
02:16:59,514 --> 02:17:01,903
- What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool?

1889
02:17:02,114 --> 02:17:03,547
- What?
- Cool.

1890
02:17:03,794 --> 02:17:06,831
Exactly. That's what
we'll be.

1891
02:17:07,074 --> 02:17:08,109
We'll be cool.

1892
02:17:08,794 --> 02:17:09,783
Now, Ringo...

1893
02:17:10,914 --> 02:17:12,552
I'll count to 3.

1894
02:17:13,234 --> 02:17:14,713
And when I count 3...

1895
02:17:14,914 --> 02:17:16,825
you let go your gun...

1896
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:19,385
put your palms flat
on the table...

1897
02:17:19,914 --> 02:17:21,506
and sit your ass down.

1898
02:17:22,514 --> 02:17:23,708
But when you do it...

1899
02:17:24,794 --> 02:17:25,783
you do it cool.

1900
02:17:26,754 --> 02:17:27,664
You ready?

1901
02:17:29,034 --> 02:17:29,784
One.

1902
02:17:31,154 --> 02:17:31,950
Two.

1903
02:17:33,194 --> 02:17:34,183
Three.

1904
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:44,665
- Okay, now let him go.
- Yolanda.

1905
02:17:44,874 --> 02:17:48,184
I thought you'd be cool.
When you yell, I get nervous.

1906
02:17:48,434 --> 02:17:50,265
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1907
02:17:50,514 --> 02:17:53,984
And when motherfuckers get
nervous, motherfuckers get shot.

1908
02:17:55,914 --> 02:17:56,710
Just know...

1909
02:17:57,394 --> 02:17:59,032
you hurt him,
you die.

1910
02:18:00,114 --> 02:18:02,105
That seems to be the situation.

1911
02:18:02,674 --> 02:18:04,153
But I don't want that.

1912
02:18:04,554 --> 02:18:07,227
You don't want that,
and Ringo here...

1913
02:18:07,634 --> 02:18:10,671
definitely don't.
So let's see what we can do.

1914
02:18:12,674 --> 02:18:13,186
Now.

1915
02:18:14,474 --> 02:18:15,907
Here's the situation:

1916
02:18:16,994 --> 02:18:20,225
Normally, your asses would
be dead as fried chicken.

1917
02:18:20,434 --> 02:18:23,824
But I'm in transition and
I don't want to kill you.

1918
02:18:24,034 --> 02:18:24,864
I want to help you.

1919
02:18:25,754 --> 02:18:27,233
I can't give you this case...

1920
02:18:27,994 --> 02:18:29,347
'cause it don't belong to me.

1921
02:18:30,114 --> 02:18:31,024
Besides...

1922
02:18:31,234 --> 02:18:35,022
I been through too much shit
to just hand it over to you.

1923
02:18:37,514 --> 02:18:37,912
Cool!

1924
02:18:39,434 --> 02:18:42,392
Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
It's cool.

1925
02:18:42,594 --> 02:18:44,824
We still talking.
Come on, point the gun at me!

1926
02:18:45,194 --> 02:18:47,469
Point it at me!
There you go.

1927
02:18:49,154 --> 02:18:52,749
Hang back and don't do a goddamn
thing. Tell her we're cool.

1928
02:18:54,034 --> 02:18:56,229
- Still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doing?

1929
02:18:57,674 --> 02:18:59,426
I got to go pee.

1930
02:19:00,474 --> 02:19:02,066
- I want to go home.
- Hang in there.

1931
02:19:02,274 --> 02:19:05,266
I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1932
02:19:05,474 --> 02:19:07,942
Almost over.
Tell her you're proud.

1933
02:19:08,754 --> 02:19:09,903
I'm proud of you.

1934
02:19:10,234 --> 02:19:11,303
I love you.

1935
02:19:11,954 --> 02:19:13,307
I love you too, Honey Bunny.

1936
02:19:13,514 --> 02:19:16,631
I want you to go
in that bag...

1937
02:19:17,114 --> 02:19:18,467
and find my wallet.

1938
02:19:21,354 --> 02:19:22,184
Which one is it?

1939
02:19:22,394 --> 02:19:24,350
It says: "Bad Motherfucker".

1940
02:19:38,874 --> 02:19:41,069
That's it. That's my...

1941
02:19:41,274 --> 02:19:42,423
Bad Motherfucker. Open it.

1942
02:19:42,634 --> 02:19:43,669
Take out the money.

1943
02:19:49,834 --> 02:19:50,584
Count it.

1944
02:19:57,354 --> 02:19:58,309
How much is there?

1945
02:20:01,794 --> 02:20:02,943
About $1.500.

1946
02:20:03,434 --> 02:20:05,470
Put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1947
02:20:06,474 --> 02:20:08,669
With the rest of those
wallets and the register...

1948
02:20:09,674 --> 02:20:11,471
this a pretty successful score.

1949
02:20:11,754 --> 02:20:14,666
You give him $1.500,
I'll shoot him on principle!

1950
02:20:15,554 --> 02:20:18,466
He won't do a goddamn
motherfucking thing.

1951
02:20:18,674 --> 02:20:20,187
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1952
02:20:21,074 --> 02:20:23,429
- Shut up!
- Yolanda, stay with me, baby.

1953
02:20:24,834 --> 02:20:26,870
I'm not giving it
to him.

1954
02:20:27,634 --> 02:20:29,147
I'm buying something for money.

1955
02:20:30,634 --> 02:20:32,113
Want to know what I'm buying?

1956
02:20:32,554 --> 02:20:33,509
What?

1957
02:20:33,834 --> 02:20:34,789
Your life.

1958
02:20:35,234 --> 02:20:37,907
I give you that money so
I don't have to kill you.

1959
02:20:39,394 --> 02:20:40,713
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1960
02:20:42,034 --> 02:20:43,592
Not regularly, no.

1961
02:20:43,794 --> 02:20:46,103
There's this passage
I got memorized.

1962
02:20:46,354 --> 02:20:48,629
Ezekiel, 25, 17.

1963
02:20:49,794 --> 02:20:52,831
"The path of the righteous
man is beset on all sides...

1964
02:20:53,034 --> 02:20:56,106
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men.

1965
02:20:56,914 --> 02:20:59,872
Blessed is he who, for
charity and goodwill...

1966
02:21:00,074 --> 02:21:03,589
shepherds the weak through
darkness, for he is his brother's...

1967
02:21:03,914 --> 02:21:05,666
keeper and finder of children.

1968
02:21:05,994 --> 02:21:09,350
I will strike down with great
vengeance and fury...

1969
02:21:09,554 --> 02:21:13,149
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

1970
02:21:13,954 --> 02:21:16,024
And you will know
I am the Lord...

1971
02:21:16,314 --> 02:21:18,464
when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

1972
02:21:20,594 --> 02:21:22,505
I've been saying this shit
for years.

1973
02:21:22,754 --> 02:21:25,587
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

1974
02:21:27,234 --> 02:21:28,906
I never considered
what it meant.

1975
02:21:29,194 --> 02:21:33,506
Thought it was some shit to say
before I capped some guy's ass.

1976
02:21:34,234 --> 02:21:36,623
But today, it's made
me think twice.

1977
02:21:37,754 --> 02:21:39,028
Now I'm thinking...

1978
02:21:39,754 --> 02:21:40,869
maybe it means...

1979
02:21:41,354 --> 02:21:42,787
you're the evil man...

1980
02:21:43,194 --> 02:21:44,832
and I'm the righteous man.

1981
02:21:45,154 --> 02:21:47,065
And Mr. 9 mm. Here...

1982
02:21:47,314 --> 02:21:50,750
is the shepherd protecting my
righteous ass in the darkness.

1983
02:21:51,554 --> 02:21:52,907
Or it could mean...

1984
02:21:53,674 --> 02:21:56,507
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

1985
02:21:56,834 --> 02:22:00,065
and it's the world that's
evil and selfish.

1986
02:22:00,794 --> 02:22:02,113
I'd like that.

1987
02:22:03,074 --> 02:22:04,587
But that shit ain't the truth.

1988
02:22:06,074 --> 02:22:07,348
The truth is...

1989
02:22:09,074 --> 02:22:10,507
you're the weak...

1990
02:22:11,874 --> 02:22:15,025
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

1991
02:22:16,514 --> 02:22:18,152
But I'm trying,
Ringo.

1992
02:22:19,714 --> 02:22:22,387
I'm trying real hard...

1993
02:22:22,594 --> 02:22:23,947
to be the shepherd.

1994
02:22:39,514 --> 02:22:40,344
Go on.

1995
02:22:58,714 --> 02:23:00,784
I think we should leave now.

1996
02:23:00,994 --> 02:23:02,950
That's probably
a good idea.
